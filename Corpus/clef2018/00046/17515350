Shareware program for nuclear medicine and PET/CT PACS display and processing. Many of the functions necessary for imaging and analyzing nuclear medicine studies are not available on radiology PACS. Over the past 20 years, we have developed a user-friendly, easily installed software package for nuclear medicine study analysis, display, Web access, and database storage and an integrated display for fused PET/CT. We are making this software available as free shareware that can be used without a license on any PC. The software package was developed as a cooperative effort between house and attending staff and our nuclear medicine programmer. Particular emphasis was put on making functions intuitive and user friendly.A shareware nuclear medicine PACS software package including a display for fused PET/CT studies has been developed, extensively clinically tested, and is freely available on the Internet.
