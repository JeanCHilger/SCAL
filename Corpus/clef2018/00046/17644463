MicroPET reconstruction with random coincidence correction via a joint Poisson model. Positron emission tomography (PET) can provide in vivo, quantitative and functional information for diagnosis however, PET image quality depends highly on a reconstruction algorithm. Iterative algorithms, such as the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) algorithm, are rapidly becoming the standards for image reconstruction in emission-computed tomography. The conventional MLEM algorithm utilized the Poisson model in its system matrix, which is no longer valid for delay-subtraction of randomly corrected data. The aim of this study is to overcome this problem. The maximum likelihood estimation using the expectation maximum algorithm (MLE-EM) is adopted and modified to reconstruct microPET images using random correction from joint prompt and delay sinograms
