Systemic nitric oxide synthase inhibition improves coronary flow reserve to adenosine in patients with significant stenoses. We studied the impact of systemic infusion of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) on coronary flow reserve (CFR) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We have previously demonstrated that CFR to adenosine was significantly increased after systemic infusion of L-NMMA in normal volunteers but not in recently transplanted denervated hearts. At baseline, myocardial blood flow (MBF ml x min(-1) x g(-1)) was measured at rest and during intravenous administration of adenosine (140 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) in 10 controls (47 +/- 5 yr) and 10 CAD patients (58 +/- 8 yr
