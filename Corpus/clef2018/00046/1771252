Minor changes in regional cerebral blood flow revealed by the early distribution of I-123 IMP in brain. To evaluate the early distribution of I-123 IMP in the brain, 10 dynamic images were obtained in the first 10 minutes after injection using a ring-type SPECT system with a high-sensitivity collimator. In cases of chronic carotid occlusion without brain CT abnormalities, areas of low perfusion were more clearly demonstrated in dynamic images than in static images obtained beginning 20 minutes after injection and continuing for 15 minutes using a high-resolution collimator. In cases of hyperperfusion following infarct or surgery, there was a difference between dynamic and static images in the visualization of hyperemic lesions. The distribution of I-123 IMP in the brain changes gradually, even in the early period after injection, and evaluation of early accumulation is useful for the detection of minor changes in regional cerebral blood flow.
