A prospective comparison between magnetic resonance imaging, meta-iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy and marrow histology/cytology in neuroblastoma. A prospective comparison between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 123I meta-iodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) scintigraphy and posterior iliac crest marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy in 30 assessments (19 patients) showed concordance between the three techniques in 16 assessments (53.3%). In 10 (33.3%), MRI and mIBG revealed abnormalities not detected by marrow biopsy. MRI was the only technique to demonstrate marrow abnormality in four assessments (13.3%). In addition, MRI revealed more sites of abnormality in 16 parallel assessments. We conclude that MRI shows promise as a non-invasive means of detecting bone marrow infiltration by neuroblastoma, but that further evaluation of the specificity of MRI in this setting is indicated.
