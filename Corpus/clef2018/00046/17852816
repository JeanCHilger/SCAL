Angiotensin-converting enzyme gene polymorphism and coronary reactivity in young men. The purpose of the study was to examine whether the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene affects the vasodilatory properties of coronary arteries in healthy men. The ACE genotypes of 128 men (mean age 35 +/- 4 years) were determined and related to myocardial blood flow. The blood flow was measured by positron emission tomography at rest and during vasodilation caused by adenosine or dipyridamole infusion. The coronary flows and resistances at rest and during stimulation with adenosine or dipyridamole did not differ between the ACE genotypes. Furthermore, this polymorphism had no effect on coronary flow reserve corrected by a rate-pressure product. In conclusion, the ACE I/D polymorphism does not seem to affect myocardial reactivity--an early indicator of atherosclerosis--in healthy subjects.
