Advances in atheroma imaging in the carotid. Atherosclerosis affects all vascular beds, including the coronary, carotid, intracerebral, peripheral and aortic vascular beds, and is responsible for tremendous morbidity and mortality, with the most serious outcomes being myocardial infarction, stroke and death. Historically the effects of vascular narrowing and associated thrombosis have been key indicators of disease in the coronary and carotid territories, with degrees of vascular stenosis being of profound importance in carotid surgery trials. Our improving understanding of the biology of atheromatous lesions and the development of alternative therapeutic agents which can initiate actual plaque regression have created a need to attempt to image plaque itself, with the carotid artery being an achievable target. This article reviews current strategies for assessing carotid atherosclerotic disease, particularly with reference to identifying plaque components and risk of rupture, the so-called vulnerable plaque.
