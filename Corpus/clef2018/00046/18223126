The Japanese MCI screen for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Early detection of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders in Japan is increasingly important. The Mild Cognitive Impairment Screen (MCIS)-derived from the National Institute of Aging CERAD neuropsychologic battery-differentiates normal aging from MCI and mild dementia with 97.3% and 99% accuracy, respectively. The Japanese MCIS (JMCIS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), quantitative SPECT (qSP), and quantitative MRI (qMRI) were used to classify 63 outpatients at Fukuoka University Hospital who were either normal or had MCI based on Clinical Dementia Rating scores of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Performance statistics for the JMCIS, MMSE, qSP, and qMRI were, respectively: (1) accuracy = 0.964, 0.768, 0.722, 0.733 (2) sensitivity = 0.958, 0.792, 0.688, 0.700
