Mediastinal lymph node staging by means of positron emission tomography is less sensitive in elderly patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. We sought to identify the impact of age on the sensitivity and specificity of integrated positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET-CT CT) on mediastinal lymph node staging of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).We conducted a retrospective review of 206 consecutive patients with histologically proven NSCLC who underwent resection and/or mediastinoscopy in our center between September 2004 and January 2007. All of these patients had preoperative staging with integrated PET-CT as an adjunct to chest CT before resection and/or mediastinoscopy. Diabetic patients and patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. The pathologic results of all of these cases were reviewed and correlated with those on CT and integrated PET-CT.The sensitivity and positive predictive values (PPV) of PET-CT in mediastinal nodal staging were significantly lower in elderly patients (age>or=65 years sensitivity, 42%PET-CT staging of the mediastinum is less sensitive in elderly patients with NSCLC who have a lower PPV. Positive mediastinal uptake on PET-CT should be verified by mediastinoscopy, irrespective of age. Elderly patients with positive mediastinal uptake should not be refuted a curative intent surgical resection on the basis of positive mediastinal uptake alone.
