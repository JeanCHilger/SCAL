Transcranial magnetic stimulation: the foundation and potential of modulating specific neuronal networks. To offer an introduction to the neurophysiologic technique of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).We summarize the physics foundations and neurobiologic principles of action of TMS. We offer an introduction to the core aspects of instrument design and delivery technique of TMS to assure efficacy and safety. We discuss the possibility of real-time merging of TMS with neuroimaging methods (such as functional magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography) to characterize neural networks in health and disease. We present evidence that repetitive TMS can be used to modulate excitability across a neural network and thus offers therapeutic applications in neurology, psychiatry, and rehabilitation.TMS offers a unique opportunity to characterize and modulate neural networks in normal subjects and patients with diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. TMS can be used with diagnostic as well as therapeutic goals children, adults and elderly with neurologic and psychiatric disorders.
