Evaluation of organ involvement in intravascular large B-cell lymphoma by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. To evaluate the role of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL), we retrospectively analyzed four consecutive IVLBCL patients receiving FDG-PET before treatment between May 2006 and November 2007. Patients were two men and two women (median age 62 years, range 54-76 years). All patients received bone marrow biopsies and random skin biopsies and two of the four patients underwent renal biopsy for diagnosis. Accuracy of FDG-PET for the detection of organ involvements was analyzed by comparing results of pathological findings. Concordant results with respect to bone marrow involvement were accurately obtained for two patients. Skin and renal involvements were undetectable by FDG-PET regardless of positive pathological findings. One patient with a false-negative FDG-PET result showed fewer lymphoma cells in the bone marrow specimen than patients with concordant FDG-PET results. These results suggest false-negative results for some types of organ involvement. Careful interpretation of the results of FDG-PET in IVLBCL is thus required.
