Comparison of culture, peroxidase-antiperoxidase reaction, and serum latex agglutination methods for diagnosis of chlamydiosis in pet birds. Comparison was made among results of cloacal specimen culture, and cloacal swab specimen (cytologic) peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP), serum latex agglutination (LA), and tissue PAP assays for diagnosis of chlamydiosis in 144 birds. Swab specimen PAP findings correlated poorly with LA results and failed to predict the LA test result in any bird. Only 1 cloacal swab specimen was regarded as PAP-positive and was from the cloaca of a bird from which chlamydiae were isolated in culture. The sensitivity of swab specimen PAP, compared with culture results, was 33%, whereas specificity was 94%. In this study, swab specimen PAP was a less sensitive test, compared with culture, than was reported in a previous study. The sensitivity of LA in identifying birds that were cloacal culture-positive was poor true-positive results were not detected, compared with culture results. The specificity of the LA method was 93%, compared with culture results. Results of the tissue PAP method correlated with culture results in the 3 birds for which both tests were performed.
