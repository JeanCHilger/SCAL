Quantitative analysis of NK1 receptor in the human brain using PET with 18F-FE-SPA-RQ. 18F-fluoroethyl-SPA-RQ (18F-FE-SPA-RQ) was recently developed as a radioligand for the measurement of neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor with PET. In this study, we used 18F-FE-SPA-RQ with PET to visualize and quantify NK1 receptor in the human brain.PET scans were performed on 7 healthy men after intravenous injection of 18F-FE-SPA-RQ. Binding potential (BPND) was calculated by the indirect kinetic, simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), and ratio methods. The indirect kinetic method was used as the gold standard method and was compared with the SRTM method, with scan times of 180, 270, and 330 min, and with the ratio method, with time integration intervals of 120-180, 210-270, and 300-330 min. The cerebellum was used as the reference brain region.Regional radioactivity was highest in the caudate head and putamen mid level in the parahippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamusThe regional distribution of 18F-FE-SPA-RQ was in agreement with previous PET studies and postmortem studies of NK1 receptor in the human brain. The ratio method will be useful for clinical research of psychiatric disorders, for the estimation of NK1 receptor without arterial blood sampling and long dynamic PET.
