Binding of radioiodinated SPECT ligands to transfected cell membranes expressing single muscarinic receptor subtypes. The equilibrium dissociation constant and the kinetic rate constants were determined for the binding of (R)-[3H]3-quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) and [125I]3-quinuclidinyl-4-iodobenzilate ((R,R)- and (R,S)-[125I]IQNB) to transfected cell membranes expressing one single muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtype. The association and dissociation kinetics for the m2 subtype were more rapid than for the m1 and m3 subtypes. The differential kinetic properties may be useful for the single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) evaluation of regional mAChR subtype alterations in disease states.
