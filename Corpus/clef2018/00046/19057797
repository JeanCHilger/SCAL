Is there a role for scintigraphic imaging of bone manifestations in Gaucher disease? A review of the literature. Gaucher disease is the most prevalent inherited, lysosomal storage disease and is caused by deficient activity of the enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase. Bone and bone marrow alterations are frequent in the most prevalent non-neuronopathic form of Gaucher disease. Imaging of bone manifestations in Gaucher disease is performed by a variety of imaging methods, conventional X-ray and MRI as the most frequently and most important ones. However, different modalities of scintigraphic imaging have also been used. This article gives an overview on scintigraphic imaging with respect to bone manifestations in Gaucher disease discussing the advantages and limitations of scintigraphic imaging in comparison to other imaging methods.
