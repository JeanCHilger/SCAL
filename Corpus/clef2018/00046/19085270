Normal dopaminergic nigrostriatal innervation in SPG3A hereditary spastic paraplegia. SPG3A/atlastin-1 gene mutations cause an autosomal dominant form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG3A-HSP). We used positron emission tomography with [(11)C]DTBZ to assess nigrostriatal dopaminergic integrity in two unrelated adults with SPG3A-HSP due to the common SPG3A/atlastin-1 mutation, R239C. Nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminal density was normal. A difference from the human pattern of neurodegeneration is a critical limitation of this Drosophila model of SPG3A-HSP. This major difference between human SPG3A/atlastin-1 mutations and the Drosophila atl(l) phenotype has several possible explanations.
