Long-term stability of measuring D(2) receptors in schizophrenia patients treated with antipsychotics. While antipsychotic-free schizophrenia patients showed a high degree of within-subject variability in dopamine D(2) receptor density over 6-24 months, no study has examined the long-term stability of D(2) receptor measures in medicated patients.Four schizophrenia patients receiving a stable dose of risperidone underwent [(11)C]raclopride positron emission tomography scans on two occasions 5-14 months apart.Plasma risperidone levels were found to be consistent between scans, and consistencies of nondisplaceable D(2) binding potential and D(2) occupancy were good.The finding supports the validity of quantification of D(2) receptor binding in longitudinal PET studies of medicated patients with schizophrenia.
