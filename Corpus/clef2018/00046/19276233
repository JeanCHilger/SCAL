Clinical relevance of single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography of the neck and thorax in postablation (131)I scintigraphy for thyroid cancer. In patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma, postablation (131)I scintigraphy aims to detect residual neck disease and distant metastases, usually found in lungs and bones. New hybrid single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT-CT) cameras that permit functional and anatomical image fusion may improve its clinical relevance.Our objective was to test the added value of neck and thorax SPECT-spiral CT to whole-body scan (WBS) in postablation (131)I scintigraphy.This was a single-referral-center prospective study with a median follow-up of 21 months.Postablation (131)I WBS and neck and thorax SPECT-CT were performed in 55 consecutive patients treated in 2006. WBS and SPECT-CT data were blindly reviewed, scored negative (benign), positive (malignant), or indeterminate and were correlated to the patient outcome.At patient level, WBS and SPECT-CT were negative in 67 and 78% of patients, positive in 4 and 15%, and indeterminate in 29 and 7%, respectively. Overall, nine patients (16%) presented treatment failure (persistent or recurrent disease) 1-16 months after radioiodine ablation. In the 16 patients with indeterminate WBS, negative SPECT-CT ruled out suspicion of disease in nine of nine patients, and positive SPECT-CT confirmed malignant lesions in four of five patients. Positive SPECT-CT predicted treatment failure better than positive WBS (McNemar's test, P = 0.03).This study demonstrates the complementary role of neck and thorax SPECT-CT to WBS in postablation (131)I scintigraphy. Because SPECT-CT allows one to confirm or to rule out residual disease in most cases where WBS remains indeterminate, we recommend its use when available.
