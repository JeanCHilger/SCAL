A comparison of single-photon emission CT lung scintigraphy and CT pulmonary angiography for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. This study compared single-photon emission CT (SPECT) ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy with multislice CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA).In a prospective, observational study, 100 patients who were >or= 50 years of age were recruited. Seventy-nine patients underwent both diagnostic 16-detector CTPA, and planar and SPECT V/Q scintigraphy. The agreement between the CTPA and the SPECT V/Q scintigraphy for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) was calculated. The sensitivity and specificity of blinded SPECT scintigraphy reporting was calculated against a reference diagnosis made by a panel of respiratory physicians that was provided with CTPA and planar V/Q scintigraphy reports, clinical information, and 3-month follow-up data.The observed percentage of agreement between SPECT V/Q scintigraphy and CTPA data for the diagnosis of PE was 95%. When calculated against the respiratory physicians' reference diagnosis, SPECT V/Q scintigraphy had a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 98%.This study indicates that SPECT V/Q scintigraphy is a viable alternative to CTPA for the diagnosis of PE and has potential advantages in that it was feasible in more patients and had fewer contraindications lower radiation doseAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry Registration Number: ACTRN12609000089235.
