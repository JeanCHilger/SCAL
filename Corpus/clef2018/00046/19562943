Clinical evaluation of CNS drugs with PET. The utility and possibility of PET in the drug development of the neuropsychiatry field is discussed in this review. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine imaging technique which visualizes and quantifies the distributions of various molecular targets in vivo. This technique has been expected to help the process to be more efficient in the drug development of the neuropsychiatry field. Three approaches have been raised as promising ways: microdosing, occupancy measurement at the target region, and biomarkers. In microdosing, it could be detected whether the drugs enter the living human brain or not using very small amount of radiolabelled candidate drugs. With occupancy measurement, the relationship between the dose of the drug and the occupancy could be established, and the optimal clinical doses could be obtained. As biomarkers, the change in the distribution in beta amyloid and microglia after the drug treatment could be detected.
