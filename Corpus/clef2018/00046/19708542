New radiopharmaceuticals and positron-emission tomography applications at the Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute in Brno. The construction and launch of the cyclotron & PET centre at the Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, which is run in cooperation with the Nuclear Research Institute Praha-Rez, allows the Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute to engage in the research, development and application of new radiopharmaceuticals including compounds labelled by short-living positron emitters (especially 11C). For the immediate future, new projects are planned, e.g. using the proliferation marker 18F-fluoro-L-thymidine, or neuro-oncological studies using the proteosynthesis and amino acid transport marker 11C-methionine, and eventually also other compounds applicable outside of oncology. The existence of the PET centre at the Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute therefore offers a wide range of possibilities to both patients and physicians in the Brno region and beyond.
