Comparative in vivo adulticidal activity of a topical dinotefuran versus an imidacloprid-based formulation against cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) on cats. Fleas cause significant discomfort to pet cats and distress to their owners and are also vectors of disease severe infestations can cause anemia or flea allergy dermatitis and can lead to infections with Dipylidium caninum and Bartonella henselae. Rapid flea kill is an important feature of flea preventives. The efficacy of dinotefuran (Vectra for Cats and Kittens, Summit VetPharm) was compared with that of imidacloprid (Advantage, Bayer Animal Health) against Ctenocephalides felis when applied topically once on day 0. Cats were infested with 100 (+-3) C. felis on study days -1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. Live fleas were counted on study days 0 (2, 6, and 12 hours after treatment), 9, 16, 23, 29 (2, 6, and 12 hours after infestation), and 30. Cats treated with dinotefuran had significantly (P less than .05) fewer fleas than the control cats at all posttreatment examinations except day 29 at 2 hours after infestation and significantly (P less than .05) fewel fleas than cats treated with imidacloprid on days 0 (2 hours after treatment), 9, 16, 23, 29 (6 and 12 hours after infestation), and 30.
