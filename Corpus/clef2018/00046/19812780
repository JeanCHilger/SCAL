Neuroinformatics: from bioinformatics to databasing the brain. Neuroinformatics seeks to create and maintain web-accessible databases of experimental and computational data, together with innovative software tools, essential for understanding the nervous system in its normal function and in neurological disorders. Neuroinformatics includes traditional bioinformatics of gene and protein sequences in the brain atlases of brain anatomy and localization of genes and proteins
