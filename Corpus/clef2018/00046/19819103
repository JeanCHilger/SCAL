Impact of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography on oncologic patient management: first 2 years' experience at a single Canadian cancer center. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) results on patient management from a single Canadian oncology center during its first 2 years of operation.A total of 3,779 consecutive patients, 18 years of age and older, who were referred for PET-CT imaging at the British Columbia Cancer Agency between July 1, 2005 and June 30, 2007, were included in this analysis. Results were tabulated from a standard questionnaire, which was given to referring physicians following completion of their patient's PET-CT study.From July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2007, 3,779 consecutive fluoro-2-deoxyglucose PET-CT examinations were performed in patients aged 18 years or older. A total of 3,429 referring-physician surveys (90.7%) were returned. The results of the PET-CT study resulted in a change in treatment decision in 49.8% of the studies and resulted in improved decision making in 83.2% of the studies.This series demonstrated that the results from PET-CT studies performed at a single Canadian oncology center during the first 2 years of its operation altered patient management in 50% of cases and resulted in improved decision making in the majority of cases.
