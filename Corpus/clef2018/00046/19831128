Temporolimbic activation by intracranial electrical stimulation. To evaluate the results of intracranial electrical stimulation (ICES) as a pre-surgical tool in order to select the side of the operation in bitemporal lobe epilepsy (BTLE) patients who underwent depth electrode (DE) implantation.We reviewed the files of 77 medically intractable BTLE patients who underwent ICES with positive results through implanted DEs and then were under surgical treatment. One year or more after surgery, we evaluated the outcome. ICES was performed through: 1) Square-wave bipolar stimulation with symmetrical pulses of 60 Hz for 0.5 ms was delivered by a constant current Nuclear Chicago stimulator 2) An initial intensity of 0.5 mA, and subsequently progressively stronger currents at 1-2 and occasionally 3 or 4 mAWe obtained habitual auras or seizures (clinical responses, CRs) in 74 patients and after-discharges, ADs in 61 of them, according to Engel's classification for post surgery outcomes. If CRs or ADs were obtained by stimulation of only one temporal lobe the result of epilepsy surgery tended to be better (Engel classes I or II) when the operation was done on the same side of positive CRs (15 cases) or ADs (14 cases), and tended to be worse (Engel classes III or IV) when the ICES had provoked bilateral responses or when the side operated on was contra-lateral to positive CRs (33 cases) or ADs (28 cases). Statistical analyses were performed in order to test these results and we found better post-operative results when the resection took place in the same side of positive responses to ICES (CRs: chi2 4.74 and p=0.0295 ADs: chi2 7.57 and p=0.0059).In addition to other methods (PET, MRI and neuropsychology) presurgical ICES can provide useful data in the process of identifying the temporal lobe to be targeted for resection in BTLE patients.
