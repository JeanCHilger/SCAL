Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: relationship between 18F-FDG PET-CT maximum standardized uptake value, metabolic tumour volume and total lesion glycolysis and TNM classification. We aimed to evaluate the relationships between primary tumour maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumour volume (TV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) and tumour-node metastases (TNM) classification in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients.Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans of 57 consecutive newly diagnosed NPC patients (age range, 15-80 years) were retrospectively reviewed. SUVmax, TV and TLG were recorded. Two-tailed Spearman's correlation was used to analyse the relationships between the metabolic parameters and the TNM staging system.Positive correlations were observed between SUVmax (P<0.001, R=0.516), TV (P<0.001, R=0.504) and TLG (P<0.001, R=0.620) and T-stage, and both TV and SUVmax were independent variables that significantly affected T-stage (P<0.001, adjusted R=0.370). No other significant correlations were found between the metabolic parameters and TNM classification system.The metabolic parameters derived from fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography were positively correlated with T-stage in primary NPC. Our findings may suggest a complementary role of these parameters to TNM staging in prognostication of NPC patients.
