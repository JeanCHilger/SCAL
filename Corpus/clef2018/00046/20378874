Animal welfare: European legislation and future perspectives. Although animals are central to the life of all societies, substantial differences exist in the level of understanding or attitudes toward animal-welfare issues between agrarian and urban societies in developing or industrial countries. These differences are largely dependent on people's degree of contact with animals. Other than domestic species, people in industrialized nations tend to have limited contact with farm and wild animals. With this reduced or lack of daily animal contact, there can be a parallel lack of understanding of or appreciation for animal-welfare issues. As a result, different nations have adopted various policies, procedures, and laws to ensure that their societies protect the welfare of animals. In this article, we chronicle 30 years of actions by European nations through the European Commission to enact legislation that ensures uniform standards of animal-welfare practices to protect farm animals, animals used in research, and wild animals held in captivity.
