Risk stratification and prediction of cancer of focal thyroid fluorodeoxyglucose uptake during cancer evaluation. Focal thyroid incidentaloma by F-18 2-deoxy-2-F18-fluoro-D: -glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has been reported 1-4% of cancer patients and normal healthy population, with a risk of cancer ranging 14-50%. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of thyroid incidentaloma in F-18 FDG PET/CT and risk of cancer, usefulness of visual and SUV(max) and SUV(mean) differentiating malignant nodules and to define the predictable variables.A total 159 patients with focal thyroid FDG incidentaloma during cancer evaluation with non-thyroid cancer were enrolled. After F-18 PET/CT, we analyzed the image visually and obtained semiquantitative indices.The incidence of focal FDG thyroid incidentaloma is 1.36% and cancer risk is 23.3%. The incidence of focal thyroid FDG uptake was significantly higher in women (2.88 vs. 0.31% Ï‡ (2) = 136.4, p < 0.0001). Malignant thyroid incidentalomas show statistically significant higher value of SUV(max) (malignant: median 4.53, range 2.1-12.0Focal thyroid FDG incidentalomas in non-thyroid cancer patients during evaluation have a high risk of malignancy. The size and visual grade are potential predictors for malignant thyroid incidentaloma.
