Dopamine turnover increases in asymptomatic LRRK2 mutations carriers. Increase in dopamine (DA) turnover was found to occur early in symptomatic Parkinson's disease (PD) and to be functionally related to the dopamine transporter (DAT). The objectives of this study were to examine changes in DA turnover in the asymptomatic PD phase to compare them with changes in other dopaminergic markers, and to investigate a possible relationship between DAT and DA turnover. Eight subjects from families at increased risk of PD due to LRRK2 mutation were investigated. Positron emission tomography imaging was performed with: ¹⁸F-fluorodopa to determine the effective DA distribution volume (EDV), the inverse of DA turnover, and the DA uptake rate K(occ), a marker of DA synthesis and storage
