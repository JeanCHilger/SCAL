Dose-response assessment of nephrotoxicity from a 7-day combined exposure to melamine and cyanuric acid in F344 rats. The intentional adulteration of pet food with melamine and derivatives, including cyanuric acid, has been implicated in the kidney failure and death of a large number of cats and dogs in the United States. Although individually these compounds present low toxicity, coexposure can lead to the formation of melamine cyanurate crystals in the nephrons and eventual kidney failure. To determine the dose-response for nephrotoxicity upon coadministration of melamine and cyanuric acid, groups of male and female F344 rats (six animals per sex per group) were fed 0 (control), 7, 23, 69, 229, or 694 ppm of both melamine and cyanuric acid 1388 ppm melamine
