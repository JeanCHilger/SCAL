Tumor metabolism and perfusion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: pretreatment multimodality imaging with 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and [18F]FDG-PET. To correlate proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS), dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), and (18)F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([(18)F]FDG PET) of nodal metastases in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) for assessment of tumor biology. Additionally, pretreatment multimodality imaging was evaluated for its efficacy in predicting short-term response to treatment.Metastatic neck nodes were imaged with (1)H-MRS, DCE-MRI, and [(18)F]FDG PET in 16 patients with newly diagnosed HNSCC, before treatment. Short-term patient radiological response was evaluated at 3 to 4 months. Correlations among (1)H-MRS (choline concentration relative to water [Cho/W]), DCE-MRI (volume transfer constant [K(trans)] volume fraction of the extravascular extracellular space [v(e)]A significant positive correlation was found between Cho/W and TLG (ρ = 0.599 p = 0.031). Cho/W correlated negatively with heterogeneity measures of standard deviation std(v(e)) (ρ = -0.691Pretreatment multimodality imaging using (1)H-MRS, DCE-MRI, and [(18)F]FDG PET is feasible in HNSCC patients with nodal metastases. Additionally, combined DCE-MRI and [(18)F]FDG PET parameters were predictive of short-term response to treatment.
