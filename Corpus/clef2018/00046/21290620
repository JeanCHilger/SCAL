2,2,3,3-Tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid [3-(2-[ There are two subtypes of cannabinoid receptors in mammalian tissues: CB1 and CB2 (1, 2). CB1 receptors are expressed abundantly in neuronal terminals in the central nervous system (CNS) and in some peripheral tissues to inhibit neurotransmitter release. CB1 receptors are found predominately in the striatum, hippocampus, substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and cerebellum. CB2 receptors are present mainly on immune cells in the blood and peripheral tissues (the spleen) to modulate cytokine release (3). However, CB2 receptors have been found in the CNS tissues (neurons and glial cells) at very low levels (4). Both receptor subtypes are coupled through G
