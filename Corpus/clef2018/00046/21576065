Community knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward rabies prevention in North Vietnam. In recent years, despite the accessibility to vaccines (both for humans and animals), rabies remains a problem in many areas of Vietnam. While the number of rabies deaths decreased by 90% from 1994 to 2003, the number of rabies deaths increased from 2004 to 2007. In 2007, the number of rabies victims was 2-3 times higher than in 2003 and 131 people died as a result of rabies. In order to better understand Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) toward rabies in areas of both high and low incidence of rabies mortality in Vietnam, and KAP between pet and non-pet owners, a cross-sectional study was carried out by administering a structured questionnaire to 585 respondents from selected households in Thanh Son District-Phu Tho Province and Viet Yen District-Bac Giang Province, Vietnam. KAP in both high and low incidence areas, especially in groups with pets, need to be improved, particularly regarding treatment practices after a dog-bite and recommended pet care. We recommend not only enhanced IEC activities, but also the development of a Behavior Change Communication Strategy (BCC).
