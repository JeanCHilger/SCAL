Management of patients following detection of unsuspected colon lesions by PET imaging. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a well-established and integral component of multimodality imaging in oncology. However, the expanded use of PET in oncological and also non-oncological imaging (such as in assessing inflammatory conditions) has identified more lesions or tumors at unsuspected locations, such as in the large bowel during examination of patients not known to have colorectal disease. We review the clinical significance of colon lesions that were discovered incidentally by PET imaging and management strategies for gastroenterologists.
