Do androgens control the uptake of 18F-FDG, 11C-choline and 11C-acetate in human prostate cancer cell lines? The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of androgen ablation therapy in different prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines--reflecting different stages of the disease--on (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), 11C-choline and 11C-acetate uptake.Uptake experiments were performed in androgen-sensitive (LNCaP, PC346C) and independent cell lines (22Rv1, PC346DCC, PC-3) as well as in a benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH-1) cell line. Tracer uptake was assessed under androgen ablation. Results of the cancer cell lines were normalized to those of BPH-1. To evaluate the effect of androgen on the uptake of 18F-FDG, 11C-choline and 11C-acetate in PCa cell lines, 10(-8) M R1881, 10(-10) M R1881, the combination of 10(-10) M R1881 plus 10(-6) M Casodex or 10(-6) M Casodex alone were added in parallel cell cultures 1 day before uptake experiments. Uptake in androgen-supplemented cell cultures was compared to the uptake under androgen deprivation. Uptake was corrected for cell number using protein content.Compared to BPH-1, a higher 18F-FDG uptake was observed only in PC346C cells, whereas a higher 11C-choline and markedly increased 11C-acetate uptake was seen in all cancer cell lines. Androgens significantly modulated the uptake of 18F-FDG in LNCaP, PC346C and 22Rv1 cells, and of 11C-choline in the PC346C and 22Rv1 cell line. No androgenic effect on 11C-choline and 18F-FDG uptake was observed in PC-3 and PC346DCC cells. 11C-Acetate uptake was independent of androgen status in all PCa cell lines studied.18F-FDG uptake in PCa cell lines showed the highest variability and strongest androgen effect, suggesting its poor potential for metabolic imaging of advanced PCa. In contrast to 18F-FDG and 11C-choline, 11C-acetate uptake was unaffected by androgens and thus 11C-acetate seems best for monitoring PCa progression.
