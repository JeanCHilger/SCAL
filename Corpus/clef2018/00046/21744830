Morpholine-phthalocyanine (donor-acceptor) construct: photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer and triplet formation from its charge separation state. Silicon phthalocyanine (SiPc) with two axially attached morpholine (MP) units was prepared, and its photophysics was studied by laser flash photolysis, steady state and time-resolved fluorescence methods. Both the fluorescence efficiency and lifetime of SiPc moiety were remarkably quenched, because of the efficient intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from morpholine donors to SiPc moiety. The generated charge separation state (CSS), SiPc(•-)-MP(•+), which was observed by transient absorption spectra, showed a lifetime of 4.8 ns. The triplet quantum yield of SiPc unit in the supra-molecule is unexpectedly high, and the predominant spectral signal in microsecond-scale is triplet-triplet (T(1)-T(n)) absorption. This high triplet yield is due to the charge recombination of CSS that generates T(1) in 32% efficiency: SiPc(•-)-MP(•+) → (3)SiPc-MP. The T(1) formation process occurred efficiently because the CSS SiPc(•-)-MP(•+) has a higher energy (1.65 eV) than that of the triplet state (3)SiPc-MP (1.0 eV). Emission from the CSS was also observed: SiPc(•-)-MP(•+) → SiPc-MP + hν'.
