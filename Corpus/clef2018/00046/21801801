Functional biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders based on the network paradigm. This commentary provides a brief introduction to the various uses that functional neuroimaging biomarkers can play in detecting, diagnosing, assessing treatment response and investigating neurodegenerative disorders. It then goes on to explain why the emphasis of much recent work has shifted to network-based biomarkers, as opposed to those that examine individual brain regions. A number of examples are referenced that illustrate the points made.
