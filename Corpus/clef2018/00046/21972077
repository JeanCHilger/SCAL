Molecular imaging of inflammation and carcinogenesis. Development of imaging agents that can be used broadly for early detection of neoplasia at various tissue sites and at various stages of disease and that also can assess states of minimal residual disease would have tremendous utility in the diagnosis and management of cancer. In a series of articles culminating with a report in this issue of the journal (beginning on page 1536), Uddin and colleagues show their ability to systemically target the enzyme COX-2 with imaging probes that will serve as agents for early detection, risk assessment, prognosis, and intervention outcome measures. These probes will enable the detection and localization of regions of inflammation and a wide variety of premalignant lesions and cancers, with utility in monitoring the effects of cancer prevention and therapy.
