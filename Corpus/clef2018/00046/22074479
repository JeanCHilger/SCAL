Epidermal growth factor receptors: a functional perspective. The epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) belong to the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (TKs) involved in the proliferation of normal and malignant cells. EGFR has attracted considerable attention as a target for cancer therapy. This article considers various functional roles of EGFR-based systems that are relevant for the early detection and staging of cancers overexpressing EGFR.
