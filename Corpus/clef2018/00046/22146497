Incremental value of myocardial perfusion over regional left ventricular function and coronary stenosis by cardiac CT for the detection of acute coronary syndromes in high-risk patients: a subgroup analysis of the ROMICAT trial. To determine the incremental benefit of assessing myocardial perfusion defects (MPD) for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) over coronary and functional assessment by rest cardiac computed tomography (CT) in patients with acute chest pain.Assessment of myocardial perfusion is feasible with cardiac CT however, the diagnostic value of this assessment in patients at risk for ACS has not been demonstrated.The study included patients who presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain, nonischemic initial electrocardiogram (ECG), and negative cardiac biomarkers but had clinical suspicion for ACS and underwent invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Results were blinded to caregivers and patients. CT data sets were independently assessed for the presence of coronary plaque and stenosis, regional left ventricular function, and myocardial perfusion deficits by 2 blinded observers. Coronary angiography was assessed for the presence of stenosis, TIMI myocardial perfusion grade, and corrected TIMI frame count. The endpoint was ACS during index hospitalization.We analyzed data from 35 subjects (69% male, mean age 58 Â± 9 years) of whom 22 (63%) had ACS. The sensitivity and specificity of MPD for ACS were 86% (95% CI: 64%-96%) and 62% (95% CI: 32%-85%), respectively. Combined, MPD and RWMA assessment resulted in specificity and sensitivity of 86% (95% CI: 64%-96%) and 85% (95% CI: 54%-97%), respectively. Adding MPD and RWMA to the assessment for significant stenosis (>50%) resulted in a higher sensitivity of 91% (69-98%) and specificity of 85% (54-97%) and a significantly increased overall diagnostic accuracy when compared with assessment for stenosis (AUC: 0.88 vs 0.79 respectively, P = 0.02). Diagnostic accuracy of CT was not associated with impaired CTFC >40 or myocardial TIMI perfusion grade < 3.Assessment of myocardial perfusion and regional wall motion abnormalities may enhance the ability of CT to detect ACS in patients with acute chest pain.
