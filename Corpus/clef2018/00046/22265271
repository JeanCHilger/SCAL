High-resolution radial artery intima-media thickness and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with suspected coronary artery disease--comparison with common carotid artery intima-media thickness. The radial artery wall structure can be measured with non-invasive very high-resolution ultrasound with great feasibility and high accuracy. In the present study, we aim to explore clinical correlates of radial artery intima-media thickness (rIMT), in a relatively large patient cohort with suspected coronary artery disease, and further compare those to common carotid artery IMT (cIMT) that is an accepted surrogate marker of atherosclerosis.Four hundred and sixteen patients referred to myocardial perfusion scintigram (MPS) were recruited, and cIMT and rIMT were scanned using conventional and very high-resolution ultrasound (55 MHz transducer), respectively. A number of plasma biomarkers were also measured.Both cIMT and rIMT were similarly correlated with disease history, MPS-verified ischemia, carotid plaque burden, and lipid status. Repeated measurement of rIMT showed acceptable variability.Radial artery IMT may constitute a novel feasible imaging biomarker for systemic atherosclerosis burden, which may be used in future imaging trials to evaluate, e.g. anti-atherosclerotic treatments.
