Response criteria for malignant lymphoma. A proven criterion for assessing tumor response is the increase in tumor size. Unlike most tumors, lymph nodes are normal anatomical structures and can be measured even when benign. The International Working Group (IWG) criteria for lymphomas therefore combine morphological with functional (positron emission tomography PET) and biopsy (bone marrow biopsy) parameters. The IWG criteria have been established as the standard in clinical trials and take nodal involvement, spleen, liver involvement as well as bone marrow involvement into account, which makes the response evaluation complex.This involves an investigator-dependent, non-standardized and poorly reproducible estimation of tumor response to therapy.The formulation of standardized response categories for malignant lymphomas.The aim was to produce uniform and standardized criteria for application in medication studies.Established as the standard for medication studies but too time-consuming for practical application.An improved practicability can be achieved by incorporating a computer-assisted evaluation program.
