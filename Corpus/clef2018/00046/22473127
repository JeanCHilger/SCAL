A fresh look at spay/neuter legislation:  the journey to a middle ground. A hybrid body of regulations is recommended containing both mandatory spay/neuter and low-cost spay/neuter provisions that will reduce accidental litters, impulse buying, and other irresponsible pet practices. The majority of pet owners are well-meaning but often lack the financial, intellectual, or other resources to properly control the breeding behaviors of their animals. Full compliance with spay/neuter regulations is the most desirable solution to the pet overpopulation problem. A comprehensive rule structure will facilitate spaying and neutering in some circumstances and require it on others.
