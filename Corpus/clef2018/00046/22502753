Intracoronary injection of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells in patients with large anterior acute myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction: a 24- month follow up study. Despite the use of reperfusion therapies, outcomes in patients with large myocardial infarction (MI), late reperfusion and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction are poor. We investigated long-term safety and efficacy of intracoronary injections of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMNCs).27 patients with anterior MI (age 59±12 years, mean baseline LV ejection fraction (LVEF) 39±5 %), who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention 4-24 hours after the onset of symptoms, were randomly assigned either to intracoronary BMNCs injection (n=17, BMNCs group, out of which 14 underwent long-term follow-up), or to standard therapy (n=10, Control group). The LVEF, the LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (LVEDV, LVESV) were assessed by echocardiography at discharge, Month 4 and 24. Myocardial perfusion was assessed using SPECT at baseline and Month 4.At 24-month, there was no difference in rates of serious clinical events (36 % vs 50 %, p=0.54). At Month 4 LVEF improved to similar extent in both groups (absolute change +5.8 % vs +7.6 %, p=0.75), with similar infarct size reductions (-10.9 % vs -12.2 %, p=0.47). However, at Month 24, LVEF further improved in BMNCs patients (+12 % vs +8.5 %, p=0.03). This effect resulted from a more pronounced reduction in LVESV (-2.6 ml vs -1.8 ml, p=0.26) and a smaller increase in LVEDV (+16.7 ml vs +17.9 ml, p=0.27) suggesting beneficial long-term effects on LV remodeling.BMNCs injections in patients with MI and LV dysfunction were associated with a significant improvement of global LVEF during long term follow-up compared to standard therapy (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 50).
