Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in COPD may manifest myocardial ischemia. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is observed frequently in advanced COPD and it appears unrelated to the co-presence of its common risk factors as hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, etc. The patho-physiology of this association is yet unclear. We postulated that ischemia not apparent in the routine clinical evaluation could be the cause of such LVDD.Advanced COPD (GOLD III & IV) patients being excluded of concomitant presence of hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and hypothyroidism by conventional evaluations were looked for the presence of LVDD by tissue Doppler echocardiography. The subjects having LVDD were further evaluated with 99(m)Tc MIBI stress myocardial perfusion imaging to detect the presence of ischemia.7 out of 14 patients of advanced COPD sufferers without any known risk factors for LVDD had reversible perfusion defect in the stress perfusion imaging predominantly involving the inferior wall myocardium (71.43%). Most of the defects, though significant, were not picked up by stress ECG.Reversible ischemic defects are quite common (50%) in advanced COPD patients with LVDD without the presence of common risk factors. This association needs further evaluation.
