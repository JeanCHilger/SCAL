Initiation of c-ART in HIV-1 infected patients is associated with a decrease of the metabolic activity of the thymus evaluated using FDG-PET/computed tomography. The role of the thymus in the depletion or restoration of T-cell pool in HIV infection is still debatable. Studies are hampered by the lack of valuable tools to investigate thymic activity.We have evaluated thymic activity using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography and molecular and phenotypic analyses of thymic precursors. Longitudinal analyses were performed in HIV-infected patients either treatment naive with indication to initiate combination antiretroviral therapy (c-ART) (n = 11) or stable under c-ART (n = 9).Thymic standardized uptake value was significantly lower in c-ART-treated patients as compared with historical age-matched HIV-negative controls. In c-ART-naive patients, baseline thymic standardized uptake value correlated with T-cell repector excision circle levels and naive CD4+ T cells. These patients exhibited a high metabolic lymph node activity positively correlated to the percentage of activated HLA-DR+CD38+ T cells. Basal metabolic thymic activity predicts the gain in CD4+ T cells after c-ART initiation. A decrease of thymic activity, which paralleled circulating plasma IL-7 levels, was noted after c-ART initiation.A metabolic thymic activity is detectable in c-ART naive and correlates with indirect phenotypic and molecular markers of thymic output. This activity may participate to the pool of peripheral naive CD4+ T cells and predicts the magnitude of T-cell reconstitution under treatment.
