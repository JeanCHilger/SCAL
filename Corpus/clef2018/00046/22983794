PET/MR for therapy response evaluation in malignant lymphoma: initial experience. To evaluate the feasibility of positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MR) with (18)fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) for therapy response evaluation of malignant lymphoma.Nine patients with malignant lymphoma who underwent FDG-PET/MR before and after chemotherapy were included in this retrospective study. Average time between the two scans was 70 days. The scans were evaluated independently by two nuclear medicine physicians. The Ann Arbor classification was used to describe lymphoma stage. Furthermore, the readers also rated PET image quality using a five point scale. Weighted kappa (κ) was used to calculate interrater agreement.The initial scan showed foci of increased FDG uptake in all patients, with Ann Arbor stage varying between I and IV. In the follow-up examination, all but one patient showed complete response to chemotherapy. PET image quality was rated as very good or excellent for all scans. Interrater agreement was excellent regarding Ann Arbor stage (κ = 0.97) and good regarding image quality (κ = 0.41).PET/MR shows promising initial results for therapy response evaluation in lymphoma patients.
