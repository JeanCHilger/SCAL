Probe "balloon on a wire" ultra-low-profile coronary catheter: results of PTCA in 107 patients. A new low-profile "balloon-on-a-wire" angioplasty catheter, the Probe (USCI), was used in 107 patients over a 4-month period. Twenty-nine patients had stable angina, 59 had unstable angina, and 19 had had myocardial infarction (MI) 3 to 15 days prior to the procedure 71 patients had single-vessel and 36 had multi-vessel disease. In this series, 57 lesions were defined as complex. Successful dilatation was defined as a residual stenosis of less than 30%. Of 132 non-total obstructions, 127 (97%) were successfully dilated. Two distal lesions could not be reached, two lesions could not be crossed by the balloon, and a distal lesion dilatation resulted in acute closure in one case. Of 19 total obstructions, 16 (84%) were successfully dilated (mean residual stenosis 23%). The wire tip was unable to cross the lesion in the three unsuccessful procedures. Seven complications occurred in the series, all involving non-total obstructions: closure of a distal vessel and a side branch caused no clinical symptoms or EKG changes
