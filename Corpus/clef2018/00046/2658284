Overnutrition: an epidemic problem in pet animal practice? This review demonstrates that manufactured pet foods contain more than adequate levels of all the essential nutrients needed by normal dogs and cats. Under normal circumstances, therefore, it is completely unnecessary to supplement the rations of these animals with protein, energy, fatty acids, vitamins, or minerals. We have tried to show that, in addition to being unnecessary, supplementation of the rations of normal animals may be quite dangerous, leading to serious--indeed, sometimes fatal--clinical consequences. Pet food manufacturers have responded to newer information regarding increased requirements for specific nutrients such as taurine and potassium. Thus, supplements of these nutrients, as well, are unnecessary in the absence of specific clinical indications. As practitioners, we should be wary of beneficial effects claimed for nutritional supplements. Anecdotal comments, in particular, should be discounted completely. Objective data, including statistical evaluation demonstrating efficacy, should be demanded before accepting claims for such products. Finally, the use of nutritional supplements should be restricted to those cases in which specific clinical problems dictate their use.
