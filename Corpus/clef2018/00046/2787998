Positron emission tomographic evaluations on hemodynamics and glucose metabolism of brain tumors and perifocal edematous tissues. Blood flow and glucose metabolism of the tumors and perifocal edematous tissues were evaluated using positron emission tomography (PET). Thirty-one brain tumor cases were investigated 12 non glial tumors (9 meningiomas and 3 metastatic tumors) and 19 gliomas (these were classified in 5 astrocytomas, 7 anaplastic astrocytomas and 7 glioblastomas, according to the malignancy). The diagnosis were confirmed pathologically in 30 cases. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) were measured by O-15 labeled gases inhalation methods. Cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMFglu) were measured by F-18 Deoxyglucose intravenous injection method and calculated by Hutchins's formula. The rate constant (ks) and lumped constant (LC) used in this study were the same as those published by Phelps et al. in 1979. The blood flow and glucose metabolic rates of tumors were measured by the same methods. The results were as follows: 1) Meningiomas showed very high blood flow and blood volume with a wide range. The OEF and metabolic rate for glucose (MRglu) values were very low. 2) Metastatic tumors showed the low values of blood flow, metabolic rate for oxygen (MRO2) and OEF. 3) The blood flow and MRglu values on gliomas were varied with no significant differences between the three subgroups. On the other hands, as the malignancy of the glioma increased, a statistically significant increase in blood volume and a decrease in OEF were noted. 4) The OEF values from the various types of tumors studied were significantly lower than those obtained from the normal tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
