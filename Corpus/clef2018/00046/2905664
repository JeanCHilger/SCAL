Benzodiazepine receptors studied in living primates by positron emission tomography: antagonist interactions. After labelling the brain benzodiazepine receptors of sub-human primates with [11C]RO15-1788, the interactions of different benzodiazepine receptor antagonist ligands were studied by positron emission tomography (PET). Various doses of either RO15-1788, RO15-3505 or propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate were injected intravenously 20 min after the radiotracer, and induced an immediate and specific dose-dependent displacement of the brain radioactivity. However, a comparison of the dose-receptor occupancy patterns of these three antagonists established from the displacement experiments revealed that only propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate displayed clear biphasic dose-receptor occupancy curves. This indicates that, in the living primate brain, there are two different benzodiazepine receptor subpopulations (which can be either different benzodiazepine receptor subtypes or distinct conformational states of a single receptor).
