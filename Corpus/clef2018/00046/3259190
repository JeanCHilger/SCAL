Use of splenic volume estimation to distinguish primary thrombocythaemia from reactive thrombocytosis. Splenic volume was measured by visual assessment of planar images of the spleen, and also by single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) using 99mtechnetium tin colloid, in a group of 33 patients with primary thrombocythaemia (PT) or reactive thrombocytosis. Volumes greater than 337 cm3 correlated strongly though not absolutely with PT, all patients with volumes greater than this figure being in the PT group. Simple visual assessment of planar images by an experienced observer matched measured splenic volumes very closely.
