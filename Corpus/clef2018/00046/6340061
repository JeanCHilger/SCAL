Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Incidence, clinical findings, pathomorphology and pathogenesis. A review. Acute and progressive respiratory distress ("shock lung") is a well known and feared complication in human patients with a variety of underlying disorders, even though the lungs are not involved primarily. In spite of the fact that dogs, and other animals, very often have been used in experimental models studying this syndrome, "shock lungs" have not received much attention in veterinary medicine. With the improved and more intensive treatment of severely diseased animals during the last years, especially pet animals, it is reasonable to assume that the lungs will be more important as an end organ also in veterinary practice. Animals in shock, particularly if complicated with sepsis, are prone to develop progressive respiratory distress. This paper reviews the current knowledge about the clinical picture, pathology and pathogenesis of acute respiratory disease, with main emphasize on the pathogenetic mechanism.
