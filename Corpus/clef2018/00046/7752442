Relationship between insufficient redistribution in exercise thallium-201 myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography and reverse redistribution at rest. It is widely accepted that perfusion defects in 3 to 4-h delayed images in exercise thallium-201 (201Tl) myocardial scintigraphy underestimate the viability of myocardium in the infarct region. In the present study, to examine the contribution of the condition of myocardium which demonstrates reverse redistribution in resting scintigraphy to the insufficiency of redistribution in the 4-h delayed image in exercise scintigraphy, we performed exercise and resting 201Tl myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography in 58 patients with acute myocardial infarction and a single diseased coronary artery. Twenty eight patients demonstrated reverse redistribution (group RR) and 28 showed a fixed defect (group FD) in resting scintigraphy. Redistribution in the 4-h delayed image in exercise scintigraphy was significantly more insufficient in group RR than in group FD (p < 0.01), and the degree of the insufficiency of redistribution in exercise scintigraphy closely correlated with the degree of reverse redistribution in resting scintigraphy (r = 0.79, p < 0.001). We conclude that in patients with acute myocardial infarction, the condition of myocardium which demonstrates reverse redistribution in resting myocardial scintigraphy is related to the insufficiency of redistribution in the delayed image in exercise scintigraphy.
