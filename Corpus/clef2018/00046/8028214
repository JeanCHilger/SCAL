Quantitation of regional cerebral blood flow by single photon emission computed tomography of CBF-tracer combined with whole-brain CBF: a comparison between 123I-IMP and 99mTc-HMPAO in healthy volunteers. A simple, noninvasive method of measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) that uses single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of CBF-tracer and whole brain CBF obtained by xenon-133 (133Xe) clearance technique was developed. In nine healthy volunteers, SPECT data were normalized to the count density of 123I-IMP or 99mTc-HMPAO uptake in the whole-brain, and then converted to the absolute units of CBF by multiplying average 133Xe-CBF in the whole brain. The CBF values measured by 99mTc-HMPAO CBF-SPECT was significantly lower in the high flow regions of cortical gray matter (bilateral frontal lobe p < 0.05 and right occipital lobe
