Regional metabolic dependency in obstructive sleep apnea. Abnormalities of oxygen use occur in obstructive sleep apnea, as do impaired cerebral perfusion and alterations of cerebral function. In this case study, the authors quantitated the local cerebral glucose metabolic rate in two patients with obstructive sleep apnea (one with and one without oxygen supply dependency) and assessed cerebral glucose use by increasing oxygen delivery through passive leg elevation. Obstructive sleep apnea was confirmed by visual analysis of nocturnal pulse oximetry traces in two patients and its severity assessed from the respiratory disturbance index and minimum oxygen saturation. Awake local cerebral glucose metabolic rate (microM/min/100 g) was determined by positron-emission tomography using [18F]-2-Fluoro-2-Deoxy-D-Glucose at baseline and on the following day during passive leg elevation. Conditions otherwise were unchanged. The patient with global oxygen supply dependency exhibited a significant increase in the local cerebral glucose metabolic rate. In contrast, the patient without global supply dependency had no change in the local cerebral glucose metabolic rate. These case studies demonstrate the first evidence of improvement in regional metabolic consumption in response to increased oxygen delivery and in the presence of global oxygen supply dependency.
