Dopamine D2 receptor alteration in patients with periodic movements in sleep (nocturnal myoclonus). Periodic movements in sleep (PMS) can cause severe sleep disturbances. We investigated the central dopamine D2 receptor density in patients with PMS with 123I-IBZM and single photon emission tomography (SPET). In PMS there was a lower 123I-IBZM binding in the basal ganglia compared to the control group. The results indicate a loss of central D2 receptors in PMS.
