Normal brain F-18 FDG-PET and MRI anatomy. Image registration techniques will become increasingly important in correlative multimodality imaging. In the case of PET, a structural imaging study can be invaluable in correlating structure metabolism relationships. A registered brain atlas of PET and MRI has been developed by the authors that allows clinicians, residents, fellows, and others to refer to a structural abnormality on MRI or metabolic abnormality on PET and correlate it neuro-anatomically.
