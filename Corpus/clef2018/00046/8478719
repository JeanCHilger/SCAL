Estimation of left ventricular mass and infarct size from nitrogen-13-ammonia PET images based on pathological examination of explanted human hearts. The purpose of this study was to develop a technique to quantify left ventricular mass and infarct size in chronic ischemic heart disease from PET images based on correlation with pathological examination of explanted human hearts. Fourteen hearts from patients with cardiomyopathy who had 13N-ammonia scans prior to orthoptic heart transplantation were studied. Accurate estimation of the relative infarct size was possible in patients with a well-delineated, nearly transmural infarct (r = 0.93, y = 1.1x - 0.7, n = 11). Both absolute and relative infarct mass measurements on PET images correlated well with pathological measurements. We identified a population of patients with patchy interstitial or subendocardial scarring with globally reduced perfusion, for which the infarct size could not be estimated using the criteria derived for the patients with well-delineated infarcts.
