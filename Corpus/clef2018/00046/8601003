Three-dimensional imaging diagnosis for cranial base lesions. Diagnosis of neurological disease by imaging has greatly improved in recent years. Precise morphological information can be obtained by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and biochemical or electrophysiological dynamic changes can be assessed by positron emission tomography or magnetoencephalography. The transcription of such biochemical or electrophysiological data on computed tomographic scan or magnetic resonance imaging can precisely demonstrate the local dynamic information in the brain. Three-dimensional imaging also provides accurate intelligence on the morphological structure of lesions and facilitates the surgical management. In this article the recent technology of three-dimensional imaging diagnosis in skull base surgery is reported.
