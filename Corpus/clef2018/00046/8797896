Cortical localization of human sustained attention: detection with functional MR using a visual vigilance paradigm. Our goal was to determine whether functional MRI on a standard 1.5 T system can localize activation during a visual vigilance sustained attention task and whether this corresponds to results described in a PET investigation of a similar task.Sixteen volunteers were studied on a 1.5 T system using a gradient echo technique. A single axial section was oriented within a stereotaxic coordinate space, 40 mm superior to the anterior-posterior commissure line. Images with eyes closed were followed by images during subject concentration on a small dim spot. Motion correction and pixel-by-pixel statistical analysis were performed. Talairach grids were applied for summary statistical analysis and comparison to PET data, with analysis using a series of planned contrasts within a repeated measures analysis of variance.Predominantly right-sided frontal and parietal activation was observed, with statistical significance across subjects in the right frontal lobe (F > or = 5.9, p < or = 0.041). Comparison with previously reported PET data yielded a very similar pattern of activation (F = 13.2 df = 1,8Activation of the right middle frontal gyrus and right parietal lobe during visual vigilance is detectable across functional imaging modalities.
