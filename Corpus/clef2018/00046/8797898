Glucose metabolic changes in nontumoral brain tissue of patients with brain tumor following radiotherapy: a preliminary study. Our goal was to measure the effect of radiotherapy on the brain glucose metabolism of tumoral and nontumoral tissue of patients with brain malignancies.Fifteen patients with primary or metastatic brain tumors were studied with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose and PET prior to radiotherapy, and nine of them were rescanned 1 week after completing radiotherapy.Brain metabolism in patients (all brain regions except for tumoral and edematous tissue) was lower than that of matched controls (34.0 +/- 8.3 vs. 46.5 +/- 6.4 mumol/100 g/min p < or = 0.0001). Five of the nine patients retested after radiotherapy showed decrements in tumor metabolism (47 +/- 10%The study indicates that radiotherapy-induced increases in metabolism of nontumoral tissue are secondary to decreased tumor metabolic activity and not just due to volume reduction.
