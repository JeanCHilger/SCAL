Topographic representation in human intraparietal sulcus of reaching and saccade. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by positron emission tomography in seven subjects during reaching with saccade, reaching without saccade, saccade and control tasks. The reaching with saccade task activated two spatially distinct areas in the contralateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS) compared with the control condition. The area located in the anterior part of the IPS was also activated during the reaching without saccade but not during the saccade task. The other area, located in the posterior part of the IPS was, in contrast, active during the saccade but not the reaching without saccade task. The results indicate that the human IPS is functionally heterogeneous, and that functional roles of its anterior and posterior parts include control of reaching movements and eye movements, respectively.
