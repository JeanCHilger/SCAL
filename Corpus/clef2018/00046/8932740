Post-traumatic apallic syndrome following head injury. Part 1: clinical characteristics. Epidemiological studies made within the western countries indicate an incidence of 200-300 traumatic head injuries per 100 000 residents each year. Severe head injuries account for 5-25% of all head injuries 10-14% of all severe head-injured patients develop into a vegetative state, in which a sleep-wake rhythm is apparent, but however in which there is no evidence of awakeness or reactivity to the environment. The most commonly used labels, in the German and international literature, for these patients are 'vegetative state', 'apallic syndrome' and 'coma vigile'. This clinical characterization is not sufficient. It is necessary to employ additional criteria to distinguish subsets of vegetative patients e.g. computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, single photon emission tomography, electroencephalography, brainstem reflexes, evoked potentials, assessment scales, age, premorbid brain disorders. Diagnostic and prognostic parameters must form the basis for various decisions relating to patients' care and intervention.
