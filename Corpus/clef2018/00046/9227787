Scintimammography using Tc-99m tetrofosmin. Breast cancer, the most common malignancy in women, still poses a challenge to diagnostic procedures and therapy. Despite low specificity routine mammography is the method of choice to screen women for breast cancer. In the last years other additional diagnostic procedures such as high frequency ultrasonography (US) and especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved breast cancer diagnosis. However, all these imaging methods are lacking in specificity which makes biopsy or surgery necessary. The purpose of our study was to evaluate prospectively the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of scintimammography with a new cationic complex Tc-99m tetrofosmin in patients with suspicious mammographic lesions. One hundred and thirty seven patients in whom mammography and/or high resolution ultrasonography (10 MHz) revealed suspicious breast lesions were studied with Tc-99m tetrofosmin scintimammography. In 84 of them biopsy and/or surgery was performed for histological evaluation. After intravenous injection of 555 MBq Tc-99m tetrofosmin planar images in anterior and lateral projections (5 min.p.i.) and SPECT imaging including 3-D-reconstruction (20 min.p.i.) were performed. Scintimammography was evaluated as negative, equivocal (+), probably (+2) or definitely (+3) positive. Planar scintimammography with Tc-99m tetrofosmin was negative in 46 patients (43 true negative-f.n 3 false negative-f.n.) and positive in 38 patients (27 true positive-t.p.
