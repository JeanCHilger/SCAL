Relationship between iodine-123-beta-methyl-p-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid washout ratio and oxygen consumption in normal and ischemic myocardium. The relationship between oxygen consumption and iodine-123-beta-methyl-p-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid (123I-BMIPP) washout at rest and after exercise was investigated in normal and ischemic myocardium. Sixteen healthy volunteers and 14 patients with ischemic heart disease were examined. After injection of 111MBq of 123I-BMIPP, serial single photon emission computed tomography imaging was performed to evaluate washout ratio after 30 min and 1 hour of rest and after exercise. In the volunteers, the mean washout ratio was 3.3 +/- 3.5% after 1 hour of rest and increased during exercise. The exercise washout ratio showed a better correlation with net pressure rate product (net PRP: cumulative values of PRP during exercise) than with the peak PRP. The exercise washout ratio showed a strong correlation with the net PRP in the range from 180 to 300 x 10(3) mmHg. beat/min and a plateau of 10-15%. In the nine ischemic patients with net PRP > or = 300 x 10(3) mmHg.beat/min, the exercise washout ratio values were significantly elevated in normal segments relative to ischemic segments (10.1 +/- 1.9% vs 4.7 +/- 2.9%, p < 0.001). In the five ischemic patients with net PRP < 300 x 10(3) mmHg.beat/min, washout ratio at rest and after exercise did not differ significantly between normal and ischemic segments. 123I-BMIPP washout ratio increased with increased oxygen consumption during exercise in normal myocardium but not in ischemic myocardium. The patient must exercise before fatty acid metabolism can be compared between normal and ischemic myocardium.
