A method for quantifying SPECT uniformity. Field uniformity is an important parameter for monitoring the performance of SPECT imaging systems. However, it is difficult to apply objective measures of uniformity because of the large variance associated with reconstructed images. In the proposed method, annular sampling of the SPECT uniformity image is used to reduce the noise level without decreasing the magnitude of uniformity artifacts. The reconstructed uniformity image is sectioned into annular rings centered on the center of rotation to match the expected distribution of uniformity artifacts. Statistical fluctuations are reduced by averaging the counts within the annular rings, allowing the use of objective measures of field uniformity such as integral uniformity. Application of the annular sampling technique on simulated and phantom uniformity images showed that the technique could reliably quantify SPECT uniformity artifacts at acceptable count levels. As a result this method can be used to objectively evaluate SPECT field uniformity in systems which utilize parallel collimation and circular orbits.
