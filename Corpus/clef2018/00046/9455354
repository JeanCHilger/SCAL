The value of scintigraphic imaging with 99mTc-MIBI for the diagnosis of gliomas. Imagery is the only possibility of early glioma diagnosis. Both the gravity of the evolution and the bad prognostic, through all CNS tumors, justify the necessity to asses new techniques in order to improve glioma imagery. From this point of view, cerebral tomoscintigraphy has developed, its usefulness depending highly on the radiotracer tumoral specificity. One of these tracers, 99mTc MIBI, has been found to be uptake in glioma malignant cells, in relation with their viability and even malignity. In our study, -14 cerebral tomoscintigraphies have been realized on patients with glioma (initial or recurrent tumor), after 20 mCi 99mTc MIBI i.v. doses. The results are in correlation with the histologic glioma grade: high grade astrocytoma has positive images, but low grade astrocytoma doesn't. In conclusion 99mTc MIBI glioma tomoscintigraphies can be useful in their initial or recurrent diagnosis the uptake tracer intensity being correlated with the histologic tumoral pattern, 99mTc MIBI SPECT could make possible a better localization of highest malignity tumoral points, in further biopsies.
