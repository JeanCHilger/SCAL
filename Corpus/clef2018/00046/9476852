Self-control and external control of mechanical ventilation give equal air hunger relief. Elevated end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 (PET(CO2)) causes air hunger this sensation becomes intense with a relatively small rise in PET(CO2) if ventilation is held constant. Spontaneously breathing subjects increase ventilation in response to CO2, thereby greatly diminishing air hunger. In healthy subjects and ventilator-dependent patients, experimenter-induced increases in ventilator tidal volume (VT) relieve air hunger even if PET(CO2) is kept elevated. We addressed two questions: (1) Can paralyzed, ventilator-dependent patients use the sensation of air hunger to effectively control ventilator VT using nonrespiratory motor pathways
