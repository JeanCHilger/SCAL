Effect of enzymatic deglycosylation on feline immunodeficiency virus sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization. We have investigated the effect of deglycosylation with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) on the sensitivity to inhibition by immune sera of two variants of the Petaluma strain of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV-Pet), one sensitive to antibody-mediated neutralization because tissue culture adapted and the other, obtained by passaging the previous one in vivo, resistant to neutralization. The partial deglycosylation achieved did not appreciably affect FIV-Pet infectivity for T lymphoid cell cultures and did not increase the susceptibility to serum neutralization of the resistant variant but totally prevented neutralization of the sensitive variant. These finding suggest that the epitopes involved in neutralization of tissue culture-adapted FIV-Pet are effectively recognized by antibody only when the viral surface is properly glycosylated.
