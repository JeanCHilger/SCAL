Is there any advantage to the acquisition of 24-hour thallium images, in the presence of persistent perfusion defects at 4 h after reinjection? We determined the incidence of delayed 24-h reversibility post thallium-201 reinjection and imaging at 4 h, as well as the prognostic and significance of such delayed reversibility. We studied 46 consecutive patients with persistent thallium-201 perfusion or incompletely reversible single-photon emission tomography (SPET) perfusion defects acquired within 10 min after reinjection performed 4 h after stress. In 38 of 46 patients (82%) 24-h images showed no further reversibility beyond the post-reinjection 4-h study (group A). Eight of 46 patients (17%) demonstrated reversibility on 24-h imaging (group B). Of these eight, three patients showed no improvement compared with the post-stress images, with a mean perfusion score of the abnormal segments of 1. 25+/-0.50 on the 4-h images, and of 3.00 on the 24-h images, where normal is 4. Four patients presented with nine mixed regions. Four of these regions showed an improvement in the mean perfusion score of 2.50+/-0.58 on 4- and 24-h images. Two of them, with moderate/severe defects, demonstrated complete reversibility at 4-h post-reinjection imaging. In addition, five other regions presented no improvement at 4-h imaging, but showed an improvement in the mean perfusion score from 0.80+/-0.84 at 4-h to 3.30+/-0.89 at 24-h imaging. Two of these regions in one patient showed a severe perfusion score of 0 at 4 h, and complete reversibility at 24 hours, with a mean score improvement of 4. Another patient had three severe perfusion defects two of them redistributed partially at 4 h and completely at 24 h. The remaining segment with a perfusion score of 0 at 4 h, presented complete reversibility with a score of 4 at 24 h. Two (4%) patients revealed significant reversibility at 24 h in a region that was severely underperfused after post-reinjection imaging at 4 h. Among group B patients, 75% (6/8) had recent acute ischemic syndrome, compared with only 13% (5/38) in group A (P = 0. 001). Among 11 patients with unstable angina, six (55%) had evidence of delayed 24-h reversibility, compared with 2 of 35 (6%) patients without clinically acute ischemia (P = 0.001). On follow-up, there were seven (17%) cardiac deaths among the 38 group A patients but three (38%) among the eight group B patients (P = 0.3). These findings suggest that although the presence of delayed 24-h 201Tl, post-reinjection reversibility is infrequent, it has potential clinical importance. Thus, delayed 24-h imaging should be considered in the context of unstable angina or other acute coronary syndromes.
