A modified method of cardiac functional analysis for ECG gated SPECT: study of functional G-maps. To evaluate the cardiac function accurately using ECG gated SPECT images, we performed a modified method of cardiac functional analysis (Functional G-maps). One hour after the intravenous injection of 1,110 MBq of 99mTc-tetrofosmin, gated SPECT data was acquired dividing a cardiac cycle into 12 frames. Every short-axis images were usually reconstructed using first 11 of 12 frames. The reconstruction of these images was repeated performing slice thickness correction. Because the apex-to-base length is different at any frame during a cardiac cycle, 10 slices of short-axis images were obtained with the same thickness for each frame. Subsequently each short-axis image was divided by 40 radii, and the time activity curve was generated from the total counts included in each segment plus both neighboring segments. Afterwards the curve fitting was performed using the second reverse Fourier function. From fitted curves and their differentials, we estimated a variety of parameters including Max (End-systolic count), Min (End-diastolic count), %CI (Percent count increase), Uptake, PCR (Peak contraction rate), PDR (Peak distention rate) and CT (Contraction time). In 5 normal subjects, %Max was greater in the anterior and septal regions, whereas %Min was greater in the apex and lateral regions. %CI and %PCR were similarly greater in the septal, anterior and inferior regions. On the other hand, %PDR in the lateral or inferior region was lower than the values in the other regions. In conclusion, this modified method is expected to be useful for accurate assessment of regional cardiac function and myocardial perfusion.
