Measurement of regional cerebral blood flow using one-point arterial blood sampling and microsphere model with 123I-IMP: correction of one-point arterial sampling count by whole brain count ratio. A correction method was proposed for measurement of the regional cerebral blood flow using one-point arterial blood sampling and a microsphere model with N-isopropyl-p-(123I)iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP). Instead of using continuous arterial blood sampling octanol-extracted counts, one-point arterial sampling whole blood counts corrected by the whole brain count ratio using 1-minute planar SPECT images were employed. The experimental subjects were 189 patients with cerebrovascular disorders. 123I-IMP, 222 MBq, was administered by intravenous infusion. Continuous arterial blood sampling was carried out for 5 minutes, and arterial blood was also sampled once at 5 minutes after 123I-IMP administration. Then the whole blood count of the one-point arterial sampling was compared with the octanol-extracted count of the continuous arterial sampling. A positive correlation was found between the two values (r = 0.87, p < 0.001). The correction method was carried out by calculation as follows. The ratio of the continuous sampling octanol-extracted count (OC) to the one-point sampling whole blood count (TC5) was compared with the whole brain count ratio (5:29 ratio, Cn) using 1-minute planar SPECT images, centering on 5 and 29 minutes after 123I-IMP administration. Correlation was found between the two values (r = 0.72, p < 0.001). The following relationship was shown from the correlation equation. OC/TC5 = 0.390969 x Cn-0.08924. Based on this correlation equation, we calculated the theoretical continuous arterial sampling octanol-extracted count (COC). COC = TC5 x (0.390969 x Cn-0.08924). There was good correlation between the value calculated with this equation and the actually measured value (r = 0.94, p < 0.001). The coefficient improved to r = 0.94 from the r = 0.87 obtained before using the 5:29 ratio for correction. For 23 of these 189 cases, another one-point arterial sampling was carried out at 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 minutes after the administration of 123I-IMP. The correlation coefficient was also improved for these other point samplings when this correction method using the 5:29 ratio was applied. It was concluded that it is possible to obtain highly accurate input functions, i.e., calculated continuous arterial sampling octanol-extracted counts, using one-point arterial sampling whole blood counts by performing correction using the 5:29 ratio.
