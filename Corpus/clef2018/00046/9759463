Multi-project angiography in the imaging of cerebral aneurysm. In spite of procedures such as CT angiography, MR angiography, and rotation angiography, panangiography is still indispensable in therapeutic planning for cerebral aneurysms. It is the only method that provides exact details about the size, anatomic localization, and multiplicity of aneurysms as well as relation to surrounding vessels, the presence of an aneurysmal neck, and for the evaluation of the collateral circulation required to answer the question if endovascular therapy is possible. In addition, panangiography still exhibits the highest selectivity in the detection of cerebral aneurysms.
