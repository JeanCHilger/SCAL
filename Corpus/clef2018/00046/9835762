FDG-PET in the staging of malignant melanoma. Positron emission tomography (PET scanning) is a useful tool in staging of malignant melanoma. A radiolabelled glucoseanalogue can demonstrate changes in metabolism and thus identify malignancy in macroscopic unchanged structures. It is a non-invasive, fast method to identify especially visceral, still symptomless metastases. The patient can often be spared from mutilating surgery.
