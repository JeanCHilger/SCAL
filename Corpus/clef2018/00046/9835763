PET-findings in head-and neck cancers. Head and neck cancer is very suitable for investigation with PET (positron emission tomography), usually owing to the locoregional spread at the time of diagnosis. Thus, the data collected enable any lesions present to be visualised. Evaluation of tumour metabolism with PET may simplify the diagnosis of metastases, and be of predictive value, enabling response to radiotherapy and cytostatic therapy to be predicted. It serves as a complement to CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in the diagnosis of recurrence, and is thus useful in planning surgical intervention. Methods capable of distinguishing hypoxic or rapidly dividing cells can be useful in the choice of effective treatment methods such as hyperfractionated radiotherapy, drugs which enhance radiosensitivity, the degree of radical surgery, and the use of gene therapy.
