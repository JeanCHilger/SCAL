Evolution of brain glucose metabolism with age in epileptic infants, children and adolescents. During the first years of life, the human brain undergoes repetitive modifications in its anatomical, functional, and synaptic construction to reach the complex functional organization of the adult central nervous system. As an attempt to gain further insight in those maturation processes, the evolution of cerebral metabolic activity was investigated as a function of age in epileptic infants, children and adolescents. The regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rCMRGlc) were measured with positron emission tomography (PET) in 60 patients aged from 6 weeks to 19 years, who were affected by complex partial epilepsy. They were scanned at rest, without premedication, in similar conditions to 20 epileptic adults and in 49 adult controls. The distribution of brain metabolic activity successively extended from sensorimotor areas and thalamus in epileptic newborns to temporo-parietal and frontal cortices and reached the adult pattern after 1 year of age. The measured rCMRGlc in the cerebral cortex, excluding the epileptic lesions, increased from low values in infants to a maximum between 4 and 12 years, before it declined to stabilize at the end of the second decade of life. Similar age-related changes in glucose metabolic rates were not observed in the adult groups. Despite the use of medications, the observed variations of rCMRGlc with age in young epileptic humans confirm those previously described in pediatric subjects. These metabolic changes are in full agreement with the current knowledge of the synaptic density evolution in the human brain.
