A review of compression methods for medical images in PACS. As an introduction to Section C2 (medical imaging) of track C (Images and PACS) of MIE '97, an appropriate and timely topic concerns the coding for the transmission of medical images in PACS. Speed limitations of existing networks along with the explosive growth of image modalities with extremely high volume outputs have combined to make the issue of medical image coding one of the key considerations in the design of future PACS systems. Both lossless and lossy compression schemes are reviewed and compared, and the compression demands are presented of the main digital medical image modalities.
