Routine patch testing with the sesquiterpene lactone mix in Europe: a 2-year experience. A multicentre study of the EECDRG. To test the screening value of the sesquiterpene lactone (SL) mix in Europe today and describe epidemiological and clinical features of Compositae-sensitive patients, the SL mix 0.1% pet. was included in the standard patch test series in 11 European clinics. 10,695 patients were tested, and 106 (1%) had positive reactions, 74% of which were of current or old relevance. The prevalence of positive reactions varied between 0.1 and 2.7% in different centres. The median age of the 66 females was 51.5 years, and 55.2 in the 40 males. The 20 occupationally sensitized had a higher % of males and a median age of 43 years, whereas 7 UV-sensitive patients had a median age of 72 years. Garden plants were the major suspected sensitizers and the clinical patterns were partly, in accordance with plant dermatoses in general, involving hands, forearms and face, and partly widespread eczema in a large proportion of the patients. More than 1/3 were positive to perfume and/or colophony, possibly reflecting cross-reactivity. With only 1 case of active sensitization and no irritant reactions, the SL mix is a safe allergen and the overall prevalence of positive reactions supports its continued use in the standard patch test series.
