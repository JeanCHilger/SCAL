Assessment of left ventricular function by ECG-gated myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with image inversion technique: comparison with equilibrium radionuclide angiography. Inversion of gated myocardial perfusion imaging has been proposed for the evaluation of left ventricular function. This study compared the results of inversion technique of gated left anterior oblique 45 degrees images (G-LAO 45 degrees) with those provided by equilibrium radionuclide angiography in the assessment of global left ventricular function in the same patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease.A total of 107 patients (85 men and 22 women, mean age 59 +/- 9 years) with suspected or documented coronary artery disease were studied. Eighty-seven underwent a 2-day stress/rest technetium-99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography with acquisition of G-LAO 45 degrees images on the day of rest, and 20 underwent thallium-201 stress/redistribution single photon emission computed tomography with G-LAO 45 degrees image acquisition immediately after redistribution imaging. An excellent correlation (P < .001) with no significant differences was found between left ventricular ejection fraction values provided by inversion G-LAO 45 degree and radionuclide angiography in 87 patients studied with Tc-99m sestamibi and 20 patients studied with TI-201. The Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated the difference in absolute ejection fraction values obtained by inversion G-LAO 45 degree images and radionuclide angiography as <8%. The inversion G-LAO 45 degrees left ventricular ejection fraction distinguishes the patients with myocardial infarction (ejection fraction = 43% +/- 13%) and without myocardial infarction (ejection fraction = 60% +/- 5%) (P < .001). In patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, inversion G-LAO 45 degree images provide evaluation of left ventricular function comparable with that obtained by RNA.Semiautomated myocardial perfusion gated inversion technique analyzed with a count-based method is useful in the evaluation of left ventricular function and provides similar results to those of radionuclide angiography.
