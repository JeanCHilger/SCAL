Fourier rebinning applied to multiplanar circular-orbit cone-beam SPECT. We study the application of Fourier rebinning methods to dual-planar cone-beam SPECT. Dual-planar cone-beam SPECT involves the use of a pair of dissimilar cone-beam collimators on a dual-camera SPECT system. Each collimator has its focus in a different axial plane. While dual-planar data is best reconstructed with fully three-dimensional (3-D) iterative methods, these methods are slow and have prompted a search for faster reconstruction techniques. Fourier rebinning was developed to estimate equivalent parallel projections from 3-D PET data, but it simply expresses a relationship between oblique projections taken in planes not perpendicular to the axis of rotation and direct projections taken in those that are. We find that it is possible to put cone-beam data in this context as well. The rebinned data can then be reconstructed using either filtered backprojection (FBP) or parallel iterative algorithms such as OS-EM. We compare the Feldkamp algorithm and fully 3-D OSEM reconstruction with Fourier-rebinned reconstructions on realistically-simulated Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT data. We find that the Fourier-rebinned reconstructions exhibit much less image noise and lower variance in region-of-interest (ROI) estimates than Feldkamp. Also, Fourier-rebinning followed by OSEM with nonuniform attenuation correction exhibits less bias in ROI estimates than Feldkamp with Chang attenuation correction. The Fourier-rebinned ROI estimates exhibit bias and variance comparable to those from fully 3-D OSEM and require considerably less processing time. However, in areas off the axis of rotation, the axial-direction resolution of FORE-reconstructed images is poorer than that of images reconstructed with 3-D OSEM. We conclude that Fourier rebinning is a practical and potentially useful approach to reconstructing data from dual-planar circular-orbit cone-beam systems.
