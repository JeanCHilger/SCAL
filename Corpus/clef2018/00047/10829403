Fusion of coregistered cross-modality images using a temporally alternating display method. As an aid to the interpretation of functional images, cross-modality coregistration of functional and anatomical images has grown rapidly. Various ways of easily interpreting and visualising coregistered images have previously been investigated for their display, an intensity-weighted temporally alternating method is used. For brain images, geometric registration involves the automatic alignment method, using the head scalp boundary extracted from the sinogram of a PET emission scan and a surface-matching algorithm
