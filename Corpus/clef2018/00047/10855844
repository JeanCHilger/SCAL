Drug choice and therapeutic drug monitoring in the management of canine primary epilepsy. Therapeutic drug monitoring is an underutilised resource in the management of canine primary epilepsy. Many of the anti-epileptic drugs, including phenobarbitone, have variable pharmacokinetic profiles in different dogs, with each individual animal showing variable rates of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. This results in variable serum drug concentrations with the same oral dose. Many clinicians interpret this situation as therapeutic failure and classify these patients as refractory to treatment. By measuring blood concentrations of drugs at appropriate times, it is possible to explain the efficacy or failure of treatment, and also to prevent serum concentrations from reaching toxic levels. By analysing paired samples, key pharmacokinetic parameters may be calculated for each patient and a profile for the disposition of the drug obtained. Individual optimal drug dosage can be calculated for each patient at little cost to the pet owner.
