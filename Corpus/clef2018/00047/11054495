Abnormalities of brain perfusion in echovirus type 30 meningitis. From May to August 1998 an epidemic of aseptic meningitis (AM) due to echovirus type 30 (E30) occurred in Yamaguchi prefecture, Japan. We performed single-photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) to evaluate cerebral perfusion during the acute stage in 27 patients with AM due to E30. Moreover, we measured the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNF-R) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) in all 27 patients, and the serum concentration of soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) in 19 of the 27 patients, which is responsible for vasculitis, by means of a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In 20 of the 27 (74.1%) children, SPECT imaging revealed localized cerebral hypoperfusion without abnormal focal neurological findings or symptoms. Follow-up SPECT after about 1 month revealed no abnormalities. The CSF concentrations of sTNF-R and IL-1beta, and the serum concentration of sE-selectin in the group with abnormal findings on SPECT were significantly higher than those in the group without abnormal findings on SPECT and the control subjects. Our results indicate that transient reduced regional blood flow is a frequent finding in children with AM due to E30 infection and that this abnormal finding may be induced by cerebral vasculitis.
