Cerebral cortical dysplasia: assessment by MRI and SPECT. The objective of this study was to establish correlations between image findings and pathologic deficits in patients with cerebral cortical malformations. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in addition to clinical data for 15 patients with cerebral cortical malformations were reviewed retrospectively. MRI led to the diagnoses of bilateral perisylvian syndrome, hemimegalencephaly, focal polymicrogyria, band-heterotopia, and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). Interictal SPECT did not reveal hypoperfusion in any case of polymicrogyria. Ictal SPECT images revealed hyperperfusion of the lesion in three patients with polymicrogyria, with accompanying hyperperfusion of the basal ganglia in two of the three patients. On the other hand, interictal SPECT images demonstrated hypoperfusion of the lesion in four patients with FCD. Ictal SPECT images revealed hypoperfusion of the lesion in two patients, hyperperfusion of the lesion in one patient, and hypoperfusion of the basal ganglia in two patients with FCD. This difference in perfusion between polymicrogyria and FCD observed in this study may reflect histologically different characteristics. This relative hyperperfusion of the cortex and the basal ganglia observed on ictal SPECT, which was found in two polymicrogyria patients with complex partial seizures and partial seizures evolving to secondary generalized seizures, respectively, suggests that the cortical-subcortical interaction is related to the mechanism of loss of consciousness or seizure generation.
