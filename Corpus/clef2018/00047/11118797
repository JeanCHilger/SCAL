Single-photon emission computed tomography of the brain in autism: effect of the developmental level. Brain single-photon emission computed tomography was performed in 22 autistic and 10 nonautistic disabled patients. The regional cerebral blood flow in both laterotemporal and dorso-medio-lateral frontal areas decreased significantly in the autistic group compared with in nonautistic group. In the autistic group, the regional cerebral blood flow was significantly higher in the right temporal and right parietal lobes than that in the left ones. Inversely, the regional cerebral blood flow in the frontal and occipital lobes was significantly higher on the left side than on the right side. In the nonautistic group, except for in the dorso-medio-lateral frontal lobes (left > right), there was no difference in the regional cerebral blood flow in either cerebrum or cerebellum. A positive correlationship between regional cerebral flow and development quotient (intelligence quotient) was observed in the left laterotemporal and both dorso-medio-lateral frontal areas, and a negative one was observed in the cerebellar vermis area. These results suggest that the regional cerebral blood flow decrease in the temporal and frontal areas relates to not only the brain mechanism of autism reported previously but also intelligence levels.
