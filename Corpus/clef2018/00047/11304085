Perfusion brain SPECT and statistical parametric mapping analysis indicate that apathy is a cingulate syndrome: a study in Alzheimer's disease and nondemented patients. Apathy is the most frequent behavioral symptom in Alzheimer's disease and is also frequently reported in other brain organic disorders occurring in the elderly. Based on the literature, we hypothesized that apathy was related to an anterior cingulate hypofunction. Forty-one subjects were studied. According to ICD 10 diagnostic criteria, 28 patients had Alzheimer dementia (demented: diagnostic group 1), and 13 had organic personality disorders or mild cognitive impairment not attributable to dementia (nondemented: diagnostic group 2). Apathy was evaluated by the Neuro-Psychiatric Inventory. As a result each diagnostic group was divided into two symptomatic subgroups: apathetic or nonapathetic. Brain perfusion was measured by (99m)Tc-labeled bicisate (ECD) brain SPECT and the images were compared using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM96). We began by comparing apathetic vs nonapathetic patients, whatever their diagnostic group (whole population), then analyzed them within each group. Twenty-one subjects were apathetic (14 in group 1 and 7 in group 2) and 20 were not (14 in group 1 and 6 in group 2). For the whole population, the Z map showed a significant decrease in ECD uptake for the apathetic patients in the anterior cingulate (P < 0.002) bilaterally. This area was also identified as hypoactive by SPM analysis in the demented (P < 0.035) and in the nondemented (P < 0.02) apathetic patient groups. Finally, conjunction analysis indicated that the anterior cingulate was the common hypoactive structure of the two apathetic subgroups (Z = 4.35, P < 0.0009). These results point to a close relationship between apathy and the anterior cingulate region.
