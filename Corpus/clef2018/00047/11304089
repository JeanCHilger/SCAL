Estimation of regional cerebral blood flow distribution in infants by near-infrared topography using indocyanine green. Near-infrared topography with indocyanine green was used to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the temporal lobes of infants. The mean rCBF in infants without neural abnormality was 14.5 +/- 3.1 ml/100 g/min, and the rCBFs in the fronto-temporal, temporal, and occipito-temporal regions were 15.1 +/- 3.9, 15.4 +/- 3.3, and 14.6 +/- 3.3 ml/100 g/min, respectively. Moreover, in one asphyxiated infant with infarction and one infant with subdural and intracerebellar hemorrhage, it was demonstrated that the area of defective blood flow could be detected as well as it can by SPECT. This technique makes it possible to estimate rCBF distribution in infants at the bedside. Thus, in the future, evaluation of various neonatal illnesses should be feasible.
