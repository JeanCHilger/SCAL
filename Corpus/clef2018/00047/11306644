Functional anatomy of nonvisual feedback loops during reaching: a positron emission tomography study. Reaching movements performed without vision of the moving limb are continuously monitored, during their execution, by feedback loops (designated nonvisual). In this study, we investigated the functional anatomy of these nonvisual loops using positron emission tomography (PET). Seven subjects had to "look at" (eye) or "look and point to" (eye-arm) visual targets whose location either remained stationary or changed undetectably during the ocular saccade (when vision is suppressed). Slightly changing the target location during gaze shift causes an increase in the amount of correction to be generated. Functional anatomy of nonvisual feedback loops was identified by comparing the reaching condition involving large corrections (jump) with the reaching condition involving small corrections (stationary), after subtracting the activations associated with saccadic movements and hand movement planning [(eye-arm-jumping minus eye-jumping) minus (eye-arm-stationary minus eye-stationary)]. Behavioral data confirmed that the subjects were both accurate at reaching to the stationary targets and able to update their movement smoothly and early in response to the target jump. PET difference images showed that these corrections were mediated by a restricted network involving the left posterior parietal cortex, the right anterior intermediate cerebellum, and the left primary motor cortex. These results are consistent with our knowledge of the functional properties of these areas and more generally with models emphasizing parietal-cerebellar circuits for processing a dynamic motor error signal.
