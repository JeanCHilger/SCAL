Comparison of [(18)F]altanserin and [(18)F]deuteroaltanserin for PET imaging of serotonin(2A) receptors in baboon brain: pharmacological studies. The regional distribution in brain, distribution volumes, and pharmacological specificity of the PET 5-HT(2A) receptor radiotracer [(18)F]deuteroaltanserin were evaluated and compared to those of its non-deuterated derivative [(18)F]altanserin. Both radiotracers were administered to baboons by bolus plus constant infusion and PET images were acquired up to 8 h. The time-activity curves for both tracers stabilized between 4 and 6 h. The ratio of total and free parent to metabolites was not significantly different between radiotracers nevertheless, total cortical R(T) (equilibrium ratio of specific to nondisplaceable brain uptake) was significantly higher (34-78%) for [(18)F]deuteroaltanserin than for [(18)F]altanserin. In contrast, the binding potential (Bmax/K(D)) was similar between radiotracers. [(18)F]Deuteroaltanserin cortical activity was displaced by the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist SR 46349B but was not altered by changes in endogenous 5-HT induced by fenfluramine. These findings suggest that [(18)F]deuteroaltanserin is essentially equivalent to [(18)F]altanserin for 5-HT(2A) receptor imaging in the baboon.
