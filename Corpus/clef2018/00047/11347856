Cerebral perfusion in hypertensive patients: effects of lacidipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Previous studies have shown areas of cerebral hypoperfusion in the frontal and parietal lobes of asymptomatic hypertensives, in the absence of extracranial carotid artery stenosis. The aims of the present study were: (a) to correlate the presence of focal cortical hypoperfusion with the presence of white matter lesions (WML), lacunae and extracranial carotid artery stenosis and (b) to compare the effects on cerebral perfusion of the dihydropyridine calcium entry blocker lacidipine and of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in hypertensive patients with carotid artery stenosis. Forty-one patients (30 males, aged 40-75) with mild to moderate essential hypertension and with negative history for cerebrovascular diseases were investigated. Twenty-four had normal extracranial carotid arteries at echo-colourDoppler examination, while 17 had at least one 50-70% stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA). At computed tomography (CT) scan, five patients had one or more lacunar infarctions, four WML, three lacunar infarctions and WML, and 26 a normal CT scan. Three, with old cortical infarctions, were excluded from further analysis. The prevalence of lesions was significantly higher among the patients with carotid artery stenosis (44% vs. 29%
