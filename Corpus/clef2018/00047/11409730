Dispositional pessimism and amygdala activity: a PET study in healthy volunteers. The present study used scores from Seligman's Attribution Style Questionnaire and [15O] water positron emission tomographic measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) to investigate the relation between individual differences in dispositional pessimism and amygdala activity. During scanning 13 healthy non-snake-phobic females passively viewed a snake videotape. Using one-tailed tests, significant negative correlations were evident between pessimism scores, with low scores reflecting relatively more pessimism, and right (r=-0.60 p=0.014) and left amygdala rCBF (r=-0.53
