Dopamine transporter density and novelty seeking among alcoholics. The aim of this study was to investigate a putative association between the personality trait of novelty seeking (NS) and dopaminergic neuronal activity in the human brain.We studied the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) density of 30 (18 early and 12 late-onset) alcoholics and 26 healthy controls with beta-CIT ([123I]-2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-iodophenyl)-tropane) and SPET (Single Photon Emission Tomography) personality traits were assessed with the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ).DAT density correlated significantly with both NS (r = 0.46, p = 0.011) and age (r = -0.50, p = 0.005) in the alcoholics, generally. NS scores were higher in alcoholics with antisocial personality disorder (p = 0.004) than among other alcoholics.Among alcoholics, NS correlated positively with DAT density, which is in line with Cloninger's theory concerning personality and character.
