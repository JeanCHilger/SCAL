Brain injury: analysis of imaging modalities. Advances in imaging have had a significant impact not only on the diagnosis of but also on the management of patients with brain injury. Various modalities are available to image the brain however, it is not always clear which imaging modality (CT, MRI, SPECT, PET, etc.) is optimal for a specific aspect of traumatized brain. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the over 20,000 imaging studies done in brain injury and to compare the results with the experience in the literature. A detailed comparison has been done relative to CT, MRI, SPECT and PET in traumatic brain injury.
