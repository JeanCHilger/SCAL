Ferret orthopedics. Orthopedic conditions requiring surgical intervention and correction frequently occur in the ferret patient. Elbow luxations and long bone fractures are among the most common syndromes affecting the ferret patient, which often presents in an emergency setting. Orthopedic conditions in the ferret, as in other mammalian species, are often the result of trauma. Surgical treatment including reduction and stabilization of the affected bony structure, combined with supervision and the recommended postoperative care, can provide a good prognosis to return to normal function for the ferret.
