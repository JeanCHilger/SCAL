Optimization technique for a Prompt Gamma-ray SPECT collimator system. Because background radiation in an irradiation room creates a problem with the PG-SPECT (Prompt Gamma-ray Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) system, which evaluates the absorbed dose for the Boron Neutron Capture Therapy treatment, optimization of a collimator system was performed while taking the shielding of background gamma-rays into consideration. Assuming that a parallel-beam collimator is used, three parameters--the diameter of a hole, the length of the collimator, and the number of detectors (the number of holes of the collimator)--were selected for optimization. Because the combinations of these parameters are limitless, it is difficult to determine them simultaneously. Therefore, a statistically derived Optimization Criterion has been proposed to optimize these parameters. When the spatial resolution was 1 cm-FWHM (full width at half maximum), the optimal diameter of the collimator was 5.4 mm, the optimal length was 321 mm, and the optimal number of detectors was 31 x 31.
