Pheochromocytoma. The only definitive therapy for patients with pheochromocytoma is surgical resection [1,2**]. Advances in preoperative medical management of hypertension/hypovolemia and improved intraoperative anesthetic care have reduced the operative mortality rate for pheochromocytoma to less than 5% in most series. In addition, accurate preoperative localization studies have eliminated the need for extensive exploratory laparotomy. Focused approach and laparoscopic resection have become the new "gold standard," with a reduced morbidity [4**]. Large or locally invasive pheochromocytomas may still require open resection.
