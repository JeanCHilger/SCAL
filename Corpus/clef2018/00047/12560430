Whole body 18FDG-PET and the response of esophageal cancer to induction therapy: results of a prospective trial. Whole-body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging before and after induction therapy was prospectively evaluated in patients with esophageal cancer to determine whether changes in PET images could measure response to therapy.Between April 1997 and April 1999, 39 patients (34 men and five women median age, 59 yearsPET after standard staging studies and before therapy imaged undetected sites of metastatic disease in six patients (15%). Restaging (including PET) after induction therapy did not identify any patients with disease progression or any patients with loco-regionally unresectable disease at exploration. The median decrease in the standardized uptake value (SUV) during induction therapy was 59%. After R0 esophagectomy, the 2-year disease-free and overall survival was 38% and 63%, respectively, among patients who had a less than 60% decrease in SUV, and 67% and 89%, respectively, among patients who had a greater than 60% decrease in SUV (P =.055 and P =.088, respectively).Compared with conventional imaging, PET detects additional sites of metastatic disease at initial evaluation. After induction therapy, PET did not add to the estimation of loco-regional resectability and did not detect new distant metastases. However, changes in [18F]FDG PET may predict disease-free and overall survival after induction therapy and resection in patients with esophageal cancer. Further evaluation in larger trials is warranted.
