Application of SPECT bone scan for multiple myeloma. To study the diagnostic value of SPECT for multiple myeloma (MM).Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) bone scan, marrow puncturing, x-ray and other related examinations were performed in 46 patients with MM. We analysed the diagnostic value of SPECT bone scan combined with marrow puncturing and other examinations for MM. Some patients were examined with SPECT bone scan in order to estimate the efficacy of MM.SPECT bone scan images of 44 patients were abnormal in the 46 patients with MM. The masculine rate was 95.6%. In most of the patients, there was multiple abnormal osseous metabolism in the whole body, especially in the spine, double ribs, and pelvis. We observed the efficacy of 2 patients with SPECT bone scan. After the therapy, SPECT bone scan was performed again in 1 patient, and the image showed that the range of abnormal osseous metabolism was reduced SPECT bone scan was performed again in the other patient, and the abnormal range was found to have increased obviously.SPECT bone scan is one of the important assistant examination methods for MM. Its sensitivity is high. The nuclear medical diagnoses should be combined with clinical documents. SPECT bone scan might be available for monitoring the efficacy of MM.
