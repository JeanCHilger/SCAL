Correlates of myocardial oxygen demand measured by positron emission tomography in the hypertrophied left ventricle. The aim of this study was to identify the best correlate of myocardial oxygen demand (MVO(2)) in patients with hypertension induced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and to examine whether relationships between these surrogates and MVO(2) differed between patients with LVH and control subjects.We measured MVO(2) by positron emission tomography using carbon-11 acetate in 20 patients and 10 normotensive control subjects, and compared the relationships between commonly used surrogates and MVO(2).With the exception of diastolic blood pressure, the same variables correlated with resting MVO(2) in the patients and control subjects.The best correlate of resting MVO(2) in the patients with hypertension induced LVH was the stress-mass-heart rate product.
