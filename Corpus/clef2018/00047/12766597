Prediction of functional recovery after coronary bypass surgery using quantitative gated myocardial perfusion SPECT. Previous studies have demonstrated that myocardial perfusion imaging using 99mTc-tetrofosmin at rest allows viability assessment similar to that obtained with 201Tl imaging and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET). The simultaneous assessment of perfusion and regional function is now available by quantitative gated myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). This study was designed to evaluate the utility of quantitative values of wall motion and wall thickening, calculated by quantitative gated myocardial perfusion SPECT, for the prediction of functional recovery after coronary bypass grafting (CABG). Fifty-six patients with coronary artery disease scheduled for CABG were included prospectively. All patients underwent 99mTc-tetrofosmin gated SPECT imaging at rest preoperatively and 3 months after CABG. The myocardium was divided into nine segments and the average quantitative values of regional perfusion (percentage uptake) (%), wall motion (mm) and wall thickening (%) were determined automatically using quantitative gated SPECT (QGS) software. The wall motion score was defined visually using a four-point scale (0, normal 3, akinesis), and segments with severe asynergy (score of 2 or 3) with patent grafts were assessed. Of 77 segments with severe asynergy, 56 segments showed improved wall motion and 21 segments did not improve after CABG. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of wall thickening for the prediction of functional recovery was significantly higher (0.92) than that of the percentage uptake (0.77, P<0.017) or wall motion (0.60, P<0.0001). When each analysis used the optimal threshold, the wall thickening analysis (>or=10%) had a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 81%. These values tended to be higher than those of the percentage uptake (sensitivity, 86%
