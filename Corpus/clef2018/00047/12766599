Persistent vegetative state: evaluation of brain metabolism and brain perfusion with PET and SPECT. Patients in persistent vegetative state (PVS) after severe head trauma were investigated with 99mTc-ECD SPECT and 18F-FDG PET to further characterize the degree of brain damage and to obtain insight into changes of brain perfusion and glucose metabolism. 18F-FDG PET and 99mTc-ECD SPECT were performed in 16 patients in PVS. Quantitative PET data were compared with that obtained from seven normal controls. After spatial normalization into Talairach space, global grey matter values and regional data using predefined ROI sets were derived. For comparison of PET and SPECT, regional data were normalized to their individual mean grey matter values. Patients in PVS showed significantly lower values of cerebral glucose metabolism than did the controls. The mean reduction of grey matter values in cortical and subcortical structures was 58%, except in the vermis cerebelli, where only a reduction of 16% was found compared to the controls. Comparing the glucose metabolism and perfusion within the patient group, the pattern of both modalities was similar in the neocortex and internal ganglia. In the cerebellar hemispheres a relatively higher perfusion than glucose metabolism was found. The overall reduction of 58% of glucose metabolism in grey matter structures is in accordance with other PET studies investigating PVS patients with different disease histories. The relative preserved activity of vermis cerebelli seems to be an uncommon finding not described by other authors up to now.
