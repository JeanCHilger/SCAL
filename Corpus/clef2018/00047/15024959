Positron emission tomography imaging of the aging brain. PET imaging provides a vital means to study the human brain in vivo in aging and early disease states. PET studies using selective markers for brain metabolism and neurotransmitter function have uncovered a wealth of information on healthy and pathologic brain aging, and its relationship to behavior and mood states. Recognition of inherent potential confounds in the use of PET in aging studies is essential to the proper interpretation of these data.
