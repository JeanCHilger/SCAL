Synthesis and characterization of zinc sensors based on a monosubstituted fluorescein platform. The synthesis of a new fluorescein carboxaldehyde asymmetrically substituted on the xanthene (top) ring is reported. This molecule is a key precursor for two of three monofunctionally derivatized fluorescein-based Zn(II) sensors presented in this work. Detailed preparative routes to, and photophysical characterization of, these sensors are described. The sensors are based on the previously reported ZP4 motif (Burdette, S. C. Frederickson, C. J.
