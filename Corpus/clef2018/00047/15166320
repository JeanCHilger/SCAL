Acute myocardial infarction: evaluation with first-pass enhancement and delayed enhancement MR imaging compared with 201Tl SPECT imaging. To evaluate acute myocardial infarction by using first-pass enhancement (FPE) and delayed enhancement (DE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging compared with thallium 201 ((201)Tl) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Contrast material-enhanced FPE MR, inversion-recovery DE MR, and rest-redistribution (201)Tl SPECT images were obtained in 60 consecutive patients (53 men, seven women mean age [+/- SD], 56 years +/- 13Mean infarct size was not significantly different between DE MR imaging (20.7% +/- 11.5% of LV area) and (201)Tl SPECT (19.4% +/- 14.3% of LV area P =.26)Good correlation and agreement with (201)Tl SPECT indicate DE MR imaging may be used to estimate infarct size 6 days after reperfused acute myocardial infarction. DE MR imaging is more sensitive for detection of inferior infarction than is (201)Tl SPECT. Patients with microvascular obstruction on FPE MR images have larger infarcts.
