Crossed cerebellar hypoperfusion in unilateral major cerebral artery occlusive disorders. We evaluated regional blood flow and oxygen metabolism in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices of 15 patients with unilateral major cerebral artery occlusive disorders with PET. These patients showed a cortical blood flow asymmetry in middle cerebral artery distribution. Only subcortical abnormalities were detected on computed tomography. Nine patients showed crossed cerebellar hypoperfusion, a reduction in contralateral cerebellar blood flow, while six did not. No difference in the degree of cerebral blood flow asymmetry existed between the two patient groups. However, oxygen metabolism asymmetry was more pronounced and was more closely matched to blood flow asymmetry in patients with crossed cerebellar hypoperfusion. These findings suggest that a major cause of cerebral cortical blood flow reduction is reduced metabolic demand in patients with crossed cerebellar hypoperfusion. Crossed cerebellar hypoperfusion may have clinical significance as a reflection of the cerebral metabolic state on blood flow images.
