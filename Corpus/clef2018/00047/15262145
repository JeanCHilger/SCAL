Detection of recurrent cervical cancer by whole-body FDG PET scan in asymptomatic and symptomatic women. To determine the ability of whole-body [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan to detect recurrent cervical carcinoma in both symptomatic and asymptomatic women.We retrospectively reviewed the records of 44 women previously treated for cervical cancer who underwent 47 posttreatment whole-body FDG PET scans in an attempt to detect recurrent disease. Twenty-six scans were performed in asymptomatic women, whereas 21 scans were performed in women with symptoms suggestive of recurrence.About 30.8% of asymptomatic women had recurrent disease detected by PET scan compared to 66.7% of women in the symptomatic group. The sensitivity of PET scan for recurrent disease in asymptomatic women was 80.0%, specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 88.9%. For symptomatic women, the sensitivity of PET was 100%, specificity of 85.7%, a positive predictive value of 93.3%, and a negative predictive value of 100%.The whole-body FDG PET scan is a sensitive imaging modality for the detection of recurrent cervical carcinoma in both symptomatic and asymptomatic women.
