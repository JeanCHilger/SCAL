Treatment for patients with early Parkinson's disease. Ad hoc committee of Japanese Neurological Society made a guideline for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in 2002. Based on the chapter of treatment for early Parkinson's disease, starting drugs were discussed in this article. Three points should be considered in initiating the drug treatment, that is, neuroprotection, motor complications, and side effects. In order to demonstrate neuroprotection of dopamine agonists by using neuroimaging techniques, CALM-PD CIT study (pramipexole) and REAL-PET study (ropinirole) were done. There are, however, many controversies concerning neuroprotection and no definite conclusion was drawn. On the contrary, the inhibitory effects of dopamine agonists on the appearance of motor complications were clearly elucidated by several large-scale studies. For the present, although the side effects were reported more frequently in those treated by dopamine agonists than by levodopa, starting the treatment by dopamine agonists were recommended except in patients with dementia and in elderly patients, for whom levodopa should be used first.
