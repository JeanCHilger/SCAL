Relation between effects of adenosine on brachial artery reactivity and perfusion pattern in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. This study examined the changes in brachial artery diameter and flow velocity in response to intravenous adenosine and compared the results to cuff occlusion and single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) images. The change in diameter was less with adenosine than with cuff occlusion. There was no correlation between the presence of abnormal SPECT images and the responses to adenosine or cuff occlusion in either diameter or flow velocity.
