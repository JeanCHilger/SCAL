18F-labeled sufentanil for PET-imaging of mu-opioid receptors. The synthesis of an (18)F-labeled sufentanil analogue with apparent high mu-opioid receptor selectivity is reported. Intravenous injection of N-[4-(methoxymethyl)-1-[2-(2-thienyl)ethyl]-4-piperidinyl]-N-phenyl-2-(+/-)-[(18)F]fluoropropan-amide in mice resulted in high brain uptake and a regional brain activity distribution corresponding to the mu-opioid receptor expression pattern. The developed ligand is a promising tracer for extended protocols in mu-opioid receptor mapping and quantitation with positron emission tomography.
