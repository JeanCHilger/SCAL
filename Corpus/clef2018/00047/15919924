18F]FHPG positron emission tomography for detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in experimental HSV encephaliti. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is one of the most common causes of sporadic encephalitis. The initial clinical course of HSV encephalitis (HSE) is highly variable, and the infection may be rapidly fatal. For effective treatment with antiviral medication, an early diagnosis of HSE is crucial. Subtle brain infections with HSV may be causally related to neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's dementia. We investigated the feasibility of a noninvasive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique using [(18)F]FHPG as a tracer for the detection of HSE. For this purpose, rats received HSV-1 (infected group) or phosphate-buffered saline (control group) by intranasal application, and dynamic PET scans were acquired. In addition, the distribution of tracer accumulation in specific brain areas was studied with phosphor storage imaging. The PET images revealed that the overall brain uptake of [(18)F]FHPG was significantly higher for the infected group than for control animals. Phosphor storage images showed an enhanced accumulation of [(18)F]FHPG in regions known to be affected after intranasal infection with HSV. High-performance liquid chromatography metabolite analysis showed phosphorylated metabolites of [(18)F]FHPG in infected brains, proving that the increased [(18)F]FHPG uptake in infected brains was due to HSV thymidine kinase-mediated trapping. Freeze lesion experiments showed that damage to the blood-brain barrier could in principle induce elevated [(18)F]FHPG uptake, but this nonspecific tracer uptake could easily be discriminated from HSE-derived uptake by differences in the tracer kinetics. Our results show that [(18)F]FHPG PET is a promising tool for the detection of HSV encephalitis.
