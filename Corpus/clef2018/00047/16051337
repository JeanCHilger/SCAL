Exclusion of lung metastases in placental site trophoblastic tumor using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography: a case report. We present the first case using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) for the evaluation of multiple lung nodules in a woman with placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) and history of pulmonary tuberculosis.PSTT was diagnosed by endometrial biopsy in a 38-year-old female, 11 months after an abortion. She had received medical treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis 8 years ago. Nodular lung lesions in upper and lower lung fields were noted on the chest X-ray and computed tomography, which was not shown on PET. She then received hysterectomy and complete remission of serum beta-hCG titer with stationary lung lesions in follow-up images were noticed thereafter.PET, as adjuvant study to conventional images, may help in the differentiation of chest lesions in PSTT.
