Relationships between changes of coronary blood flow, energy metabolism of the myocardium, and hyperinsulinemia in patients with ischemic heart disease. The paper reviews current data on relationships between coronary blood flow, hemodynamics, and myocardial energy metabolism during phenomena of stunned and hibernating myocardium in patients with ischemic heart disease. These data has been obtained with various modern techniques including positron emission tomography with (18)F-flourodeoxyglucose, (11)C-palmitate and (11)C-acetate. Possible association of remodeling of cardiac energetic metabolism under conditions of chronic ischemia and hyperinsulinemia in patients at various stages of ischemic heart disease is interpreted as compensatory reaction to elevation of myocardial glucose requirements.
