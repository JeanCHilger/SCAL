Positron emission tomography (PET)--current state of the art and future perspectives. Over the last years, PET has developed rapidly, with the most relevant indications being in oncologic imaging. Particularly since the introduction of PET-CT it is suggested that PET will become the imaging standard in oncologic staging and therapy monitoring in the near future in many tumors. This is due to the fact that PET measures molecular events such as glucose uptake and metabolism rather than anatomical changes. Despite this, anatomical information is frequently relevant for precise staging: hence, PET in the form of PET-CT is rapidly becoming the preferred way of imaging. In 2004, there were around 8000 PET examinations performed in Switzerland. A steady further increase is expected with around 2000 to 3000 PET examinations necessary per one million inhabitants per year. Other indications for PET are in neuro-, cardio- and inflammation imaging with substantial growth potential in all fields. The next promising clinical application of PET-CT may well be integrated PET-CT of the heart for the representation of coronary anatomy combined with quantitative myocardial perfusion as "cardiac-one-stop-shop".
