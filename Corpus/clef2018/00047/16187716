Retrospective study of owners' perception on home monitoring of blood glucose in diabetic dogs and cats. Home monitoring of blood glucose (HMBG) concentrations has been recommended in the monitoring of human diabetics for 3 decades. During the last number of years, it also gained popularity in long-term follow-up of diabetic cats and dogs. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the practical feasibility of and identify the major problems encountered with HMBG in diabetic pets. A standard questionnaire was filled in by owners of 9 diabetic pets monitored with HMBG. The need for more than 1 puncture to obtain a blood drop, the creation of a sufficient blood drop, the need for assistance in restraining the pet, and the resistance of the pet were the most frequently encountered problems during HMBG. The major obstacles for the owners to start with HMBG were also identified. In conclusion, HMBG is a practical and simple technique for most owners and, overall, owners were satisfied.
