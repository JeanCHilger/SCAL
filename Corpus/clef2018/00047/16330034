The influence of hepatic lipase C-480T polymorphism on coronary flow reserve in young men is independent of the plasma cholesterol level. The hepatic lipase (HL) gene C-480T promoter polymorphism affects gene transcription and enzyme activity and leads to CC, CT, and TT genotypes. Recently, HL expression was detected in macrophages. It has been postulated that HL might have a direct role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis without changes in the plasma profile. We hypothesized that the difference of plasma cholesterol level may not influence the effect of HL genotype on coronary reactivity.A total of 108 young men (aged 34+/-5 years) were genotyped and divided into three groups. These groups contained 45, 49 and 14 men having either normal (4.9+/-1.2 mmol/L), mildly (5.5+/-0.8 mmol/L) or severely (7.8+/-1.9 mmol/L, subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia) elevated mean plasma cholesterol level, respectively. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was measured at rest and during adenosine or dipyridamole-induced hyperemia with positron emission tomography using [(15)O] H(2)O.The effect of HL genotype on the indices of MBF was parallel within all cholesterol groups and therefore they were combined. In all subjects, basal flow did not differ between the genotypes. However, men with CC genotype had a significantly higher hyperemic blood flow (3.86+/-1.26 mLg(-1)min(-1) versus 3.20+/-1.38 mLg(-1)min(-1), p=0.007), higher coronary flow reserve (CFR, 4.80+/-1.77 versus 3.77+/-1.43, p=0.001) and lower coronary resistance during hyperemia (25.63+/-9.98 mmHg min g mL(-1) versus 35.00+/-23.95 mmHg min g mL(-1), p=0.003) than T allele carriers. In multivariate regression analysis, after adjustment for age, body mass index, serum lipids, blood pressure, adenosine or dipyridamole administration, and study group, HL polymorphism was an independent predictor of blood flow during hyperemia (p=0.016), coronary resistance (p=0.014), and CFR (p=0.005), respectively.The HL C-480 T polymorphism is associated with CFR, which is an early indicator of atherosclerosis, independently of the level of plasma cholesterol in young men.
