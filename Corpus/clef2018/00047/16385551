Therapeutic doses of amphetamine or methylphenidate differentially increase synaptic and extracellular dopamine. Methylphenidate (MP) and amphetamine (AMP) are first-line treatments for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Although both drugs have similar therapeutic potencies, the stimulatory effect of AMP on extracellular dopamine (ECF DA) is greater than that of MP. We compared extracellular effects directly against synaptic changes. ECF DA was assessed by microdialysis in freely moving rodents and synaptic dopamine (DA) was measured using PET and [11C]-raclopride displacement in rodents and baboons. Microdialysis data demonstrated that MP (5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) increased ECF DA 360% +/- 31% in striatum, which was significantly less than that by AMP (2.5 mg/kg, i.p. 1398% +/- 272%). This fourfold difference was not reflected by changes in synaptic DA. In fact, rodent PET studies showed no difference in striatal [11C]-raclopride binding induced by AMP (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.
