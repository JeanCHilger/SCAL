In vivo quantification of serotonin transporters using [(11)C]DASB and positron emission tomography in humans: modeling considerations. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) in the human brain are increasingly using the radioligand [(11)C]N, N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-cyanophenylthio) benzylamine. A variety of models have been applied to such data in several published articles however to date, these models have not been validated with test-retest data. We recruited 11 healthy subjects and conducted two identical scans on each subject on the same day. We considered four different models (one- and two-tissue compartment kinetic models, likelihood estimation in graphical analysis (LEGA
