Effectiveness of peritoneal dialysis. In the last few years, an increasing number of patients suffering from terminal renal disease of various leading causes was treated with renal replacement therapy. Peritonaeal dialysis involves an exchange of water and solutes between blood in the peritonaeal capillaries and dialysate in the peritonaeal cavum throughout the peritonaeum. Effective dialysis treatment should provide good quality of life, decrease the number of physical complaints, and bring the incidence of morbidity and mortality closer to the incidence of morbidity and mortality in the healthy population.The aim of this study was the evaluation of peritonaeal transport characteristics and dialysis effectiveness in 58 patients affected by terminal renal disease who underwent peritonaeal dialysis treatment during August 2003 at the Clinic of Nephrology of the Clinical Centre of Serbia.We examined 30 male and 28 female patients, with an average age of 52 years (range 26 to 78 years). The average duration of peritoneal dialysis treatment was 20 months (ranging from 2 to 66 months), and the end-stage renal failure was caused by different leading disease in our patients. We applied different dialysis modalities: continuous ambulatory peritonaeal dialysis (CAPD) with three to five 2- or 3-litre exchanges daily, cyclic peritonaeal dialysis (CCPD), intermittent peritonaeal dialysis (IPD), or automatic peritonaeal dialysis (APD), according to the transport characteristics of the peritonaeal membrane, the residual renal function (RRF), and the clinical status of the patients, in order to perform adequate depuration as suggested by the new international criteria. A peritonaeal equilibrium test (PET) was performed according to the new international advice urea and creatinine clearances (Kt/V and Ccr) as well as RRF were calculated using the internationally suggested formulas.Most of our patients received effective dialysis treatment, thanks to the modulation of number, volume, and timing of exchanges.Adequate dialysis improved blood count, nutritional status, and quality of life in our patients, while reducing the incidence of infection to a significant degree.
