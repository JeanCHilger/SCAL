Common procedures and concerns with wildlife. Wildlife patients have special needs compared with pet patients in regard to handling and restraint, the importance of the stress response, physical examination, and neonatal concerns. Because many wildlife patients present with wounds and fractures, a good understanding of the pathophysiology of these processes is also important. The primary goal of all wildlife rehabilitation procedures is the ultimate release of the animal back into its natural environment.
