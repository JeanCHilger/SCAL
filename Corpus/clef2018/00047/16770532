Molecular targeting of the lymphovascular system for imaging and therapy. Progress toward targeting cancer cells is a multi-disciplinary endeavor. In addition to the surgical and oncology specialties, radiologists collaborate with mathematicians, computer scientists, and physicists, in a constant effort to incrementally improve upon the current imaging modalities. Recently, radiologists have formed collaborations with molecular biologists and chemists in order to develop molecular agents that target cancer cells via receptor-substrate or specific physiochemical interactions. In this review, we summarize selected efforts toward molecular targeting of the lymphovascular system. Standard imaging modalities, positron emission tomography, single photon emission tomography, and ultrasound, are reviewed as well as, the targeted introduction of substances for endolymphatic therapy. We also review the current status of sentinel lymph node mapping with radiocolloids and the application of molecular targeting for the development of a radiopharmaceutical specifically designed for sentinel lymph node mapping.
