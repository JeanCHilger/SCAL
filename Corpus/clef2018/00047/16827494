Incorporation of system resolution compensation (RC) in the ordered-subset transmission (OSTR) algorithm for transmission imaging in SPECT. In order to reconstruct attenuation maps with improved spatial resolution and quantitative accuracy, we developed an approximate method of incorporating system resolution compensation (RC) in the ordered-subset transmission (OSTR) algorithm for transmission reconstruction. Our method approximately models the blur caused by the finite intrinsic detector resolution, the nonideal source collimation and detector collimation. We derived the formulation using the optimization transfer principle as in the derivation of the OSTR algorithm. The formulation includes one forward-blur step and one back-blur step, which do not severely slow down reconstruction. The formulation could be applicable to various transmission geometries, such as point-source, line-source, and sheet-source systems. Through computer simulations of the MCAT phantom and transmission measurements of the air-filled Data Spectrum Deluxe single photo emission computed tomography (SPECT) Phantom on a system which employed a cone-beam geometry and a system which employed a scanning-line-source geometry, we showed that incorporation of RC increased spatial resolution and improved the quantitative accuracy of reconstruction. In simulation studies, attenuation maps reconstructed with RC correction improved the quantitative accuracy of emission reconstruction.
