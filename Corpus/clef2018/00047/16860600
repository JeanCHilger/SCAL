Vascular prostheses with controlled release of antibiotics Part 1: Surface modification with cyclodextrins of PET prostheses. Vascular prostheses were functionalised with the aim to obtain a slow release of antibiotics in order to reduce postoperative infections. The original process that we present in this paper is based on the use of a family of cage molecules named cyclodextrins (CD). These compounds have the ability to form reversible inclusion complexes with drugs such as antibiotics. The aim of this work was to graft CD onto the prosthesis, so that an antibiotic can be bound on it by this inclusion phenomenon, and then be progressively released over a prolonged period by a complex dissociation mechanism. This paper presents the first part of this research program and concerns mainly the study of the functionalization parameters. It presents surface characterization results of the modified prostheses. The PET prostheses were immersed into a solution containing a cross linking agent, cyclodextrins (beta-CD, gamma-CD, HP-beta-CD and HP-gamma-CD) and a catalyst and were padded. Grafting occurred by the mean of a thermofixation step at a temperature comprised between 140 and 180 degrees C. It was observed that the support was permanently modified when the CD polymer that coated the fibres resisted to the final washing process. Grafting rates of 12 wt% in CD polymer could be reached. It was also observed that the fibre coating reaction induced an increase of the permeability of the grafts.
