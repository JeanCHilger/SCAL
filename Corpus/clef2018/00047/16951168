Redistribution of nucleoside transporters to the cell membrane provides a novel approach for imaging thymidylate synthase inhibition by positron emission tomography. Thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45) is a key enzyme for the de novo synthesis of DNA and as such a target for anticancer drug development. There is a need to develop noninvasive methods for assessing thymidylate synthase inhibition in tumors. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ([(18)F]FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) for early measurement of thymidylate synthase inhibition and to elucidate the cellular mechanisms involved. Radiation-induced fibrosarcoma-1 tumor-bearing mice were injected with a single i.p. dose of the thymidylate synthase inhibitor 5-fluorouracil (5-FU 165 mg/kg) and imaged by [(18)F]FLT-PET at 1 to 2 hours after treatment.
