Late relapse of metastatic non-seminomatous testicular germ cell tumours. Although the majority of men presenting with non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCT) are cured, late relapse (occurring more than 2 years after obtaining a complete response to treatment) is increasingly recognized. The typical patterns of disease spread have been well-documented, but the findings at late relapse are more variable and less well-described. We discuss the phenomenon of late relapse, the characteristics of teratoma differentiated (TD), and the issue of long-term imaging surveillance of patients with NSGCT. The potential sites of late relapse of NSGCT and the associated spectrum of imaging appearances are illustrated.
