Experience with the use of positron emission tomography (PET) in Mexico. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a non-invasive imaging diagnostic tool that allows the study of specific biochemical processes using labeled molecules that closely mimic endogenous molecules. The two radiopharmaceuticals used in our facility are 13N-Ammonia and 18F-2-deoxy-2 fluor D-glucose (18F-FDG). 18F-FDG is the most common radiopharmaceutical used both at our Unit as well as worldwide, as it allows the study of tumor activity, the heart's metabolic activity, distinguish viable from non-viable myocardium and assess cerebral metabolism, among others.Describe the experience in the use of PET scan in our country in the fields of oncology, cardiology and neuropsychiatry.We performed an observational, retrospective, cross-sectional, and descriptive study.We analyzed a total of 1,154 studies performed at the UNAM-PET-Cyclotron Unit belonging to the Faculty of Medicine at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). From the studies, 72.1% (832) corresponded to oncology, whereas 18.5% (213) and 9.4% (109) belonged to cardiology and neuropsychiatry, respectively.The studies performed at the UNAM-PET-Cyclotron Unit places it as the site with the largest PET experience in our country.
