Creatine supplementation in Parkinson disease: a placebo-controlled randomized pilot trial. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD). Creatine (Cr) is an ergogenic compound that exerts neuroprotective effects in animal models of PD. We conducted a 2-year placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial on the effect of Cr in 60 patients with PD. Cr improved patient mood and led to a smaller dose increase of dopaminergic therapy but had no effect on overall Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores or dopamine transporter SPECT.
