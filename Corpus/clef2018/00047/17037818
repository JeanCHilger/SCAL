The stroke variables assessment as a prognostic factor for post-stroke depression with the emphasis on the cerebral SPECT regional blood flow asymmetry. The aim of this paper was to assess the risk for depression in a 6-month-long post stroke follow up period as related to the stroke variables (i.e. stroke localisation, haemodynamic parameters).The stroke localisation was determined with CT and/or MRI. Subsequently all the examined individuals underwent SPECT examination. The follow up examinations were performed by the consultant psychiatrist in 6, 12 and 24 weeks subsequent to the stroke episode. The depressive episode diagnosis was established on the basis of ICD-10 diagnostic criteria.Only right-handed patients (43 men aged 57.3 +/- 11.6 and 17 women aged 62.5 +/- 14.4) with unilateral brain lesion were examined. 23 subjects (38%) developed depression in the follow-up period. 5 women (29%) and 18 men (ca. 42%) developed a depressive episode. Only one of the observed depressive episodes met ICD-10 criteria for severe depressive episode. 10 patients suffered from moderate depressive episode and 12 subjects exhibited a mild depressive episode.The results obtained with CT and/or MRI techniques revealed no correlation between the post-stroke depression and stroke lateralisation. However the localisation of the deep brain functional abnormalities revealed with SPECT correlated with the occurrence of the affective disorders as related to the asymmetry in regional blood flow measures.
