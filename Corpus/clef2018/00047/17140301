Factors associated with hypospadias in Asian newborn babies. Previous studies reported an increasing temporal trend of hypospadias and a significant association with poor intrauterine growth. It remains unclear whether the association relates to birth weight, degree of prematurity or intra-uterine growth. The objective was to study the incidence of hypospadias and to examine the association with various risk factors.A retrospective case-control study was carried out of infants admitted to a neonatal unit from January 1st, 1999 to December 31st, 2005.Of 6538 male live births, 27 (0.41%) infants had hypospadias. Incidence increased from 2.85 per thousand in 1999 to 6.89 per thousand in 2005. Hypospadias occurred significantly more frequently in babies born small for gestational age (SGA), in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, those born preterm and to mothers with preeclampsia (PET). Logistic regression revealed that VLBW (OR 14.12, CI 5.48-36.39), maternal PET (OR 3.90, CI 1.50-10.14) and SGA (OR 3.23, CI 1.25-8.37) as independent risk factors.Hypospadias is associated with VLBW, maternal PET and poor intra-uterine growth, but not with preterm birth. A rising trend in the incidence of hypospadias was noted in our population of Asian babies, suggesting a universal phenomenon.
