Expression and purification of recombinant human interleukin 4 in Escherichia coli. Human interleukin 4 (IL-4) cDNA was optimized and synthesized according to E. coli preferred codon. A recombinant expression plasmid pET-30a (+)/rhIL-4 was constructed with the target cDNA inserted between Nde I and EcoR I sites, which can translate the mature IL-4 protein with an extra methionine residue at N-terminal. The expression vector was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). The rhIL-4 protein was expressed in the inclusion body. By using the optimized fermentation conditions, the high expression level was achieved with the expression level as high as 35% of total protein obtained. A purification strategy has been designed which includes Q-Sepharose and SP-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography and dialysis renaturation. The rhIL-4 was purified with the purity more than 98% and the yield of 40 mg per liter fermentation culture achieved. Western blot proved that the purified protein is IL-4. Amino acid sequencing revealed that N-terminal 16 residue sequence is identical to the theoretical sequence. Biological activity assay on TF-1 cells demonstrated that the rhIL-4 is active with an activity of 2.5 x 10(6) AU/mg. This study promises large scale production of rhIL-4.
