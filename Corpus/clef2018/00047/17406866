The new EANM paediatric dosage card. In a recent publication, Jacobs et al. proposed the use of three tracer-dependent dosage cards for paediatric nuclear medicine.Based upon this work, the EANM dosimetry and paediatrics committees introduce a condensed and revised version of this dosage card for major nuclear medicine paediatric diagnostic procedures, replacing the previous card by Piepsz et al. and including a set of minimum activities.The activities to be administered result in weight-independent effective doses to the children. In addition, the introduction of minimum activities guarantees a minimum standard of image quality throughout Europe and avoids a variety of administered activities in children of the same weight in different countries, which was the case when using the previous EANM dosage card.
