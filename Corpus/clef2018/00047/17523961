Haematology, blood chemistry and urine parameters of free-ranging plains viscachas (Lagostomus maximus) in Argentina determined by use of a portable blood analyser (i-STAT) and conventional laboratory methods. Haematology, blood chemistry and urine values were determined for 44 adult free-ranging plains viscachas (Lagostomus maximus Rodentia, Chinchillidae) in their pampas habitat in central Argentina. The study animals were captured in the wild and anaesthetized with a ketamine-xylazine combination for physical examination and sampling. Blood was obtained by venipuncture of the saphenous vein. Results for many of the blood parameters fall within the reference ranges for pet chinchillas. Differentiation of white blood cells revealed a predominantly neutrophil count for plains viscachas, while chinchillas have predominantly lymphocytes. Mean values for blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase and sodium were higher than the upper limit of the reference range for pet chinchillas. The results of seven analytes (haematocrit, haemoglobin, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, sodium, potassium, chloride) were compared by using both a portable blood analyser (i-STAT) in the field and conventional laboratory methods. In general, correlation and agreement between the two methods were low for most parameters.
