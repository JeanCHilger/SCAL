2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron-emission tomography in staging, response evaluation, and treatment planning of lymphomas. 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) is used increasingly in the clinical management of lymphomas. With regard to staging, FDG-PET is more sensitive and specific than conventional staging methods in FDG avid lymphomas (ie, Hodgkin lymphoma and most aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas). Despite methodological problems, in particular the lack of a valid reference test, FDG-PET is approved and generally used for this purpose. With regard to response evaluation, FDG-PET at the end of treatment seems to aid considerably in differentiating between residual masses with or without residual lymphoma. Hence, new revised response criteria have been proposed, incorporating the result of FDG-PET at the end of treatment. An early interim FDG-PET scan after 1 to 3 cycles of chemotherapy is a very strong predictor of outcome, and trials are now in progress testing treatment modifications on this basis. With regard to treatment planning, in the context of combined-modality therapy, radiotherapy for lymphomas is moving toward more conformal techniques reducing the irradiated volume to include only the macroscopic lymphoma. In this situation, accurate imaging is essential, and FDG-PET coregistered with the planning computed tomography (CT) scan is used increasingly. The availability of PET/CT scanners suited for virtual simulation has aided this process. However, clinical data evaluating this technique are at present sparse.
