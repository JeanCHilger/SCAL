PET/CT image registration: preliminary tests for its application to clinical dosimetry in radiotherapy. The quality of dosimetry in radiotherapy treatment requires the accurate delimitation of the gross tumor volume. This can be achieved by complementing the anatomical detail provided by CT images through fusion with other imaging modalities that provide additional metabolic and physiological information. Therefore, use of multiple imaging modalities for radiotherapy treatment planning requires an accurate image registration method. This work describes tests carried out on a Discovery LS positron emission/computed tomography (PET/CT) system by General Electric Medical Systems (GEMS), for its later use to obtain images to delimit the target in radiotherapy treatment. Several phantoms have been used to verify image correlation, in combination with fiducial markers, which were used as a system of external landmarks. We analyzed the geometrical accuracy of two different fusion methods with the images obtained with these phantoms. We first studied the fusion method used by the PET/CT system by GEMS (hardware fusion) on the basis that there is satisfactory coincidence between the reconstruction centers in CT and PET systems and secondly the fiducial fusion, a registration method, by means of least-squares fitting algorithm of a landmark points system. The study concluded with the verification of the centroid position of some phantom components in both imaging modalities. Centroids were estimated through a calculation similar to center-of-mass, weighted by the value of the CT number and the uptake intensity in PET. The mean deviations found for the hardware fusion method were: deltax/ +/-sigma = 3.3 mm +/- 1.0 mm and /deltax/ +/-sigma = 3.6 mm +/- 1.0 mm. These values were substantially improved upon applying fiducial fusion based on external landmark points: /deltax/ +/-sigma = 0.7 mm +/- 0.8 mm and /deltax/ +/-sigma = 0.3 mm 1.7 mm. We also noted that differences found for each of the fusion methods were similar for both the axial and helical CT image acquisition protocols.
