Osteoinduction in human fat-derived stem cells by recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 produced in Escherichia coli. Bioactive recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) was obtained using Escherichia coli pET-25b expression system: 55 mg purified rhBMP-2 were achieved per g cell dry wt, with up to 95% purity. In murine C2C12 cell line, rhBMP-2 induced an increase in the transcription of Smads and of osteogenic markers Runx2/Cbfa1 and Osterix, measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Bioassays performed in human fat-derived stem cells showed an increased activity of the early osteogenic marker, alkaline phosphatase, and the absence of cytotoxicity.
