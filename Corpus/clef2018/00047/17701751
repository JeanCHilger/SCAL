Baseline serum levels of cardiac biomarkers in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Stable coronary artery disease (CAD) can cause repetitive reversible myocardial ischaemia, and it seems to be possible that reversibly injured myocardium releases small amounts of soluble cytoplasmic proteins. Hence, the aim was to evaluate the effect of stable CAD on baseline serum levels of cardiac biomarkers. We studied 68 consecutive outpatients referred for gated myocardial perfusion imaging. Before a treadmill exercise test, blood samples for measurement of creatine kinase (CK), CK-myocardial band (CK-MB) mass, myoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were collected. Normal perfusion patterns were detected in 29 (43%) patients (group 1) and perfusion defects were detected in 39 (57%) patients (group 2). Baseline serum levels of biomarkers except CK were significantly higher in group 2 (p=0.001). Stable CAD increases baseline levels of CK-MB mass, myoglobin, AST and LDH in the serum and this increase is related to the extent and severity of the perfusion defect and to some extent the ejection fraction of the left ventricle.
