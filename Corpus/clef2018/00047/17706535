Critical role of 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose PET in the management of patients with arthroplasty. The most frequent complications after arthroplasty are aseptic loosening and infection. It is often difficult to differentiate aseptic loosening from infection. The management of these two distinct clinical identities is quite different, however. Treatment of aseptic loosening usually requires one-step revision surgery, whereas treatment of infection requires antimicrobial therapy for an extended period before inserting a new prosthesis. Infection associated with arthroplasty is a serious complication and should be treated adequately before proceeding with a surgical intervention. PET with 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been proposed as an accurate technique for evaluating painful arthroplasty. This review addresses the applications of FDG-PET in such clinical settings. In addition, the potential of PET in the assessing the viability of bone grafts in revision arthroplasty is discussed.
