Influence of attenuation correction by integrated low-dose CT on somatostatin receptor SPECT. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) is well-established in neuroendocrine tumour (NET) imaging. This study evaluated the impact of attenuation correction (AC) on SRS SPECT data in patients examined by SPECT-CT.Planar scintigraphy and SPECT-CT of 17 patients (10 men, seven women age, 40-74 yearsA total of 46 pathological foci were found. Focus contrast and intensity significantly increased in 14/46 foci (30%) after AC (mean, 3.7-4.0) in the visual analysis (P<0.001). While TB ratios increased only in 24/46 foci after AC and no correlation between the T(BAC)/T(BNAC) ratio and focus depth (r=0.027 P=0.856) was found, T(max) was higher after AC in all foci and the T(max,AC)/T(max,NAC) ratio showed the expected correlation to focus depth (r=0.650Attenuation correction of SRS SPECT data by SPECT-CT results in visually more clearly contrasted foci. Moreover, as focus intensity increases, especially in the more centrally localised foci, CT-based AC has a potential to further improve the sensitivity of SRS SPECT.
