131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy in patients with a suspected pheochromocytoma. A comparison with CT and biohumoral parameters. The results of 131I metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and Computed Tomography (CT) scans in a group of patients with clinically suspected pheochromocytoma were evaluated and compared with biohumoral parameters. We studied 24 consecutive patients (7 M and 17 F age range 20-66 years). 131I-MIBG scintigraphy and CT were in agreement in 19 patients (79%): of them 7 cases were true positive, and 12 were true negative. Disagreement between the two imaging techniques was observed in 5 patients (21%). In this group, one patient, with positive CT scan, had false negative MIBG study, while 4 patients with negative MIBG scan, had false positive CT. MIBG showed significantly higher (p less than 0.05) specificity (100%), positive predictive value (100%), and accuracy (96%) than CT (75%, 67%, and 83%, respectively). 131I-MIBG scintigraphy is an accurate, noninvasive technique for localizing pheochromocytoma and providing direct tissue characterization, while CT provides more accurate spatial information. In conclusion, CT and MIBG studies are complementary in the evaluation of patients with suspected pheochromocytoma.
