Animal illness and human emotion. Decision-making concerning pets with loss of autonomic function. Appropriate communication with clients is essential when dealing with pets that have conditions associated with loss of autonomic function. These conditions include fecal and urinary incontinence, megaesophagus, and feline constipation. These conditions require a strong commitment to long-term caretaking with frequent frustrations on behalf of the client. Evaluation of the owner's personality types as well as the entire home situation is essential in assisting clients with their decision on how to deal with the problems. Each case should be evaluated based on multiple factors. Ideally, the veterinarian needs to go beyond offering medical advice and should help facilitate the decision-making process based on the ability of the client to deal with the care of a pet with a chronic problem. Different approaches to dealing with these often difficult situations will be discussed.
