Basic skills for successful client relations. Today's veterinary professional must not only be medically adept but must also possess good communications and client relations skills. Clients are far more likely to judge a practitioner by his or her interpersonal abilities rather than by medical judgment. This chapter stresses the importance of having "a counselor's attitude" toward clients. It will also make clinicians more aware of their verbal and nonverbal communication, hone the ability to listen and empathize, develop the art of questioning and explaining, and teach clinicians to constructively handle anger. These skills will go a long way to enhance relationships, build the practice, and reduce the people-to-people stresses that always arise when a beloved pet's life is compromised, threatened, or ended.
