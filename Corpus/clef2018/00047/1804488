Animal illness and human emotion. Behavioral problems. Understanding companion animal behavior and treating behavior problems requires an appreciation of both the species-typical and individualistic nature of the behavior of dogs and cats, as well as people. Pet behavior problems are influenced by many factors, including genes, physiological processes and a myriad of environmental influences during the development of the pet throughout its life. Human behavior is influenced greatly by cognitive/linguistic capabilities unavailable to pets. Human anthropomorphism, egocentrism, and our tendency to attribute causality have surprisingly little effect on the development of major pet behavior problems but must be considered factors bearing on the successful treatment of these problems.
