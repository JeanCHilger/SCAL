Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue: imaging findings in 21 patients. Few articles have been published on imaging findings of marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) of the lung. We present CT scan and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scan findings of the disease.From March 1995 to February 2007, 21 pretreatment patients (male patients, 9 female patients, 12A single nodular or consolidative pattern was observed in 7 of 21 (33%) patients, multiple nodular or areas of consolidation were observed in 9 patients (43%), bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis were observed in 3 patients (14%), and DILD was observed in 2 patients (10%). On PET scans (n = 6), lesions showed heterogeneous FDG uptake in five patients and homogeneous uptake in one patient, with mSUVs ranging from 2.2 to 6.3 (mean mSUV, 4.2 +/- 1.48).Marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of BALT manifest diverse patterns of lung abnormality on CT scans, but single or multiple nodules or areas of consolidation are the main patterns that occur in a majority (76%) of patients. Most lesions show heterogeneous but identifiable FDG uptake on PET scans.
