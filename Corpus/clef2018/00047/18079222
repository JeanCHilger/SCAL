Risk factors associated with persistent airflow limitation in severe or difficult-to-treat asthma: insights from the TENOR study. The Epidemiology and Natural History of Asthma: Outcomes and Treatment Regimens study is among the largest to assess persistent airflow limitation and the first to evaluate a wide range of potential risk factors in high-risk patients with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma. A better understanding is needed regarding factors associated with persistent airway obstruction this study was performed to determine demographic and clinical characteristics associated with persistent airflow limitation.Data from adult patients (>or= 18 years old) with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma were evaluated. Patients with COPD, obesity with a restrictive respiratory pattern, or a >or= 30 pack-year history of smoking were excluded. Patients with persistent airflow limitation (postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio <or= 70% at two annual consecutive visits) and normal postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio (75 to 85%) were compared. Multivariate analysis identified factors independently associated with persistent airflow limitation.Of 1,017 patients, 612 patients (60%) showed evidence of persistent airflow limitation. Risk factors were as follows: older age (odds ratio [OR] per 10 years, 1.4 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 1.6)Persistent airflow limitation is prevalent in patients with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma and is associated with identifiable clinical and demographic characteristics.
