Application of PET/SPECT imaging in vascular disease. Nuclear medicine imaging differs from other imaging modalities by showing physiological processes instead of anatomical details.To describe the current applications of positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as a diagnostic tool for vascular disease as relevant to vascular surgeons.A literature search identified articles focussing on vascular disease and PET or SPECT using the Pubmed database. Manual cross referencing was also performed.PET and SPECT may be used to assess plaque vulnerability, biology of aneurysm progression, prosthetic graft infection, and vasculitis. The ability to combine computerized tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging with PET or SPECT adds detailed anatomical information and enhances the potential of nuclear medicine imaging in the investigation of vascular disease.Considerable further information will be needed to define whether and where PET or SPECT will fit in a clinical strategy. The necessary validation studies represent an exciting challenge for the future but also may require the development of interdisciplinary imaging groups to integrate expertise and optimize nuclear diagnostic potential.
