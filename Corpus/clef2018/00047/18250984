Does partial volume corrected maximum SUV based on count recovery coefficient in 3D-PET/CT correlate with clinical aggressiveness of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma? There is much controversy about the correlation between the degree of 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG) uptake and clinical aggressiveness of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In this study, we investigated whether partial volume corrected FDG uptake based on count recovery coefficient in 3D-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) correlates with the clinical aggressiveness of NHL and improves diagnostic accuracy.Forty-two patients with NHL underwent FDG-PET/CT scans (26 aggressive NHLs and 16 indolent ones). Count recovery curve was obtained using NEMA 2001 body phantom. Scan protocol and reconstructive parameters in the phantom study were the same as those in a clinical scan except for emission time. Relative recovery coefficient (RC) was calculated as RC = A/B (A, maximum pixel count of each hot sphere B, maximum pixel count of greatest sphere). Partial volume corrected maximum count of standardized uptake value (PVC-SUV) was calculated as PVC-SUV = NC-SUV/RC (NC-SUV: non-corrected maximum count of SUV). Three parameters (NC-SUV, PVC-SUV, and size) between aggressive and indolent NHLs were compared.Significant differences were shown in all parameters between aggressive and indolent NHLs. Means +/- SD of NC-SUV, PVC-SUV, and size was as following: NC-SUV (15.3 +/- 6.9, 8.7 +/- 7.0 P < 0.01), PVC-SUV (18.2 +/- 8.1, 12.7 +/- 7.8Diagnostic accuracy of PVC-SUV was inferior to that of NC-SUV. These results suggest that NC-SUV, which contains information on both size and FDG density, provides better differentiation between aggressive and indolent NHLs than PVC-SUV.
