Prediction of functional recovery after revascularization using quantitative gated myocardial perfusion SPECT: a multi-center cohort study in Japan. Prediction of left ventricular functional recovery is important after myocardial infarction. The impact of quantitative perfusion and motion analyses with gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) on predictive ability has not been clearly defined in multi-center studies.A total of 252 patients with recent myocardial infarction (n = 74) and old myocardial infarction (n = 175) were registered from 25 institutions. All patients underwent resting gated SPECT using (99m)Tc-hexakis-2-methoxy-isobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) and repeated the study after revascularization after an average follow-up period of 132 +/- 81 days. Visual and quantitative assessment of perfusion and wall motion were performed in 5,040 segments.Non-gated segmental percent uptake and end-systolic (ES) percent uptake were good predictors of wall motion recovery and significantly differed between improved and non-improved groups (66 +/- 17% and 55 +/- 18%, p < 0.0001 for non-gated 64 +/- 16% and 51 +/- 17% for ES percent uptake, p < 0.0001). The area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics curve for non-gated percent uptake, ES percent uptake, end-diastolic percent uptake and visual perfusion defect score was 0.70, 0.71, 0.61, and 0.56, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of percent uptake were 68% and 64% for non-gated map and 80% and 52% for ES percent uptake map. An optimal threshold for predicting segmental improvement was 63% for non-gated and 52% for ES percent uptake values.Segmental (99m)Tc-MIBI uptake provided a useful predictor of wall motion improvement. Application of quantitative approach with non-gated and ES percent uptake enhanced predictive accuracy over visual analysis particularly in a multi-center study.
