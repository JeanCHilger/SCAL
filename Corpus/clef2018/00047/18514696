Advanced modalities for the imaging of sarcoma. There is a diversity of modalities available for the imaging of soft tissue and skeletal sarcomas. However, conventional radiography remains the first line imaging modality in the diagnostic work-up, as it provides superior spatial resolution for the evaluation of bone trabecular detail. This article focuses on the advanced imaging modalities of computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography in the evaluation of sarcomas.
