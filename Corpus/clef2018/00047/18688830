Harnessing a ratiometric fluorescence output from a sensor array. Ratiometric fluorescence-based sensors are widely sought after because they can effectively convert even relatively small changes in optical output into a strong and easy-to-read signal. However, ratiometric sensor molecules are usually difficult to make. We present a proof-of-principle experiment that shows that efficient ratiometric sensing may be achieved by an array of two chromophores, one providing an on-to-off response and the second yielding an off-to-on response in a complementary fashion. In the case that both chromophores emit light of different color, the result is a switching of colors that may be utilized in the same way as from a true ratiometric probe. The chromophore array comprises two sensor elements: i) a polyurethane membrane with embedded N-anthracen-9-yl-methyl-N-7-nitrobenzoxa-[1,2,5]diazo-4-yl-N',N'-dimethylethylenediamine hydrochloride and ii) a membrane with N,N-dimethyl-N'-(9-methylanthracenyl)ethylenediamine. A combination of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) allows for green-to-blue emission switching in the presence of Zn(II) ions. The sensing experiments carried out with different Zn(II) salts at controlled pH revealed that the degree of color switching in the individual sensor elements depends on both the presence of Zn(II) ions and the counter anion. These results suggest that sensing of both cations and anions may perhaps be extended to different cation-anion pairs.
