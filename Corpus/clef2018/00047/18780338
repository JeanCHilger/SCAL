Receipt of guideline-recommended follow-up in older colorectal cancer survivors : a population-based analysis. After curative resection for colorectal cancer, routine follow-up with office visits, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and colonoscopy is recommended. The actual adherence to these guidelines as well as the potential overuse of testing in routine practice has not been well studied.The authors identified 9426 eligible patients aged > or = 66 years in a linked tumor registry-claims database who were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum from 2000 to 2001. Patients were observed to 3 years after diagnosis. Receipt of > or = 2 office visits per year, > or = 2 CEA tests per year (years 1 and 2), and > or = 1 colonoscopy within 3 years constituted guideline fulfillment.Guidelines for office visits, colonoscopy, and CEA testing were met in 92.3%, 73.6%, and 46.7% of patients, respectively. In addition, receipt of 2 nonrecommended procedures, abdominal/pelvic computed tomography scans and positron emission tomography scans, was documented in 47.7% and 6.8%, respectively. Overall, 60.2% received testing below recommended levels, 17.1% at recommended frequency, and 22.7% above guideline recommendations. In a multivariate analysis, factors associated with meeting guidelines included younger age group, white race, regional stage cancers, and poorly differentiated tumors. Considerable geographic variation in meeting guidelines was also observed.Many older colorectal cancer survivors in this population-based cohort underwent testing below a minimum frequency specified by clinical practice guidelines, especially with regard to CEA. Further studies should ascertain the reasons for poor compliance and the effect on patient outcome.
