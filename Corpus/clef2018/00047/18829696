Hypothalamic involvement in Huntington's disease: an in vivo PET study. Recent studies have shown alterations in metabolism, sleep and circadian rhythms as well as in several neuropeptides derived from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in Huntington's disease patients however, the pathology underlying these abnormalities is not known. Our aim was to assess in vivo D(2) receptor's loss/dysfunction and increases in microglial activation in the hypothalamus of symptomatic Huntington's disease patients and premanifest Huntington's disease gene carriers using PET with (11)C-raclopride (RAC), a specific D(2) receptor ligand and (11)C-(R)-PK11195 (PK), a marker of microglial activation. We have studied 9 symptomatic Huntington's disease patients (age = 46.8 +/- 4.7 years
