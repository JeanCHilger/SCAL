Clinical impact of FDG-PET in patients with suspected recurrent ovarian cancer. To evaluate the efficacy and clinical impact of FDG-PET in patients with suspected recurrent ovarian cancer.Between October 2001 and October 2006, we retrospectively studied 49 FDG-PET performed in 40 women (age: 52.4 +/- 12.2 years) with ovarian cancer, who had suspicion of recurrent disease by positive morphologic imaging tests (MIT) or increased tumour markers and negative MIT. All patients underwent whole body FDG-PET after the injection of 370-434 MBq of (18)FDG. The results were confirmed by histology in 31 cases, and by clinical-radiological follow-up in 18.Prevalence of disease was 79.6 %. We obtained a global sensitivity and positive predictive value of 87.2 % and 87.2 %, and an accuracy of 79.6 %. Results led to a change in the patient's management in 25 cases (51 %). Subgroup results were: Sensitivity of 81.8 % in patients with increased tumour markers and negative MIT, and 89.3 % in patients with operable malignant lesions.FDG-PET has high sensitivity and clinical impact in patients with suspicion of recurrent ovarian cancer. Better results were obtained in patients with increased tumour markers and negative MIT.
