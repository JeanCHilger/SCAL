Retrospective analysis of radiation load during examination of cancer patients by (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography. We present retrospective analysis of the results of examinations of 1,338 cancer patients by (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (18)F-FDG positron emission and computer-aided tomography. It was shown that complex devices for positron emission and computer-aided tomography provide more informative data than individual methods. The protocol for examination by methods of positron emission and computer-aided tomography in each case is determined by clinical requirements and risk of extra exposure of the patient.
