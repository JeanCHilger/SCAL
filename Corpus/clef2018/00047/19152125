Diagnostic value of left ventricular function after adenosine triphosphate loading and at rest in the detection of multi-vessel coronary artery disease using myocardial perfusion imaging. Although transient left ventricular (LV) dilation is a well-known marker for extensive coronary artery disease (CAD), few studies performed quantitative analysis of LV function of post adenosine triphosphate (ATP) stress and at rest to detect extensive CAD.One hundred nineteen patients with suspected CAD underwent post-stress and resting gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Myocardial perfusion was assessed with a 20-segment model, and the changes in LV volume and function with ATP were analyzed. In addition, the stress-induced volume ratio (SIVR), defined as stress-to-rest ratios (end-systolic volume x 5 + end-diastolic volume), was calculated. All the patients underwent coronary angiography within 3 months of gated SPECT.In the 62 patients with multi-vessel CAD, the summed stress score (SSS) (16.6 +/- 8.7 vs 11.5 +/- 9.1 P < .002), summed difference score (SDS) (9.6 +/- 5.8 vs 3.9 +/- 4.2The addition of "post-ATP stress" and "at rest" LV functional analysis using gated SPECT to conventional perfusion analysis helps to better identify patients with multi-vessel CAD.
