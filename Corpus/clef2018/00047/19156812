para-Functionalized aryl-di-tert-butylfluorosilanes as potential labeling synthons for (18)F radiopharmaceuticals. Broad spectrum: Novel para-functionalized aryl-di-tert-butylfluorosilanes, p-(tBu(2)FSi)C(6)H(4)X (X=functional group), have been made available and broaden the spectrum of silicon-based (18)F acceptors (SiFAs) for potential PET applications. For example, the [(18)F]maleimido derivative 1 has been employed for the synthesis of [(18)F]1- labeled rat serum albumin (RSA), the applicability of which for PET has been verified by in vivo experiments.The syntheses of the functionalized triorganofluorosilanes tBu(2)(p-XC(6)H(4))SiF (3 a, X=SH 4 a, X=NCS
