An Evaluation of Iterative Reconstruction Strategies on Mediastinal Lesion Detection Using Hybrid Ga-67 SPECT Images. Hybrid LROC studies can be used to more realistically assess the impact of reconstruction strategies, compared to those constructed with digital phantoms. This is because hybrid data provides the background variability that is present in clinical imaging, as well as, control over critical imaging parameters, required to conduct meaningful tests. Hybrid data is obtained by adding Monte Carlo simulated lesions to disease free clinical projection data. Due to Ga-67 being a particularly challenging radionuclide for imaging, we use Ga-67 hybrid SPECT data to study the effectiveness of the various correction strategies developed to account for degradations in SPECT imaging. Our data was obtained using GE-VG dual detector SPECT-CT camera. After determining a target lesion contrast we conduct pilot LROC studies to obtain a near-optimal set of reconstruction parameters for the different strategies individually. These near-optimal parameters are then used to reconstruct the final evaluation study sets. All LROC study results reported here were obtained employing human observers only. We use final LROC study results to assess the impact of attenuation compensation, scatter compensation and detector resolution compensation on data reconstructed with the RBI-EM algorithm. We also compare these with FBP reconstructions of the same dataset. Our experiment indicates an improvement in detection accuracy, as various degradations inherent in the image acquisition process are compensated for in the reconstruction process.
