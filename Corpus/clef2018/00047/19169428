Factors Influencing Lesion Detection in SPECT Lung Images. An earlier localization ROC (LROC) study that found attenuation correction (AC) degraded the detection of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) in hybrid SPECT lung images had several potential shortcomings related to the simulation methods. We sought to address these issues with a revised LROC study. Clinical Tc-99m NeoTect scans acquired with a simultaneous transmission-emission protocol defined the normal cases in a single-slice LROC study. Abnormal cases contained a simulated 1-cm lung lesion. Four rescaled-block-iterative EM (RBI) reconstruction strategies applied: 1) AC, scatter correction (SC), and resolution compensation (RC) 2) AC only
