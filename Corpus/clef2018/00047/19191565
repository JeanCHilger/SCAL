Compared to purpurinimides, the pyropheophorbide containing an iodobenzyl group showed enhanced PDT efficacy and tumor imaging (124I-PET) ability. Two positional isomers of purpurinimide, 3-[1'-(3-iodobenzyloxyethyl)] purpurin-18-N-hexylimide methyl ester 4, in which the iodobenzyl group is present at the top half of the molecule (position-3), and a 3-(1'-hexyloxyethy)purpurin-18-N-(3-iodo-benzylimide)] methyl ester 5, where the iodobenzyl group is introduced at the bottom half (N-substitued cyclicimide) of the molecule, were derived from chlorophyll-a. The tumor uptake and phototherapeutic abilities of these isomers were compared with the pyropheophorbide analogue 1 (lead compound). These compounds were then converted into the corresponding 124I-labeled PET imaging agents with specific activity >1 Ci/micromol. Among the positional isomers 4 and 5, purpurinimide 5 showed enhanced imaging and therapeutic potential. However, the lead compound 1 derived from pyropheophorbide-a exhibited the best PET imaging and PDT efficacy. For investigating the overall lipophilicity of the molecule, the 3-O-hexyl ether group present at position-3 of purpurinimide 5 was replaced with a methyl ether substituent, and the resulting product 10 showed improved tumor uptake, but due to its significantly higher uptake in the liver, spleen, and other organs, a poor tumor contrast in whole-body tumor imaging was observed.
