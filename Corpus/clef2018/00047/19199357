Distinct patterns of regional cerebral glucose metabolism in Parkinson's disease with and without mild cognitive impairment. There is no consensus with regard to the clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of prodromal dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD). To delineate functional neuroimaging features of PD with mild cognitive impairment (PDMCI) and with no cognitive impairment (PDNC), we compared regional cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRglc) amongst 13 patients with PDMCI, 27 with PDNC, and 13 healthy controls. The PDNC patients had limited areas of hypometabolism in the frontal and occipital cortices. In the PDMCI patients, there were extensive areas of hypometabolism in the posterior cortical regions, including the temporo-parieto-occipital junction, medial parietal, and inferior temporal cortices. The present results suggest that posterior cortical dysfunction is the primary neuroimaging feature of PD patients at risk for dementia.
