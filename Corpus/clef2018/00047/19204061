Blood compatibility of surface modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) by plasma polymerized acetobromo-alpha-D-glucose. Poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) was surface modified by plasma polymerization of acetobromo-alpha-D-glucose (ABG) at different radio frequency (RF) powers. Plasma polymerization was carried out by vaporizing ABG in the powder form by heating at 135 degrees C. Surface modification resulted in improved hydrophilicity and smoothness of the surface especially at low RF powers (30-50 W), but at high RF powers, the surface was found to be etched and the hydrophilicity decreased as evidenced by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and contact angle measurements. The plasma polymerized ABG film was found to be extensively cross-linked as evidenced by its insolubility in water. Infra red (IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to characterize the plasma polymerized ABG films. IR studies revealed that at lower RF powers, polymerization was taking place mainly by breaking up of acetoxy group while retaining the ring structures to a major extent during the polymerization process whereas at high RF powers, the rupture of ring structures was indicated. XPS indicated a reduction in the percentage of oxygen in the polymers going from low to high RF powers suggestive of complete destruction of the acetoxy group at high RF powers. Cross-cut tests showed excellent adhesive properties of the plasma polymerized ABG films onto PET. Static platelet adhesion tests using platelet rich human plasma showed significantly reduced adhesion of platelets onto modified PET surface as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy. Polymerization of glucose and its derivatives using RF plasma has not been reported so far and the preliminary results reported in this study shows that this could be an interesting approach in the surface modification of biomaterials.
