The effect of 18F-FDG-PET/CT respiratory gating on detected metabolic activity in lung lesions. Respiratory gated PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography) of the lung is expected to increase the accuracy of quantitative determinations in lesional activities, regardless of the gating method used reasonably, respiratory gating should increase standard uptake value (SUVA group of 26 consecutive positive studies (21 men, 5 women, age 36-84, mean 68), performed on patients referred to our institution for known or suspected lung cancer, are examined. All studies were performed both with conventional PET/CT total body scan and with Real-Time Position Management (RPM) triggered selective gated study of the thorax. Four studies were considered technically unsatisfactory and were discarded the remaining 22 studies are the object of this work. Max lesional SUVs were evaluated in both settings by semi-automated algorithmsIn conventional, SUV showed a mean +/- standard deviation (SD) value of 9.2 +/- 6.9 (range 0.9-26). In the averaged gated studies, the mean +/- SD value was 13.4 +/- 11.7 (range 1.4-47) in the "best bin" dataset the mean +/- SD was 14.9 +/- 12.9, ranging from 1.6 to 53.1. In general, the use of respiratory trigger induced rather variable but overall consistent increases in SUV. If the percentage variations in the average trigger dataset are considered, there is an average increase of +60%, SD +/- 97 (P < 0.05). Similar results are found in the "best bin" dataset, the average percentage increase in SUV values being +77.2% (SD +/- 04.6).In lung cancer, triggering procedures increase the signal to noise ratio. The increase in SUV determined by gating is very variable, but generally relevant. This could lead to an SUV values cut-off revision, and may have an impact on smaller lesions detection.
