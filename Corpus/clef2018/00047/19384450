Kinetic analysis of experimental rabbit tumour and inflammation model with 18F-FDG PET/CT. Non-specific accumulation of 18F-FDG by both tumour and inflammatory lesions can make diagnostic analysis difficult. Our aim was to explore the difference in 18F-FDG uptake kinetics between tumour and inflammatory cells. To this end, we investigated VX2 tumour lesions and inflammatory lesions in rabbits.Six rabbits with VX2 tumour cells transplanted into one forelimb muscle and inflammatory lesions induced by turpentine oil in the contralateral forelimb were scanned for 60 minutes post 18F-FDG injection. Imaging data was analyzed with the standard 2-tissue-compartment model. Parameters, VB, Ki, K1, k2, k3, k4, were compared between tumour and inflammatory lesions. SUV and dual time scan methods were also compared in the experiment.Time activity curves of VX2 tumour lesions showed a characteristic pattern of gradually increasing 18F-FDG uptake up to 60 min, whereas, 18F-FDG uptake in inflammatory lesions increased more slowly than in tumours. Parameters estimated from the uptake process showed that forward transport constant, K1, and influx constant, Ki, values in VX2 tumour lesions (0.186 +/- 0.053 and 0.048 +/- 0.014, respectively) was significantly higher than that in inflammatory lesions (0.129 +/- 0.024 and 0.022 +/- 0.007, respectively) (p < 0.05). In contrast, mean values of VB, k2, k3 and k4 derived from VX2 tumours were not significantly different from that of inflammatory lesions. SUVs at 60 minutes post 18F-FDG injection were also significantly higher in the VX2 tumor lesions than in the inflammatory lesions. Retention index (RI) was not significantly different between VX2 tumours and inflammatory lesions (1.134 +/- 0.076 vs. 1.060 +/- 0.058, p > 0.05).Different kinetic parameters (Ki, K1, k3) exist between inflammatory and tumour lesions.
