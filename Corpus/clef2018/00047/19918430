Appendicular mass imitating a malignant cecal tumor on f18-FDG PET/CT study: a case report. Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography scan is a very useful method in the diagnosis and follow-up of gastrointestinal malignancies, although it may cause confusion in differential diagnosis.We present a 48-year-old man admitted with a right lower quadrant mass. Upon an unyielding colonoscopy due to inability to pass beyond the hepatic flexure, a Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography strongly suggested a right colonic or cecal malignancy. Eventual laparatomy revealed a periappendiceal plastron due to appendicitis that was subsequently proven histological diagnosis.Although Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography is a reliable diagnostic tool for colonic malignancies, it can misdiagnose such masses due to inflammatory process around the cecum.
