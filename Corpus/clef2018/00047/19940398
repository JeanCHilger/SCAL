Changes in regional blood flow induced by unilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) induced by unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) were investigated in 7 consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease, 4 men and 3 women (mean age 62.3 +/- 8.1 years), who underwent rCBF measurement by N-isopropyl-p-(iodine-123)-iodoamphetamine single photon emission computed tomography at rest before and after unilateral STN DBS preoperatively in the on-drug condition, and postoperatively in the on-drug and on-stimulation condition. Statistical parametric mapping was used to identify significant changes in rCBF from the preoperative to the postoperative conditions. rCBF was increased in the bilateral cingulate cortices and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. rCBF was decreased in the bilateral medial frontal cortices and left superior temporal cortex. Unilateral STN DBS produced rCBF changes in the bilateral cingulate cortices, cerebellar hemispheres, and medial frontal cortices. These findings indicate that unilateral STN DBS affects rCBF in both hemispheres.
