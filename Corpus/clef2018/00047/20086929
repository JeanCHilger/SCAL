Lumbar spine stress fracture in a young athlete. An 18-year-old rugby player suffered pain at the left lumbosacral junction after intensifying his level of practice. Plain radiographs were negative, but single-photon-emission computed tomography and three-dimensional bone scan images showed a lesion on the left neural arch of L-5. After conservative treatment and 10 pain-free weeks, he resumed training. One week later, symptoms recurred, and standard computed tomography showed a vertical fracture through the S-1 facet. This rare fracture illustrates the need to consider the unusual injury, especially in younger athletes who participate in high-level sports.
