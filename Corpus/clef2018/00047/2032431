Watershed infarcts, Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT and CT correlation. Case reports. We report on the use of Tc-99m hexamethylpropylene amineoxime (HMPAO) in watershed infarcts in five patients who had focal neurologic symptoms. Good correlation between Tc-99m HMPAO and CT was found in two patients. In three patients only Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT in a watershed distribution showed a perfusion abnormality that explained the clinical findings. Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT may be more sensitive than CT in the detection of infarctions in the watershed distribution.
