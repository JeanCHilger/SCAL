Clinical utility of ultrasound and 99mTc sestamibi SPECT/CT for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenoma in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. To evaluate the accuracy of ultrasound and parathyroid scintigraphy using single photon-emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) for the preoperative localization of solitary parathyroid adenomas in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who would be suitable for minimally invasive parathyroid surgery.Retrospective study of 63 consecutive patients with biochemical evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism referred for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenoma that proceeded to surgery in the same institution. All patients underwent high-resolution ultrasound and Technetium-99m sestamibi scintigraphy with planar and SPECT/CT imaging. The accuracy of preoperative imaging was compared to surgical and histological findings as the reference standard.Fifty-nine patients had solitary parathyroid adenomas, three patients had multiglandular hyperplasia, and one patient had multiple parathyroid adenomas confirmed at surgery and histology. Thirty-five solitary parathyroid adenomas were identified preoperatively with ultrasound (64%) and 53 with SPECT-CT (90%). Concordant ultrasound and SPECT/CT findings were found in 35 cases (59%). An additional three adenomas were found with ultrasound alone and 18 adenomas with SPECT/CT alone. Fifty-one of the 56 adenomas localized using combined ultrasound and SPECT/CT were found at the expected sites during surgery. Combined ultrasound and SPECT/CT has an overall sensitivity of 95% and accuracy of 91% for the preoperative localization of solitary parathyroid adenomas.The combination of ultrasound and SPECT/CT has incremental value in accurately localizing solitary parathyroid adenomas over either technique alone, and allows selection of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who would be suitable for minimally invasive surgery.
