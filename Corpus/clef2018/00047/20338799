Biomarkers: Parkinson disease with dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. Dementia is a common feature in Parkinson disease (PD), the time of onset determining how patients are classified. Those patients where dementia develops prior to parkinsonism or during the first year of disease are designated as having dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In those where dementia develops over a year after the onset of motor signs, the condition is known as Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). While this seems at first sight to be a definitive way to distinguish these conditions, reality is rather different. The overlap between them is considerable, and there is much uncertainty associated with patients who have both motor symptoms and early cognitive impairment. The diagnosis is still based on medical history and clinical evaluation. It is not even certain that they can be accurately distinguished at autopsy. For this reason, the data concerning these entities have been reviewed, to examine various markers employed or measured in clinical, neuropathological, neuroimaging, and biochemical investigations. The concept of PDD and DLB being separate conditions is comparatively new, and the most promising tools with which to separate them at present are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning that indicate increased amyloid-beta burden in DLB compared to PDD. However as yet there are no markers that unequivocally distinguish between PDD and DLB.
