Localization of epileptic foci in frontal lobe epilepsy and its surgical therapy. To analyze the clinical data and pre-operative examination results of frontal lobe epilepsy and combine with intra-operative intracranial electrical record in order to localize epileptic foci and to direct surgical therapy.Preoperative EEG record and MRI scan were performed in 23 patients with refractory frontal lobe epilepsy. Among them, 17 patients received interictal 18F-FDG-PET-CT, 11 received MEG examination, 2 received functional MRI, 10 received surgical operation and intra-operative intracranial electrical record.The positive predictive value of clinical features of epileptic seizure, interictal EEG, ictal EEG, MRI and PET-CT were 56.52%, 56.52%, 60.87%, 54.55% and 94.12% respectively. Their consistent results helped to confirm the epileptogenic zone. MEG was more accurate than EEG. ECoE and VEEG monitoring was significant for operative guidance.A series of examinations is necessary for the diagnosis of epileptogenic zone of frontal lobe epilepsy. The surgical outcome is related to the accuracy of epileptic foci localization and the removal of epileptogenic zone.
