Role of 11C-choline PET/CT in the restaging of prostate cancer patients showing a single lesion on bone scintigraphy. To assess the utility of (11)C-choline PET/CT in the restaging of prostate cancer (PC) patients who showed a single finding on bone scintigraphy (BS) that was classified as equivocal or suspected for metastatic lesion.A total of 25 PC patients with biochemical failure (mean PSA value 11.1 ng/mL median value 6.3 ng/mLOn the basis of biopsy confirmation and/or 6-month follow-up, 22 of 25 patients were classified as positive for the presence of metastatic bone lesions: 13 with a single lesion and 9 with multiple lesions. (11)C-choline PET/CT was positive in 19/25 patients and, on a lesion basis, it showed 50 positive findings. BS results were confirmed in 8/25 (32%) patients. (11)C-choline PET/CT detected multiple sites of relapse in 11/25 (44%) patients: in 2/11, a single bone lesion associated with other extraosseous sites of relapse in 6/11, multiple bone lesionsIn our study, (11)C-choline PET/CT detected unknown lesions in 11/25 patients. Patients with a single equivocal finding on BS could have important additional information from (11)C-choline PET/CT study, especially in the detection of additional metastases, to choose an appropriate treatment.
