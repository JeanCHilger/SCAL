Prevalence of positive FDG-PET findings in patients with high CEA levels. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of positive findings of positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) in patients with high serum CEA levels.A total of 303 patients who had undergone an FDG-PET scan in our institution with high serum CEA levels were analyzed. The prevalence of positive PET findings was evaluated with regard to a previous history of malignancy, absolute value of CEA levels, and the time course of CEA levels (an increasing or decreasing pattern, a change divided by time (DeltaCEA) and doubling time of CEA).Of 303 patients, 232 were confirmed to have malignancy, and the patient-based sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of PET were 87, 86, 95, 66, and 86%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in positive rates according to the history of previous malignancy. The prevalence of PET-positive cases was higher with an increase in absolute CEA levels, and more than 90% of the patients were positive when CEA levels were more than 20 ng/ml. The DeltaCEA was significantly higher and the doubling time was significantly shorter in patients with positive results than those with negative results.A high value of serum CEA levels was correlated with a higher prevalence of positive PET findings. FDG-PET scans would be justified in patients with high serum CEA levels, regardless of whether there was or was not a previous history of malignancy.
