 Chondrosarcomas are the second most common primary malignancies of the skeleton. These cancers have a characteristic slow growth and overproduce extracellular matrix (ECM) of the cartilage. The ECM of the cartilage is composed of several components, including proteoglycans, which have been described in detail by Gentili and Cancedda (3). Proteoglycans are negatively charged molecules, impart elasticity to the structure (3), and have been targeted with quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC), which carry a high positive charge, for the selective delivery of drugs or radioactive isotopes to the cartilage (1). Because of their specificity of binding of QACs to the cartilage, the QAC
