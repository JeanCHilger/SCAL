3-β-(4-Iodophenyl)tropane-2-β-carboxylic acid 2-[ Dopamine, a neurotransmitter, plays an important role in the mediation of movement, cognition, and emotion. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with a loss of dopamine-containing neurons in the striatum, resulting in a loss of dopamine transporters (DAT) in the presynaptic nerve terminals (1, 2). Reduced DAT density is inversely correlated with the severity of motor dysfunction in PD patients. Several cocaine analogs have been developed for the evaluation of DAT density in the neurons of PD patients. Radiolabeled 2-β-carboxymethoxy-3-β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (β-CIT) and
