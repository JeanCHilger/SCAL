 Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a T-cell growth factor secreted by T lymphocytes (1). It stimulates the growth and differentiation of T cells, B cells, NK cells, LAK cells, monocytes, macrophages, and oligodendrocytes (2-4). Three subunits (α, β, and γ) of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) have been identified. The α subunit has low affinity and normally expresses very low levels in resting lymphocytes (5). The high-affinity receptor is expressed mainly on activated T cells and macrophages (6) when the α, β, and γ subunits associate together (7). Activated cells are found in infiltrating tumors, inflammatory tissues, and autoimmune tissues. [
