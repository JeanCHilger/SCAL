Diffusion-weighted MRI and liver metastases. Liver metastases are the most frequently encountered malignant liver lesions in the Western countries. Accurate diagnosis of liver metastases is essential for appropriate management of these patients. Multiple imaging modalities, including ultrasound, CT, positron emission tomography, and MRI, are available for the evaluation of patients with suspected or known liver metastases. Contrast-enhanced MRI has a high accuracy for detection and characterization of liver lesions. Additionally, diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) has been gaining increasing attention. It is a noncontrast technique that is easy to perform, could be incorporated in routine clinical protocols, and has the potential to provide tissue characterization. This article discusses the basic principles of DWI and discusses its emerging role in the detection of liver metastases in patients with extrahepatic malignancies.
