Expression of GLUT1 protein and its relationship with uptake of FDG in non-small cell lung cancer tissues. To investigate the expression of facilitative glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and its relationship with uptake of 18fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Twenty-four patients with NSCLC were evaluated with 18FDG-PET examination before operation. The expression of GLUT1 was detected immunohistochemically in lung cancer and normal lung tissues, and the intensity of GLUT1 in lung cancer was assessed by computer image analysis. Correlation analysis was carried out between expression level of GLUT1 and value of SUV obtained from preoperative FDG-PET.Expression of GLUT1 protein was positive in 24 cases of NSCLC samples, but negative in corresponding normal tissues. A highly significant linear correlation was found between GLUT1 expression and SUV value (r= 0.86, P < 0.05).GLUT1 expression is quite general in NSCLC tissues, and it may play an important role in the glucose uptake of NSCLC cells.
