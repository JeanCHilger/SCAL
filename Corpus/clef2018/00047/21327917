Proximal and overall gastric emptying of solids in patients with reduced gastric volume accommodation compared to matched controls. Interventions such as gastric surgery and erythromycin result in displacement of solids to the distal stomach and acceleration of overall and proximal gastric emptying. The effect of non-surgical impairment of gastric accommodation on gastric emptying is unclear. Non-surgical impairment of gastric accommodation is associated with accelerated gastric emptying.To compare measurements of proximal and overall gastric emptying in patients with reduced postprandial gastric volume accommodation with the emptying rates in age- and gender-matched controls with normal postprandial gastric volume accommodation.We evaluated overall and proximal gastric emptying in nine patients with impaired gastric accommodation and age-equivalent and gender-matched controls. Gastric volumes and emptying were measured using validated SPECT and dual gamma camera scintigraphy, respectively. We compared group differences in overall and proximal gastric emptying t (1/2) by t test.Patients with impaired postprandial gastric volume accommodation had greater fasting gastric volume. The proportion of food emptied from the proximal stomach immediately after meal ingestion was lower and t (1/2) of proximal gastric emptying correspondingly longer in the group with reduced postprandial gastric accommodation. In contrast, differences were not detected in overall gastric emptying in the two groups, and the ratio of overall to proximal gastric emptying t (1/2) was greater in the group with impaired volume accommodation.Proximal stomach emptying is reduced in patients with impaired postprandial volume accommodation this difference occurs predominantly during the time of meal ingestion. Compensatory mechanisms that result in normal overall gastric emptying require further elucidation.
