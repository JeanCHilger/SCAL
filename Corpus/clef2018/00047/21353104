Comparison of atorvastatin 5 and 20 mg/d for reducing F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in atherosclerotic plaques on positron emission tomography/computed tomography: a randomized, investigator-blinded, open-label, 6-month study in Japanese adults scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is a useful tool for the detection of local inflamed atherosclerotic lesions.This study used hybrid PET/computed tomography (CT) to examine the effects of 2 doses of atorvastatin on (18)F-FDG uptake in atherosclerotic plaques in Japanese adults with stable angina pectoris who were scheduled to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).This was a prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, open-label study in patients with dyslipidemia (total cholesterol ≥ 220 mg/dL and/or LDL-C ≥ 140 mg/dL) who were scheduled to undergo PCI for stable angina pectoris and had not received any lipid-lowering drugs within 1 year before enrollment. Patients were randomly allocated to receive atorvastatin 5 or 20 mg/d for 6 months. At baseline (the day after PCI), (18)F-FDG uptake in the ascending aorta and femoral artery was determined using PET/CT imaging, and the mean target-to-background ratio (TBR) was calculated in individual plaques. The same regions were assessed by PET/CT after 6 months of treatment. Changes from baseline to follow-up in the lipid profile, serum malondialdehyde-modified LDL-C (MDA-LDL-C), and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were also examined. Drug adherence, adverse events, and changes in medications were monitored at monthly outpatient visits.Of 32 patients initially screened, 2 were excluded due to newly diagnosed cancer thus, 30 patients were randomly assigned to treatment, 15 in each group. Patients were predominantly male (18 [60%]), with a mean (SD) age of 54 (11) years, mean body weight of 65 (12) kg, and mean total cholesterol, HDL-C, and triglyceride concentrations of 240 (29), 48 (14), and 180 (102) mg/dL, respectively. After 6 months, the 20-mg group had significant reductions from baseline in mean (SD) TBR in the ascending aorta (from 1.15 [0.14] to 1.05 [0.12]Six months of treatment with atorvastatin 20 mg, but not 5 mg, was associated with a significant reduction in TBR in the ascending aorta and femoral artery in these Japanese adults with dyslipidemia undergoing PCI for stable angina pectoris.
