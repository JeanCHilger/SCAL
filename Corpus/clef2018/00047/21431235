Rapid carbonylative coupling reactions using palladium(I) dimers: applications to 11CO-radiolabelling for the synthesis of PET tracers. Palladium dimers with sterically hindered phosphines have been shown to be excellent pre-catalysts for the aminocarbonylation of aryl halides to yield amides and one of them has been successfully employed as a pre-catalyst for the synthesis of (11)C-radiolabelled amides for PET imaging.
