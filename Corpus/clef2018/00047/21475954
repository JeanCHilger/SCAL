Stem cell tracking in human trials: a meta-regression. The potential effectiveness of cell therapies is dependent upon homing of transplanted cells to relevant target organs. In this study we firstly characterise the range of methods employed in all human therapeutic-cell studies published to date investigated with cell-tracking. Secondly, we determine factors that predict target-organ cell uptake efficiency by meta-regression. Following a comprehensive literature search, we identified 19 relevant trials, representing 145 patients over the following 7 diseases: myocardial infarction Chagasic cardiomyopathy
