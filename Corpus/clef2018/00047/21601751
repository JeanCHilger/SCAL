A veterinarian's role in helping pet owners with decision making. End-of-life care frequently requires owners and veterinarians to make decisions of monumental consequences while feeling they sorely lack essential information. This feeling can be distressing to owners and veterinarians and lead to strains in their relationship. This article illustrates an approach to end-of-life decision making that offers the greatest benefit to the animal, the owner, the veterinarian, the veterinary practice, and, ultimately, the veterinary profession. The article introduces issues and concepts that underlie all companion animal end-of-life decision making-the human-animal bond, quality of life, and veterinarians' nonmedical helping roles-and discusses major end-of-life decisions.
