Experimental results from a prototype slit-slat collimator with mixed multiplexed and non-multiplexed data. We have previously shown with simulations that a gain in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be obtained by using mixed multiplexed (MX) and non-MX data in a slit-slat SPECT system as compared to using non-MX data only. We have now developed a prototype slit-slat collimator for a conventional gamma camera in order to validate these simulation results. The prototype collimator consists of seven slits and multiple parallel slats. Image reconstruction is performed using a modified OSEM algorithm, which takes into account geometric sensitivity variations and attenuation, but not scatter or resolution effects. Here, we first describe the calibration of the system and then we present the experimental validation with phantom experiments. SPECT acquisitions using different geometric and anthropomorphic phantoms were performed with and without multiplexing. The results show that reconstruction of the MX projections with the non-MX-projections eliminates artefacts caused by multiplexing. SNR gains obtained using the mixed MX and non-MX configurations were in the range of 26% to 51% for different phantoms. The results were in agreement with our previously published simulation work, proving that combining MX and non-MX data can result in artefact-free reconstructed images with improved SNR.
