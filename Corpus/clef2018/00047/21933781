Imaging intraplaque inflammation in carotid atherosclerosis with 11C-PK11195 positron emission tomography/computed tomography. We sought to determine whether intraplaque inflammation could be measured with positron emission tomography/computed tomography angiography (PET/CTA) using (11)C-PK11195, a selective ligand of the translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) which is highly expressed by activated macrophages.Patients (n = 32 mean age 70 Â± 9 years) with carotid stenoses (n = 36Imaging intraplaque inflammation in vivo with (11)C-PK11195 PET/CTA is feasible and can distinguish between recently symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques. Patients with a recent ischaemic event had ipsilateral plaques with lower CT attenuation and increased (11)C-PK11195 uptake.
