Fully automatic synthesis of [¹⁸F]FES for reporter gene hERL expression imaging. We have developed a fully automatic method for the synthesis of 16α-[¹⁸F]fluoroestradiol ([F]FES) using a TRACERlab FXFN module. Following [¹⁸F]fluorination, the intermediate was hydrolyzed with a mixture of 2 N HCl in acetonitrile (CH3CN) and then neutralized with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). After HPLC purification, the decay-corrected radiochemical yield of [¹⁸F]FES was 50 ± 2.35% (n=4), which was stable up to 96.1 ± 0.3% (n=4) at 8 h. This new fully automated synthesis method provided high and reproducible yields and the produced [F]FES could be used to monitor in-vivo human estrogen receptor α ligand binding domain gene expression using PET images.
