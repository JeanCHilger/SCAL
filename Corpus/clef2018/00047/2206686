Coronary angiography and thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography in multiple vessel coronary artery disease. Polar presentations of selective coronary angiography and myocardial 201Tl SPECT were compared in 141 patients with multiple vessel disease, 80 with 3-vessel disease, 34 with 2-vessel disease and 27 post-bypass patients. Perfusion defects were present in 125/141 patients (89%) and were located within the area supplied by 194/359 stenotic arteries (54%) and 9 non-stenotic arteries. The type and extent of disease was correctly indicated by 201Tl SPECT in 16/80 patients (20%) with 3-vessel disease, 5/34 patients (15%) with 2-vessel disease and 8/27 post-bypass patients (30%). Perfusion defects indicated the artery with the most severe lesion in 107/125 patients (86%). False negative isotope studies were present in 15 patients (11%).
