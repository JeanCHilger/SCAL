In colorectal liver metastases, the presence of extrahepatic disease correlates with the pathology of the primary tumour. Background. FDG-PET scan detects extrahepatic metastases in 20% of patients with colorectal liver metastases but it is reported to have approximately 16% false negative rates. Patients and Methods. Patients who had PET scan for metastatic colorectal cancer at Westmead Hospital between March 2006 and March 2010 were reviewed retrospectively. The results of PET scan were correlated with tumour characteristics that were thought to affect the overall prognosis. Results. Degree of tumour differentiation and vascular invasion were significantly predictive for the presence of extrahepatic disease on PET scan, also did the level of CEA. Conclusion. The detection of extrahepatic disease in colorectal liver metastases correlates with the biologic behaviour of the primary tumour. Poorly differentiated tumours and those with lymphovascular invasion behave in aggressive fashion and likely to have wide-spread metastases. This should be considered when contemplating liver resection for colorectal metastases.
