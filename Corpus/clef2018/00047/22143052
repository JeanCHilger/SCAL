Imaging in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The review focuses on recent achievements obtained by means of imaging techniques in clinical and experimental studies on acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).The review focuses on four imaging techniques: computed tomography (CT), PET, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and ultrasound, highlighting the most recent developments for each technique. Whereas CT and ultrasound are primarily based on detection of density, EIT and PET are aimed at providing more functional data.Major improvements were recently obtained in imaging structure and several functions of the lungs, with the potential of positively impacting the clinical practice.
