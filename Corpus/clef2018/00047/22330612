Multimodality imaging in interventional cardiology. 'Multimodality' imaging--the side-by-side interpretation of data obtained from various noninvasive imaging techniques, such as echocardiography, radionuclide techniques, multidetector CT (MDCT), and MRI--allows anatomical, morphological, and functional data to be combined, increases diagnostic accuracy, and improves the efficacy of cardiovascular interventions and clinical outcomes. During the past decade, advances in software and hardware have allowed co-registration of various imaging modalities, resulting in cardiac 'hybrid' or 'fusion' imaging. In this Review, we discuss the roles of both multimodality and hybrid imaging in three broad areas of cardiology--coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, and valvular heart disease. In the evaluation of CAD, integration of either single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or PET with CT coronary angiography provides both morphological and functional data in a single procedure. Accordingly, the functional consequences (myocardial hypoperfusion on SPECT or PET) of anatomical pathology (coronary anatomy on MDCT or MRI) can be assessed. Co-registration of PET and MRI data sets to provide cellular and molecular information on plaque composition and stability is now possible. Furthermore, novel imaging modalities have been implemented to guide electrophysiological and transcatheter-based procedures, such as cardiac resynchronization therapy (an established treatment for patients with heart failure), and transcatheter valve repair or replacement procedures.
