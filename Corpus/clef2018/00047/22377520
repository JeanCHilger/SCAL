MRI/SPECT-based diagnosis and CT-guided high-intensity focused-ultrasound treatment system in MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of dopamine transporters with (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 has recently been proposed to offer valuable information for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a newly developed technique in which the energy of ultrasound wave is directed to a focused spot for the purpose treatment of PD. This study presents a diagnosis and image-guided system using HIFU to treat the mouse with PD under a designed stereotactic frame. The system comprises two key components: an automatic atlas-based SPECT/MRI image registration module for diagnosis and a stereotactic CT-guided module for HIFU treatment. The SPECT/MR image registration here is important in the non-invasive examination of the dopamine concentration in vivo. From the experimental results, the image registration module proves to have comparable performance to that derived from manual drawing by experts. In addition, the stereotactic CT-guided module achieved a positioning accuracy to within 2mm on the average, which is acceptable for the purpose of HIFU treatment.
