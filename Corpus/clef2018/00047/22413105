Sources and resources for oncologists to help answer the question: is PET/CT appropriate for my patient? Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)-subsequently referred to as PET/CT is  emerging as a critically important diagnostic tool in oncology. There has been a substantial increase in the utilization of this modality over the last decade. The optimal imaging protocols are, however, still not established which results in considerable confusion and uncertainty among referring physicians and providers. Oncologists, hematologists and other physicians managing oncologic patients frequently face the dilemma of whether or not to order a PET/CT scan for their patients. The large body of evidence from clinical research often overwhelms the ability of physicians to stay adequately informed on the disease specific performance of PET/CT. Moreover, regulatory agencies  have changed their requirements for reimbursement of PET/CT scans in an effort to curtail health care expenditures. In this article we attempt to inform users and providers about the appropriate use of this  technology.
