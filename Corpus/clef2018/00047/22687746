A new facile synthetic route to [11C]GSK189254, a selective PET radioligand for imaging of CNS histamine H3 receptor. GSK189254 and its corresponding precursor GSK185071B were synthesized from 3-methoxyphenylacetic acid with 6-chloropyridine-3-carbolic acid or 6-chloronicotinamide in 8 and 7 steps with either 6% or 7% and either 14% or 16% yield, respectively. [(11)C]GSK189254 was prepared from GSK185071B with [(11)C]CH(3)OTf through N-[(11)C]methylation and isolated by HPLC combined with solid-phase extraction (SPE) in 50-60% radiochemical yield based on [(11)C]CO(2) and decay corrected to end of bombardment (EOB), with 370-740 GBq/Î¼mol specific activity at EOB.
