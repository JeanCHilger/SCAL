Seroprevalence of subtype H3 influenza A virus in South Korean cats. To investigate the potential transmission of subtype H3 influenza virus to cats, a serological survey was carried out in South Korea. Serum samples (n=1027) were obtained from 809 pet cats and 218 domesticated cats living in urban colonies (D-cats) from 2008 to 2010, and tested using an influenza anti-nucleoprotein (NP)-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, which was recommended by the World Organization for Animal Health. Anti-influenza virus antibodies were detected in 3.12% and 2.43% of cat sera tested using the NP-specific ELISA and HI test, respectively. Anti-H3 antibodies were also identified when the HI assay was used for influenza virus serotyping. These data may indicate the sporadic transmission of subtype H3 influenza virus from other infected species to cats in South Korea.
