Design and rationale of low-dose erythropoietin in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (EPO-AMI-II study): a randomized controlled clinical trial. The development of novel pharmaceutical interventions to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is an unmet medical need worldwide. In animal models, a single intravenous administration of erythropoietin (EPO) during reperfusion improves left ventricular (LV) function in the chronic stage. However, the results of recent proof-of-concept trials using high-dose EPO in patients with STEMI are inconsistent. In our pilot study, low-dose EPO after successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) improved the LV ejection fraction (EF) and did not trigger severe adverse clinical events in patients with STEMI. One possible reason for this discrepancy is the dose of EPO used.We have started a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trial (EPO-AMI-II) to clarify the safety and efficacy of low-dose EPO in patients with STEMI. STEMI patients who have a low LVEF (<50 %) will be randomly assigned to intravenous administration of placebo or EPO (6,000 or 12,000 IU) within 6 h after successful PCI. The primary endpoint is the difference in LVEF between the acute and chronic phases (6 months), as measured by single-photon emission computed tomography. The patient number needed for EPO-AMI-II is 600. The study will stop when superior efficacy or futility is detected by an interim analysis. This study has been approved by the Evaluation System of Investigational Medical Care.EPO-AMI-II study will clarify the safety and efficacy of low-dose EPO in STEMI patients with LV dysfunction in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.
