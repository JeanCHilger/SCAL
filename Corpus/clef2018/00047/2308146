Neuronal mapping of the heart with 6-[18F]fluorometaraminol. The false neurotransmitter metaraminol labeled with fluorine-18 has been used to noninvasively assess regional adrenergic nerve density in the canine heart. Intravenous administration of 6-[18F]fluorometaraminol (FMR) results in high, selective accumulation of radioactivity in the heart drug blocking studies with desipramine and reserpine confirm the neuronal locus of FMR. Iodine-125 labeled metaraminol, however, shows no selective accumulation in the canine heart. Positron emission tomography (PET) analyses with FMR of closed-chest dogs bearing left ventricular neuronal defects clearly delineate the region of neuronal impairment
