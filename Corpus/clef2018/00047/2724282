Client profile of an animal companion practice. The aim of the study was to gather demographic information from consulting clients, to compile a profile of the typical companion animal client in South Africa. This method differed from other studies in that information was collected from actual clients and not from pet owners. Completed questionnaires (n = 612) were received back from veterinary practices (n = 120) in South Africa. The data was processed by a computer. Questionnaires were completed on a voluntary basis and were anonymous. The typical client in this survey was a young married woman, with one or two children, living in a suburban home, with an average income and 2 companion animals. The most common companion animal presented, proved to be a miniature breed of dog. The advantage of this study is that veterinarians may use it to prepare themselves in terms of the most common type of client as well as of a variety of other types. The client profile also gives an indication of the level at which consultations should be conducted, and may aid the veterinarian in developing a specific sensitivity towards certain clients.
