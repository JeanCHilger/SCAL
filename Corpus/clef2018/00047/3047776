Nuclear medicine: SPECT comparisons to PET. Early comparisons between PET and SPECT imaging of the brain, therefore, confirm that SPECT is capable of revealing information about regional brain function and metabolism at a much lower cost and degree of complexity. While PET will continue to play a leading role in research, SPECT imaging will increasingly be used clinically to evaluate functional disorders of the brain.
