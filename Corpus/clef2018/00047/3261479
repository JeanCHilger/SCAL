Osteonecrosis of the femur head. Comparative studies on methods for early diagnosis. Compared to the computerized tomography and bone scintigraphy with additional single photon emission tomography the Magnetic-Resonance-Tomography shows early pre-radiological stages in cases of femoral head necrosis which cannot be seen neither by computerized tomography nor by usual x-ray. Compared to this the bone scintigraphy shows early stages similarly, but the topographic coordination and specific diagnosis is impossible.
