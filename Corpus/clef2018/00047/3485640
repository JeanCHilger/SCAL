Strategies for in vivo measurement of receptor binding using positron emission tomography. Dopaminergic ligands labeled with positron-emitting radionuclides have been synthesized for quantitative evaluation of dopaminergic binding in vivo. Two different methods, the explicit method and an operationally simplified ratio method, have been proposed for analysis of these positron emission tomographic (PET) data. The basis for both methods is the same three-compartment model. The two methods differ in the assumptions necessary for practical implementation. We have compared these two approaches using PET data obtained in our laboratory. Sequential scans and serial arterial blood samples from a baboon following intravenous injection of [18F]spiroperidol were collected. Application of the two methods to the same data yielded different values for corresponding parameters. Values calculated by the ratio method for the specific rate constant describing receptor binding varied depending upon the time after tracer injection, thus demonstrating an internal inconsistency in this approach. Tracer metabolism markedly affected the binding measurements calculated with either method and thus cannot be ignored. Our results indicate that the adoption of simplifying assumptions for operational convenience can lead to substantial errors and must be done with caution. Alternatively, we present simple new analytical solutions of the tracer conservation equations describing the complete, unsimplified three-compartment model that vastly reduce the computations necessary to implement the explicit method.
