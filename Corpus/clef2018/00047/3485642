Calcium antagonist (PY 108-068) treatment may further decrease flow in ischemic areas in acute stroke. The effect of the possible influence of a new calcium antagonist, PY 108-068, on regional CBF was studied in patients suffering acute ischemic stroke. The dosage was 1.5 + 2.5 mg intravenously in six patients (series 1) and 2.5 + 5.0 mg intravenously in five other patients (series 2). CBF was measured before and after treatment by xenon-133 inhalation and single-photon emission computed tomography (Tomomatic 64). In the first series, no changes in hemispheric CBF, MABP, or clinical symptoms were noted after treatment, but one patient showed an increase of CBF in part of the periinfarct area. In the second series, slight increases in mean hemispheric flow values were seen, but in three of the five patients CBF decreased even further in the ischemic area. MABP decreased by 13%, and the clinical symptoms were unchanged.
