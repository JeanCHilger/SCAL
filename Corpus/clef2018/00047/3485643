Regional cerebral glucose transport in insulin-dependent diabetic patients studied using [11C]3-O-methyl-D-glucose and positron emission tomography. Regional cerebral [11C]3-O-methyl-D-glucose ([11C]MeG) uptake kinetics have been measured in five insulin-dependent diabetic patients and four normal controls using positron emission tomography (PET). Concomitant measurement of regional cerebral blood volume and CBF enabled corrections for the presence of intravascular [11C]MeG signal in cerebral regions of interest to be carried out, and regional cerebral [11C]MeG unidirectional extraction fractions to be computed. Four of the five diabetic subjects were studied with their fasting plasma glucose level clamped at a normoglycaemic level (4 mM), and four were studied at hyperglycaemic plasma glucose levels (mean 13 mM). The four diabetic subjects whose fasting plasma glucose levels were clamped at a normoglycaemic level of 4 mM had mean fasting whole-brain, cortical, and white matter [11C]MeG extraction fractions of 15, 15, and 16%, respectively, values similar to those found for the four normal controls (whole brain, 14% cortex, 13%
