PET studies of cerebral glucose metabolism in idiopathic torticollis. Regional cerebral glucose metabolism was studied in 16 patients with idiopathic torticollis, using positron emission tomography. Analysis of subcortical regions revealed no consistent focal abnormality of cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, but there was a bilateral breakdown of the normal relationships between the thalamus and basal ganglia. The findings suggest disruption of the pallidothalamic projections in this focal dystonia and may imply a disturbance of GABA.
