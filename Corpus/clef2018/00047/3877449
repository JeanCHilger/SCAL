Measurement of left ventricular volume using single-photon emission computed tomography. A count-based method for measuring left ventricular (LV) volume using technetium-99m-labeled red cells and ungated single-photon emission computed tomography is described. The tomographic slices were used to determine the counts per milliliter in the center of the left ventricle and total LV counts, which were used to derive mean LV volume. End-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were calculated from the mean volume using the LV time-activity curve from planar gated blood pool images. Phantom evaluation with simulated LV volumes (50 to 400 ml) in air, in a phantom filled with water, with 10% background, and with a simulated right ventricle, showed excellent accuracy. For clinical validation, 30 patients underwent electrocardiographically gated planar and nongated tomographic acquisition of the cardiac blood pool followed by single-plane cineangiography. For end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes combined, the correlation with cineangiography showed a standard error of the estimate (SEE) of 24 ml and 14 ml, respectively. Mean intra- and interobserver deviation was 12 ml and 14 ml (SEE 13 ml and 16 ml), respectively. It is concluded that this noninvasive count-based technique, requiring no assumptions regarding LV geometry, is an accurate and reproducible way to measure LV volume.
