The use of an inexpensive, general purpose microcomputer in quantitative cytochemistry. A 32K Commodore Pet microcomputer has been interfaced with two Vickers microdensitometers. This system allows for the simultaneous logging of data from two densitometers being operated independently of each other. Software for the statistical analysis of data generated by the densitometers, and for use with the cytochemical bioassay of hormones, is described. The densitometer/Pet system is relatively cheap, reliable, and readily adaptable to other applications.
