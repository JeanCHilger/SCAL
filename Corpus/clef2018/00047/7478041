Dipyridamole echocardiography and 99mTc-MIBI spect dipyridamole scintigraphy for cardiac evaluation prior to peripheral vascular surgery. Coronary artery disease accounts for most of the early and late mortality and morbidity associated with vascular surgery. Cardiac pre-operative evaluation is mandatory for the assessment of cardiac risk. The aim of this study is to compare dipyridamole scintigraphy with 99mTc-MIBI (MIBI-dipy) and dipyridamole echocardiography (ECHO-dipy) and to evaluate their capability in identifying cardiac risk for strong events such as death, unstable angina or myocardial infarction. METHODS. Sixty consecutive patients (mean age 67 +/- 7) were enrolled. 52 performed ECHO-dipy, 51 MIBI-dipy. 40 patients went to aorto-femoral or aorto-iliac graft replacement and 15 to vascular angioplasty. Five patients did not undergo surgery. RESULTS. Eighteen patients (30%) had stress defects and 9 patients also rest defects with MIBI-dipy. Six patients new asinergic areas at ECHO-dipy. Three pts died in the first year follow-up for a cerebrovascular event, a myocardial infarction and a sudden death respectively. Sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive value were 100%, 69%, 16%, 100% for MIBI-dipy and 66%, 94%, 40%, 98% for ECHO-dipy. CONCLUSIONS. As other authors reported, stress scintigraphy is a pre-operative test showing high sensitivity but with no satisfying specificity. Stress echocardiography, in our population, can produce a good negative predictive value. It is a less expensive and widespread clinical tool useful in the evaluation of preoperative patients. Its positive predictive power is not satisfying but it is shared with all non-invasive pre-operative tests available now.
