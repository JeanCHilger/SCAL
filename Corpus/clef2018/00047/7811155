Postinfarction hibernating myocardium. The detection of hibernating myocardium after infarction is important because it justifies the discussion concerning the revascularisation of infarcted zones irrigated by occluded or severely stenosed vessels, but with an adequate collateral circulation to allow hibernation. The detection of hibernating myocardium is particularly important in patients without the classical indications for revascularisation, such as residual spontaneous ischaemia or ischaemia provoked by exercise or pharmacological stress testing. All techniques currently in use tend to overestimate the size of the necrosed, fibrous scar, compared with the amount of viable myocardium. Improved regional myocardial function after revascularisation is the most convincing proof of hibernating myocardium but it can only be obtained retrospectively. The detection of a reserve of contractility in the necrosed territory by an inotropic stimulus is well adapted to the demonstration of stunned myocardium but this method has not been proved in hibernating myocardium. Thallium scintigraphy is certainly useful in the prospective diagnosis of hibernating myocardium but the protocol of examination should be adapted to this specific problem. There is little available data concerning the evaluation of hibernating myocardium by positron emission tomography: the technical advantages of this method in assessing myocardial viability should enable a more accurate evaluation of post-infarction hibernating myocardium. Adequate revascularisation of necrosed territories depends on a deeper understanding and more precise prospective assessment of postinfarction hibernating myocardium.
