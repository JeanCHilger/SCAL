Sensitization to thimerosal (Merthiolate) is still present today. The results on thimerosal (Merthiolate) hypersensitivity of a retrospective study, together with the relevant data on thimerosal hypersensitivity referred to in the literature up to 1993, are presented. Positive patch test reactions to thimerosal (0.1% pet.) were observed in 32 (1.3%) of 2461 adult patients with suspected contact allergy examined in the period 1987-1992. 20 (0.8%) patients had a solitary positive patch test to thimerosal. The observed incidence is low. Clinical symptoms related to thimerosal hypersensitivity were observed in only 3 patients. The collected results are discussed with emphasis on the clinical implications of sensitization to thimerosal. It appears that a positive patch test to thimerosal is frequently clinically irrelevant.
