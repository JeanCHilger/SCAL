Transcranial Doppler is valid for determination of the lower limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. This study validates transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) for determination of the lower limit of cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation and establishes a relation between global CBF and mean flow velocity (Vmean) in the middle cerebral artery.Relative changes in CBF and in Vmean were compared in 12 normal volunteers (2 women and 10 men median age, 30 years [range, 21 to 61 years]). Catheters was placed in the left radial artery and in the bulb of the right internal jugular vein, respectively. Baseline CBF was measured by single-photon emission computed tomography scanningMAP values between 122 (range, 110 to 140) and 48 (range, 34 to 75) mm Hg were measured. The lower limit of autoregulation (the blood pressure under which autoregulation is off) as determined by Vmean did not differ significantly from that determined by relative changes in global CBF: 91 (range, 41 to 108) and 79 (range, 53 to 113) mm Hg, respectively. A significant correlation between Vmean and relative changes in global CBF was demonstrated below the lower limit of autoregulation (R2 = .73, P < .001 CBF = -6.3 + 1.0.Vmean). Above the lower limit both values were stable.TCD is valid for determination of the lower limit of CBF autoregulation, and changes in CBF may be reliably evaluated by TCD during changes in cerebral perfusion pressure in normal subjects.
