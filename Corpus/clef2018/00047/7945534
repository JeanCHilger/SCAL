Effect of sumatriptan on cerebral blood flow in the baboon model. Changes in cerebral blood flow are implicated to be important in the pathophysiology of migraine. Furthermore, serotonin (5-HT) is known to be the most important substance in the etiology of migraine. Sumatriptan (CAS 103628-46-2), a 5-HTID receptor agonist was recently introduced in the treatment of migraine. In the present study a baboon model was used to investigate the changes in cerebral blood flow due to anaesthesia and pharmacological interventions using 99mTc-labelled hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The effect of sumatriptan on cerebral blood flow was investigated after 10 min and again after 23 min, with the animal under anaesthesia, i.e. induction with ketamine and maintenance on thiopental. Sumatriptan did not alter the cerebral blood flow during the 10 min procedure. However, sumatriptan reversed the increased cerebral blood flow due to the prolonged anaesthesia (23 min), lowering the cerebral blood flow by more than 20%. No significant changes in the biochemical parameters (blood pressure, heart rate, pO2 and pCO2) were observed. These results also suggest that sumatriptan reverses the increased cerebral blood flow most likely via 5-HTID receptor stimulation.
