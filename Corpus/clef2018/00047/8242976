Myocardial SPECT and left ventricular performance study using a single Tc-99m teboroxime injection. Comparison with thallium-201 myocardial SPECT. Myocardial SPECT using teboroxime was compared to thallium SPECT in 26 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Agreement between thallium SPECT and teboroxime SPECT for the identification of myocardial segments was 209/235 (89%). A significant correlation was found in 15 patients between the left ventricular ejection fraction by teboroxime first-pass study and the ejection fraction by contrast ventriculography. In nine patients with myocardial infarction and/or multivessel coronary artery disease, the ejection fraction revealed a mean decrease from 0.52 at rest to 0.46 at exercise. Teboroxime makes it possible to perform an exercise first-pass study of left ventricular ejection fraction followed by myocardial perfusion imaging.
