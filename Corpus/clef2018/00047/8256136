Scintigraphic evaluation of the growth plate. Multiphase bone scintigraphy is used to assess growth plate function in the growing skeleton. It can identify an evolving total or segmental closure by comparing an affected plate with a contralateral normal plate. Although visual interpretation is usually adequate, quantitative methods permit a more objective assessment. Total or partial closure occurs in response to trauma and infection plate closure also may be induced surgically to prevent progressive leg length inequality. As new orthopaedic procedures for correcting early plate closure are developed, the need for accurate physiological assessment of the growth plate is critical.
