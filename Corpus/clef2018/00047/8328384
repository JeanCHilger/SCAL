Regional systolic function, myocardial blood flow and glucose uptake at rest in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Decreased 18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake and blood flow at rest in the ventricular septum, as compared with the lateral wall, have been reported in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC). To assess whether regional metabolic heterogeneity in patients with HC is related to heterogeneous regional systolic function, 10 symptomatic patients (mean age 36 +/- 17 years) with HC and no coronary artery disease underwent positron emission tomography with oxygen-15-water and FDG, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging at rest to assess regional anatomy and systolic function. Regional absolute blood flow was similar between the ventricular septum and lateral wall. In contrast, FDG activity was significantly greater in the lateral wall than in the septum (1,023 +/- 588 vs 767 +/- 388 nCi/ml, respectively p < 0.01). However, regional systolic wall thickening was also significantly greater in the lateral wall than in the septum (5.3 +/- 4.3 vs 2.4 +/- 4.0 mm, respectively
