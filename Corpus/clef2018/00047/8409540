Non-invasive assessment of residual viability in post-myocardial infarction patients. Role of nuclear techniques. The failure of non-imaging techniques in identifying viable segments has favoured the clinical application of nuclear imaging. The main pathways that support radionuclide imaging are cell membrane integrity, persistence of intermediary metabolism and demonstration of a residual coronary reserve. Thallium-201 reinjection or rest protocols allow the identification of viable myocardium in most of patients with wall motion abnormalities and appear to be the most diffuse, low-cost and available method to detect viable myocardium. More complex approaches use positron emission tomography and matched flow/metabolic information. Flow/metabolic 'mismatch' usually identifies most of hypoperfused regions that show post-operative improvement of regional wall motion. The last promising approach is represented by the demonstration of a maintained regional coronary reserve in dyssynergic areas. Technetium-99m-microspheres (or Teboroxime in the future) can be successfully used for this purpose. The clinical application of radionuclides appears to be one of the principal imaging tools able to identify residual viability.
