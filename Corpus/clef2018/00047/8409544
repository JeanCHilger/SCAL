The role of scintigraphic techniques in the evaluation of functional results of coronary bypass grafting and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Scintigraphic techniques can be used first, to guide appropriate referral for interventional procedures, and second to predict the effect of revascularization on regional perfusion and function prior to the intervention, thereby being able to assess efficacy of revascularization and to assess whether ischemia is the origin of recurrence of symptoms. Of increasing importance is the ability of nuclear techniques to identify those myocardial regions with abnormal function which might benefit from revascularization by showing improvement in regional wall motion. Positron emission tomography is considered to be the gold standard to assess regional myocardial perfusion and metabolism. The introduction of the reinjection technique makes 201Tl-scintigraphy the method of choice to detect jeopardized myocardium and to guide appropriate referral for revascularization procedures in those institutes where PET is not available. Even when the costly PET-instrumentation is available, cost-benefit analysis is indicated to assess the additional value of PET compared with 201Tl reinjection imaging.
