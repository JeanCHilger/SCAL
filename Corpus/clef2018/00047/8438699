Assessment of myocardial fatty acid metabolism with positron emission tomography at rest and during dobutamine infusion in patients with coronary artery disease. The myocardial clearance rate of C-11 palmitate as an index of fatty acid oxidation was assessed by means of positron emission tomography (PET) at rest and during dobutamine infusion in seven normal subjects and 10 patients with coronary artery disease. In the normal subjects the clearance half time was homogeneous in the left ventricle at rest and uniformly shortened during dobutamine infusion. In the myocardium at risk, clearance half time tends to be longer in the segments with an abnormal Q wave on ECG, exhibiting regional wall motion abnormality, and supplied by severely stenosed coronary arteries, particularly during dobutamine infusion. These data indicate that fatty acid oxidation may be decreased in infarcted myocardium and associated with regional asynergy. Such an abnormality was most striking in those with severe coronary stenosis during dobutamine infusion. We conclude that PET with the use of C-11 palmitate at rest and during dobutamine is a useful means of identifying impaired fatty acid oxidation and decreased metabolic reserve in patients with coronary artery disease.
