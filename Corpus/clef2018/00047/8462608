Sympathetic innervation of the left ventricle is impaired in arrhythmogenic right ventricular disease. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular disease (ARVD) is a disease of unknown origin that primarily affects the right ventricle and is characterized by ventricular tachyarrhythmias which may lead to syncope and even, though rarely, sudden cardiac death. In 25 patients with ARVD, sympathetic innervation of the left ventricle was assessed by iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine single photon emission tomography (123I-MIBG SPET). In addition, thallium-201 SPET was performed. The diagnosis of ARVD was made by an electrophysiological study and right and left heart catheterization including right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. Ischaemic heart disease was excluded by coronary angiography. A group of seven patients without any evidence of heart disease served as a control group. Twenty-two of the 25 patients showed reduced uptake of 123I-MIBG. The abnormal areas were located predominantly in posterior and posteroseptal segments of the heart. No focus of increased 123I-MIBG activity could be demonstrated. No patient had signs of left ventricular involvement on left ventricular angiography. In contrast to the results of the 123I-MIBG SPET, those of 201T1 SPET were normal in 16 patients. The remaining nine patients showed areas of slight hypoperfusion not correlated with the reduced 123I-MIBG uptake. 123I-MIBG scintigraphy allows detection of left ventricular adrenergic dysinnervation in ARVD patients without morphological or functional abnormalities of the left ventricle.
