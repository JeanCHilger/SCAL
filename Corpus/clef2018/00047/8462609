Prospective evaluation of thallium-201 reinjection in single-vessel coronary patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. Twenty-two patients with single-vessel left anterior descending coronary artery disease were investigated by means of dipyridamole stress thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, using single photon emission tomography (SPET), 1 week before and 2-5 weeks after coronary bypass surgery. The dose of dipyridamole was 0.56 mg/kg, and the injected activity of 201Tl was 74 MBq. Before surgery, and after completion of the redistribution study, a further 37 MBq of 201Tl was injected. Ten minutes and 1 h later, repeated SPET imaging were performed. SPET images were evaluated both subjectively and semiquantitatively, using a five-grade segmental defect score system, with higher scores for more severe perfusion defects. Before surgery, the 3-h redistribution images revealed complete or partial persistence of the perfusion defects in all patients. On the images taken 10 min after reinjection, these defects were completely filled in four cases, and partially filled in ten cases. Further positive changes were observed on the 1-h post-reinjection images in four cases. Three of the 1-h post-reinjection images exhibited a paradox redistribution. The stress images after surgery corresponded well to the 201Tl distribution on the preoperative 1-h post-reinjection images in 11 cases. The average of the segmental defect severity scores was 17.0 after stress, 10.1 at rest, 7.1 10 min after reinjection and 6.4 1 h after reinjection. After surgery, the average of both the post-stress and the 3-h redistribution scores was 3.1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
