FDG-PET evaluation of therapeutic effects on VX2 liver tumor. Transplanted VX2 liver tumor in the rabbit is an experimental liver tumor model in which 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) accumulates to a 3.5-fold level that surrounds normal liver tissue. In this study, changes in FDG uptake were assessed in this liver tumor model after transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) and radiotherapy.Fifteen rabbits bearing VX2 liver tumors were treated with TAE with gelatin sponges 1 day before the FDG study, and 18 rabbits received local irradiation with electron beams at a dose of 12-36 Gy 1-10 days before the FDG study. In the FDG study, serial arterial blood sampling was performed to determine arterial input (AI), and 1 hr after tracer injection, normal liver tissue and tumor tissue were excised to measure radioactivity. The tumor FDG level per AI and the tumor-to-normal liver ratio were assessed. Dynamic PET images were obtained in 20 of the 46 rabbits.Tumor FDG uptake was significantly decreased 1 day after TAE (from 3.54 to 0.83 in the tumor-to-normal liver ratio) and 5 days after 30 Gy of irradiation (from 3.54 to 1.28). The decrease in tumor FDG uptake was dose-dependent, especially in the relatively low dose range (12-24 Gy). The untreated tumors could be clearly distinguished from the surrounding normal liver tissue, while the embolized tumors or the irradiated tumors were not clearly delineated. Histological analysis showed that the decrease in tumor FDG after treatment agreed well with the decrease in number of viable tumor cells.The VX2 liver tumor is an appropriate experimental tumor model for evaluating the change in FDG uptake in various therapeutic modalities. Moreover, the therapeutic effects can be assessed 1 day after TAE and 5 days after irradiation. Further clinical trials for the early evaluation of therapeutic effects on liver tumors using FDG-PET are warranted.
