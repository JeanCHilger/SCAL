Difference in response of D2 receptor binding between 11C-N-methylspiperone and 11C-raclopride against anesthetics in rhesus monkey brain. The effects of anesthesia on dopamine D2 receptor binding in the rhesus monkey brain were examined using positron emission tomography. The bindings of 11C-N-methylspiperone (NMSP) and 11C-raclopride (RAC) were measured under controlled ketamine or isoflurane anesthesia. The binding of 11C-NMSP was significantly lower in the striatum anesthetized with isoflurane than with ketamine. There was a smaller change in the binding of 11C-RAC than of 11C-NMSP. These findings suggest that changes in 11C-NMSP or 11C-RAC binding induced by anesthetics were not due solely to changes in the competition of endogenous dopamine.
