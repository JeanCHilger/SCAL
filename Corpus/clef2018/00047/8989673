Quantitative comparison of single-isotope and dual-isotope stress-rest single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging for reversibility of defects. Dual-isotope rest/stress single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging is a time-saving imaging protocol. However, the stress radiotracer, technetium 99m-labeled sestamibi, and the rest radiotracer, thallium 201, have different physical properties and myocardial kinetics. In patients with abnormal resting myocardial perfusion, these differences may affect quantification of rest defect size and defect reversibility. The purpose of the study was to compare myocardial perfusion defect reversibility quantitatively by single-isotope (rest/stress sestamibi) and dual-isotope (rest thallium/stress sestamibi) SPECT.Thirty patients with prior myocardial infarction underwent rest/stress sestamibi SPECT imaging and rest thallium SPECT imaging. Defects were quantified according to circumferential count profiles with a normal sestamibi database. The images of a subgroup of 21 patients were processed with radiotracer-specific normal databases. Defect size and defect reversibility were compared quantitatively for single-isotope and dual-isotope SPECT. Rest sestamibi defect size was significantly larger than rest thallium defect size (19 +/- 15 vs 14 +/- 16 p = 0.007). Defect reversibility was larger with thallium than with sestamibi (10 +/- 9 vs 6 +/- 6In patients with prior myocardial infarction, stress-induced defect reversibility is quantitatively larger with dual-isotope imaging than with single-isotope imaging. Quantitative processing of dual-isotope images requires radiotracer-specific normal databases. Because of different characteristics of sestamibi and thallium, assessment of defect reversibility on dual-isotope images should be made with caution. Only relatively large defect reversibility can be assumed to represent true stress-induced myocardial ischemia.
