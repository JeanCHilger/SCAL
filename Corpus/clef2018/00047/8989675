Abnormal myocardial uptake and clearance of 123I-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine in patients with chronic renal failure and autonomic dysfunction. Patients with chronic renal failure were evaluated with 123I-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy to investigate the relationship between abnormal findings on MIBG scintigrams and autonomic dysfunction.Eleven control subjects and 20 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) (serum creatinine level > 8 mg/dl) were evaluated by MIBG myocardial scintigraphy and power spectral analysis (PSA) of the R-R fluctuations of the electrocardiogram. Subjects with CRF were divided into two groups: without (CRF1 nine patients) or with (CRF2Alterations in MIBG scintigrams are seen in patients with autonomic dysfunction in CRF and may be useful for evaluating cardiac sympathetic dysfunction in those patients.
