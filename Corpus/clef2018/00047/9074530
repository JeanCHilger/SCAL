Rest-redistribution thallium-201 and rest technetium-99m-sestamibi SPECT in patients with stable coronary artery disease and ventricular dysfunction. Resting sestamibi uptake was compared with 201Tl rest-redistribution uptake in 48 patients with ischemic heart disease and regional ventricular asynergies.In 48 patients, rest/4-hr redistribution 201Tl and resting sestamibi tomography were closely performed on separate days. Segmental tracer uptake was quantified. Wall motion in corresponding segments was also assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography in 17 patients.Quantitative analysis indicates that the uptake of the two tracers was comparable in normal segments as well as in segments with fixed 201Tl defects. In contrast, in segments with reversible 201Tl defects, sestamibi uptake was significantly lower than redistribution 201Tl uptake.In patients with chronic ischemic heart disease and regional asynergies, quantified sestamibi activity parallels 201Tl redistribution activity in normal segments and in those with fixed 201Tl defects. In segments showing reversible 201Tl defects, whether or not dysfunctioning, sestamibi uptake is significantly lower than 201Tl redistribution.
