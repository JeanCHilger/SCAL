Dobutamine stress echocardiography compared with exercise thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography in detecting coronary artery disease-effect of exercise level on accuracy. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and exercise thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were compared for the accuracy in detecting coronary artery disease (CAD) in 51 consecutive patients. Twenty-six (group 1) of the 51 patients achieved adequate exercise end points, and 25 (group 2) did not. There were 38 patients with angiographically documented CAD. The overall sensitivity of DSE and thallium-201 SPECT in detecting CAD was 92 and 76% (p = NS), and the specificity was 77 and 77% (p = NS), respectively. The sensitivity of DSE is the same as that of SPECT in group 1 (90 vs. 90% p = NS) and higher than that of SPECT in group 2 (94 vs. 61%
