Comparison between iodine 123 metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy and heart rate variability for the assessment of cardiac sympathetic activity in mild to moderate heart failure. This study demonstrates that in patients with mild to moderate heart failure, cardiac metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) washout positively correlates with normalized low-frequency power in the heart rate variability spectrum. Alterations of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system could be detected with MIBG scintigraphy in patients with normal plasma norepinephrine levels. Therefore cardiac MIBG washout may be a valuable noninvasive technique to assess early alterations in cardiac sympathetic activity that may have potential clinical implications in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.
