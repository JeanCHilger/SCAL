Typical normal cases and normal cases with abnormal image pattern in every myocardial SPECT radiopharmaceutical. Working group of cardiac nuclear medicine was made as a Japanese part of society of international cardiac nuclear medicine under the cooperation between Japanese society of nuclear medicine and Japanese society of cardiology. We investigated typical normal cases and normal cases with abnormal image pattern in every myocardial SPECT radiopharmaceutical as one of the research activity of working group. From 11 faculties, 16 T1 cases, 14 BMIPP cases, 8 MIBG cases, 8 MIBI cases and 14 tetrofosmin cases were submitted as typical normal cases, and 12 T1 cases, 5 BMIPP cases, 12 MIBG cases, 10 MIBI cases and 5 tetrofosmin cases were submitted as normal cases with abnormal image pattern. We summarized the condition of SPECT data acquisition of each faculties. And we added the discussion from literature about how to discriminate normal cases with abnormal image pattern from abnormal cases. In MIBG, patterns of typical normal cases and normal cases with abnormal image pattern were slightly different from other 4 pharmaceuticals. In other 4 pharmaceuticals, diaphragmatic attenuation, breast attenuation, apical thinning and others were presented as normal cases with abnormal image pattern.
