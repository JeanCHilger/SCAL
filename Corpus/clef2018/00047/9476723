123I]beta-CIT SPECT visualizes dopamine transporter loss in de novo parkinsonian patient. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia, which may be visualized by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in combination with the cocaine analog methyl-3-beta-(4-beta[123I]iodophenyl)tropane-2beta-carboxylate ([123I]beta-CIT). The aim of our study was to correlate findings of SPECT with clinical data of 34 previously untreated, idiopathic parkinsonian patients [age: 59.58+/-10.03 (mean+/-SD) years Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HYS) mean range: 1.97+/-0.83, ranges I-III
