Decade of the brain: neurological advances. In the last half century, neurological developments have been phenomenal and have escalated in this decade of the brain. Many infective disorders have been conquered, but AIDS has posed new challenges. Neuropharmacology has transformed the management of parkinsonism and epilepsy. New imaging techniques such as CT, NMR, PET and ultrasonic scanning have presented us with remarkable images of the nervous system in health and disease. Steroids control many autoimmune disorders beta-interferon and other new drugs have begun to influence multiple sclerosis. Intensive care has saved many of those with head injury or acute neurological disorders, and we have greatly improved methods of rehabilitation. There are still many incurable neurological disorders but none are untreatable. Today's discovery in basic science brings tomorrow's improvement in patient care, as is clearly shown by molecular genetics. Some neurological and neuromuscular diseases in which the causal gene or genes have been located and characterised and in which the missing or abnormal gene product has been identified will be mentioned, as well as the prospects of carrier detection, antenatal diagnosis and gene therapy.
