(+)-p-([18F]fluorobenzyl)spirotrozamicol [(+)-[18F]spiro-FBT]: synthesis and biological evaluation of a high-affinity ligand for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). (+)-1'-[4-Hydroxy-1-(4-fluorobenzyl)piperidin-3-yl]spiro[1H- indene-1,4'- piperidine] {(+)-Spiro-FBT}, a high-affinity vesicular acetylcholine transporter ligand, was labeled with fluorine-18, and evaluated in the rat and monkey. In the rat brain, (+)-[18F]Spiro-FBT accumulated preferentially in the striatum, hippocampus, and cortex, brains regions containing high-to-moderate densities of cholinergic terminals. However, due to rapid metabolism, no preferential accumulation of the radiotracer was observed in corresponding regions of the monkey brain. Consequently, rapid metabolism renders (+)-[18F]Spiro-FBT unsuitable for studying cholinergic function with positron emission tomography.
