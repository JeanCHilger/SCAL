Are brain functions really additive? Although Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies commonly subtract data obtained during two or more experimental conditions to decompose a complex task, there have been few opportunities to evaluate this approach directly. In the present study, PET was used to study three motor speech tasks selected such that two were constituent components of the third, making possible a direct examination of decomposition by subtraction. In Experiment 1, a group of 13 right-handed normal volunteers participated in three activation studies: syllable repetition phonation
