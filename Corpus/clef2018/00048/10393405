Mapping the ischaemic penumbra with PET: implications for acute stroke treatment. The ischaemic penumbra has been documented in the laboratory animal as a severely hypoperfused, non-functional, but still viable cortex surrounding the irreversibly damaged ischaemic core with elapsing time, more penumbra gets recruited into the core, while tissue reperfusion is able to stop this deleterious process until a certain point in time. As saving the penumbra should improve clinical outcome, it should constitute the main target of acute stroke therapy. In a series of PET studies performed 5-18 h after stroke onset, we were able to (i) document, for the first time in man, the existence of tissue fulfilling operational criteria for penumbra in about one third of the cases
