Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with 99mTC-sestamibi and gated SPECT and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with reinjection of 201Tl at 24 hours. Are the techniques comparable?. To compare the results obtained with 99mTc-sestamibi and gated-SPECT (gated SPECT in stress and rest) with 201Tl (stress, redistribution, and 24 hour reinjection SPECT).Twenty patients underwent two SPECT studies, one with 201Tl and the other with 99mTc-sestamibi.Using 201Tl as a reference, 177 segments were considered normal, 31 viable and 32 with myocardial necrosis. The overall concordance with 99mTc-sestamibi was 84.2%. In the subgroup of defects that improved after reinjection of 201Tl, it was much less (45%), even after wall thickness and movement (55%) were analyzed.The overall concordance between 201Tl scintigraphy compared to 99mTc-sestamibi is acceptable. Correlation is low in the viable segments with 99mTc-sestamibi, even after analyzing the Gated-SPECT.
