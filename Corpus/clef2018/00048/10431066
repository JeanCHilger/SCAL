Assessment of coronary revascularization with 99mTC-sestamibi SPECT. Quantitative analysis of segmentary perfusion. We analyzed the change in myocardial perfusion recovery after revascularization using Dipyridamole-99mTc-Sestamibi SPECT in 37 patients (mean age 59 years old 33 males), all of whom had wall motion abnormalities and 84% who had myocardial infarction. The perfusion defects were evaluated before the revascularization and at 64 days of the angioplasty in 18 cases and of the coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in 19 and were compared with a normal Dipyridamole database. The bullseye parameters were: decrease in severity, size and ischemia area of the defect and worsening of the defect. It was found that the defects decreased in an average of 31. 4% for extension and 35,8% for severity (with no significant differences between the 2 techniques)In patients with a high prevalence of myocardial infarction, revascularization obtained a moderate decrease in the perfusion defects and a significant ischemia decrease.
