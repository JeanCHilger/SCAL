The effect of trihexyphenidyl, an anticholinergic agent, on regional cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in patients with Parkinson's disease. Cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism were studied in six previously untreated patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) before and after anticholinergic treatment using positron emission tomography (PET) and compared with six controls. The PET study and an assessment of the disability and cognitive impairment were performed before and after administration of 6 mg trihexyphenidyl for 5 to 11 weeks. All PD patients showed improvements in motor symptoms after the trihexyphenidyl treatment. Cognitive function did not significantly differ between before and after trihexyphenidyl treatment. However, after trihexyphenidyl treatment, rCBF and rCMRO2 decreased by 15% in the striatum and by 10% in all cortical areas contralateral to predominantly symptomatic limbs, and by 10% in the ipsilateral striatum and all cortical areas, significantly below the values of controls in most cerebral cortices and striatum. These findings suggest that trihexyphenidyl inhibits the cortical cholinergic system and significantly decreases rCBF and rCMRO2 in the cerebral cortices without cognitive impairment in untreated patients with PD.
