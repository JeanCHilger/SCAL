SPECT and PET imaging of brain tumors. The unique capacity of measuring or visualizing intracellular biochemical processes allows nuclear medicine techniques to determine functional and metabolic activities of various disorders. This article describes the critical role of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of brain tumors beyond what can be achieved by anatomic methods.
