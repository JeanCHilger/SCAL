The effect of tumor size on F-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose and fluoroerythronitroimidazole uptake in a murine sarcoma model. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of tumor size on the uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and fluoroerythronitroimidazole (FETNIM) in a murine sarcoma model. ICR mice were xenografted with sarcoma 180 cell line and tumors were allowed to grow to a weight of 0.26-5.82 grams. 18F-FDG and 18F-FETNIM were injected intravenously in separate groups of mice, and after 1 hr, the tumors were excised and radiotracer uptake was measured. In another group of mice tumors were autoradiographically analyzed and subjected to H & E staining. In both the FDG and FETNIM group, per-gram radiotracer uptake by a tumor was inversely proportional to tumor weight. 18F-FETNIM correlated more (r = -0.593, p < 0.05) than 18F-FDG (r = -0.447, p < 0.05). Autoradiographic studies revealed that FDG accumulated in viable tumor areas, whereas FETNIM accumulated in both viable and partially necrotic areas. In the case of 18F-FETNIM, a direct correlation between tumor weight and the no-uptake-area to total-tumor-area was demonstrated. We concluded that increased tumor size is associated with decreased uptake of 18F-FDG and FETNIM, though this depends on the type of radiotracers and distribution of necrosis.
