Benzodiazepine receptor binding in Huntington's disease: [11C]flumazenil uptake measured using positron emission tomography. We used positron emission tomography and [11C]flumazenil to analyze the benzodiazepine receptor binding in symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of the Huntington's disease gene. We found an inverse relationship between [11C]flumazenil and [11C]raclopride binding in the putamen of symptomatic patients, and interpret this result as GABA receptor upregulation.
