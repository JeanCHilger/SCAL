Evaluation of the extension of cerebral gliomas by scintigraphy. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 201Tl and 123I-alpha-methyl tyrosine (123I-IMT) are routine methods for the evaluation of brain tumors. 123I-IMT transport across the blood brain barrier is mediated by an amino acid carrier, 201Tl accumulation is analogous to cerebral potassium uptake.To determine the differences in glioma extension as shown by the 2 methods, 17 patients with malignant gliomas were included in this comparative imaging study: astrocytoma III: n = 6, ependymoma III: n = 1, oligodendroglioma III: n = 1, glioblastoma IV: n = 9. The tomographic image sets were matched anatomically and the slices showing maximal tumor extension were identified in both image sets respectively. Tumor spread was compared visually and the tumor extension was quantified.In gliomas WHO III tumor extension was delineated significantly larger by 123I-IMT-SPECT than by 201Tl-SPECT (mean +/- SD: 816 +/- 281 pixels vs 600 +/- 220 pixels, n = 8, p < 0.05). The size of glioblastomas was shown in a comparable manner by the 2 methods (977 +/- 571 vs 1.051 +/- 588, n = 9, ns, p = 0.57), but there were considerable regional differences between the area of 201Tl uptake and amino acid retention. In the whole group a weak but significant negative correlation between intensity of 201Tl uptake on the one hand and a ratio of the area as depicted by 123I-IMT vs area as depicted by 201Tl on the other hand, was found (n = 17, r = 0.49, p < 0.05). Thus the differences in the delineation of areas became smaller with increasing 201Tl uptake.These preliminary data indicate that the extension of gliomas is depicted differently by the 2 methods. 123I-IMT-SPECT shows a larger tumor extension especially in gliomas WHO III. Since 201Tl uptake has previously been shown to correlate with disruption of the blood brain barrier, 123I-IMT-SPECT may delineate tumor parts without endothelial leakage. This additional information may be helpful in planning surgical or radiation therapy. The advantages of 123I-IMT in this respect decrease with increasing 201Tl uptake and with increasing malignancy.
