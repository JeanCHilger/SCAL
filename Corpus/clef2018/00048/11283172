Rapid N transport to pods and seeds in N-deficient soybean plants. Non-nodulated soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) plants were cultivated hydroponically under N-sufficient (5 mM NaNO(3)) or N-deficient (0.5 mM NaNO(3)) conditions. (13)N- or (15)N- labelled nitrate was fed to the cut end of the stems, and the accumulation of nitrate-derived N in the pods, nodes and stems was compared. Real-time images of (13)N distribution in stems, petioles and pods were obtained using a Positron Emitting Tracer Imaging System for a period of 40 min. The results indicated that the radioactivity in the pods of N-deficient plants was about 10 times higher than that of N-sufficient plants, although radioactivity in the stems and nodes of N-deficient versus N-sufficient plants was not different. A similar result was obtained by supplying (15)NO(3) to cut soybean shoots for 1 h. The fact that the N translocation into the pods from NO(3) fed to the stem base was much faster in N-deficient plants may be due to the strong sink activity of the pods in N-deficient plants. Alternatively, the redistribution of N from the leaves to the pods via the phloem may be accelerated in N-deficient plants. The temporal accumulation of (13)NO(3) in nodes was suggested in both N-sufficient and N-deficient plants. In one (13)NO(3) pulse-chase experiment, radioactivity in the stem declined rapidly after transferring the shoot from the (13)NO(3) solution to non-labelled NO(3) in contrast, the radioactivity in the node declined minimally during the same time period.
