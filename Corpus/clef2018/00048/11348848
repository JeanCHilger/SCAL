The Potential of F-18-FDG PET in Breast Cancer. Detection of Primary Lesions, Axillary Lymph Node Metastases, or Distant Metastases. This retrospective study was done to evaluate the utility of 2-[F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (F-18-FDG PET) in identifying primary and recurrent breast cancer and lymph node metastases. One hundred whole-body PET scans of 87 patients were reviewed. PET results obtained with F-18-FDG and an ECAT/EXACT-921 or an ECAT-931 (Siemens/CTI) were based on visual interpretation, or standardized uptake values (SUVs), related to histology and also compared to computerized tomography (CT) and mammography results. The sensitivity for PET in detecting primary (N = 35 studies) and recurrent breast cancer (N = 65 studies) was 96% and 85% with a specificity of 91% and 73%. The sensitivity for lymph node metastases at the time of initial diagnosis was 100% with a specificity of 100%. Quantitative SUV information did not improve the accuracy of F-18-FDG PET in identifying primary breast cancers. The results suggest that whole-body PET is useful in detecting recurrence or metastases, may be useful in detecting lymph node metastases prior to initial axillary lymph node dissection, but is less sensitive in excluding axillary lymph nodes metastases later in the course of the disease.
