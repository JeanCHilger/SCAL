Comparison of relative coronary Doppler flow velocity reserve to stress myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with coronary artery disease. To compare relative coronary artery vasodilator reserve (rCVR = CVRtarget/CVRreference) to myocardial perfusion stress imaging, 48 patients with coronary artery stenoses (61% +/- 16% mean, +/- SD
