A concise overview of recent breakthroughs in imaging of ALS. Numerous attempts have been made to visualize the motor cortex and pyramidal tract lesions in patients with ALS using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). This paper briefly reviews the applicability of these imaging modalities in ALS.
