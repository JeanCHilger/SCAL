Dissociable brain regions process object meaning and object structure during picture naming. Although imaging studies have indicated that the fusiform gyrus is important in tasks of picture naming, whether this region encodes an object's structure or its meaning is not clear. We used positron emission tomography to examine cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in response to a picture naming task that varied on two dimensions: familiarity (or difficulty: hard vs easy) and category (tools vs animals). Results show that although familiarity effects are present in the frontal and left lateral posterior temporal cortex, they are absent from the fusiform gyrus. This provides strong evidence that the processing carried out in the fusiform gyrus relates to an object's structure, not to its meaning, and that the left posterior middle temporal gyrus instantiates in part the semantic network that represents the object's meaning.
