Areas of the brain concerned with ventilatory load compensation in awake man. There is broad agreement that the awake human ventilatory response to a moderate inspiratory load consists of a prolongation of inspiratory time (T(I)) with a maintenance of tidal volume (V(T)) and end-tidal P(C)(O(2)) (P(ET,C)(O(2))), the response being severely blunted in sleep. There is no agreement on the mechanisms underlying this ventilatory response. Six naive healthy males (aged 39-44) were studied supine with their heads in a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner to allow relative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) to be measured with H(2)(15)O given intravenously. A linearised resistive load (24 cmH(2)O (l s(-1))(-1)) could be added to the inspiratory limb of a breathing valve inserted into a tightly fitting facemask inspiratory flow was measured with a pneumotachograph. The load was applied, without alerting the subject, when the radioactivity first reached the head. Six scans were performed with and without the load, in each subject. Relative rCBF contrasts between the loaded and unloaded breathing states showed significant activations in inferior parietal cortex, prefrontal cortex, midbrain, basal ganglia and multiple cerebellar sites. No activations were found in the primary sensorimotor cortex. The findings suggest that there is a pattern of motor behavioural response to the uncomfortable sensation that inspiration is impeded. This results in a prolongation of T(I), the maintenance of V(T) and a reduction in the degree of discomfort, presumably because of the reduction of mean negative pressure in the airways.
