Frequent deletion of chromosome 3 in malignant sporadic pancreatic endocrine tumors. Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) arise from neuroendocrine cells in and around the pancreas. As loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 3 has been reported in sporadic PETs, we examined 16 sporadic PETs for LOH of 10 polymorphic DNA markers spanning both arms of chromosome 3. LOH was demonstrated in 4 of 8 (50%) sporadic PETs with hepatic metastasis, but in none of 8 sporadic PETs without hepatic involvement. The smallest common-deleted region (SCDR) mapped to 3q27-qter. Analysis of this data with the status of markers on chromosomes 1, 11, and MEN1 mutations in these 16 sporadic PETs revealed that chromosome 3q loss may be a late event in sporadic PET tumorigenesis. These data, combined with reports from other investigators, indicate that chromosome 3q27-qter may contain a tumor suppressor gene that's important in the tumorigenesis of sporadic PETs.
