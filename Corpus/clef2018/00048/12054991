Enhancing reactivity via structural distortion. To examine how small structural changes influence the reactivity and magnetic properties of biologically relevant metal complexes, the reactivity and magnetic properties of two structurally related five-coordinate Fe(III) thiolate compounds are compared. (Et,Pr)-ligated [Fe(III)(S(2)(Me2)N(3)(Et,Pr))]PF(6) (3) is synthesized via the abstraction of a sulfur from alkyl persulfide ligated [Fe(III)(S(2)(Me2)N(3)(Et,Pr))-S(pers)]PF(6) (2) using PEt(3). (Et,Pr)-3 is structurally related to (Pr,Pr)-ligated [Fe(III)(S(2)(Me2)N(3)(Pr,Pr))]PF(6) (1), a nitrile hydratase model compound previously reported by our group, except it contains one fewer methylene unit in its ligand backbone. Removal of this methylene distorts the geometry, opens a S-Fe-N angle by approximately 10 degrees, alters the magnetic properties by stabilizing the S = 1/2 state relative to the S = 3/2 state, and increases reactivity. Reactivity differences between 3 and 1 were assessed by comparing the thermodynamics and kinetics of azide binding. Azide binds reversibly to both (Et,Pr)-3 and (Pr,Pr)-1 in MeOH solutions. The ambient temperature K(eq) describing the equilibrium between five-coordinate 1 or 3 and azide-bound 1-N(3) or 3-N(3) in MeOH is approximately 10 times larger for the (Et,Pr) system. In CH(2)Cl(2), azide binds approximately 3 times faster to 3 relative to 1, and in MeOH, azide dissociates 1 order of magnitude slower from 3-N(3) relative to 1-N(3). The increased on rates are most likely a consequence of the decreased structural rearrangement required to convert 3 to an approximately octahedral structure, or they reflect differences in the LUMO (vs SOMO) orbital population (i.e., spin-state differences). Dissociation rates from both 3-N(3) and 1-N(3) are much faster than one would expect for low-spin Fe(III). Most likely this is due to the labilizing effect of the thiolate sulfur that is trans to azide in these structures.
