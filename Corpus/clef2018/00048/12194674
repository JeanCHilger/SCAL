Left ventricular cavity-to-myocardium count ratio in exercise and resting technetium-99m-tetrofosmin SPECT: correlation with left ventricular function. The aim of this study was to assess the value of the cavity-to-myocardium count ratio (C/M ratio) calculated in exercise and resting technetium-99m (Tc-99m) tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images to identify patients with depressed exercise and resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). We studied 60 patients with recent coronary artery diseases (CAD) undergoing first-pass ventriculography to calculate LVEF and myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging to calculate left ventricular C/M ratios. The group A of 30 CAD patients with higher LVEF (> or = 40%) had significant higher C/M ratios than the group B of 30 CAD patients with abnormal LVEF (< 40%) during exercise and rest. However, C/M ratios between exercise and rest did not differ significantly in the both groups A and B. There is significant correlation between exercise/rest LVEF and exercise/rest C/M ratios. Tc-99m tetrofosmin C/M ratios calculated SPECT perfusion images are useful parameters in identifying patients with depressed LVEF in CAD patients.
