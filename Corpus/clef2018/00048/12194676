Discordance between dipyridamole stress technetium-99m tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography and coronary angiography in patients with Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute vasculitis syndrome of unknown etiology that mainly affects the coronary arteries. The purpose of this study was to assess the agreement between dipyridamole stress technetium-99m tetrofosmin (Tc-TF) myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and coronary angiography in these patients. Twenty-nine children with KD were included in this study. All of the 29 children also received dipyridamole stress Tc-TF myocardial perfusion SPECT within 1 month of their coronary angiographic studies. The results showed that (1) 89.7% of children had negative coronary angiographic findings without significant coronary stenoses, and 10.3% of children had positive coronary angiographic findings with significant coronary stenosis (2) 44.8% of children had negative Tc-TF myocardial perfusion SPECT findings without abnormal myocardial perfusion, and 55.2% of children had positive Tc-TF myocardial perfusion SPECT findings with abnormal myocardial perfusion
