Identification of genotypes of Cryptosporidium parvum isolates from ferrets in Japan. Recent molecular studies show that Cryptosporidium parvum is composed of at least eight genotypes including zoonotic genotypes. Therefore, it is important to screen the genotypes of the isolates harbored in animals for the control of human cryptosporidiosis. The ferret is a popular pet, but also a reservoir of Cryptosporidium. Since the infectivity of zoonotic genotypes in ferrets remains unclear, there is a possibility these hosts harbor zoonotic genotypes. In the present study, we examined the genotypes of C. parvum isolates from ferrets in Japan using polymerase chain reaction direct sequencing. The sequences of the isolates examined clustered with the ferret-adapted genotype (ferret genotype). Our study suggests that ferrets harbor the ferret genotype which is conserved across geographical areas. Further study is required to determine whether ferrets are a significant reservoir for human cryptosporidiosis.
