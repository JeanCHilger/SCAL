Noise components on positron emission tomography images. Noise components on PET images were studied. The results showed that the square of synthetic noise Delta(2) and the square of signal-to-noise ratio (N/Delta)(2) varied with the signal intensity N and the relationships were respectively expressed with: Delta(2)=0.0395N(2)+0.1427N+0.0025 (R(2)=0.9358) and (N/Delta)(2)=-1.13932N(2)+7.0185N-0.0746 (R(2)=0.9377). The synthetic noise on PET image may be categorized into three components. The first one varies directly as signal intensity, which depend on random coincidence the second one varies directly as the square root of signal intensity, which depend on Poisson fluctuation
