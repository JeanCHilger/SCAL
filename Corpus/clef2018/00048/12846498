Treatment of neuroendocrine tumours in adults with 131I-MIBG therapy. This is a retrospective review of 131I-MIBG therapy for metastatic neuroendocrine tumours in 25 adult patients. The tumours comprised 17 carcinoids, six paragangliomas, one somatostatinoma and one intestinal smooth muscle sarcoma. All patients (age range 28-84 years) had stage IV disease and a positive diagnostic 123I-MIBG scan. Patients received 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) of 131I-MIBG given in three cycles at 3-monthly intervals. The mean cumulative dose was 27.7 GBq (751 mCi). Symptomatic response was observed in 80%, hormonal response in 55% and tumour response in 48% (WHO criteria). Of the 25 patients, 40% are still under follow-up. Death was due to disease progression in all except one. The median survival time was 48 months from diagnosis of metastatic disease, and 17 months from the last 131I-MIBG therapy. The 5-year survival rate was 59% (95% confidence interval, 34%-78%). There was no statistical difference in survival between previously treated (chemo/radiotherapy) and treatment-naive patients. Side-effects were minimal and commonly include nausea (in the first 24 h) and a transient fall in platelet count. 131I-MIBG provides a good therapeutic response in patients with metastatic neuro-endocrine tumours.
