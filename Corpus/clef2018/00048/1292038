Ventricular size and regional cerebral blood flow in schizophrenia: an attempted replication. We attempted to replicate the finding of Berman et al. (1987) that frontal cortical blood flow correlated inversely with ventricular size in schizophrenia. Computed tomography and high-resolution 99m-Tc-HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography were performed in 25 right-handed chronic schizophrenic men engaged in a word-fluency task. Weak, nonstatistically significant inverse correlations were found between the ventricle-brain ratio (VBR) and frontal cortical blood flow. The VBR was significantly inversely correlated with the ratio of left to right medial frontal blood flow.
