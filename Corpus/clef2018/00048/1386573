Amplitude analysis of stress technetium-99m methoxy isobutylisonitrile images in coronary artery disease. To determine the role of rest and stress gated technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (sestamibi), in the detection of coronary artery disease, routine Fourier analysis of these images was performed with the best septal left anterior oblique (LAO) position of 20 patients (17 men, 3 women aged 40-75 years) who also underwent rest or redistribution/stress single photon emission tomography (SPET) (99mTc-sestamibi and Thallium-201), gated blood pool imaging and coronary angiogram. There were 6 patients with single-vessel disease, 6 with two-vessel disease, 4 with three-vessel disease, 2 with coronary spasms, 1 with a patent graft and 1 with anginal episodes but a normal angiogram result. Three normal volunteers (2 women, 1 man
