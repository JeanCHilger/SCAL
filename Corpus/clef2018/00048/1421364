Comparative study of 99mTc-HM-PAO SPECT brain imaging, EEG and CT scanning in epileptic patients during the interictal period. Forty patients with epilepsy in the interictal period were studied with 99mTc (HM-PAO) SPECT brain imaging, EEG and CT scanning. Four cases of generalized epilepsy had normal findings on EEG, SPECT imaging and CT scanning. Two cases of childhood benign partial seizures had abnormal EEG, but the SPECT brain imagings were normal. Regional hypoperfusions of various extents were found in 20 of the 34 patients with complex partial seizures. Among the 34 patients, 17 had abnormal EEG and 8 had abnormal CT scans. A good topographic concordance between regional HM-PAO hypofixation and EEG foci was found (39.1%). Localization of the lesion by SPECT imaging and CT scan was coincident in 5 cases (27.8%). The correlation between these three examination methods is discussed.
