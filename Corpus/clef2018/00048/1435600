Performance characteristics of transmission imaging using a uniform sheet source with parallel-hole collimation. Transmission imaging is receiving increasing attention in SPECT due to the need to compensate for nonuniform attenuation in cardiac-chest SPECT. The quality of a transmission image has an important effect on the measured attenuation distribution. To improve image quality, knowledge of the performance characteristics of a transmission imaging system is essential. The characteristics, spatial resolution, detection efficiency, photon flux, and exposure to the object, of a transmission imaging system consisting of a gamma camera and a uniform sheet source have been studied. The results demonstrate that spatial resolution of a transmission imaging system can be improved by use of a high-resolution source collimator at the price of a moderate decrease in detection efficiency, in comparison to the uncollimated case. Also, the source collimator significantly reduces the photon flux and exposure to the object. This investigation suggests that a high-resolution collimator be used with an intense sheet source to improve spatial resolution and reduce statistical noise with low exposure to the patient. This research further suggests that the amount of source activity is determined by the requirement of image quality, detection geometry, and allowed absorbed dose to the patient.
