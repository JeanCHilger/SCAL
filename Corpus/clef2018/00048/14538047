FDG-PET in breast cancer: a different view of its clinical usefulness. The current review addresses the role of whole-body PET imaging for diagnosing, staging, and re-staging of breast cancer, as well as its role for monitoring effects of treatment on breast cancer. The strengths and limitations of the conventional imaging modalities and those of PET are discussed. New solutions for relatively inexpensive PET screening of patients at risk for breast cancer are proposed. Clinical indications for PET in breast cancer are specified.
