Molecular imaging in breast cancer. Since the 1960s, bone scanning has played a major role in the management of breast cancer. In the last decade, however, the role of radionuclide molecular imaging has expanded significantly in the clinical management of breast cancer because of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, mammoscintigraphy, and sentinel lymph node techniques. Molecular imaging also is instrumental in drug development,gene therapy, and in basic science research of breast cancer. This article provides a comprehensive review of the role of molecular imaging of breast cancer in clinical practice and reports on the current state of research in this field.
