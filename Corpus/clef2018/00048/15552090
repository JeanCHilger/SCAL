An estimation of noise levels in HMPAO RCBF SPECT images using simulation and phantom data comparison with results obtained from repeated normal controls. The purpose of this work was to determine noise levels in HMPAO RCBF SPECT images. Eight simulated images of a uniform sphere of activity were made at each of three different count levels. Three images of the Amersham brain phantom were obtained at each of three count levels, roughly corresponding to the simulation levels. Image reconstruction involved a modified Shepp-Logan filter with and without attenuation correction. The scaling constant in the Budinger equation was shown to vary little over the count range used with a mean value of 23 for uncorrected phantom data and 27 for corrected phantom data, corresponding to RMS noise levels of 7%-15%. The variance due to noise was calculated as a percentage of the variance obtained for 53 normal control studies following image registration and normalization. Values of 54% for uncorrected images and 67% for corrected images were obtained. For 10 normal controls a repeated study was performed. The ratio of within-subject to (single sample) between-subject variance was determined as 73% for uncorrected images and 78% for corrected images.
