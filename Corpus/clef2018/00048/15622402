Central hemodynamic and cognitive function in the short- and long-term periods after coronary bypass grafting. The aim of the present work was to study cerebral hemodynamics and cognitive function in patients suffering from coronary artery disease (CAD) in the short- and long-term periods after coronary bypass grafting (CBG). The study accrued 65 patients who underwent myocardial revascularization using cardiopulmonary bypass (43 persons) and without heart interruption (22 persons). In 21 cases, CBG using cardiopulmonary bypass with a purpose of preventing cerebral events was supplemented by administration of instenon manufactured by the Nycomed Company, Perfusion tomoscintigraphy of the brain and neuropsychological testing were provided to all the patients prior to CBG, 14 days and 6 months following surgery. CBG coupled with preventive administration of instenon or beating heart operation allow to appreciably minimize the risk of disorders of cerebral hemodynamics and cognitive function in the long-term postoperative period.
