Lack of benefit of concurrent chemotherapy in patients with cervical cancer and negative lymph nodes by FDG-PET. To compare the outcome of patients with cervical cancer and negative lymph nodes by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) treated with irradiation (RT) and concurrent chemotherapy or RT alone.This was a prospective data registry of 65 patients with cervical cancer and negative lymph nodes by whole-body FDG-PET. The tumor stage was IB2 in 11, IIB in 37, and IIIB in 17 patients. RT alone was administered to 15 and RT with concurrent weekly cisplatin to 50 patients.The 5-year overall survival estimate was 85% with RT and 81% with RT and concurrent chemotherapy (p = 0.91). The corresponding 5-year cause-specific survival estimates were 78% and 74% (p = 0.98). The differences in the sites of recurrence (pelvis vs. distant metastasis) were not statistically significant between the two groups (p = 0.77). A Cox proportional hazards model of survival outcome did not identify chemotherapy, overall treatment time, or radiation dose as statistically significant prognostic factors. Severe complications included one rectovaginal fistula, one rectal stricture requiring colostomy (both in the concurrent chemotherapy group), and one death from chemotherapy-related complications.Irradiation with concurrent cisplatin was not advantageous compared with RT alone in patients with negative lymph nodes on FDG-PET.
