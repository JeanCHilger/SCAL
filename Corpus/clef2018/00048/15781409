11C]Glycylsarcosine: synthesis and in vivo evaluation as a PET tracer of PepT2 transporter function in kidney of PepT2 null and wild-type mic. [11C]Glycylsarcosine (Gly-Sar) was synthesized as a potential radiotracer to investigate the localization and in vivo function of the peptide transporter PepT2 in mouse kidney. Its C-11 labeled diketopiperazine derivative, [11C]cyclo(Gly-Sar) [1-methylpiperazine-2,5-dione], was also evaluated as a potential tracer. [11C]Gly-Sar exhibited rapid initial uptake into kidneys with slow clearance from the medulla, consistent with uptake and retention of the radiotracer through the actions of PepT2. In contrast, the corresponding cyclized dipeptide [11C]cyclo(Gly-Sar) showed rapid clearance and accumulation only in the renal pelvis region. Involvement of PepT2 in reabsorption and delayed clearance of [11C]Gly-Sar was confirmed using the PepT2 knockout mouse, where rapid renal elimination of [11C]Gly-Sar and the absence of radioactivity in medulla were observed. This study demonstrates using in vivo imaging technique that PepT2 is primarily responsible for renal tubular active reabsorption of Gly-Sar, and provides a new tool for studying tubular peptide reabsorption and clearance.
