Combining bronchoscopy and positron emission tomography for the diagnosis of the small pulmonary nodule < or = 3 cm. To assess the role of bronchoscopy and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning in an integrated approach for the diagnosis of noncalcified, small, chest radiologic lesions (< or = 3 cm).Seventy-four consecutive patients (29 men mean age, 64 years) with a pulmonary nodule < or = 3 cm undergoing both combined PET and bronchoscopy were included. When bronchoscopy and PET findings were negative, a multidisciplinary decision was taken to perform further invasive diagnostics or follow-up.Malignancy was diagnosed in 51 patients (69%), and a positive benign diagnosis was made in 9 patients (12%). Six patients (8%) had endobronchial lesions. Bronchoscopy was diagnostic in 53% patients (cancer, n = 35 benign, n = 4). PET findings were positive in 19 of 35 patients with a nondiagnostic bronchoscopy. In these 19 patients, malignant diagnosis was made in 14 patients (CT-fine needle aspiration [FNA], n = 3Combining bronchoscopy and PET scanning has an useful role in the diagnosis of noncalcified chest radiologic lesions < or = 3 cm in size. Bronchoscopy has a diagnostic yield of > 50% and also allows the diagnosis of endobronchial lesions. If bronchoscopy is nondiagnostic, a PET scan should be performed.
