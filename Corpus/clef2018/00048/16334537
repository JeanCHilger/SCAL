Diagnostic methods of central nervous system changes in SLE patients. Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune, multiorgan disease, in the course of which central nervous system (CNS) disturbances are usually observed. Pathomechanism of CNS changes is complex and not fully investigated. Neuropathological alterations are often not characteristic, usually caused by vasculopathy, infarction, hemorrhages or infection. Vascular changes are generally disseminated and develop in different time period, sometimes they precede clinical symptoms. Currently applied diagnostic methods and their usefulness in diagnosis of CNS involvement in lupus patients, especially single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), are presented.
