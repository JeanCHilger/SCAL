FBP Algorithms for Attenuated Fan-Beam Projections. A filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstruction algorithm for attenuated fan-beam projections has been derived based on Novikov's inversion formula. The derivation uses a common transformation between parallel-beam and fan-beam coordinates. The filtering is shift-invariant. Numerical evaluation of the FBP algorithm is presented as well. As a special application, we also present a shift-invariant FBP algorithm for fan-beam SPECT reconstruction with uniform attenuation compensation. Several other fan-beam reconstruction algorithms are also discussed. In the attenuation-free case, our algorithm reduces to the conventional fan-beam FBP reconstruction algorithm.
