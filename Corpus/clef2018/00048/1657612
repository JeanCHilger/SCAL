Plasma pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the benzodiazepine antagonist [11C] Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) in baboon and human during positron emission tomography studies. Flumazenil is a specific antagonist of the central benzodiazepine receptor (CBZR). Labelled with 11C, this compound is the reference radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) study of the CBZR in humans and primates. The time-course of [11C]-flumazenil radioactivity and its main acid metabolite [11C] Ro 15-3890 were reconstructed from the time-course of total radioactivity in plasma after administration with high or low SRA in primates and humans, applying an extraction procedure validated by TLC. The measured pharmacokinetics of [11C]-flumazenil (T1/2 beta = 45.1 +/- 12.3 min, T1/2 alpha = 1.5 +/- 1.5 min K = 0.14 +/- 0.14 min-1
