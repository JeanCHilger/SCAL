Baseline MRI delivery characteristics predict change in invasive ductal breast carcinoma PET metabolism as a result of primary chemotherapy administration. The aim of the study was to investigate whether pre-therapy vascular delivery assessment [using dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI)] can predict reduction in breast cancer metabolism [detected using 2-[(18)F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography ((18)F(-)FDG-PET)] after a single cycle of chemotherapy. Reduction in (18)F-FDG PET metabolism has previously been shown to correlate with histological response to primary chemotherapy.Seventeen patients with large or locally advanced invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast were imaged using DCE-MRI and (18)F-FDG-PET prior to therapy and 20 days after the first cycle of chemotherapy. MRI data were analysed using a multi-compartment model. PET data were analysed using standardised uptake value (SUV) analysis.A significant association (P <0.05) was observed between pre-therapy DCE-MRI vascular parameters and the reduction in PET metabolism resulting from administration of one cycle of chemotherapy.A relationship was demonstrated between pre-therapy DCE-MRI vascular parameters and the reduction in PET metabolism after a single cycle of chemotherapy. This suggests that reduction in PET metabolism as a result of chemotherapy may be dependent, at least in part, on pre-therapy vascular delivery. These pre-therapy vascular characteristics may be suitable for use as a surrogate measure for initial chemotherapy delivery, a key factor in chemotherapeutic efficacy.
