Does regional brain perfusion correlate with eating disorder symptoms in anorexia and bulimia nervosa patients? Using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), we sought brain perfusion correlates of eating disorder symptoms in anorexia and bulimia nervosa patients.We investigated 67 female eating disordered (ED) patients. Eating disorder symptoms were measured by the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI). Determination of brain areas in which regional perfusion co-varied with drive for thinness, bulimia, body dissatisfaction, ineffectiveness, perfectionism, interpersonal distrust, interoceptive awareness and maturity fears was done by open explorative correlation analysis using Statistical Parametrical Mapping (SPM).A significant positive correlation between scores on body dissatisfaction and ineffectiveness, and brain perfusion in the prefrontal and parietal cortex was demonstrated. There were no correlations between other eating disorder symptoms and brain perfusion.Based on the finding of an association between regional brain flow and body dissatisfaction and ineffectiveness, we argue that neurobiological findings in ED patients may not only reflect emotional and behavioural factors but cognitive-evaluative features as well.
