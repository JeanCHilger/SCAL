Mites as a cause of zoonoses in human beings. Different mite species occurring in animals may infest humans temporarily. Such agents should be considered a possible cause of erythemateous and sometimes pruritic skin reactions of unclear origin. Pseudoscabies is a common problem in occupationally exposed humans, e.g. farmers, veterinarians or pet owners. Those selflimiting dermatoses may often be misdiagnosed. Several species including Sarcoptes scabiei, Notoedres cati, Cheyletiella spp., Dermanyssus gallinae, Ornithonyssus bacoti, Ophionyssus natricis and Neotrombicula autumnalis may infest human skin, causing symptoms.
