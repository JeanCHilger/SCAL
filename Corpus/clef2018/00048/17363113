Striatal dopamine transporters correlate with simple reaction time in elderly subjects. The decline in motor performance that accompanies advanced age has unclear neurobiological substrates but may relate, in part, to degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine system. This research tested the hypothesis that striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability in healthy elderly individuals was related to measures of motor performance. Thirty-six healthy volunteers (18 male, 18 female) who ranged in age from 68 to 88 (75.4+/-4.9 years) received a neuropsychological evaluation that included two primary motor measures (tested with dominant hand): (1) simple reaction time (SRT) and (2) finger tapping (FT). Subjects underwent SPECT scanning with [(123)I]2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane ([(123)I]beta-CIT) for measurement of striatal DAT availability. A ratio of specific to nondisplaceable brain uptake (i.e., radical V3 =[striatal-occipital]/occipital), a measure proportional to the binding potential (B(max)/K(D)), was derived. SRT was significantly correlated with striatal DAT availability with or without controlling for the contribution of age. However, contrary to hypothesis, FT was not correlated with striatal DAT availability. Comparison measures, including episodic memory and general intelligence, were also unrelated to striatal DAT availability. These results demonstrate that a loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic function likely contributes to slowing of reaction speed with advancing age.
