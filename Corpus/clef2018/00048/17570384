Low-temperature growth of ZnO nanorods by chemical bath deposition. Aligned ZnO nanorod arrays were synthesized using a chemical bath deposition method at normal atmospheric pressure without any metal catalyst. A simple two-step process was developed for growing ZnO nanorods on a PET substrate at 90-95 degrees C. The ZnO seed precursor was prepared by a sol-gel reaction. ZnO nanorod arrays were fabricated on ZnO-seed-coated substrate. The ZnO seeds were indispensable for the aligned growth of ZnO nanorods. The ZnO nanorods had a length of 400-500 nm and a diameter of 25-50 nm. HR-TEM and XRD analysis confirmed that the ZnO nanorod is a single crystal with a wurtzite structure and its growth direction is [0001] (the c-axis). Photoluminescence measurements of ZnO nanorods revealed an intense ultraviolet peak at 378.3 nm (3.27 eV) at room temperature.
