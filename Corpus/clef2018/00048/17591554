Synthesis and positron emission tomography studies of C-11-labeled isotopomers and metabolites of GTS-21, a partial alpha7 nicotinic cholinergic agonist drug. (3E)-3-[(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)methylene]-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2,3'-bipyridine (GTS-21), a partial alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist drug, has recently been shown to improve cognition in schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. One of its two major demethylated metabolites, 4-OH-GTS-21, has been suggested to contribute to its therapeutic effects.We labeled GTS-21 in two different positions with carbon-11 ([2-methoxy-(11)C]GTS-21 and [4-(11)C]GTS-21) along with two corresponding demethylated metabolites ([2-methoxy-(11)C]4-OH-GTS-21 and [4-methoxy-(11)C]2-OH-GTS-21) for pharmacokinetic studies in baboons and mice with positron emission tomography (PET).Both [2-(11)C]GTS-21 and [4-methoxy-(11)C]GTS-21 showed similar initial high rapid uptake in baboon brain, peaking from 1 to 3.5 min (0.027-0.038%ID/cc) followed by rapid clearance (t(1/2)<15 min), resulting in low brain retention by 30 min. However, after 30 min, [2-methoxy-(11)C]GTS-21 continued to clear while [4-methoxy-(11)C]GTS-21 plateaued, suggesting the entry of a labeled metabolite into the brain. Comparison of the pharmacokinetics of the two labeled metabolites confirmed expected higher brain uptake and retention of [4-methoxy-(11)C]2-OH-GTS-21 (the labeled metabolite of [4-methoxy-(11)C]GTS-21) relative to [2-methoxy-(11)C]4-OH-GTS-21 (the labeled metabolite of [2-methoxy-(11)C]GTS-21), which had negligible brain uptake. Ex vivo studies in mice showed that GTS-21 is the major chemical form in the mouse brain. Whole-body dynamic PET imaging in baboon and mouse showed that the major route of excretion of C-11 is through the gallbladder.The major findings are as follows: (a) extremely rapid uptake and clearance of [2-methoxy-(11)C]GTS-21 from the brain, which may need to be considered in developing optimal dosing of GTS-21 for patients, and (b) significant brain uptake of 2-OH-GTS-21, suggesting that it might contribute to the therapeutic effects of GTS-21. This study illustrates the value of comparing different label positions and labeled metabolites to gain insight on the behavior of a central nervous system drug and its metabolites in the brain, providing an important perspective on drug pharmacokinetics.
