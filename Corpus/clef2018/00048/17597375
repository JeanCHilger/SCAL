Surface tailoring of poly(ethylene terephthalate) via ligand-tethered comb-like PEG to enhance endothelialization. The comb-like PEG (CPEG) end-tethered with L-lysine was explored to surface modification of PET to enhance endothelialization. The hydroxyl end groups of CPEG were oxygenated into aldehyde groups. The CPEG-CHO was grafted onto the aminolysized PET. The L-lysine was then end-tethered onto surface via the residual aldehyde groups. The surface modification was confirmed by ATR-FTIR, contact angle and XPS measurements. The endothelial cell adhesion, proliferation and viability results indicated that the PET-CPEG resisted cell adhesion and growth, where as PET-CPEG-lysine promoted cell adhesion and growth. The MTT assay and total cell protein tests indicated that the endothelial cells on PET-CPEG-lysine had high viability. Cell spread uniformly and covered completely on the PET-CPEG-lysine. The CPEG end tethered with L-lysine could regulate cell adhesion and growth and enhance surface endothelialization.
