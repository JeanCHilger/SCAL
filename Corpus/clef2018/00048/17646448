Anterior layering of excreted 18F-FDG in the bladder on PET/CT: frequency and cause. The objective of our study was to determine the frequency and cause of anterior layering of excreted 18F-FDG in the bladder on PET/CT.Anterior layering of excreted FDG in the bladder is commonly seen on PET/CT scans obtained with i.v. iodinated contrast material and is due to displacement of FDG by excreted iodinated contrast material this phenomenon may unmask FDG-avid bladder disease.
