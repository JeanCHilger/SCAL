Fusion of positron emission tomography (PET) and gene array data: a new approach for the correlative analysis of molecular biological and clinical data. The combined assessment of data obtained by positron emission tomography (PET) and gene array techniques provide new capabilities for the interpretation of kinetic tracer studies. The correlative analysis of the data helps to detect dependencies of the kinetics of radiotracer on gene expression. Furthermore, gene expression may be predicted using regression functions if a significant correlation exists, which raises new aspects regarding the interpretation of dynamic PET examinations. The development of new radiopharmaceuticals requires the knowledge of the enhanced expression of genes, especially genes controlling receptors and cell surface proteins. The GenePET program facilitates an interactive approach together with the use of key words to identify possible targets for new radiopharmaceuticals.
