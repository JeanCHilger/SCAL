Preoperative cerebral hemodynamic impairment and reactive oxygen species produced during carotid endarterectomy correlate with development of postoperative cerebral hyperperfusion. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether preoperative cerebral hemodynamic impairment and reactive oxygen species produced during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) correlate with development of postoperative cerebral hyperperfusion.Concentrations of malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL), a biochemical marker of oxidative damage, were measured in serum samples obtained from 90 patients undergoing CEA for ipsilateral ICA stenosis (>70%). Serum samples were obtained from a venous catheter inserted into the ipsilateral jugular bulb before clamping of the internal carotid artery (ICA), 10 minutes after clamping of the ICA, and 5 and 20 minutes after declamping of the ICA. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to acetazolamide were also measured using single-photon emission computed-tomography before CEA. In addition, CBF was measured postoperatively.Hyperperfusion (CBF increase >100% compared with preoperative values) was observed immediately after CEA in 12 patients (13%). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that reduced preoperative CVR (95% CIs, 1.053 to 1.453 P=0.0097) and an increase in MDA-LDL (calculated as a percentage of the preclamp values) after ICA declamping (95% CIs, 0.862 to 0.980Both preoperative cerebral hemodynamic impairment and reactive oxygen species produced during surgery correlate with development of cerebral hyperperfusion after CEA.
