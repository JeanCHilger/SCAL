Usefulness of standardized uptake values for distinguishing adrenal glands with pheochromocytoma from normal adrenal glands by use of 6-18F-fluorodopamine PET. 6-(18)F-Fluorodopamine ((18)F-FDA) PET is a highly sensitive tool for the localization of pheochromocytoma (PHEO). The aim of this study was to establish cutoff values for pathologic and physiologic adrenal gland tracer uptake.(18)F-FDA PET with CT coregistration was performed in 14 patients (10 men and 4 women age [mean +/- SD], 42.9 +/- 13.3 y) with unilateral adrenal gland PHEO and in 13 control subjects (5 men and 8 women(18)F-FDA accumulation was observed in all adrenal glands with PHEO and in 6 of 13 control adrenal glands (P = 0.02). The SUV was higher in adrenal glands with PHEO (mean +/- SD, 16.1 +/- 6.1) than in (18)F-FDA-positive control adrenal glands (7.7 +/- 1.4) (P = 0.005). SUV cutoffs for distinguishing between adrenal glands with PHEO and normal adrenal glands were 7.3 (100% sensitivity) and 10.1 (100% specificity).The SUVs of adrenal foci on (18)F-FDA PET facilitate the distinction between adrenal glands with PHEO and normal adrenal glands.
