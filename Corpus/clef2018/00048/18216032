Early validation study of 64-slice multidetector computed tomography for the assessment of myocardial viability and the prediction of left ventricular remodelling after acute myocardial infarction. We aim to validate the ability of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) for assessing myocardial viability and predicting left ventricular (LV) remodelling after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).In 52 consecutive patients with first AMI, 64-slice MDCT without iodine re-injection was performed immediately following coronary stenting. Electrocardiogram-gated thallium-201 single-photon emission tomography was performed using QGS programs within 5 days and 6 months after onset. Among the 52 patients, 18 patients (Group A) showed transmural contrast-delayed enhancement on MDCT images, 20 patients (Group B) showed subendocardial contrast-delayed enhancement, and 14 patients (Group C) had no contrast-delayed enhancement. In the acute phase, peak creatine kinase-MB [497 (189-744), 182 (90-358), 85 (40-204) IU/mL, respectively, P = 0.0004] was significantly higher in Group A, while the incidence of myocardial blush grade 3 (22, 67, 75%, respectively, P = 0.001) and LV ejection fraction (41 +/- 7, 53 +/- 12, 62 +/- 11%, respectively, P < 0.0001) were significantly lower in Group A. During the 6-month period, LV remodelling (P = 0.001) and the number of rehospitalization for heart failure (P = 0.0017) were more significantly observed in Group A.Myocardial contrast-delayed enhancement patterns provide promising information regarding myocardial viability, LV remodelling, and prognosis in AMI.
