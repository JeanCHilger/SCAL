Prognostic value of FDG uptake by the bone marrow in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The appearance of natural suppressor cells and circulating endothelial progenitor cells in tumour tissue has been associated with myelopoetic stimulation by growth factors that may increase fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake by the bone marrow and high FDG uptake by bone marrow in patients suffering from human malignancies is a not uncommon finding.This study looked at the relationship between bone marrow FDG uptake, biochemical (Hb level, RBC count, WBC count and platelet count), clinical and radiological findings and outcome in a series of 35 patients suffering from squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), consecutively referred for FDG PET as part of their routine staging procedure.In SCCHN, mean FDG standardized uptake values (SUVs) of the primary tumour correlate significantly with blood WBC count (r=0.44 P=0.011, Bonferroni corrected P=0.04) and mean FDG SUVs of bone marrow are significantly correlated to the maximum FDG SUVs of the primary tumour (r=0.523
