Myocardial scar and insulin resistance predict cardiovascular events in severe ischaemic myocardial dysfunction: a perfusion-metabolism positron emission tomography study. Clinical outcome can be predicted by metabolism-perfusion positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with severe ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction. This study determined whether the amount of viable or non-viable myocardium detected with a PET scan or clinical-functional parameters might predict cardiovascular events.All patients had previous myocardial infarction (>6 months previously) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%. Metabolism-perfusion PET, echocardiogram and coronary angiography were provided. All subjects underwent short euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp before the metabolism study. The dysfunctioning segment was defined as hibernating myocardium when metabolism was normal-moderately reduced with impaired perfusion (mismatch flow-metabolism). Cardiac death, hospital admission for myocardial infarction or heart failure were considered cardiovascular events.Ninety-three patients (71 males, aged 64.2 years) were studied. The LVEF was 30.2+/-7.7% 48 (51.6%) suffered an anterior myocardial infarction. Fifty-three (54.1%) subjects were treated with coronary revascularizationNon-viable myocardium revealed with PET predicts mid-term clinical prognosis. Insulin resistance seems to influence the outcome.
