Raman spectroscopic characteristics of microcosmic and photosensitive damage on space structure of liposomes sensitized by hypocrellin and its derivatives. Raman spect-pic characteristics of microcosmic and photosensitive damage on space structure of DP-PC liposomes sensitized by hypocrellin and its derivatives are obvious. The trans conformation decreased and the gauche conformation increased. The longitudinal order-parameter in chains and the lateral order-parameter between chains decreased in different degrees. The lateral packing became loose. Photodamage on the liposomes sensitized by 5-Br-hypocrellin B was stronger than that by hypocrellins A and B.
