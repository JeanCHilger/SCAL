Neural plasticity in blind cochlear implant users. This study, using positron emission tomography, investigates the cortical activation generated by auditory stimulation in two congenitally blind cochlear implant users. In the patient with a relatively short history of deafness, activity increased in both auditory cortices and fell in the visual cortices. The patient with a longer period of deafness had greater activation of the visual cortices than the auditory cortices. A similar pattern of activity was seen when this patient subsequently had a second cochlear implant inserted into the opposite ear. The neural pathways formed after the restoration of auditory input in the congenitally blind can activate either the auditory or visual cortices. We suggest that the visual cortical activation demonstrated is of functional significance.
