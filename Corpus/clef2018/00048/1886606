Mitochondrial inner membrane protease 1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows sequence similarity to the Escherichia coli leader peptidase. The nuclear yeast mutant pet ts2858 is defective in the removal of pre-sequences from the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COXII) and the processing intermediate of cytochrome b2 (Cytb2), a nuclear gene product. In order to identify the genetic lesion in this mutant we have cloned and characterized a DNA region which complements the pet ts2858 mutation. The DNA sequence revealed three open reading frames, one of which is responsible for the complementation. A 570 bp reading frame represents the structural gene PET2858, as demonstrated by in vitro mutagenesis, gene expression from a foreign promoter, and allelism tests. PET2858 encodes a 21.4 kDa protein, which is essential for growth on non-fermentable carbon sources and for the proteolytic processing of COXII and the Cytb2 intermediate. When the N-terminus of the PET2858 protein is fused to a reporter protein, the resulting hybrid molecule is imported into mitochondria. Interestingly, the N-terminal half of the deduced PET2858 protein exhibits 30.7% amino acid identity to the leader peptidase of Escherichia coli. These results suggest that PET2858 codes for a mitochondrial inner membrane protease (IMP1) or at least a subunit of it. This protease is involved in protein processing and export from the mitochondrial matrix.
