The commonly used cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I (cGKI) inhibitor Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS can activate cGKI in vitro and in intact cells. Small-molecule modulators of cGMP signaling are of interest to basic and clinical research. The cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I (cGKI) is presumably a major mediator of cGMP effects, and the cGMP analogue Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS (Rp-PET) (chemical name: beta-phenyl-1,N2-etheno-8-bromoguanosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer) is currently considered one of the most permeable, selective, and potent cGKI inhibitors available for intact cell studies. Here, we have evaluated the properties of Rp-PET using cGKI-expressing and cGKI-deficient primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), purified cGKI isozymes, and an engineered cGMP sensor protein. cGKI activity in intact VSMCs was monitored by cGMP/cGKI-stimulated cell growth and phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. Unexpectedly, Rp-PET (100 microm) did not efficiently antagonize activation of cGKI by the agonist 8-Br-cGMP (100 microm) in intact VSMCs. Moreover, in the absence of 8-Br-cGMP, Rp-PET (100 microm) stimulated cell growth in a cGKIalpha-dependent manner. Kinase assays with purified cGKI isozymes confirmed the previously reported inhibition of the cGMP-stimulated enzyme by Rp-PET in vitro. However, in the absence of the agonist cGMP, Rp-PET partially activated the cGKIalpha isoform. Experiments with a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based construct harboring the cGMP binding sites of cGKI suggested that binding of Rp-PET induces a conformational change similar to the agonist cGMP. Together, these findings indicate that Rp-PET is a partial cGKIalpha agonist that under certain conditions stimulates rather than inhibits cGKI activity in vitro and in intact cells. Data obtained with Rp-PET as cGKI inhibitor should be interpreted with caution and not be used as sole evidence to dissect the role of cGKI in signaling processes.
