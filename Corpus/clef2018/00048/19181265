Neuroimaging of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter by a novel 4-[18F]fluoro-benzoyl derivative of 7-hydroxy-6-(4-phenyl-piperidin-1-yl)-octahydro-benzo[1,4]oxazines. Phenylpiperidinyl-octahydro-benzo[1,4]oxazines represent a new class of conformationally restrained vesamicol analogues. Derived from this morpholine-fused vesamicol structure, a new fluorine-18-labeled 4-fluorobenzoyl derivative ([(18)F]FBMV) was synthesized with an average specific activity of 75 GBq/micromol and a radiochemical purity of 99%. The radiolabeling method included an exchange reaction of a 4-nitro group of the precursor by fluorine-18, a reduction procedure to eliminate excess of the nitro compound, followed by a high-performance liquid chromatography purification. [(18)F]FBMV demonstrates (i) a moderate lipophilic character with a logD(pH7.0) 1.8+/-0.10 (ii) a considerable binding affinity to the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) (K(i)=27.5 nM), as determined using PC12 cells transfected with a VAChT cDNA, and a low affinity to sigma(1,2) receptors (K(i) >3000 nM)
