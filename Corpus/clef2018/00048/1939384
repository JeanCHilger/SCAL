L-6-[18F]fluoro-dopa metabolism in monkeys and humans: biochemical parameters for the formulation of tracer kinetic models with positron emission tomography. Characterization of peripheral and cerebral L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluorophenylalanine (FDOPA) metabolism in humans and monkeys has shown FDOPA to be an analogue of L-DOPA for the study of the dopaminergic system with positron emission tomography (PET). In human studies with carbidopa pretreatment, L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluoro-3-O-methylphenylalanine (3-OMFD) was the only FDOPA metabolite detected in plasma. FDOPA administration in monkeys resulted in selective accumulation of FDOPA metabolites in central dopaminergic regions, whereas 3-OMFD of peripheral origin was uniformly distributed among putamen, caudate, frontal cortex, and cerebellum. At 60 min, 3-OMFD and 6-[18F]fluorodopamine (FDA) each represented approximately 35% of the total activity, the remainder being FDOPA and FDA metabolites. These data on monkey and human FDOPA metabolism provide the basis for the configuration of an FDOPA tracer kinetic model with PET.
