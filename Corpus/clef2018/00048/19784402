Chondroradionecrosis of the larynx: diagnostic and therapeutic measures for saving the organ from radiotherapy sequelae. Chondroradionecrosis (CRN) of the larynx is a rare but fatal complication of radiotherapy. We determined the optimal diagnostic methodology and management of laryngeal CRN in six patients.We retrospectively reviewed the records of six patients with Chandler grade IV laryngeal CRN who had received prior radiotherapy (mean total radiation dose, 66.7+/-4.5 Gy) at a tertiary care hospital. Two patients underwent transoral laser microresection of their laryngeal carcinoma plus postoperative radiotherapy. All patients underwent endoscopy, computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), removal of necrotic tissue, biopsy under suspension laryngoscopy, administration of antibiotics, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO). Their diagnostic and therapeutic results were assessed.CT showed CRN of the anterior larynx in three patients and CRN of the posterior larynx in three patients, with one patient having a false-positive result on PET. HBO consisted of a mean of 36+/-6 dives. After early debridement and HBO, five patients showed CRN improvement, but one had aggravation and subsequently underwent total laryngectomy. None of these patients showed local tumor recurrence on pathologic examination or during a mean follow-up of 24 months.Although CRN of the larynx may be detected by endoscopic and imaging work-ups, detection may require pathologic examination. Early debridement and HBO may effectively treat CRN, saving the functional larynx.
