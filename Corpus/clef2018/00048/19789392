Contemporary imaging in sarcoma. Sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of >50 subtypes of neoplasm. It is imperative to obtain appropriate imaging of these tumors in order to adequately assess, characterize, and stage bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Anatomic imaging such as radiographs, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remain the foundation for both biopsy planning and postoperative evaluation of these neoplasms. However, anatomic imaging may not be entirely accurate in the evaluation of treatment response. Newer techniques, such (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, are being used to evaluate distant metastases. Newer radiopharmaceuticals, such as (18)F-fluorodeoxythymidine, are being developed to assist in the differentiation between benign and low-grade malignant neoplasms. Newer functional imaging techniques, such as dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging, among others, are being developed to evaluate treatment response.
