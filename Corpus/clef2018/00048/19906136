The feline iodine requirement is lower than the 2006 NRC recommended allowance. The purpose of this study was to determine the iodine (I) requirement in adult cats. Forty-two healthy euthyroid cats (1.6-13.6 years old) were utilized in a randomized complete block design. Cats were fed a dry basal diet (0.23 mg/kg I) for a minimum of 1 month (pre-test) then switched to a different basal diet supplemented with seven levels of KI for 1 year (experimental period). Analysed I concentrations were 0.17, 0.23, 0.47, 1.1, 3.1, 6.9 and 8.8 mg I/kg diet [dry matter (DM) basis] and used to construct a response curve. Response variables included I concentrations in serum, urine and faeces, urinary I:creatinine ratio, I balance, technetium(99m) pertechnetate (Tc(99m)) thyroid:salivary ratio, complete blood count and serum chemistries as well as serum thyroid hormone profiles. No significant changes in food intake, weight gain or clinical signs were noted. Serum I, daily urinary I, daily faecal I and urinary I:creatinine ratio were linear functions of iodine intake. An estimate of the I requirement (i.e. breakpoint) was determined from regression of Tc(99m) thyroid:salivary ratio (scintigraphy) on I intake at 12 months [0.46 mg I/kg diet (DM basis) as well as 9 months I balance (0.44 mg I/kg diet (DM)]. The I requirement estimate determined in our study at 12 months for adult cats (0.46 mg I/kg) was higher than current Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) recommendations (e.g. 0.35 mg I/kg), but was lower than the 2006 National Research Council (NRC) I recommended allowance (e.g. 1.4 mg I/kg).
