Specification and selection of regions of interest (ROIs) in a computerized brain atlas. The computerized individually adjustable brain atlas (CBA) has been further developed. The atlas was primarily designed for anatomical localization and quantitative evaluation of data in positron emission tomography (PET), but may also be employed for other neuroimaging modalities, such as transmission computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The atlas is based on anatomical information obtained from digitized cryosectioned brains. Using spatially standardized and then averaged MRI images, we demonstrate the high localization accuracy and precision of the brain atlas. This is a prerequisite for obtaining accuracy when using the atlas in the localization and the quantitative evaluation of PET data. The specification and the selection of region of interests (ROIs) by the CBA are presented and discussed.
