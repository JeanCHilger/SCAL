MRI-PET correlation in three dimensions using a volume-of-interest (VOI) atlas. Quantitative interpretation of functional images (PET or SPECT) is hampered by poor spatial resolution, low counting statistics, and, for many tracers, low contrast between different brain structures of interest. Furthermore, normal tracer distributions can be severely disrupted by such gross pathologies as stroke, tumor, and dementia. Hence, the complementary anatomical information provided by CT or MRI is essential for accurate and reproducible regional analysis of functional data. We have developed methods for the simultaneous three-dimensional display and analysis of image volumes from MRI and PET. A general algorithm for defining the affine transformation between two equivalent point ensembles has been adapted for the purpose of registering MRI and PET image volumes by means of a simple fiducial arrangement. In addition, we have extended previous MRI-based computerized atlas methodology to three dimensions. The native atlas planes were spaced at 2 mm intervals, sufficient axial sampling to permit the generation of oblique planar sections through the atlas space. This will allow for an infinite number of angulations and axial offsets in two-dimensional region-of-interest (ROI) templates, all derived from the same master three-dimensional volume-of-interest (VOI) atlas and therefore maintaining topographical consistency throughout. These ROI templates may be selected to match the image orientation for conventional two-dimensional segmentation and data extraction.
