The value of the dopamine D2/3 receptor ligand 18F-desmethoxyfallypride for the differentiation of idiopathic and nonidiopathic parkinsonian syndromes. We evaluated the utility of the selective dopamine D(2/3) receptor ligand (18)F-desmethoxyfallypride ((18)F-DMFP) for the differential diagnosis of patients with idiopathic parkinsonian syndrome (IPS) and nonidiopathic parkinsonian syndrome (non-IPS). On the basis of the superior sensitivity of PET, we hypothesized that (18)F-DMFP should have properties for the differential diagnosis of these syndromes superior to what has been reported for the more conventional SPECT procedures.A series of 81 patients with parkinsonism (26 women, 55 men mean age +/- SD, 68 +/- 11 y) were included in this retrospective analysis. A 30-min (18)F-DMFP PET recording was acquired starting 1 h after injection of the tracer (180-200 MBq, intravenously). The specific binding (SB) in divisions of the striatum was calculated relative to the occipital cortex using an observer-independent semiautomatic volume-of-interest-based technique. The optimal SB threshold was defined by means of receiver-operating-characteristic analysis, which was also used for the evaluation of the diagnostic performance of SB, ratios between striatal subregions, and absolute asymmetries in SB.Significant differences (P < 0.001) were found in striatal SB between IPS and non-IPS, most notably in the posterior putamen, for which the diagnostic power for discrimination of IPS and non-IPS was the highest (sensitivity, 87% specificity, 96%(18)F-DMFP PET is useful for the differential diagnosis of IPS and non-IPS in patients with parkinsonism. The findings are consistent with relative sparing of D(2/3) receptors in the dopamine-denervated putamen of IPS patients, in contrast to a more substantial loss of striatal dopamine receptors in non-IPS patients. The PET procedure for this differential diagnosis was superior to the reported experience with (123)I-iodobenzamide SPECT.
