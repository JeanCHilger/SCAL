A simple method for the quality control of [(18)F]FDG. Most automated synthesis modules produce [(18)F]FDG within half an hour, but the quality control involving up to three separate methods and three different analytical systems is time consuming. The use of HPLC, TLC, and GC for the quality control of [(18)F]FDG is both time consuming and expensive (high purchase costs). Presented here is a method using a single HPLC system for all three analyses.
