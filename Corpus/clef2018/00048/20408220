Use of anatomical parcellation to catalog and study structure-function relationships in the human brain. We describe a functional neuroanatomy approach that combines structural (MRI) and functional (PET) data at the individual level. For each subject MRI dataset, sulci are first localized using hemisphere surface rendering and sections and stored. Using these landmarks, the subject brain volume is then divided in 100 anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI). AVOI morphometric measurements are readily obtained as well as functional parameters (CBF) after MRI-PET alignment. This approach allows structure-function relationship investigations both at the single case and at the intersubject average level in addition, individual morphometric and functional parameters can be easily archived in a database for further meta-analysis. This approach is applicable to all imaging modalities and is especially suited for a priori hypothesis testing and for the investigation of interindividual functional neuroanatomy variability.
