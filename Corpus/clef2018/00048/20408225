An overview and some new developments in the statistical analysis of PET and fMRI data. The first part of this paper gives an overview of a simplified approach to the statistical analysis of PET and fMRI data, including new developments and future directions. The second part outlines a new method, based on multivariate linear models (MLM), for characterising the response in PET and fMRI data, which overcomes some of the drawbacks of current methods such as SSM, SVD, PLS and CVA.
