Endovascular treatment of multiple severe atherosclerotic stenoses with cerebral hypoperfusion. Case report. A 60-year-old man presented with syncope and transient left-sided motor weakness. Cerebral angiography revealed multiple severe atherosclerotic stenoses of bilateral internal carotid arteries, bilateral intracranial vertebral artery (VA), and left VA origin. A SPECT study showed poor cerebral perfusion and vascular reserve in the right cerebral hemisphere and the posterior circulation.We performed angioplasty and stentings for the VA stenoses first by using balloon-expandable stents. The patient had shown no syncope attack ever since, which might be due to an increased vascular reserve in the posterior circulation. The following bilateral carotid angioplasty and stentings could be performed safely. Angioplasty and stenting is feasible, and can improve cerebral perfusion even in a patient with multiple severe atherosclerotic stenoses by pre-operative appropriate haemodynamic assessment.
