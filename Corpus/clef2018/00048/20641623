. Pathological conditions such as neoplastic diseases, metabolic disorders, infections, and cancers often result in metastases of the disease to the skeletal system. During the past 50 years, a variety of bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals have been developed and evaluated to detect skeletal metastases by imaging (1-3) or as pain palliative agents in patients (4). The diagnostic radiochemicals, usually phosphate and phosphonate derivatives of compounds, are particularly useful to detect the metastasis because they localize avidly in the bone (5, 6). Most bone lesions have an elevated concentration of minerals (mostly calcium salts) that form a major part of the matrix surface area, and these lesions have a high affinity for and facilitate the adsorption of the bone imaging agents (1, 7). Compared to phosphates, the phosphonate compounds are more stable under
