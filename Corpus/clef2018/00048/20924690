Psychiatric manifestation of a dengue-encephalopathy. Psychiatric manifestation of dengue virus infections is seldom reported. Here a case is presented of a 21-year-old man who developed mainly neuropsychiatric symptoms which he caught one week after a feverish infection during his stay in India: troubles with concentration and memory, confusion, as well as depressive delusions and agoraphobia. Liquor diagnosis as well as CCT and MRI was mainly inconspicuous. The FDG-PET showed a diffuse lack of activity. IgM and IgG antibodies of dengue virus were positive. We interpreted these psychiatric symptoms as a result of a dengue virus infection.
