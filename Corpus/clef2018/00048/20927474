Improvement of proteolytic efficiency towards low-level proteins by an antifouling surface of alumina gel in a microchannel. A microfluidic reactor has been developed for rapid enhancement of protein digestion by constructing an alumina network within a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) microchannel. Trypsin is stably immobilized in a sol-gel network on the PET channel surface after pretreatment, which produces a protein-resistant interface to reduce memory effects, as characterized by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and electroosmotic flow. The gel-derived network within a microchannel provides a large surface-to-volume ratio stationary phase for highly efficient proteolysis of proteins existing both at a low level and in complex extracts. The maximum reaction rate of the encapsulated trypsin reactor, measured by kinetic analysis, is much faster than in bulk solution. Due to the microscopic confinement effect, high levels of enzyme entrapment and the biocompatible microenvironment provided by the alumina gel network, the low-level proteins can be efficiently digested using such a microreactor within a very short residence time of a few seconds. The on-chip microreactor is further applied to the identification of a mixture of proteins extracted from normal mouse liver cytoplasm sample via integration with 2D-LC-ESI-MS/MS to show its potential application for large-scale protein identification.
