Efficient production of therapeutic doses of [131I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine for clinical use. [(131)I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) is a known radiopharmaceutical used for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. The development of therapeutic [(131)I]-mIBG doses at production level is highly challenging due to rapid product degradation and high radiation exposures to the production plant personnel. In the present work, a working module for the production of 10 doses (100 mCi each) in a single operation was developed following copper (I) assisted isotope exchange. The labeled product complies with the pharmaceutical specifications suitable for in-vivo patient use.
