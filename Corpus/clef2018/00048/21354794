Synthesis of an acromelic acid A analog-based 11C-labeled PET tracer for exploration of the site of action of acromelic acid A in allodynia induction. A novel (11)C-labeled PET (positron emission tomography) tracer, which was designed based on the (phenylthio)pyrrolidine derivative that can competitively block the acromelic acid A-induced allodynia, was synthesized. A protocol in which methylation by palladium-mediated coupling of the boronate derivative with [(11)C]CH(3)I and deprotection of the protected amino acid moiety are successively performed in one-pot within 5 min was established for the synthesis of the tracer. The tracer is potentially useful as a tool to investigate the mode of action of acromelic acid A in the induction of allodynia.
