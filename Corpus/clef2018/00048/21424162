Antitumour efficacy of two paclitaxel formulations for hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in an in vivo rat model. To evaluate the tumour growth delay of a peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) of colorectal origin after intraperitoneal chemotherapy with paclitaxel/randomly-methylated-β-cyclodextrin (Pac/RAME-β-CD) versus Taxol® at normo- and hyperthermic conditions in rats.Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) was performed 7 days post implantation of the tumour with both formulations at a Pac concentration of 0.24 mg/ml. Tumour evaluation was performed via positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging, measuring tumour activity and tumour volume, respectively. Scans were taken at 2 and 7 days post treatment.PET and MRI data showed a significant reduction in tumour activity and tumour volume for rats treated with Pac/RAME-β-CD (at normo- and hyperthermic conditions), compared to the control group. Treatment with Taxol® did not result in a significant reduction of tumour activity and tumour volume. No significant differences between the normo- and hyperthermic conditions were observed for both formulations, indicating that hyperthermia and paclitaxel were not synergistic despite the direct cytotoxic effect of hyperthermia.Monitoring tumour growth via PET and MRI indicated that Pac/RAME-β-CD inclusion complexes had a significantly higher efficacy compared to Taxol® in a rat model for peritoneal carcinomatosis.
