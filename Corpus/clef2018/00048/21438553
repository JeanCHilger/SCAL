A cyclic disilylated stannylene: synthesis, dimerization, and adduct formation. Reaction of 1,4-dipotassio-1,1,4,4-tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)tetramethyltetrasilane with [(Me(3)Si)(2)N](2)Sn led to the formation of an endocyclic distannene via the dimerization of a transient stannylene. In the presence of strong donor molecules such as PEt(3), the stannylene could be trapped as adduct. Reaction of the PEt(3) derivative with B(C(6)F(5))(3) gave rise to the formation of the stannylene B(C(6)F(5))(3) adduct.
