Quantification of changes in the skeletal muscle blood circulation following revascularization using a 99m technetium-labeled tracer. A new 99mTc-labelled tracer (99mTc-Sestamibi) was used for the first time to demonstrate the perfusion of the skeletal muscle. In 16 patients with obstructive atherosclerosis of the lower limbs the change of perfusion of thigh and lower leg was studied with SPECT before and after vascular surgery (n = 11) or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (n = 5). Comparative results of scintigraphic measurements and clinical observations (ankle-arm pressure, treadmill test) in 10 surgical patients (14 operated legs) showed correct positive or negative results in 86% (12/14).
