Microfluidic preparation of [18F]FE@SUPPY and [18F]FE@SUPPY:2--comparison with conventional radiosyntheses. Recently, first applications of microfluidic principles for radiosyntheses of positron emission tomography compounds were presented, but direct comparisons with conventional methods were still missing. Therefore, our aims were (1) the set-up of a microfluidic procedure for the preparation of the recently developed adenosine A(3)-receptor tracers [(18)F]FE@SUPPY [5-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)2,4-diethyl-3-(ethylsulfanylcarbonyl)-6-phenylpyridine-5-carboxylate] and [(18)F]FE@SUPPY:2 [5-ethyl-2,4-diethyl-3-((2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)sulfanylcarbonyl)-6-phenylpyridine-5-carboxylate] and (2) the direct comparison of reaction conditions and radiochemical yields of the no-carrier-added nucleophilic substitution with [(18)F]fluoride between microfluidic and conventional methods.For the determination of optimal reaction conditions within an Advion NanoTek synthesizer, 5-50 μl of precursor and dried [(18)F]fluoride solution were simultaneously pushed through the temperature-controlled reactor (26 °C-180 °C) with defined reactant bolus flow rates (10-50 μl/min). Radiochemical incorporation yields (RCIYs) and overall radiochemical yields for large-scale preparations were compared with data from conventional batch-mode syntheses.Optimal reaction parameters for the microfluidic set-up were determined as follows: 170 °C, 30-μl/min pump rate per reactant (reaction overall flow rate of 60 μl/min) and 5-mg/ml precursor concentration in the reaction mixture. Applying these optimized conditions, we observed a significant increase in RCIY from 88.2% to 94.1% (P < .0001, n ≥ 11) for [(18)F]FE@SUPPY and that from 42.5% to 95.5% (P<.0001, n ≥ 5) for [(18)F]FE@SUPPY:2 using microfluidic instead of conventional heating. Precursor consumption was decreased from 7.5 and 10 mg to 1 mg per large-scale synthesis for both title compounds, respectively.The direct comparison of radiosyntheses data applying a conventional method and a microfluidic approach revealed a significant increase of RCIY using the microfluidic approach.
