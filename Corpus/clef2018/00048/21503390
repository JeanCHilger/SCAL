Relationship between cardiac adrenergic image and exercise testing in heart failure. The exercise treadmill test can be used in ventricular dysfunction patients for functional capacity or predicting prognosis. The cardiac image with 123I MIBG shows cardiac sympathetic activation.To evaluate the relationship between exercise treadmill test variables and cardiac image changes in 123I MIBG.23 patients with LVEF ≤ 45% performed scintigraphy cardiac with 123I MIBG and divided into two groups. G1: Washout rate < 27% G2: ≥ 27%. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR) and functional capacity were evaluated. It was performed Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman coefficient and linear regression.SBP at exercise peak (G1: 181.00 ± 28.01 G2: 153.27 ± 27.71 mmHg, p = 0.027), SBP variation [G1: 64(47.5-80.5)In heart failure patients, the SBP at exercise peak and functional capacity were the variables associated with Washout rate.
