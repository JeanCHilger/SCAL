Vessel wall inflammation in spontaneous cervical artery dissection: a prospective, observational positron emission tomography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging study. Vessel wall inflammation (VWI) may be a pathogenetic factor in cervical artery dissection (CAD). We used contrast-enhanced high-resolution MRI (hrMRI) and positron emission tomography CT (PET-CT) to systematically investigate VWI in spontaneous CAD.In this monocentric, prospective, observational study, all consecutive patients with acute, MRI-confirmed, spontaneous CAD admitted to our center between August 2007 and August 2009 were included. VWI was defined as perivascular contrast enhancement in hrMRI and increased perivascular [18F]-fluorodesoxyglucose uptake in PET-CT. VWI was further differentiated between local (restricted to the site of dissection) and generalized (exceeding the site of dissection).A total of 37 patients were included. Multiple dissections were seen in 10 patients (27%). Twenty-five patients received both modalities as planned, 8 received only PET-CT, and 4 received only hrMRI. A subset of patients showed signs of a generalized VWI in hrMRI (4/29 patients, 14%) and PET-CT (8/33 patients, 24%). In patients who received both modalities, all with hrMRI signs of generalized VWI were PET-CT positive (3/3), whereas some PET-CT-positive patients were hrMRI-negative (4/7). If present, generalized VWI in hrMRI completely resolved within 6 months. The presence of >2 simultaneous dissections (seen in 2 patients) was significantly associated with generalized VWI in hrMRI (P=0.015) but marginally not in PET-CT (P=0.053).A subset of patients with spontaneous CAD showed signs of a generalized transient inflammatory arteriopathy in contrast-enhanced hrMRI and PET-CT. This subset of patients may be more prone to multiple dissections.
