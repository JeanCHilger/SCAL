Radiolabeled antibodies as in-vivo cancer probes (review). Cancer imaging with radiolabeled antibodies, or radioimmunodetection (RAID), has undergone a gradual multidisciplinary development over a period of at least 2 decades, resulting in rapid, simple, and accurate targeting agents that are now in final stage evaluation as a new class of cancer imaging and detection reagents. In its development, RAID has focused on different antigen targets, antibodies and antibody forms, radiolabels, and scanning instruments and procedures. Antibodies and imaging agents for a large variety of cancer types have been investigated clinically, and require well controlled, prospective trials to determine clinical applications, utility and safety. At the present time, truly cancer-specific antibodies are not required for successful RAID many different patients with a similar tumor type can be imaged with a single pancarcinoma antibody
