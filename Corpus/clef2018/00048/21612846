Positron tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose in the preoperative evaluation of gall bladder lesions suspicious of malignancy. Diagnostic utility and clinical impact. Gallbladder carcinoma is a neoplasm having a poor prognosis in which the role of the positron emission tomography with (18)F-fluordeoxyglucose as a diagnostic tool, although of possible usefulness, has not been well-defined.It is a prospective cohort of patients with radiologically malignant suspicious gallbladder lesions. A staging diagnostic presurgical FDG-PET study was carried out in each patient using both dedicated PET and multimodality PET-CT scanners. Diagnostic accuracy parameters were calculated from the results of PET imaging and were correlated with the condition and/or the clinical course of the patients. The clinical impact of its implementation in the diagnosis of gallbladder carcinoma was also analyzed.A total of 42 patients were recruited (22 malignant lesions, 20 benign). Overall diagnostic accuracy was 83.33% for the diagnosis of the primary lesion, 88.89% for the evaluation of lymph node involvement and 85.1% for the evaluation of metastatic disease. Mean SUVmax in malignant gallbladder lesions was 6.14Â±2.89. ROC curve showed a cut-off value of 3.65 in the SUVmax for malignancy. Accuracy of PET studies alone (n=21) was slightly lower than that of the PET/CT (n=21). FDG-PET changed the management of 14.8% of the population due to the identification of unsuspected metastatic disease.FDG-PET accurately diagnoses malignancy or benignity of suspicious gallbladder lesions, with the addition of its capacity to identify unsuspected metastatic disease. PET-CT improves the diagnostic accuracy of the procedure, due to the metabolic-structural complementarity of their information. The SUVmax has a complementary value added to the visual analysis.
