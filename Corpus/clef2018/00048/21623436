Efficient bifunctional gallium-68 chelators for positron emission tomography: tris(hydroxypyridinone) ligands. A new tripodal tris(hydroxypyridinone) bifunctional chelator for gallium allows easy production of (68)Ga-labelled proteins rapidly under mild conditions in high yields at exceptionally high specific activity and low concentration.
