Synthesis of a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor: [11C]citalopram. Citalopram, a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, was labeled with 11C for non-invasive in vivo studies of serotonin uptake sites in the human brain using positron emission tomography. The synthesis was completed in approximately 17 min using [11C]methyl iodide as the precursor. The synthesis, purification, characterization, and determination of specific activity are described.
