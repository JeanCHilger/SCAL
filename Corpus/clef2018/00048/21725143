Dual-isotope PET using positron-gamma emitters. Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely recognized as a highly effective functional imaging modality. Unfortunately, standard PET cannot be used for dual-isotope imaging (which would allow for simultaneous investigation of two different biological processes), because positron-electron annihilation products from different tracers are indistinguishable in terms of energy. Methods that have been proposed for dual-isotope PET rely on differences in half-lives of the participating isotopes these approaches, however, require making assumptions concerning kinetic behavior of the tracers and may not lead to optimal results. In this paper we propose a novel approach for dual-isotope PET and investigate its performance using GATE simulations. Our method requires one of the two radioactive isotopes to be a pure positron emitter and the second isotope to emit an additional high-energy gamma in a cascade simultaneously with positron emission. Detection of this auxiliary prompt gamma in coincidence with the annihilation event allows us to identify the corresponding 511 keV photon pair as originating from the same isotope. Two list-mode datasets are created: a primary dataset that contains all detected 511 keV photon pairs from both isotopes, and a second, tagged (much smaller) dataset that contains only those PET events for which a coincident prompt gamma has also been detected. An image reconstructed from the tagged dataset reflects the distribution of the second positron-gamma radiotracer and serves as a prior for the reconstruction of the primary dataset. Our preliminary simulation study with partially overlapping (18)F/(22)Na and (18)F/(60)Cu radiotracer distributions showed that in these two cases the dual-isotope PET method allowed for separation of the two activity distributions and recovered total activities with relative errors of about 5%.
