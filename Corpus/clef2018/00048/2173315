Comparative studies of Toxocara infections in Belgium and in other countries. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with larval stage antigen was used to measure the concentration of antibodies to Toxocara sp in 2206 human sera. The results led to the determination of the specificity of our method, the experimental cutoff estimation and the Toxocara sp seroprevalence in different human populations. The prevalence of canine toxocariasis in pet dogs and the associated environmental contamination were studied through examination of 107 faecal and 20 sand-pits samples for Toxocara sp eggs. Our immunological studies and environmental research revealed the existence of toxocariasis as a zoonotic disease in Belgium. We compare here our results with those found in the world literature: in spite of some surprising results, the environmental factors are important for toxocaral infection. The urban residence, the restricted number of playgrounds for children and areas for dogs, the socioecological status are preponderant in the spread of infection.
