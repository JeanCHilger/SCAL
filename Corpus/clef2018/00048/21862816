Skeletal scintigraphy with 18F-NaF PET for the evaluation of bone pain in children. Although not commonly used in current clinical practice, the PET agent (18)F-NaF provides an excellent alternative to the standard tracers used for radionuclide bone scintigraphy. This article illustrates the use and appearance of (18)F-NaF PET and shows examples of its utility in the assessment of bone pain in children.Skeletal imaging with (18)F-NaF harnesses both the superior imaging characteristics of PET and the improved biodistribution of the fluoride tracer in comparison with standard nuclear techniques, resulting in excellent-quality images that can effectively be used to investigate the cause of bone pain in children.
