The yield of 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with clinical stage IIA, IIB, or IIIA breast cancer: a prospective study. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the role of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in patients with stage IIA, IIB, or IIIA breast cancer.During 56 mo, 131 consecutive patients with large (>2 cm) breast cancer and clinical stage IIA, IIB, or IIIA (based on clinical examination, mammography, breast MRI, and ultrasonography) underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT. The nuclear physician was unaware of the results of any other procedure (bone scan, chest radiography, liver ultrasound, or thoracoabdominal CT scan).Of the 131 examined patients, 36 had clinical stage IIA (34 T2N0 and 2 T1N1), 48 stage IIB (20 T3N0 and 28 T2N1), and 47 stage IIIA (29 T3N1, 9 T2N2, and 9 T3N2). (18)F-FDG PET/CT modified staging for 5.6% of stage IIA patients, for 14.6% of stage IIB patients, and for 27.6% of stage IIIA patients. However, within stage IIIA, the yield was specifically high among the 18 patients with N2 disease (56% stage modification). When considering stage IIB and primary operable IIIA (T3N1) together, the yield of (18)F-FDG PET/CT was 13% (10/77) extraaxillary regional lymph nodes were detected in 5 and distant metastases in 7 patients. In this series, (18)F-FDG PET/CT outperformed bone scanning, with only 1 misclassification versus 8 for bone scanning (P = 0.036).(18)F-FDG PET/CT provided useful information in 13% of patients with clinical T3N0, T2N1, or T3N1 disease. The yield was more modest in patients with stage IIA. The high yield in the case of N2 disease demonstrates that stage IIIA comprises 2 quite distinct groups of patients.
