Dynamic PET-CT studies for characterizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma metabolism:  comparison of analytical methods. To investigate the optimal PET protocol and analytical method to characterize the glucose metabolism in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).Newly diagnosed NPC patients were recruited and a dynamic PET-CT scan was performed. The optimized threshold to derive the arterial input function (AIF) was studied. Two-tissue compartmental kinetic modeling using three, four, and five parameters, Patlak graphical analysis, and time sensitivity (S-factor) analysis were performed. The best compartmental model was determined in terms of goodness of fit, and correlated with Ki from Patlak graphical analysis and the S-factor. The methods with R>0.9 and P<0.05 were considered acceptable. The protocols using two static scans with its retention index (RI=(SUV(2)/SUV(1)-1)Ã—100%, where SUV is the standardized uptake value) were also studied and compared with S-factor analysis.The best threshold of 0.6 was determined and used to derive AIF. The kinetic model with five parameters yields the best statistical results, but the model with k4=0 was used as the gold standard. All Ki values and some S-factors from data between various intervals (10-30, 10-45, 15-30, 15-45, 20-30, and 20-45 min) fulfilled the criteria. The RIs calculated from the S-factor were highly correlated to RI derived from simple two-point static scans at 10 and 30 min (R=0.9, P<0.0001).The Patlak graphical analyses and even a 20-min-interval S-factor analysis or simple two-point static scans were shown to be sufficient to characterize NPC metabolism, confirming the clinical feasibility of applying a short dynamic with image-derived AIF or simple two-point static PET scans for studying NPC.
