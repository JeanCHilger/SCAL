Significant impact of different oxygen breathing conditions on noninvasive in vivo tumor-hypoxia imaging using [¹⁸F]-fluoro-azomycinarabino-furanoside ([¹⁸F]FAZA). [18F]FAZA is a PET biomarker with great potential for imaging tumor hypoxia. Aim of our study was to compare [18F]FAZA uptake in mice with subcutaneous exogenous CT26 colon carcinomas and endogenous polyoma middle-T (PyV-mT) mammary carcinomas and to analyze the influence of different breathing protocols in CT26 colon carcinomas as well as the reversibility or irreversibility of [18F]FAZA uptake.We injected subcutaneous CT26 colon carcinoma or polyomavirus middle-T (PyV-mT) mammary carcinoma-bearing mice intravenously with18F-FAZA and performed PET scans 1-3 h post injection (p.i.). To analyze the impact of oxygen supply in CT26 carcinomas we used three different breathing protocols: (P0) air (P1) 100% oxygen 1 h prior injection until 3 h p.i.There was no difference in18F-FAZA uptake 1-3 h p.i. between the two carcinoma types (CT26: 1.58 ± 0.45%ID/cc PyV-mT: 1.47 ± 0.89%ID/cc, 1 h p.i., tumor size < 0.5 cm3). We measured a significant tracer clearance, which was more pronounced in muscle tissue (P0). The [18F]FAZA tumor-to-muscle-ratios in CT26 colon carcinoma-bearing mice 2 h and 3 h, but not 1 h p.i. were significantly higher when the mice breathed air (P0: 3.56 ± 0.55, 3 h) compared to the oxygen breathing protocols (P1: 2.45 ± 0.58Exogenous CT26 colon carcinomas and endogenous polyoma middle-T (PyV-mT) mammary carcinomas showed no differences in [18F]FAZA uptake 1-3 h p.i. Our analysis using various breathing protocols with air (P0) and with pure oxygen (P1, P2) clearly indicate that [18F]FAZA is an appropriate PET biomarker for in vivo analysis of hypoxia revealing an enhanced tracer uptake in tumors with reduced oxygen supply. [18F]FAZA uptake was independent of tumor-type.
