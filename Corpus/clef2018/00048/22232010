Identification of putative molecular imaging probes for BACE-1 by accounting for protein flexibility in virtual screening. β-secretase (BACE-1), an enzyme critical in the process of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides deposition in human brain, is closely associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A strong need exists, therefore, to identify molecular imaging probes homing at BACE-1 for use with positron emission tomography (PET) that is recognized as an effective tool for detecting AD. Through this imaging, an early diagnosis of AD could be made. Herein, to identify suitable molecular probes for use with PET, we searched the Molecular Imaging and Contrast Agent Database (MICAD), an online database warehousing scientific information regarding molecular imaging and contrast agents, and applied a virtual screening approach against the different confirmations of BACE-1 obtained from the World Wide Protein Database. The lack of considering receptor flexibility is a key drawback in virtual screening for drug discovery. Therefore, we incorporated protein flexibility into the virtual screening by using an ensemble of 143 experimental BACE-1 structures derived from the Protein Data Bank. Finally, the best performing affinity was recorded and used in the ranking of each ligand. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first virtual screening approach used to identify four new molecular probes that could target BACE-1 with favorable affinity, a discovery that can lead to the development of new PET probes for the early detection and therapy of AD. However, the actual utility of these probes can only be ascertained after in vitro and in vivo investigations.
