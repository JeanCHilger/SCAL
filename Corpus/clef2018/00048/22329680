Characterising the structure of photosynthetic biofilms using fluid dynamic gauging. A new configuration of the fluid dynamic gauging technique for measuring soft layers on surfaces was used to monitor the growth of a cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp. WH 5701, on stainless steel (SS), glass and an indium tin oxide (ITO) on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substratum. The biofilm thickness increased steadily over 4 weeks and exhibited noticeable changes in microstructure and strength. The biofilms all exhibited a two-layer structure, with a compact layer next to the substratum and a loose layer above. Biofilms on ITO or SS exhibited cohesive failure when removed by fluid shear whereas those on glass exhibited adhesive failure. The technique is able to elucidate various aspects of biofilm behaviour, as illustrated by the action of a biocide (NaOCl) on a mature biofilm.
