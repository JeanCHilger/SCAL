Pd2(dba)3/P(MeNCH2CH2)3N·HCl-mediated Stille cross-coupling of [1-11C]acetyl chloride with aryl and heteroaryl stannanes. Developments in the Stille cross-coupling of [1-11C]acetyl chloride with tributylphenylstannane mediated by the Pd2(dba)3/P(MeNCH2CH2)3N·HClsystem are reported.The reaction conditions for the cross-coupling of [1-11C]acetyl chloride with tributylphenylstannane were optimized, and the reaction scope was investigated.The cross-couplings of [1-11C]acetyl chloride with a range of aryl and heteroaryl stannanes were performed with good to excellent radiochemical conversions using the developed method.A highly efficient method for the Stille cross-coupling of [1-11C]acetyl chloride with organostannanes was demonstrated. It is anticipated that our method will be an attractive addition to the carbon-11-labeling procedures available for the synthesis of positron emission tomography probes.
