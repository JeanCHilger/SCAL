Automatic alignment of myocardial perfusion PET and 64-slice coronary CT angiography on hybrid PET/CT. Hybrid PET/CT allows for acquisition of cardiac PET and coronary CT angiography (CCTA) in one session. However, PET and CCTA are acquired with differing breathing protocols and require software registration. We aimed to validate automatic correction for breathing misalignment between PET and CCTA acquired on hybrid scanner.Single-session hybrid PET/CT studies of rest/stress (13)N-ammonia PET and CCTA in 32 consecutive patients were considered. Automated registration of PET left ventricular (LV) surfaces with CCTA volumes was evaluated by comparing with expert manual alignment by two observers.The average initial misalignments between the position of LV on PET and CCTA were 27.2 ± 11.8, 13.3 ± 11.5, and 14.3 ± 9.1 mm in x, y, and z axes on rest, and 26.3 ± 10.2, 11.1 ± 9.5, and 11.7 ± 7.1 mm in x, y, and z axes on stress, respectively. The automated PET-CCTA co-registration had 95% agreement as judged visually. Compared with expert manual alignment, the translation errors of the algorithm were 5.3 ± 2.8 mm (rest) and 6.0 ± 3.5 mm (stress). 3D visualization of combined coronary vessel anatomy and hypoperfusion from PET could be made without further manual adjustments.Software co-registration of CCTA and PET myocardial perfusion imaging on hybrid PET/CT scanners is necessary, but can be performed automatically, facilitating integrated 3D display on PET/CT.
