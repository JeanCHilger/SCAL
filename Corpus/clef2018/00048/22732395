Effective production of ⁶⁵Zn with a PET cyclotron. Cyclotrons dedicated to the production of PET radiopharmaceuticals for clinical use can be a resource also for research in other fields of science. In the present study we assessed the feasibility of (65)Zn production via the (65)Cu(p,n)(65)Zn reaction using a 16.5 MeV GE-PETtrace biomedical cyclotron. The radioisotope (65)Zn (t(1/2)=244.26 zd decay mode: EC 98.3%, β(+) 1.7%) has a wide range of applications, especially in botany and agriculture
