Feasibility of sequential PET/MRI using a state-of-the-art small animal PET and a 1 T benchtop MRI. Combined PET/MRI studies receive increasing attention, as their combination allows deeper insight into disease progression. We evaluated a novel 1 T benchtop MRI scanner (1T-MRI) for its use in sequential PET/MRI studies.Phantom studies were performed, addressing the attenuation caused by the MRI coils. For in vivo studies, PET/MRI data acquired with the 1T-MRI were compared with data using a conventional small animal high-field MRI (7T-MRI) in combination with the same PET scanner.Phantom and in vivo measurements show that the animal beds have no negative impact on the PET scanner performance compared to the 7T-MRI animal bed. Representative images of various animal studies are shown, indicating a wide field for sequential PET-benchtop MRI applications.Phantom and in vivo data indicate that sequential PET/MRI studies with this novel setup are comparable to sequential PET/MRI studies using a 7T-MRI in combination with a dedicated PET scanner.
