Clinicoradiologic perspective of a severe case of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. Fibrous dysplasia (FD) of bone is a congenital non-heritable disorder that was first reliably reported by von Recklinghausen, when he described patients with pathologic condition of bone characterized by deformity and fibrotic changes that he termed as osteitis fibrosa generalisata. FD may involve one bone (monostotic) or multiple bones (polyostotic) and occurs throughout the skeleton with predilection for long bones, ribs, and cranio-facial bones. Seventy percent of the lesions are monostotic and asymptomatic, and identified incidentally. The polyostotic form of disease is often deforming and devastating, with multiple skeletal complications like repeated fractures, limb length discrepancies, and bone pains. The bone lesion of unknown origin is characterized by slow progressive replacement of normal bone by abnormal proliferative, isomorphic fibrous tissue. This case report documents a 40-year-old male with severe polyostotic FD that involved most of the skeleton, including long bones of all extremities, pelvis, facial bones, and skull base. Initial evaluation consisted of physical examination, plain radiographs, which was followed by computed tomography scan, Single-photon emission computed tomography scan, and biochemical and hematological examination. This paper stresses on the clinical implications and management of this rare debilitating disease.
