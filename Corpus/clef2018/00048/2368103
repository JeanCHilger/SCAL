Cerebral vasoreactivity and blood flow before and 3 months after carotid endarterectomy. We measured regional cerebral blood flow and cerebral vasoreactivity before and 3 months after carotid endarterectomy using xenon-133 inhalation with single-photon emission computed tomography and the acetazolamide test in 14 selected patients who had suffered cerebral transient ischemic attacks due to an ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis. The patients had neither clinical nor cerebral computed tomographic evidence of infarction. Baseline regional cerebral blood flow was symmetrical before and unchanged after endarterectomy. Before endarterectomy, vasoreactivity in the middle and anterior cerebral artery territories of the symptomatic side was significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) however, vasoreactivity was normalized 3 months after surgery. Our findings strongly suggest that the stenoses caused a reduction in perfusion reserve that was improved by carotid endarterectomy.
