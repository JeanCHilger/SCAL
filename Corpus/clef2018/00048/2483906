Bacteriological variations in a medio-mineral water bottled in polyethylene terephthalate containers. Containers made with PET (Polyethylene-terephthalate) are currently more and more employed in packing industry, particularly for the storage of mineral waters. The increasing utilization of such containers is due to the intrinsic properties of this polymer, which was shown particularly suitable for making bottles devoted to the storage of gassed drinks. The resistance of the PET to high pressure, hits by falls and top-to-down loads indeed makes PET bottles unbreakable their gas-tightness warrants a good gas maintenance during the storage period
