Positron emission tomography in manganese intoxication. We employed 6-fluorodopa to study the integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic projection by positron emission tomography in 4 subjects with clinical features of mild parkinsonism caused by exposure to manganese. The 6-fluorodopa scans were normal. This finding suggests that in early manganism sufficient to cause parkinsonian deficits, damage may occur in pathways postsynaptic to the nigrostriatal system, probably involving striatal or pallidal neurons. Fluorodeoxyglucose scans showed decreased cortical glucose metabolism, the significance of which is discussed.
