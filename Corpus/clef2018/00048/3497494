Positron emission tomography of the heart. Positron emission computed tomography (PET) has introduced a new dimension into cardiology by its ability of imaging in-vivo cardiac metabolism non-invasively. Following administration of labelled substrates PET provides display of digitized heart tomograms, which reflect tracer concentration quantitatively. Thus, regional myocardial metabolism and perfusion can be measured using appropriate tracers such as C-11 palmitate, F-18 deoxyglucose, N-13 or C-11 amino acids, N-13 ammonia and Rb-82. Accordingly, the documentation of marked metabolic derangements during ischemia and infarction by initial clinical PET studies have been very promising diagnostically. It has been shown that normal, resting ischemic and acutely ischemic and infarcted tissue can be differentiated reliably. In cardiomyopathies, disturbed energy substrate utilization not known until then was found by means of PET. Unfortunately, PET will be available only in larger centers in the near future because of its high cost.
