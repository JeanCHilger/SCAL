Gold-195m first-pass radionuclide ventriculography, thallium-201 single-photon emission CT, and 12-lead ECG stress testing as a combined procedure. Graded, sequential, rest/exercise, gold-195m (Au-195m) (T1/2 = 30 seconds), first-pass ventriculography and thallium-201 (T1-201) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were performed simultaneously during a single, electrocardiograph-monitored, bicycle stress test in 24 individuals. The technical aspects and logistics involved in performing this combined radionuclide study are stressed in this preliminary report. Fourteen healthy volunteers each had a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and wall-motion response, along with normal Tl-201 perfusion and washout, as determined by both visual and quantitative analysis of the tomographic sections. Each of ten patients with coronary artery disease had at least one abnormality of these parameters. We suggest that it is technically feasible to evaluate both cardiac function and myocardial perfusion simultaneously by combining Au-195m ventriculography and T1-201 SPECT imaging into a single, noninvasive, diagnostic package.
