SOL-detectability of liver SPECT--analysis by SOL detection model. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of liver SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography). Eleven hospitals which are in or near Tokyo are participating in this study. Planar liver images and SPECT images of 134 cases which were retrospectively confirmed for its final diagnosis were collected. At the first study, the planar images (PS) were read by 13 nuclear medicine physicians. The second, the image reading by the combination of the planar images and the SPECT images (PS + SPECT) were performed. The confidence level of diagnosis for SOL (space occupying lesion) obtained by the image reading of PS and PS + SPECT has been analyzed by using the SOL detection model. The SOL detectability of PS + SPECT was higher than that of PS only. However, these differences were not statistically significant.
