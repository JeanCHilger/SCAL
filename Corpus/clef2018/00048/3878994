Severe stenoses and persistent occlusions of the middle cerebral artery: hemodynamic and metabolic consequences studied by positron tomography. Using positron emission tomography and the 15O continuous inhalation technique, we have measured the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF) and oxygen consumption (rCMRO2) of non-infarcted tissue in six patients with either tight stenosis (N = 3) or occlusion (N = 3) of the trunk of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) these arterial lesions were shown to be persistent on late and/or repeated angiograms. The patients were studied 1 to 6 months after their last cerebral ischemic event. The data were analyzed in 4 cm2 regions of interest (fig. 1) and were compared to age-matched control values. Regional right/left ratios were tested for significance individually by comparison to 95 p. 100 confidence limits found in control subjects. We found a significant reduction in mean rCBF in the affected MCA territory
