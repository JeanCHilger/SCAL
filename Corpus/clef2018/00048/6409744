Quantitative measurements of regional extra-vascular lung water in dogs using positron emission tomography. A new method for quantifying regional variations in extravascular lung water (rELW) has been developed. The positron source 15O (T1/2 = 2.0 min.) was provided as H215O 'on line' by constant intravenous injection. Tomographic images (PET) of the water distribution were obtained during equilibrium. The distribution of blood volume was obtained by marking erythrocytes (carboxyhaemoglobin) using a bolus inhalation [C-11)-CO T1/2 = 20.4 min). Absorption is calculated from transmission tomography. The rELW is defined as: total lung water minus intravascular space. The method was carried out in five intubated and anaesthetised dogs before and after induction of pulmonary oedema with oleic acid (0.06 ml./kg.). Mean ELW (PET) rose from 0.13 +/- 0.02 g./cm.3 to 0.24 +/- 0.04 g./cm.3. There was good correlation with a simultaneously performed thermo-dye method (7.1 +/- 1.3 ml./kg. KG to 13.3 +/- 1.9 ml./kg. KG
