Presynaptic dopamine function in striatum of neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients. Presynaptic dopamine function (6-[18F]-fluorodopa uptake) in the brains of seven neuroleptic-naive first-admission schizophrenic patients and eight healthy controls was studied with positron emission tomography. The fluorodopa influx constant (Ki) in putamen was higher in the patients than in controls (average mean: 0.0149 vs 0.0129, p = 0.034). The changes in caudate were smaller but significantly lateralised to the left caudate. There was one catatonic schizophrenic patient in our sample. This patient had lower striatal Ki than any control. Alterations in striatal presynaptic dopamine function may constitute a part of disrupted neural circuits that predispose to schizophrenic psychosis.
