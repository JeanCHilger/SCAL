The liver-spleen scan as a quantitative liver function test: correlation with liver severity at peritoneoscopy. Sulfur colloid distribution on liver-spleen scan is determined by the perfused Kupffer cell mass. The perfused Kupffer cell mass is proportional to the perfused hepatocyte mass, but is less affected by acute changes in hepatocyte function. Thus, sulfur colloid distribution parameters (precisely measured by quantitative liver-spleen scan [QLSS]) may be an excellent test of the perfused hepatic mass. Although no gold standard exists for confirmation, a close correlation should exist between liver disease severity assessed at peritoneoscopy and sulfur colloid distribution. Peritoneoscopy severity (scored as total peritoneoscopy score [PS] range, 0-5) was assessed in 76 patients who also had QLSS. Multivariate equation were generated to estimate liver disease severity from the QLSS. These were then applied prospectively in 20 consecutive patients to validate these equations. In 76 patients, 62 were evaluated because of chronic liver disease (CLD) and included those with micronodular (20) and macronodular (20) cirrhosis with various degrees of severity (Child's A, 16
