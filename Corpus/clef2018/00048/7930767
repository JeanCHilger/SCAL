Radioimmunoscintigraphy of squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck region. Radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) with a monoclonal antibody (SQ 174, Biomira, Inc, Canada) is introduced as a new diagnostic method for detection of squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck region. RIS could detect eight of the 10 primary tumors. One patient had histopathologically proven nodal disease. This lymph node was seen in RIS. No false positive results were seen in RIS, whereas sonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging showed several false positive results.
