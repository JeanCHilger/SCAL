Late reperfusion for acute myocardial infarction limits the dilatation of left ventricle without the reduction of infarct size. While previous clinical studies have shown a possible beneficial effect of the reperfusion performed at a relatively late phase of acute myocardial infarction ("late reperfusion") in preventing left ventricular enlargement, the mechanism has not been clarified.Of 89 patients with an initial anterior myocardial infarction, reperfusion was successful in 69. These 69 were divided into three groups according to the time required to achieve reperfusion after the onset of symptoms: early-reperfused (< 3 hours from the onset to reperfusion n = 22), intermediate-reperfused (3 to 6 hours from the onset to reperfusionLate reperfusion appeared to prevent ventricular dilatation acute myocardial infarction independent of the limitation of infarct size.
