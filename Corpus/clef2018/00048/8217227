Coronary surgery can be an alternative to heart transplantation in selected patients with end-stage ischemic heart disease. Patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) low ejection fraction (EF), and congestive heart failure (CHF), are usually referred for orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). This study reports our experience with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients initially referred for OHT, and suggests guidelines to facilitate the choice of procedure (OHT or CABG). Between January 1990 and December 1991, 32 patients with IHD, proposed for OHT, underwent CABG 31/32 patients were male, the mean age was 58 +/- 12 years (40 to 70). Congestive heart failure was present in all patients and was the main symptom. The mean EF was 23 (14 to 31%), mean cardiac index (CI) 2.4 l/min per m2 (1.6 to 3.1 l/min per m2), mean pulmonary artery mean pressure (MPAP) 26 (20 to 37 mmHg) and mean pulmonary wedge pressure 16 (12 to 22 mmHg). Every patients underwent a myocardial viability study by thallium scintigraphy (n = 32) and/or by positron emission tomography (n = 10). The perioperative mortality was 9.3% (3/32). All long-term survivors (n = 27) are in NYHA Class II with a complete follow-up (mean 18 +/- 6 months). Ejection fraction control either by angiography (n = 15) or by single photon emission computed tomography (n = 12) showed an increase of up to 38% (22%-46%). Three determinant factors influenced the choice of CABG. 1) CI > 21/min per m2, 2) MPAP < 35 mmHg. 3) Detection of myocardial viability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
