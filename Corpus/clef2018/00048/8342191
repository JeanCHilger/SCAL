Regional cerebral blood flow measured with N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine and its redistribution in ischemic cerebrovascular disease. The relation between the redistribution phenomenon and regional cerebral blood flow and its clinical significance were investigated in stroke patients.Single-photon emission computed tomography studies using N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine were performed on 16 patients (26 to 77 years old) with chronic infarction and 10 age-matched normal control subjects. Regional cerebral blood flow was quantitatively measured by a microsphere model, and the redistribution on delayed images was analyzed in ischemic lesions.Supratentorial mean cerebral blood flow and the ratio of gray matter to white matter in normal subjects were 52.7 +/- 5.0 mL/100 g per minute and 2.34, respectively. Low-activity areas of ischemic lesions on early images were classified into two abnormal zones, an infarct area and a peri-infarct area. These regions were characterized by regional blood flow averaging 9 to 20 mL/100 g per minute and 22 to 41 mL/100 g per minute, respectively. Redistribution, which was minimally present in the infarct area, was markedly enhanced in the peri-infarct area. After bypass surgery, we observed a significant increase of blood flow (+22%) in the peri-infarct area.The data indicate that the redistribution phenomenon depends on the maintenance of a minimal blood flow that would sustain cellular function and that this phenomenon is useful to evaluate bypass surgery in patients with chronic infarction.
