Improved evaluation of technetium-99m-red blood cell SPECT in hemangioma of the liver. This paper reports the results of a prospective study carried out to evaluate a new reading method of tomographic 99mTc red blood cell (RBC) imaging in liver hemangiomas. For this purpose, assessment of planar imaging and conventional, static 99mTc-RBC SPECT presentation (x-ray type film) (Method 1) was compared to a dynamic three-view display of SPECT slices (Method 2) in 21 patients with 56 hemangiomas and 18 patients with malignant liver lesions. Of the 56 hemangiomas, 47 were diagnosed by US, 6 by CT and 56 by MRI. Twenty-nine (52%) hemangiomas were detected by planar scintigraphy and 38 (68%) by SPECT Method 1, whereas 53 (95%) were visualized by SPECT Method 2. Comparing Methods 1 and 2 in hemangiomas < or = 1.0 cm, 1.1-2.0 cm and 2.1-3.0 cm in diameter, Method 2 improved sensitivity from 18% to 82%, 50% to 93% and 82% to 100%, respectively. The smallest hemangioma detected with Method 2 was 0.5 cm in diameter with Method 1, 0.9 cm
