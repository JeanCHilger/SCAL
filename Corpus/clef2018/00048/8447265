Scintigraphic monitoring of coronary artery occlusion due to Kawasaki disease. Noninvasive monitoring of the process of coronary occlusion will probably aid in determining the timing of therapeutic interventions for Kawasaki disease. A pair study of coronary angiography and thallium scintigraphy after dipyridamole infusion-single-photon emission computed tomography with dipyridamole infusion (Dp-SPECT) was repeated at least twice at intervals of several years in 29 patients, and these findings were compared and analyzed in a chronologic manner. The current study demonstrated that angiographic stenosis was more severe, with an increase in the severity of the perfusion defect. Positive rates determined by Dp-SPECT increased with increasing severity of stenosis on angiography. Angiographic findings from the first to the second serial study that showed worsening, no change and improvement were correctly diagnosed from scintigraphic changes in 94% of coronary arterial lesions. About half of the arteries with progression in stenotic severity could be found before complete occlusion by scintigraphic monitoring. It is concluded that Dp-SPECT can be used as a noninvasive monitor of the occurrence and progression of coronary stenoses due to Kawasaki disease.
