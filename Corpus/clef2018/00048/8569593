Myocardial perfusion imaging using 99mTc-MIBI in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy--methodology and its clinical use. The aim of the study was to demonstrate the methodology of investigation of myocardial perfusion and viability using 99mTc-MIBI in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and to estimate its clinical use. Myocardial perfusion and viability were investigated by using the planar and SPECT scintigraphy and by estimating the wall motion of the myocardium. The foci of decreased myocardial viability were found in 7 patients. One patient had perfusion defect only at stress. Analyzing the patients data, by using the gated studies, we found various degrees of wall motion myocardial abnormalities.
