Cerebral oxygen metabolism in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy: a positron emission tomography study. To investigate cerebral oxygen metabolism in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PSP and a variable degree of cognitive deficit were selected for positron emission tomography (PET) of the brain. In 4 of them, a significant decrease in oxygen metabolism was found in all cortical regions, without frontal accentuation. In the group as a whole, this decrease was even slightly more marked in parietal and temporal regions. These findings are not consistent with earlier PET studies that demonstrated frontal targeting of hypometabolism in PSP patients. Part of this discrepancy can be explained by differences in methodology, although the use of different clinical criteria and overlap of PSP with other neurodegenerative diseases must be taken into account. It is concluded that the absence of frontal hypometabolism on PET examination does not exclude the diagnosis of PSP.
