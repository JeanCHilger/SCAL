Brain energy metabolism in early blind subjects: neural activity in the visual cortex. As an attempt to better understand the metabolic basis for the previously reported increases in glucose metabolism in the visual cortex of congenitally blind subjects, cerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption and glucose utilization were investigated with multitracer positron emission tomography. Measurements were carried out in three subjects who became blind early in life and in three age-matched blindfolded controls. Regional analysis of cerebral blood flow, metabolic rates for oxygen and glucose utilization revealed that these parameters were relatively higher in the visual cortex in case of early blindness (109.7 +/- 2.4% 114.3 +/- 1.5%
