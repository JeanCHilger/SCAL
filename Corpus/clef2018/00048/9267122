Compartment analysis of 123I-iomazenil brain on early and delayed SPECT. We investigated the characteristics of 123I-Iomazenil (IMZ) SPECT images in 12 adults (six males and six females, with a mean age of 56.1 years). The washout rate of 123I-IMZ from the brain was estimated from two SPECTs done 15 min and 3 hr after injection. Although the washout was relatively slow, the rates differed in each intracerebral region, suggesting that the distribution of 123I-IMZ was gradually changing. Furthermore, assuming 123I-IMZ kinetics in the brain for the three-compartment, two-parameter model, the transition rate constant (K1) from the blood to the brain and the binding potentials (BP) of benzodiazepine to the receptor were calculated. The BP and K1 values were compared with 123I-IMZ SPECT counts and CBF values by 123I-IMP. The BP values correlated more closely with the counts on the delayed SPECT than those on the early SPECT. It was confirmed that delayed SPECT images reflect better the distribution of the benzodiazepine receptor than early images do. On the other hand, the K1 values correlated highly with CBF obtained by 123I-IMP, and this finding suggested that super-early SPECT images might be remarkably influenced by the distribution of CBF.
