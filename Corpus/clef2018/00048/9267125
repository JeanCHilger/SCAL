Quantitative evaluation of response at acetazolamide test using 99mTc-ECD SPECT a trial of production of the response map. In the method by Matsuda and Takeuchi et al. for easy regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements at pre- and post-acetazolamide tests using 99mTc-ECD, a study was done for producing the increase rate of rCBF as a response map after acetazolamide administration. To prepare the response map calculated from the arithmetic operation of [(rCBF image at administration--rCBF image at rest)/rCBF image at rest x 100], the images were preprocessed by combination of matrix size conversion and smoothing techniques and then areas outside the brain were masked to remove amplified noises. The response map seemed helpful for visual evaluation of the response after acetazolamide administration, and also for understanding the disease conditions and clinical courses.
