Effect of ST segment measurement point on performance of exercise ECG analysis. To evaluate the effect of ST-segment measurement point on diagnostic performance of the ST-segment/heart rate (ST/HR) hysteresis, the ST/HR index, and the end-exercise ST-segment depression in the detection of coronary artery disease, we analysed the exercise electrocardiograms of 347 patients using ST-segment depression measured at 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 ms after the J-point. Of these patients, 127 had and 13 had no significant coronary artery disease according to angiography, 18 had no myocardial perfusion defect according to technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography, and 189 were clinically 'normal' having low likelihood of coronary artery disease. Comparison of areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the discriminative capacity of the above diagnostic variables improved systematically up to the ST-segment measurement point of 60 ms after the J-point. As compared to analysis at the J-point (0 ms), the areas based on the 60-ms point were 89 vs. 84% (p=0.0001) for the ST/HR hysteresis, 83 vs. 76% (p<0.0001) for the ST/HR index, and 76 vs. 61% (p<0.0001) for the end-exercise ST depression. These findings suggest that the ST-segment measurement at 60 ms after the J-point is the most reasonable point of choice in terms of discriminative capacity of both the simple and the heart rate-adjusted indices of ST depression. Moreover, the ST/HR hysteresis had the best discriminative capacity independently of the ST-segment measurement point, the observation thus giving further support to clinical utility of this new method in the detection of coronary artery disease.
