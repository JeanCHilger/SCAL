PET with hydroxytryptophan as tracer in hormone-refractory prostatic adenocarcinoma: evaluation of decarboxylation in vivo. Position emission tomography (PET) was performed on two patients with hormone-refractory prostatic adenocarcinoma in order to characterize the mechanism behind an earlier observed increased uptake of tracer hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) in bone metastases. The osseous metastases were investigated with 5-hydroxytryptophan, radio-labelled with 11C in the carboxyl group (5-HTC), and with 5-HTP in order to elucidate in vivo the presence of hydroxytryptophan decarboxylation. An increased uptake, measured as standard uptake value (SUV), in the metastatic lesions was observed using 5-HTP. The uptake varied between lesions. Using 5-HTC a corresponding uptake was observed. The time-activity rates were similar. The congruence in uptake patterns between 5-HTP and 5-HTC in the investigated lesions, demonstrates that decarboxylation of 5-hydroxytryptophan to serotonin is not a dominant factor in the uptake. It was concluded that 5-HTC could be used in vivo to investigate the chemical event of decarboxylation of 5-hydroxytryptophan and provide information about characteristics in metastatic lesions.
