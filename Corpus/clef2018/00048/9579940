Changes in regional cerebral blood flow beyond the temporal lobe in unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is widely used to evaluate functional abnormalities during the epileptic event. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) are well defined in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) undergoing surgical resection. Nonetheless, the interpretation of ictal abnormalities in CBF beyond the temporal lobes has not been carefully addressed.We assessed 4 patients with pathologically proven unilateral TLE who had significant ipsilateral frontal hypoperfusion in ictal studies with no other abnormalities but chronic epilepsy accounting for such findings. Patients were assessed as candidates for surgery by interictal EEG, neuropsychological studies, brain magnetic resonance imaging, scalp electrode video-EEG monitoring, and ictal SPECT.Characteristic hyperperfusion was evident over the temporal lobe ipsilateral to the EEG focus, with significant hypoperfusion over the frontal region in 3 patients. In patient 4, frontal hypoperfusion was not statistically significant.SPECT demonstrated relative rCBF changes beyond the epileptogenic zone in unilateral TLE. Our findings provide further insight into the pathophysiological changes underlying this condition.
