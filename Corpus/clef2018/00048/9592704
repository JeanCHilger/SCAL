Methods for coronary functional assessment. Functional evaluation of coronary vasomotion encompasses the assessment of dynamic changes in coronary lumen, vessel wall, blood flow, intracoronary pressure and myocardial perfusion in response to specific pharmacologic stimuli. These parameters are obtained to characterize mechanisms of physiologic regulation and to evaluate pathophysiologic processes and potential therapeutic strategies, especially with regard to the development of coronary atherosclerosis. To this end, a variety of direct (invasive) and indirect (non-invasive) diagnostic tools are employed. Among the invasive methods are registration of intracoronary Doppler flow, coronary pressure measurements, quantitative coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound. The non-invasive modalities consist of coronary Doppler echocardiography, positron emission tomography, myocardial scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging. Because of the different technical and physiological principles involved, these methods are complementary by providing independent access to different aspects. The combined invasive functional testing as employed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory allows for a simultaneous synopsis of high-resolution coronary imaging and direct measurement of physiologic parameters during local application of defined pharmacologically active substances. However, the demands in terms of equipment, time and operator skills are high and limit this combined invasive approach to specialized centers. Besides these research purposes, a number of functional methods has entered the clinical arena. They are employed to evaluate the hemodynamic significance of coronary lesions and to assess functional outcome of therapeutic interventions in the catheterization laboratory. The underlying principles and applications of the different methods are described and an overview of selected results is presented.
