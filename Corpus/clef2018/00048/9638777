Seroprevalences to Toxoplasma gondii in privately-owned dogs in Taiwan. The prevalences of IgG and IgM antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in pet dogs in Taiwan were measured by using both a kinetics-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting. A logistic regression model with five factors (sex, age, weight, breed, domain) was analyzed. Pet dogs (n = 658) had seroprevalence of 7.9%, and had IgG and IgM geometric mean titers of 1:50 and 1:31, respectively. Older or heavier pet dogs had higher odds of seropositivity than younger or lighter dogs. Also, mixed-breed dogs had higher odds of seropositivity than pure-bred dogs.
