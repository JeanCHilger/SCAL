Discordance of technetium-99m-HMPAO and technetium-99m-ECD SPECT in herpes simplex encephalitis. Technetium-99m-hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) and 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) accumulate in brain tissue in proportion to regional cerebral blood flow in healthy subjects and in patients with a variety of neurological diseases. We report on four patients with herpes simplex encephalitis and the discordance between these two approved cerebral perfusion imaging radiopharmaceuticals.SPECT images showed unilateral regional increase of 99mTc-HMPAO uptake and decrease of 99mTc-ECD uptake in the affected temporal lobe.
