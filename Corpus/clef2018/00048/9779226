Cerebral blood flow in chronic hydrocephalus--a parameter indicating shunt failure--new aspects. Prediction of outcome after shunt-therapy in chronic hydrocephalus syndrome is uncertain. Pathology reveals an impairment of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Based on this, we evaluated CBF and its significance for the assessment of prognosis. In 21 patients (mean age 69 years) selected for surgery, CBF was measured by PET (15O-H2O) before, about one week and 7 months (n = 14) after shunting. CBF was computed by a 1-compartmental model in the territories of the ACA, MCA and PCA. One PET slice in the height of the maximum projection of both cellae mediae was chosen. CBF data were standardized by cluster analysis. Three CBFClusters with significantly different CBF levels prior to shunting in the ACA, MCA and PCA territory, respectively, referred to the sample average (38.2 ml/100 ml/min) were found. These CBFClusters differed in clinical outcome: almost 50% and 90% of patients improved clinically in CBFCluster I, with a perfusion level lower than average, after one week and 7 months, respectively. In contrast, patients of CBFCluster II with an average perfusion did not improve. CBF changes 7 months after shunting related to global CBF before surgery showed a relationship with the clinical course. Clinical outcome corresponded with preoperative global CBF values. Cerebral blood flow lower than average forecasts clinical improvement. Our results suggest that measurement of CBF adds to the indication for surgery.
