Noninvasive diagnosis of coronary artery stenosis in women with limited exercise capacity: comparison of dobutamine stress echocardiography and 99mTc sestamibi single-photon emission CT. To compare the accuracy of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and simultaneous 99mTc sestamibi (MIBI) single-photon emission CT (SPECT) imaging for the diagnosis of coronary artery stenosis in women.Seventy women with limited exercise capacity referred for evaluation of myocardial ischemia.DSE (up to 40 microg/kg/min) was performed in conjunction with stress MIBI SPECT. Resting MIBI images were acquired 24 h after the stress test. Ischemia was defined as new or worsened wall motion abnormalities confirmed by DSE and as reversible perfusion defects confirmed by MIBI. Significant coronary artery disease was defined as > or = 50% luminal diameter stenosis.DSE was positive for ischemia in 35 of 45 patients with coronary artery stenosis and in 2 of 25 patients without coronary artery stenosis (sensitivity = 78% CI, 68 to 88 specificity = 92% CI, 85 to 99DSE is a useful noninvasive method for the diagnosis of coronary artery stenosis in women and provides a higher overall and regional diagnostic accuracy than dobutamine MIBI SPECT in this particular population.
