Theta synchronization in the human EEG and episodic retrieval. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS) was measured during episodic retrieval in a specially designed recognition task which forces subjects to avoid semantic search strategies. ERD represents the percentage of a decrease, ERS an increase in band power. The results show that only the theta band differentiates between good and bad episodic memory performers and that good performance is related to a large degree of theta synchronization. The delta and alpha bands did not yield significant effects. Topographical differences in theta ERS reveal that good performers use primarily their right hemisphere to retrieve episodic information. This finding agrees with respective results from PET studies.
