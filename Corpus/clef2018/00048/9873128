Obtaining myo-cardial perfusion images synchronized with the ECG (gated-SPEC) after injecting MIBI during exertion: comparative study with echocardiography in 95 patients for the assessment of left ventricular function. Technical innovation has recently resulted in the routine use of gated-SPECT in myocardial perfusion imaging. In the present work we compare estimates of left ventricular function (LV cavity) by gated-SPECT with those of conventional echocardiography in a group of 95 ischemic patients, 49 of whom had previous myocardial infarction. Kappa analysis showed correlation coefficients of 0.67 for global function in the whole group and of 0.68 in patients with MI, as well as of 0.56 in the anterior wall, and 0.55 in the inferior wall. With these data, we believe that the technique is useful and it adds to the conventional perfusion SPECT imaging. Also, it is conveniently validated against echocardiography in our hands.
