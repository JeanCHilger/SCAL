Ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia after 6 h passive hyperventilation in humans. 1. Acute exposure to hypoxia stimulates ventilation and induces hypocapnia. Long-term exposure to hypoxia generates changes in respiratory control known as ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia. The object of this study was to investigate the degree to which the hyperventilation and hypocapnia can induce the changes known as ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia, in the absence of the primary hypoxic stimulus itself. 2. Three 6 h protocols were each performed on twelve healthy volunteers: (1) passive hypocapnic hyperventilation, with end-tidal CO2 pressure (PET,CO2) held 10 Torr below the eupnoeic value (2) passive eucapnic hyperventilation, with PET,CO2 maintained eucapnic
