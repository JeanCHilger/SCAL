Surgical angioplasty of the main coronary arteries in children. To determine the safety and efficacy of surgical angioplasty of the coronary arteries in children.We performed 9 surgical reconstructions of the left main coronary artery and 1 of the right coronary artery ostium in 10 children (mean age 5.7 years range 2 months-15 years). The basic diseases included the following: congenital atresia of the left coronary artery (n = 2) and atresia of the right coronary artery in a patient with an aortoventricular tunnel (n = 1)There was 1 hospital death and 9 patients are alive (mean follow-up 46 +/- 30 months range 12 months to 10.5 years). Eight of 9 survivors had a selective coronary artery angiogram and had normal coronary artery ostia. Two patients had stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery, 1 of whom underwent successful internal thoracic artery grafting.Surgical angioplasty of the coronary stems restores physiologic coronary perfusion and conserves bypass material. It can be performed safely in children and provides encouraging midterm results.
