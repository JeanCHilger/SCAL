18-FDG imaging in breast cancer. Despite the large number of women with breast cancer and the importance of this disease in health care, only a relatively small number of published reports involve the application of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the evaluation of patients with breast cancer. This report summarizes the results of these studies, presents the opinions from various clinical oncologists from both a university and community setting, and discusses the possible future implication of positron imaging technology in the management of breast cancer. The four potential areas of clinical application include (1) detection and differentiation of primary breast lesions, (2) staging of axillary lymph nodes, (3) detection of residual and metastatic disease, and (4) monitoring the response to chemotherapy.
