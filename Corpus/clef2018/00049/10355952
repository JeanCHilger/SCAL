Washout rate of 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine increased by posture change or exercise in normal volunteers. 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging detects sympathetic nerve function in the heart. The present study was conducted to clarify whether posture change or exercise affects 123I-MIBG kinetics in normal volunteers. Seven subjects underwent three 123I-MIBG studies, i.e., supine protocol, sitting protocol and exercise protocol. Planar 123I-MIBG images were obtained at 15 minutes, 1 hour and 4 hours after injection of 123I-MIBG. The washout rate (WR) from 15 minutes to 1 hour in the supine position in all subjects was similar for all three protocols, whereas the WR from 1 hour to 4 hours was significantly augmented in the sitting protocol and the exercise protocol as compared to the supine protocol (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). The serum concentration of noradrenaline was significantly increased from the baseline to the 4 hour sampling in the sitting protocol and the exercise protocol (both p < 0.01), but was not altered in the supine protocol. The WR from 1 hour to 4 hours significantly correlated with the noradrenaline concentration in 4 hour sampling (r = 0.59, p < 0.01). It also significantly correlated with an increase in the noradrenaline concentration from the baseline to the 4 hour sampling (r = 0.53, p < 0.05). It is concluded that posture change or exercise affects the WR of 123I-MIBG in normal healthy subjects.
