Exercise-test Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT in patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction: direct comparison with Ti-201 reinjection. This study was designed to compare the results of exercise-rest technetium-99m tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with those of thallium-201 reinjection at rest after exercise-redistribution imaging in the same patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.Within 1 week, 33 patients with chronic myocardial infarction and LV dysfunction underwent exercise-rest tetrofosmin SPECT and Tl-201 reinjection at rest after exercise-redistribution imaging. In each patient, regional tetrofosmin and Tl-201 activity was quantitatively measured in 22 myocardial segments. Regional LV function was assessed in corresponding segments by echocardiography.Agreement in the evaluation of regional perfusion status between tetrofosmin and Tl-201 imaging was observed in 78% of the 726 total segments, with a kappa value of 0.61. In segments with normal function at echocardiography (n = 436), no difference between Tl-201 and tetrofosmin uptake was observed. In hypokinetic segments (n = 138), exercise tetrofosmin uptake was lower (P < .01) as compared with exercise Tl-201 activity, whereas no difference was observed between tetrofosmin uptake at rest as compared with Tl-201 activity on redistribution and reinjection images. In segments with severe functional impairment (akinetic or dyskinetic, n = 152), tetrofosmin uptake on exercise images was reduced (P < .01) as compared with exercise Tl-201 activity furthermore, tetrofosmin uptake at rest was lower (P < .01) as compared with Tl-201 activity on both redistribution and reinjection images. In these segments, concordance in the detection of myocardial viability between tetrofosmin and Tl-201 imaging was observed in 138 (91%) of the 152 segments, with a kappa value of 0.77.In patients with chronic coronary artery disease and LV dysfunction quantitative exercise-rest tetrofosmin and Tl-201 reinjection SPECT provide similar information in the assessment of perfusion status and in the detection of myocardial viability.
