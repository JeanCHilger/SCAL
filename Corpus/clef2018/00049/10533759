Detection of cancer in augmented breasts by positron emission tomography. To assess the diagnostic efficiency of positron emission tomography with 18-fluorine fluorodeoxyglucose in detecting breast cancer in augmented breasts.Retrospective study.University hospital, Korea.9 cases or 8 patients with breasts augmented with paraffin or silicone.FDG-PET, mammography, and ultrasonographyThe mammogram detected the breast cancer in only 1 of 3 patients, and ultrasonography gave a false positive result in 1 patient with an augmented breast. In contrast, PET predicted all the cancers and 5/6 benign lesions. 2/3 breast cancers had axillary FDG uptake interpreted as showing metastatic involvement, and in 1 case with cancer with no axillary lymph node involvement there was no FDG uptake in the axilla, which correlated with the pathological finding.Although the high cost of PET makes its use as a screening test for all patients with augmented breasts unrealistic, it would be the best diagnostic choice if other methods failed.
