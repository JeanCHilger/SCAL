Exact rebinning methods for three-dimensional PET. The high computational cost of data processing in volume PET imaging is still hindering the routine application of this successful technique, especially in the case of dynamic studies. This paper describes two new algorithms based on an exact rebinning equation, which can be applied to accelerate the processing of three-dimensional (3-D) PET data. The first algorithm, FOREPROJ, is a fast-forward projection algorithm that allows calculation of the 3-D attenuation correction factors (ACF's) directly from a two-dimensional (2-D) transmission scan, without first reconstructing the attenuation map and then performing a 3-D forward projection. The use of FOREPROJ speeds up the estimation of the 3-D ACF's by more than a factor five. The second algorithm, FOREX, is a rebinning algorithm that is also more than five times faster, compared to the standard reprojection algorithm (3DRP) and does not suffer from the image distortions generated by the even faster approximate Fourier rebinning (FORE) method at large axial apertures. However, FOREX is probably not required by most existing scanners, as the axial apertures are not large enough to show improvements over FORE with clinical data. Both algorithms have been implemented and applied to data simulated for a scanner with a large axial aperture (30 degrees), and also to data acquired with the ECAT HR and the ECAT HR+ scanners. Results demonstrate the excellent accuracy achieved by these algorithms and the important speedup when the sinogram sizes are powers of two.
