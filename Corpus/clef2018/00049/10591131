Inhibition of fibroblast cell adhesion on substrate by coating with 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine polymers. Fibroblast adhesion and growth behavior were examined on various polymers coated on a poly(ethylene telephthalate) (PET) substrate. The polymers are poly[2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC)-co-n-butyl methacrylatel copolymer (PMB)s with different MPC unit compositions, and poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate). Surface analysis by dynamic contact angle measurement revealed that the mobility of the polymer chain on the PET substrate depended on the MPC unit composition, but there was no significant difference between the PMBs with 3-10 mol% MPC units and poly(HEMA). Fibronectin adsorption on the polymer surface from a cell culture medium was determined by immunoassay. The adsorbed fibronection was evenly distrubuted in every polymer, however, the amount was reduced with an increase in the MPC unit composition in the PMB. This result suggested that the MPC unit could weaken the interaction between the polymer surface and proteins. When fibroblast L-929 cells, were cultured on the polymers, the cells adhered and the number of cells increased on not only the hydrophobic poly(BMA) but also on the hydrophilic poly(HEMA). However, the number of cells that adhered on the PMB surface decreased with an increase in the MPC unit composition. This was a result of the fibronectin adsorption behavior. Thus, it could be concluded that since the PMB could suppress cell adhesion proteins e.g. fibronectin, the PMB showed excellent cell adhesive resistance properties.
