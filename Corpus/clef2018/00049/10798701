In vivo biodistribution of 125IPIP and internal dosimetry of 123IPIP radioiodinated agents selective to the muscarinic acetylcholinergic receptor complex. The development of new radioiodinated ligands for imaging the muscarinic acetylcholinergic complex (mAChR) using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) requires the evaluation of human organ doses prior to approval for human use. Animal biodistribution and excretion data were obtained and evaluated for IPIP, a new mAChR agent. Preliminary biodistribution studies were performed on four different stereoisomers of IPIP. A biokinetic model of the Z-(S)-IPIP stereoisomer was constructed for the rat and used to estimate the internal absorbed dose in humans based on an extrapolation of the rat model. The thyroid is the critical organ for this radiopharmaceutical, with an absorbed dose estimate of 2.4 mGy/MBq for both males and females, when labeled with 123I. Even when blocked, the thyroid is still the critical organ, yet with a 90% dose reduction. The heart and brain receive the next highest doses in both males and females. Effective dose estimates for the use of pure 123I-PIP in humans are 0.16 mSv/MBq for males and 0.14 mSv/MBq for females. The biodistribution studies of the Z-(S)-IPIP stereoisomer showed the most promise as a successful agent for imaging muscarinic receptor sites in the heart and brain. IPIP also demonstrated potential as a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical for some colon carcinomas where muscarinic receptor sites are expressed in the tumor cells. These results provide preliminary data for use of IPIP in clinical studies on humans.
