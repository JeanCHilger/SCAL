Surface modification of poly(ethylene terephthalate) angioplasty balloons with a hydrophilic poly(acrylamide-co-ethylene glycol) interpenetrating polymer network coating. An interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) of poly(acrylamide-co-ethylene glycol) (p(AAm-co-EG)) hydrogel was covalently grafted to polyethylene terephthalate (PET) angioplasty balloons to increase surface hydrophilicity and improve lubricity. A 2-step graft polymerization protocol was followed to first polymerize and cross-link acrylamide onto the substrate with a photosensitizer and/or oxygen plasma pretreatment. The effects of varying photo-initiation and plasma exposure times were investigated separately and conjunctively using water contact angles to obtain optimal coating deposition parameters. A poly(ethylene glycol) network was then grafted by swelling the preexisting polyacrylamide network to allow inter-diffusion of the monomer and cross-linker, which were then polymerized by photo-initiation. When the photo-initiation time was long enough to reach near gelation, pretreatment of PET with oxygen plasma did not offer significant benefit. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of both polymer layers, and composition depth profiles supported the assessment that an interpenetrating network was formed. Tensile testing and application of Weibull statistics on unmodified and modified films indicated that the surface modification approach did not significantly alter the mechanical integrity of the material. These findings indicate that a p(AAm-co-EG) coating can be effectively deposited on PET surfaces without compromising the structural integrity of the substrate.
