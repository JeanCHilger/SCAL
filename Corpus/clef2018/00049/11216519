64Cu-TETA-octreotide as a PET imaging agent for patients with neuroendocrine tumors. 64Cu (half-life, 12.7 h beta+, 0.653 MeV [17.4%]Eight patients with a history of neuroendocrine tumors (five patients with carcinoid tumors and three patients with islet cell tumors) were imaged by conventional scintigraphy with (111)In-DTPA-OC (204-233 MBq [5.5-6.3 mCi]) and by PET imaging with 64Cu-TETA-OC (111 MBq [3 mCi]). Blood and urine samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. PET images were collected at times ranging from 0 to 36 h after injection, and the absorbed doses to normal organs were determined.In six of the eight patients, cancerous lesions were visible by both (111)In-DTPA-OC SPECT and 64Cu-TETA-OC PET. In one patient, (111)In-DTPA-OC showed mild uptake in a lung lesion that was not detected by 64Cu-TETA-OC PET. In one patient, no tumors were detected by either agent however, pathologic follow-up indicated that the patient had no tumors. In two patients whose tumors were visualized with (111)In-DTPA-OC and 64Cu-TETA-OC, 64Cu-TETA-OC and PET showed more lesions than (111)In-DTPA-OC. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that 64Cu-TETA-OC was rapidly cleared from the blood and that 59.2% +/- 17.6% of the injected dose was excreted in the urine. Absorbed dose measurements indicated that the bladder wall was the dose-limiting organ.The high rate of lesion detection, sensitivity, and favorable dosimetry and pharmacokinetics of 64Cu-TETA-OC indicate that it is a promising radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging of patients with neuroendocrine tumors.
