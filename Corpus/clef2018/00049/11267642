Molecular design, expression, and affinity immobilization of a trypsin-streptavidin fusion protein*(1). A trypsin-streptavidin (TRYPSA) fusion protein was designed and its expression in Escherichia coli was evaluated. The streptavidin gene was PCR modified and cloned into the pET expression vector. The trypsin gene was subsequently inserted into this plasmid, thus generating a colinear fusion of trypsin and streptavidin genes (pTRYPSA). This engineering strategy was verified, and TRYPSA was expressed after IPTG induction using the E. coli strains, BL21(DE3) and BL21(DE3)pLysS. Standard protein fractions of the cell lysate were prepared and trypsin activity was primarily detected in the periplasmic and inclusion body fractions. Immunoblotting showed a single Western-positive band exhibiting a molecular weight of 39,000 Da. A biotinylated porous glass affinity matrix was prepared and selective adsorption resulted in a one-step purification and immobilization of TRYPSA from crude cell lysate. Trypsin activity was verified using a synthetic substrate. This enzyme bioreactor should serve as an excellent prototype for future studies that will examine the effect of limited proteolysis on functional characteristics of milk proteins, including gelling, emulsifying and foaming properties.
