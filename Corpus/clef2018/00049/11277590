Motor imagery in normal subjects and Parkinson's disease patients: an H215O PET study. Motor imagery paradigms can be used to investigate motor preparation. We used positron emission tomography to compare regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with Parkinson's disease and normal controls under three conditions: rest, motor imagery and motor execution. In controls, imagery activated bilateral dorsolateral and mesial frontal cortex, inferior parietal cortex and precuneus. Motor execution additionally activated primary motor cortex (p < 0.001). Between-group, for imagery there was relative reduction in dorsolateral and mesial frontal activation in the patient group (p<0.01). For execution, there was impaired activation of right dorsolateral frontal cortex and basal ganglia (p<0.01). Our results support the notion that underfunctioning of mesial frontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may underlie motor preparation in Parkinson's disease but also suggest that akinesia may occur in the absence of impaired mesial frontal cortex activation.
