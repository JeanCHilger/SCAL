SQ22536 and W-7 inhibit forskolin-induced cAMP elevation but not relaxation in newborn ovine pulmonary veins. The role of cAMP in forskolin-induced relaxation was studied in isolated pulmonary veins of newborn lambs (7-12 days). In vessels preconstricted with endothelin-1, forskolin at concentrations < or =10(-7) M had no effect on cAMP content and adenylyl cyclase activity but caused up to 50% relaxation. At higher concentrations, forskolin markedly elevated cAMP content and adenylyl cyclase activity and caused a further relaxation.
