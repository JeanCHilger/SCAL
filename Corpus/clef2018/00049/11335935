Pancreatic fate of a (125)I-labelled mouse monoclonal antibody directed against pancreatic B-cell surface ganglioside(s) in control and diabetic rats. The possible use of a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against rat pancreatic B-cell surface ganglioside(s) and labelled with radioactive iodine for selective imaging of the endocrine pancreas by a non-invasive procedure was investigated by following its pancreatic fate in experiments conducted either in vitro by incubation of rat isolated pancreatic islets, acinar tissue and pancreatic pieces or in vivo after intravenous injection of the (125)I-labelled antibodies ([(125)I]gamma-G). Although the binding of [(125)I]gamma-G per microg protein was about one order of magnitude higher in isolated islets than in acinar tissue, no significant difference was detected when comparing pancreatic pieces or isolated islets from control animals and rats rendered diabetic by one or two prior administrations of streptozotocin (STZ rats). Likewise, except in one set of experiments, no significant difference was found between control animals and STZ rats, when measuring the radioactive content of the pancreatic gland, relative to that of plasma, 1-4 days after the intravenous injection of [(125)I]gamma-G. These findings indicate that under the present experimental conditions, the mouse monoclonal antibody labelled with radioactive iodine does not appear to be a promising tool for selective imaging of the endocrine pancreas, e.g. by single photon emission computerized tomography.
