Neuroimaging in hyperkinetic children and adults: an overview. The application of brain imaging techniques to children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders is reviewed, stressing methodological aspects. Findings are still provisional, but suggest minor structural changes in frontal and candate areas, especially on the right side. Functional studies suggest reduced activation in these and other areas. The techniques do not yet contribute to individual diagnosis.
