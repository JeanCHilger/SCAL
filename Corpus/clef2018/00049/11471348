Magnetic resonance first-pass perfusion imaging: overview and perspectives. The data from clinical studies with quantitative MR first-pass perfusion imaging suggests that this technique outperforms SPECT--widely available clinical imaging tool--in sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, MRFP imaging may be combined with the assessment of global and segmental function of the heart and regional wall thickening, and in addition, performed with pharmacological stress agents. The inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of quantitative MRFP is comparable with clinically used nuclear medicine techniques. MRFP measurements can discern collateral myocardium and are able to identify small changes in myocardial blood flow and myocardial perfusion reserve (the ratio of stress blood flow over resting). MRFP imaging has been mainly used in context of coronary artery disease but many other exciting areas in clinical cardiology are awaiting of new insights that can be accomplished with this technique. Trials are needed to obtain the approval of the contrast agent (Gd-DTPA) and perfusion sequences by the Food and Drug Administration and to establish reimbursement procedures with the third-party insurance companies and health maintenance organizations.
