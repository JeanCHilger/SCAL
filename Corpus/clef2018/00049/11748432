Non-invasive quantitative monitoring of cerebral blood flow in aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage with 99mTc-ECD. The purpose of this prospective study was to detect symptomatic cerebral vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) by a non-invasive mean cerebral blood flow (mCBF) quantification using 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer. Measurement of mCBF without blood sampling and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) were performed at 1 and 7 days after surgery in 35 consecutive SAH patients, of whom 16 were examined at day 30 as well. A decrease in mCBF of more than 10% on day 7 versus day 1 was considered to indicate vasospasm. On visual interpretation of SPECT, a perfusion decrease which appeared newly on day 7 was considered to indicate vasospasm. In total, nine of 35 patients had cerebral vasospasm confirmed by computed tomography (CT) and/or angiography. The mCBF measurement showed a 77.8% (7/9) sensitivity, a 88.5% (23/26) specificity, a 70.0% (7/10) positive predictive value, and a 92.0% (23/25) negative predictive value. SPECT yielded a 33.3% (3/9) sensitivity, a 73.1% (19/26) specificity, a 30.0% (3/10) positive predictive value, and a 76.0% (19/25) negative predictive value. On SPECT, decreased perfusion was observed in most of the patients at clipping sites, which might represent post-operative transient abnormal perfusion and should not be read as vasospasm. In conclusion, this mCBF measurement is more accurate than visual interpretation of SPECT for detecting vasospasm.
