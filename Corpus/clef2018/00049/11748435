Quantified 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy for predicting chemotherapy response in breast cancer patients: factors that influence the level of 99m Tc-MIBI uptake. The aim of this study was to establish whether tumour uptake of 99mTc-MIBI can predict response to chemotherapy in patients with breast carcinoma. Forty women suffering from breast carcinoma confirmed by tumour biopsy were studied prospectively. Fifteen patients subsequently underwent surgery and 25 were candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Breast scintigraphy was performed and planar and tomographic views (single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)) were obtained after injection of 740 MBq of 99mTc-MIBI. The tumoural uptake was quantified by computer analysis. P-glycoprotein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry only in operable patients. The response to chemotherapy was evaluated at 3 months upon completion of treatment. The results of this study showed no relationship between 99mTc-MIBI uptake and the histological type or tumour size. There was an inverse correlation with the degree of tumour differentiation (P<0.05). 99mTc-MIBI uptake in negative P-glycoprotein lesions (2.36+/-1.72) was higher than in positive P-glycoprotein lesions (1.53+/-1.29), although the difference was not statistically significant. Lesions which responded to chemotherapy (16) showed higher 99mTc-MIBI uptake (7.70+/-5.20) than non-responding lesions (nine) (2.21+/-1.0) (P<0.001). In conclusion, there is a correlation between 99mTc-MIBI uptake in breast cancer and response to chemotherapy. Furthermore, 99mTc-MIBI uptake may be influenced by other factors such as the degree of tumour differentiation or tumour P-glycoprotein levels.
