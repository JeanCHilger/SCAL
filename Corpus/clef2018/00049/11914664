Increased prognostic value of combined myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging and the quantification of lung Tl-201 uptake. The authors wanted to identify those patients assessed by exercise SPECT in whom the quantification of lung Tl-201 uptake helps to evaluate disease prognosis.One hundred forty-nine patients (114 men, 35 women 74 after myocardial infarction [MI]During an average follow-up of 20 +/- 9 months, eight patients had died of cardiac causes and 13 patients experienced nonfatal MIs. Among the 45 patients with normal perfusion, no cardiac event was observed and the L:H ratio was not helpful for risk stratification. In 29 patients with fixed defects, four cardiac deaths occurred (all in patients with L:H ratios >0.5 annual event rate, 21.1% for L:H ratios >0.5 compared with 0% for L:H ratios <0.5These findings suggest a benign prognosis in patients with normal SPECT (regardless of the L:H ratio). Conversely, all patients with ischemia are at high risk for future cardiac events. Quantification of the Tl-201 lung uptake seems to be valuable in evaluations of disease prognosis, especially in patients with fixed defects.
