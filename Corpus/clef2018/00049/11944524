Effect of vascular endothelial growth factor in fracture healing. To observe the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in fracture healing and to investigate the influence of VEGF and VEGF antibody in fracture healing.One hundred and five rabbits were used to make fracture model in the left radius and randomly divided into control group, VEGF group and VEGF antibody group. VEGF and VEGF antibody were used in the VEGF group and VEGF antibody group respectively, then the blood flow of the fracture ends was measured by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) 8, 24, 72 hours, 1, 3, 5 and 8 weeks after fracture, the X-ray films of the fracture sites were taken after 1, 3, 5 and 8 weeks to observe the fracture healing.The blood flow of the fracture ends in the VEGF group increased during a period from 8 h to 3 wk after fraction when compared with that of the control group, and no obvious difference was seen on the X-ray films between the two groups. In the VEGF antibody group, the blood flow of the fracture ends decreased obviously when compared with that of the control group. The fracture healing process was interfered seriously and nonunion change was seen in the fracture site.The lack of VEGF will interfere with the fracture healing process and result in nonunion in the fracture site. Administration of ectogenous VEGF may promote fracture healing by increasing the blood flow of the fracture ends.
