Advances in FDG PET probes in surgical oncology. Whole-body positron emission tomography (WB-PET) has been developed as a sensitive, cost-effective method for imaging malignant disease. WB-PET provides complete body imaging with a single scanning approach for a variety of malignancies. With increasing clinical experience, the indications for its use have broadened. This article reviews current uses of the technology and discusses some potential applications, particularly the utility of a commercially available surgical gamma probe for detecting the gamma particles emitted in the decay process of FDG.
