Effect of pathologic and induced peripheral vestibular balance disturbance on the central nervous system. The authors investigated the central projection of excitement in acute stage vestibular neuronitis using positron emission tomography. The changes in the pattern of regional cerebral blood flow caused by the disease were compared with the effect of cold caloric stimulation known to provoke similar signs. It was concluded that the involved brain regions overlapped each other only partially. The mismatch could be explained by the compensatory processes developing during the disease. These processes do not normally develop during the caloric vestibular stimulation because of its short duration.
