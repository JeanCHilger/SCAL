Nuclear imaging of the brain in electrical burn patients. Patients surviving high-voltage electrical injury may have early or delayed sequelae. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) is a lipid soluble brain perfusion agent rapidly retained in the brain tissue in proportion to regional cerebral blood flow without any redistribution. The aim of this study is to point out the importance of nuclear imaging of the brain and estimate the possible sequelae due to high-voltage electric injured patients. Brain perfusion analyses may help the early detection of cerebral blood disturbances and to inform both patient and surgeons about the possible neurological complications in electric burn patients.
