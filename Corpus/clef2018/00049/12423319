High oxidized LDL and elevated plasma homocysteine contribute to the early reduction of myocardial flow reserve in healthy adults. Impairment of coronary blood flow reserve has been shown to be an early manifestation of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD). We studied more closely the contribution of various risk factors on early deterioration of coronary function.Fifty-one young, apparently healthy adults, with normal or mildly elevated serum cholesterol levels but without other major risk factors for CAD, such as diabetes or hypertension, underwent positron emission tomography (PET) studies. Coronary flow reserve (CFR) was measured using O15-water. In addition to the classical risk factors, the role of several new risk indicators, such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, infection (Chlamydia pneumoniae antibodies), and inflammation parameters (adhesion molecules, ICAM, VCAM, selectin, and C-reactive protein), homocysteine and body iron stores were investigated.Elevated lipid and lipoprotein levels were not associated with reduced coronary reactivity. However, high autoantibody titers against oxidized LDL (oxLDL) were associated with 21% lower CFR than low oxLDL (P < 0.05). Furthermore, high homocysteine levels predicted low CFR (P < 0.05). The other measured parameters, Chlamydia pneumoniae antibody levels, C-reactive protein and adhesion molecule concentrations did not associate with myocardial blood flow. In a stepwise regression model, oxLDL (P = 0.03), homocysteine (P = 0.04) and triglycerides (P = 0.018) were significant predictors of CFR.The present study suggests an important role for oxidized LDL and plasma homocysteine on early impairment of coronary reactivity in young adults.
