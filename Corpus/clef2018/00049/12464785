Pulsed Doppler tissue imaging for the assessment of myocardial viability: comparison with 99mTc sestamibi perfusion imaging. The aim of the present study was to examine whether Doppler tissue imaging demonstrated comparable diagnostic performance for the detection of viable myocardium compared to myocardial perfusion imaging with Tc hexakis-2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI). We studied 30 patients with old myocardial infarction who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with Tc-MIBI and two-dimensional echocardiography were carried out within 7 days before PTCA. We measured regional Tc-MIBI uptake for each myocardial segment from SPECT and peak systolic velocity and a ratio of regional pre-ejection period to regional ejection time (PEP/ET) from pulsed Doppler tissue imaging. Biplane left ventriculography was performed before interventional procedures and repeated 3 months after PTCA. Myocardial viability was determined when wall motion was improved at least one grade after PTCA. The peak systolic velocity was positively correlated with regional Tc-MIBI uptake (R =0.59, P<0.01). The PEP/ET demonstrated inverse correlation with Tc-MIBI uptake ( R=-0.59, P<0.01). Peak systolic velocity of viable segments was higher than that of non-viable segments ( P<0.05). The PEP/ET was lower in viable segments than in non-viable segments ( P<0.05). Peak systolic velocity and PEP/ET demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for detecting viable myocardium compared with Tc-MIBI perfusion imaging (80% and 79% vs 90%). These data indicate that measurements of regional peak systolic velocity and PEP/ET by Doppler tissue imaging are useful for evaluating myocardial viability quantitatively and provide helpful information for a clinical judgment in an interventional strategy.
