123I-MIBG radioaerosol lung clearance in COPD patients with fixed and partially reversible obstruction to evaluate the functional status of pulmonary adrenergic innervation. In order to test the hypothesis that a greater sympathetic activity underlies partial reversibility of the bronchial obstruction in selected patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we assessed the pulmonary clearance of inhaled I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ( I-MIBG) radioaerosol in 10 patients with fixed and nine with reversible obstruction. The clearance of inhaled I-MIBG is known to be inversely related to I-MIBG uptake by adrenergic terminals. Groups were matched for age and judged free from confounding comorbidity. The penetration index did not distinguish between the groups (fixed obstruction, 97.39+/-14.59% reversible obstruction, 89.09+/-19.95%
