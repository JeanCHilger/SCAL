Anti-TNF antibodies in the treatment of inflammatory intestinal stenoses in Crohn's disease. Stenoses are a frequent complication in patients with Crohn's disease and represent a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The proper assessment of the nature of a stenosis as inflammatory or fibrotic is critical for appropriate treatment, since symptomatic fibrotic stenoses require surgical resection. Standard diagnostic procedures to assess the nature of a stenosis include endoscopy, conventional contrast radiography and magnetic resonance tomography. Recent data suggest, that the positron-emission-tomography possesses a high sensitivity and specificity to confirm inflammatory activity in the bowel. The recombinant monoclonal anti-TNF-antibody Infliximab (Remicade) has been approved for the treatment of steroid refractory and steroid dependent Crohn's disease in Germany since 9/2000 and the efficacy of Infliximab is well documented. However, few data exist about the treatment of inflammatory stenoses with Infliximab. We performed a retrospective analysis of our experience with Infliximab in patients with Crohn's disease with special reference to patients with inflammatory stenoses. Among a total of 21 patients treated with Infliximab 11 patients had an inflammatory stenosis. 9 of these patients responded well to Inflimab and became completely asymptomatic for a considerable period of time. Infliximab was tolerated well except for one patient who developed an intrabdominal abscess. The notable clinical response of patients with inflammatory stenoses to Infliximab suggests that treatment with Infliximab might be helpful to postpone or avoid surgical intervention. This finding should be further investigated in a prospective randomized study.
