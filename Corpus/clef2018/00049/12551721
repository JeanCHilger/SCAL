Effects of electroconvulsive therapy on regional cerebral blood flow measured by 99mtechnetium HMPAO SPECT. Decreased cerebral blood flow is documented in depression. In this study, 15 patients were studied with 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT before and after a course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Improvement in frontal and temporal hypoperfusion was seen only in those patients who responded to ECT. Cerebral hypoperfusion may be a state-dependent marker in depressive illness.
