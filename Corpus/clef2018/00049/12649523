William Feinberg lecture 2002: emotions, mood, and behavior after stroke. While emotional outcome is a critical factor influencing early evolution and late prognosis after stroke, few relevant studies have been performed on this subject. However, mood changes, modified judgment, and emotional reactions may also dramatically alter recruitment into clinical trials for instance, up to one third of patients with acute stroke may have altered time perception, inappropriate self-evaluation of their condition, and attentional or memory dysfunction, with a subsequent increase in referral-to-hospital delays. In addition, the value of the "informed" consenting process may be questionable in the setting of urgent randomization into an acute stroke clinical trial. Data from ongoing studies suggest that behavior and emotional reactions in acute stroke patients may be classified into a few broad categories, with considerable overlap. Correlations between mood changes and the type, location, and severity of stroke may provide useful information for improving patient management, including the prediction of functional evolution and late prognosis. While depressive reactions have been widely studied in the recovery-rehabilitation phase after stroke, significant depression is uncommon shortly after stroke. On the other hand, related, though different, emotional behavioral changes may be more frequent
