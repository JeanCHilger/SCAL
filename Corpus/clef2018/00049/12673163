A comparative study of 11C-choline PET and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET in the evaluation of lung cancer. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of 11C-choline positron emission tomography (PET) and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging in the detection of primary lung cancer and mediastinal lymph node metastases. Seventeen patients with histologically proven primary lung cancer were examined with both 11C-choline and FDG PET within a week of each study. Lung cancers were analysed visually and semiquantitatively using the ratio of tumour-to-normal radioactivity (T/N ratio) and standardized uptake value (SUV). Mediastinal lymph node metastases were analysed visually. Although both techniques delineated focal lesions with an increase in tracer accumulation in 13 patients, FDG PET identified three additional patients in whom 11C-choline PET did not visualize any lesion. In the detection of lung cancer <2 cm in size, FDG PET provided higher sensitivity (six of seven, 85.7%) than 11C-choline PET (four of seven, 57.1%). The T/N ratio and SUV were significantly higher with FDG PET (T/N ratio, 7.43+/-6.22 SUV, 4.05+/-3.05) than these were with 11C-choline PET (T/N ratio, 2.93+/-1.19
