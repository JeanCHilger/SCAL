Contribution of the combination of (201)Tl SPECT and (99m)T(c)O(4)(-) SPECT to the differential diagnosis of brain tumors and tumor-like lesions. A preliminary report. This study was undertaken to assess the contribution of the combination of (201)Tl SPECT and (99m)TcO(4)(-)SPECT to the differential diagnosis of brain tumors and tumor-like lesions. In the 8 patients selected for this study, both (201)Tl SPECT and (99m)TcO(4)(-) SPECT were performed because of clinical or radiological suspicion of brain tumor, no therapy was initiated before either SPECTs, diagnosis was based on biopsy, and MRI findings were stable in the interval between SPECTs. Histological diagnoses consisted of low grade glioma (n=1), high grade glioma (n=2), lymphoma (n=1), metastasis (n=1), multiple sclerosis (n=2) and cavernous angioma (n=1). Two high grade astrocytomas, one malignant lymphoma and one metastatic tumor showed (201)Tl accumulation and were diagnosed as tumor. The combination of (201)Tl and (99m)TcO(4)(-) did not change the diagnosis. One cavernous angioma showed no (201)Tl accumulation and was diagnosed as non-tumor. The combination of (201)Tl and (99m)TcO(4)(-) did not change the diagnosis. One low grade astrocytoma showed faint (201)Tl accumulation and was diagnosed as non-tumor. As (201)Tl uptake was higher than (99m)TcO(4)(-) uptake, the combination of (201)Tl and (99m)TcO(4)(-) changed the diagnosis to tumor. Two multiple sclerosis showed (201)Tl accumulation and were diagnosed as tumor. As (99m)TcO(4)(-) uptake was higher than (201)Tl uptake, the combination of (201)Tl and (99m)TcO(4)(-) changed the diagnosis to non-tumor. In three of the eight patients (38%), the combination of (201)Tl SPECT and (99m)TcO(4)(-) SPECT altered the diagnosis made by (201)Tl SPECT alone. In all of these three cases, the diagnosis made by the combination of (201)Tl SPECT and (99m)TcO(4)(-) SPECT was correct.
