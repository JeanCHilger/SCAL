Brain perfusion SPECT in patients with corticobasal degeneration: analysis using statistical parametric mapping. We sought to determine the characteristics of brain perfusion in patients with corticobasal degeneration (CBD) using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Thirteen patients with CBD and 10 age-matched healthy volunteers were examined using brain perfusion SPECT and (99m)Tc-ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements were performed noninvasively using a graphic analysis method. Both the absolute rCBF data (raw data) and the adjusted rCBF data (global CBF normalized to 50 ml/100 g/min) were used in the SPM analysis. A significant decrease in the absolute rCBF was observed in extended areas of the brain in CBD patients compared to the control group. These areas included the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices basal ganglia
