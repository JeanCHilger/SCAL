Sympathetic innervation in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine primate model of Parkinson's disease. Cardiac sympathetic denervation occurs commonly in Parkinson's disease. This study explored whether analogous denervation occurs in primates with Parkinsonism from systemic administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). 6-[18F]Fluorodopamine positron emission tomographic scanning and plasma levels of catecholamines and their deaminated metabolites were used to assess sympathetic and adrenomedullary function in rhesus monkeys, in the untreated state (n = 3), 2 weeks after a series of four MPTP injections, before establishment of Parkinsonism (acute phase, n = 1) a month later, after four more MPTP doses, associated with severe Parkinsonism (subacute phase, n = 1)
