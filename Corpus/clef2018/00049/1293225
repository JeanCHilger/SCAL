Detection of intestinal parasites from dogs in Tochigi-City in 1979 and 1991. To clarify whether sanitary and hygienic conditions surrounding humans and pet animals have improved or not, we examined feces from dogs for intestinal parasites in Tochigi in 1979 and 1991. Intestinal parasites were detected from 109 of the 262 dogs (41.9%) in 1979 and 86 of the 260 dogs (32.8%) in 1991. Among the parasites. Ancylostoma caninum, Tirchuris vulpis and Toxocara canis were most commonly detected, and their detection rates were higher in 1979. On the contrary, Dipylidium caninum, Strongyloides stercoralis, Isospora spp., which are important causes of human diseases, were detected at higher rates in 1991. In the dogs of outdoor feeding, the detection rates of parasites were markedly decreased, but slightly increased in the dogs of indoor feeding in 1991. These results suggest that sanitary conditions surrounding pet animals have not been sufficiently improved, in spite of the fact that humans are in more contact with their pet animals.
