Gliomatosis cerebri evaluated by 18Falpha-methyl tyrosine positron-emission tomography. Gliomatosis cerebri is a rare condition in which an infiltrative glial neoplasm spreads through the brain with preservation of the underlying structure. CT and MRI show diffuse abnormal density or signal, without mass effect, and because these findings are nonspecific, it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis. Our purpose was to assess the usefulness of a new tumour-detecting amino acid tracer for positron-emission tomography (PET), L-[3-(18)F] alpha-methyl tyrosine (FMT), in patients with gliomatosis cerebri. We performed FMT PET, fluorodeoxyglucose FDG PET and MRI eight patients with gliomatosis cerebri and six with non-neoplastic disease, whose MRI also showed diffuse high signal on T2-weighted images. Standardised uptake (SUV) of FMT and FDG in the area of gliomatosis was obtained and the tumour-to-normal cortex (T/N) ratio of this was compared. The tumours were shown on FMT PET as areas of increased uptake, except in one patient with severe intracranial hypertension. There were significant differences between the SUV of FMT and the T/N ratio of FMT in patients and in controls (both P<0.01), and between the T/N ratio of FMT and FDG in patients ( P<0.01). Increased uptake of FMT PET strongly suggests neoplasia. FMT PET is valuable for differentiating gliomatosis cerebri from non-neoplastic diseases showing similar diffuse high signal on T2-weighted images and little contrast enhancement.
