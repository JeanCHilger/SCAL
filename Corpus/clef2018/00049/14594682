Migration of volatile degradation products into ozonated water from plastic packaging materials. Migration of volatile degradation products from poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles, polypropylene (PP) caps and ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) liners into ozonated water was measured. Polymer strips were immersed in deionized and distilled water with ozone concentrations of 0.5, 2.5 and/or 5 mg kg(-1) inside 35-ml vials, which were clamp-sealed and stored at 40 degrees C for 10 days. A purge-and-trap unit was developed to extract volatile products from the ozonated water in vials. The extractables were trapped in an adsorbent tube and analysed using a GC-MS coupled with an automated thermal desorber (ATD). Mass spectra were interpreted by comparison with a NIST mass spectral library, and an internal standard method was used to quantify the extractables of interest. Several volatile compounds found in ozonated water that had been in contact with PP, EVA and HDPE polymers included butanal, pentanal, hexanal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, 2,2-dimethyl propanal, 3-hexanone, 2-hexanone and heptanone. These compounds could cause off-taste and off-odour with a low organoleptic threshold. In general, the concentrations of these volatile compounds increased with an increased exposure to ozone. The highest concentration found was 14.1 +/- 0.6 microg kg(-1) for hexanal with a 5 mg kg(-1) ozone treatment of PP caps. Even at a treatment level of 5 mg kg(-1) ozone, which is greater than 10 times the current regulatory limits for bottled water, the extractables migrating from those polymers were within the levels permitted by the FDA. For the PET sample, no significant peaks were observed before or after ozonation. These results imply that PP caps containing EVA liners may be major sources of off-odour and taste in ozonated bottled water.
