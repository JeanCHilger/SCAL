Corticobasal degeneration: decreased and asymmetrical glucose consumption as studied with PET. Cerebral energy metabolism was studied by positron emission tomography and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose in five patients with clinical diagnoses of probable corticobasal degeneration. A reduction in glucose consumption was observed in most cortical and subcortical structures compared to age-matched controls. The reduction was greatest on the side of the brain contralateral to the most affected limbs, as shown by the significantly lower ratios of contralateral to homolateral metabolic rates, in the temporal and sensorimotor cortex of patients compared to controls. A distinct asymmetry between the two hemispheres could be observed in a patient who was examined twice in the course of his illness. Detection of this asymmetrical decrease in brain cortical and subcortical glucose metabolism may prove useful as additional evidence supporting clinical diagnoses of the disease.
