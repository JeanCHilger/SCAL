Common carotid intima-media thickness is correlated with myocardial flow reserve in patients with coronary artery disease: a useful non-invasive indicator of coronary atherosclerosis. The common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) is correlated with the angiographically determined coronary artery stenosis. However, their correlation is weak, which limits the clinical application of the IMT as a predictor of coronary artery stenosis. The IMT reflects diffuse early-phase atherosclerosis, whereas the angiographically determined coronary artery stenosis is a late-phase phenomenon. The latter is localized and rapidly progressive with plaque rupture and acute thrombosis. Instead of the angiographically determined coronary artery stenosis, we employed myocardial flow reserve (MFR) that reflects diffuse early-phase coronary atherosclerosis and impaired coronary vasodilatation function. We evaluated the relationship between the IMT and the MFR.Twenty-three patients with angiographically diagnosed coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent B-mode ultrasound examination to measure their common carotid IMT and positron emission tomography (PET) with dipyridamole intervention to obtain their MFR. We also performed B-mode ultrasound examination in 21 patients with hypertension without CAD and in 15 control subjects.The common carotid IMT in patients with CAD was thickened (0.92+/-0.15 vs. 0.81+/-0.14 mm in patients with hypertension (P<0.05) and 0.69+/-0.13 mm in control subjects (P<0.01)). The IMT was inversely correlated with the MFR (r=0.51, P<0.01). The correlations between the MFR and most of the coronary risk factors (age, blood pressure, serum cholesterol level and triglyceride level, HbA1c level, smoking index) did not reach statistical significance.Thickened common carotid IMT is also an indicator of reduced MFR or early-phase coronary atherosclerosis.
