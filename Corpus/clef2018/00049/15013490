Biological studies of radiolabeled glucose analogues iodinated in positions 3, 4 or 6. The aim of this study was to assess the biological behavior of new radiolabeled glucose analogues proposed as tracers of glucose uptake in vivo and iodinated in position 3, 4, or 6. Biological results obtained in vitro on adipocytes and erythrocytes and in vivo in mice were compared to those obtained with the gold-standard tracer of glucose uptake, 2-deoxy-D-glucose. None of these molecules had the same biological behavior than 2-deoxy-D-glucose. Therefore, these compounds cannot be considered as tracers of glucose uptake.
