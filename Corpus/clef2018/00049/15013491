Evaluation of anesthesia effects on [18F]FDG uptake in mouse brain and heart using small animal PET. This study evaluates effects of anesthesia on (18)F-FDG (FDG) uptake in mouse brain and heart to establish the basic conditions of small animal PET imaging. Prior to FDG injection, 12 mice were anesthetized with isoflurane gas 11 mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine/xylazine mixture
