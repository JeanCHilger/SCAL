11C]choline uptake in regenerating liver after partial hepatectomy or CCl4-administratio. To characterize [methyl-(11)C]choline ([(11)C]choline) as an oncologic PET radiopharmaceutical, [(11)C]choline uptake in regenerating livers after partial hepatectomy as a model of typical proliferating tissue and after CCl(4) insult as that of proliferating tissue with inflammation, was studied in rats. [(11)C]Choline, [(18)F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) and [2-(14)C]thymidine ([(14)C]TdR) uptake was studied in regenerating rat liver after 70% partial hepatectomy or CCl(4)-administration. [(11)C]Choline uptake in regenerating liver after partial hepatectomy was significantly increased with [(14)C]TdR uptake as a marker of DNA synthesis at 18 hours after surgery. On the other hand, the uptake was not accelerated by CCl(4)-administration, though it significantly increased [(14)C]TdR uptake. There were no differences of [(11)C]choline uptake acceleration following partial hepatectomy among the three parts of the regenerating liver. [(18)F]FDG uptake was accelerated in the regenerating liver on either partial hepatectomy or CCl(4)-administration. The magnitude of the increase in [(18)F]FDG uptake in the regenerating liver induced by partial hepatectomy was greater than that for [(11)C]choline. [(11)C]Choline uptake in the liver was accelerated by partial hepatectomy, but not by CCl(4)-administration. This might be expected given that the differentiation between proliferating tissues such as tumor and inflammatory tissue was possible by [(11)C]choline-PET.
