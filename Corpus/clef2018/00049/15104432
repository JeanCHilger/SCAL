Substituent effects on monoboronic acid sensors for saccharides based on N-phenyl-1,8-naphthalenedicarboximides. In the course of our investigations on new monoboronic acid saccharide sensors with C(0) spacers, a series of probes 1-6 based on 1,8-naphthalenedicarboximide were synthesized. Sensor 1 displays features typical of PET monoboronic acid sensors and shows high selectivity to fructose. Sensor 2 exhibits a novel dual emission and remarkable sensitivity for glucose relative to fructose and galactose through subtle changes in pH. Sensor 3 displays significantly enhanced fluorescence in the presence of galactose at low pH. Although probes 4-6 exhibit unique properties such as high quantum yield (Phi(F) = 0.407) and excellent solubility in water, they did not show significant change in fluorescence intensity in the presence of monosaccharides. The effects of substituent on all six probes lend support to the proposed photoelectrochemical model.
