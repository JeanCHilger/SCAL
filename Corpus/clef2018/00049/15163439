Impulsivity related to brain serotonin transporter binding capacity in suicide attempters. Altered monoaminergic activity has earlier been associated with violent suicidal behaviour. In this study whole brain binding potential of the serotonin transporter (5HTT) and dopamine transporter (DAT) was measured by single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) in 12 patients after a serious suicide attempt and in 12 age, sex and season matched healthy controls. Clinical and temperamental assessments were analysed for possible associations with 5HTT and DAT. We found no significant 5HTT or DAT differences between patients and controls. In patients, but not in controls, there was a significant correlation between whole brain 5HTT and DAT. Impulsiveness according to the Marke Nyman Temperament (MNT) was significantly correlated to 5HTT in suicide attempters, but not in controls. Neither of the transporters could be regarded as a marker for serious suicidal behaviour. A previously discussed connection between serotonin and dopamine was replicated in this study. In suicide attempters, low 5HTT was associated with impulsivity and to some extent with depressive disorder-key factors for suicidal behaviour.
