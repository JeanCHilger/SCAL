Reduced value of thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography in the management of HIV-related focal brain lesions in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. To evaluate the diagnostic value of thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (201Tl SPECT) in the management of focal brain disorders in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a validation study of diagnostic procedure was performed in a tertiary clinical care center in Italy. Thirty-eight consecutive HIV-infected patients with neurological impairment and focal brain lesions (FBL) were enrolled in a prospective evaluation and underwent diagnostic procedures according to a standardized protocol based on modified previously released guidelines. Six out of seven PCNSL presented high uptake at 201Tl SPECT [sensitivity 86% (95% CI 42-99) specificity 77% (95% CI 58-90)
