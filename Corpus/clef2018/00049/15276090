Differential prognostic significance of peri-infarction versus remote myocardial ischemia on stress technetium-99m sestamibi tomography in patients with healed myocardial infarction. Peri-infarction and remote myocardial ischemia involve different myocardial substrates, but their differential clinical implications have not been previously studied. We assessed the differential prognostic significance of peri-infarction and remote ischemia during long-term follow-up in patients with healed myocardial infarction. We studied 345 patients (59 +/- 12 years old 282 men) with previous myocardial infarction who demonstrated reversible perfusion abnormalities on exercise or dobutamine stress technetium-99m sestamibi tomography. Follow-up events for 5.5 +/- 2.6 years were 60 deaths (17%
