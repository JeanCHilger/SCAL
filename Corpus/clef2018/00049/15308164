Experimental and computational validation of BDTPS using a heterogeneous boron phantom. The idea to couple the treatment planning system (TPS) to the information on the real boron distribution in the patient acquired by positron emission tomography (PET) is the main added value of the new methodology set-up at DIMNP (Dipartimento di Ingegneria Meccanica, Nucleare e della Produzione) of University of Pisa, in collaboration with the JRC (Joint Research Centre) at Petten (NL). This methodology has been implemented in a new TPS, called Boron Distribution Treatment Planning System (BDTPS), which takes into account the actual boron distribution in the patient's organ, as opposed to other TPSs used in BNCT that assume an ideal uniform boron distribution. BDTPS is based on the Monte Carlo technique and has been experimentally validated comparing the computed main parameters (thermal neutron flux, boron dose, etc.) to those measured during the irradiation of an ad hoc designed phantom (HEterogeneous BOron phantoM, HEBOM). The results are also in good agreement with those obtained by the standard TPS SERA and by reference calculations carried out using an analytical model with the MCNP code. In this paper, the methodology followed for both the experimental and the computational validation of BDTPS is described.
