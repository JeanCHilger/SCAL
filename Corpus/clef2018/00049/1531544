Chronic low back pain: comparison of bone SPECT with radiography and CT. In patients with chronic low back pain, bone scintigraphy with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the lumbar spine allows identification of lesions not seen with planar imaging. In this study, findings from radiography, computed tomography (CT), and bone scintigraphy with SPECT in 34 patients with chronic back pain were examined to determine the nature and clinical relevance of the lesions. Twenty-seven patients had lesions at SPECT, of whom 24 (89%) had abnormalities at CT and 18 (67%) had abnormalities at radiography. SPECT allowed identification of 54 lesions, of which only 20 (37%) were detected with planar imaging. Forty-three (80%) SPECT lesions were located at the site of an abnormality also seen at CT and 20 (37%) at the site of an abnormality also seen at radiography. It was concluded that bone SPECT provides diagnostic information in chronic low back pain that is not available with radiography or planar imaging. The majority of lesions seen at SPECT corresponded to identifiable disease at CT.
