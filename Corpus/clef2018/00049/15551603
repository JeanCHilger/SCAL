3D reconstruction for a multi-ring PET scanner by single-slice rebinning and axial deconvolution. A three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction method, which was originally developed for a positron emission tomography (PET) system consisting of two rotating scintillation cameras, has now been implemented for a multi-ring PET scanner with retractable septa. The method is called 'single-slice rebinning with axial deconvolution' (SSAD), and can be described as follows. The projection data are sorted into transaxial 2D sinograms. Correction for the axial blurring is made by deconvolution in the sinograms. To obtain the axial spread functions, which depend on the activity distribution, 2D reconstruction is first made using a limited axial acceptance angle. The final 3D image is obtained by 2D reconstruction of transaxial planes. The method is simple but not approximate, has a modest memory requirement, and can be combined with different 2D techniques. Evaluations by Monte Carlo simulations and phantom studies have been made.
