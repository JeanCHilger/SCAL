FDG PET as a procedure for detecting simultaneous tumours in head and neck cancer patients. The presence of simultaneous primary tumours in other regions affects the prognosis and management decisions of head and neck cancer patients. Therefore, early detection of these tumours is necessary. Recent improvements in positron emission tomography (PET) have made it possible to examine the patient's whole body. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical contribution of whole-body PET using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for head and neck cancer patients.Fifty-three consecutive patients with previously untreated head and neck cancer were examined. Whole-body FDG PET imaging was performed at 1 h after injection of (18)F-FDG. A 3-D acquisition was undertaken and iterative reconstruction was performed. The final diagnosis of simultaneous primary tumour was established by histological findings or clinical follow-up.Of 53 patients, six (11%) had evidence of simultaneous primary tumour. In five of these six patients, simultaneous primary tumours (two gastric cancer one colon cancerThe results of this study show a high rate of simultaneous primary tumour in patients with primary head and neck cancer. FDG PET appears to be a promising imaging modality for the detection of simultaneous tumours in head and neck cancer patients.
