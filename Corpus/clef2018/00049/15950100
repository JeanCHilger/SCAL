Diagnostic value of MRI in comparison to scintigraphy, PET, MS-CT and PET/CT for the detection of metastases of bone. The initial localization of metastases in the bone in patients with solid tumors has a relatively good prognosis in comparison with visceral metastasization. The early detection of bone marrow metastases allows for a rapid initiation of therapy and a subsequent reduction in the morbidity rate. Modern MRI is superior to the 30-year-old skeletal scintigraphy and bone marrow scintigraphy with respect to sensitivity, specificity, as well as the extent of osteal metastasis. MRI provides substantial, therapy-relevant additional information. MSCT plays an important role in the management of cancer patients in clinical routine and gives an excellent survey of the axial skeleton by demonstrating osteolytic and osteoblastic metastases. Extensive comparative studies of MRI with 18F-FDG-PET and 18F-fluoride-PET have not yet been carried out. Whole body MRI is a very promising new staging method for the oncological diagnosis of solid tumors and the detection of osteal metastases. The adoption of 18F-FDG-PET and 18F-fluoride-PET FDG as well as the side by side PET-CT image fusion and the two in one PET/CT examinations appears to be slightly less sensitive to whole body MRI in the detection of osteal metastases. Larger, prospective multicenter studies are necessary to establish these as new, promising methods for the detection of osteal metastases.
