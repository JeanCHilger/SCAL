Emergency cardiac imaging: state of the art. Multiple strategies and testing modalities are available to evaluate patients presenting to the emergency department with cardiac complaints. Many provide anatomic and prognostic information about coronary stenosis and long-term out-comes. Although nuclear and stress echo imaging have the ability to predict outcomes in patients in the emergency department population, the newer modalities of cardiac imaging (EBCT, MDCT,and CMR) continue to show promising results and may soon be incorporated into emergency department chest pain centers. Protocols can be developed within an institution to meet the needs of the patient population while minimizing risk and improving outcomes for all patients.
