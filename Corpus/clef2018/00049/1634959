An automated method for rotational correction and centering of three-dimensional functional brain images. The display and analysis of functional brain images often benefit from head rotational correction and centering. An automated method was developed to align brain PET images into a standard three-dimensional orientation. The algorithm performs transverse and coronal rotational correction as well as centering of a brain image set. Optimal rotational correction and centering are determined by maximizing a bilateral hemispheric similarity index, the stochastic sign change criterion. Testing of this algorithm on simulated symmetrical brain image sets showed errors less than 1.0 degree and 0.5 pixels for rotational correction and centering, respectively. With actual PET data, the algorithm results correlated well with those obtained by visual inspection. Testing on asymmetrical brain image sets with simulated lesions indicated that performance of the algorithm is not sensitive to focal asymmetries. This automated method provides objective, reproducible image alignment into a standard orientation and facilitates subsequent data analysis techniques for functional brain images.
