Magnetic resonance approaches and recent advances in myocardial perfusion imaging. Myocardial perfusion imaging identifies the presence of coronary artery stenoses and defines the functional significance of those lesions. Single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography have established roles. Cardiac magnetic resonance is evolving as a promising new modality in the evaluation of myocardial perfusion. This article summarizes the current capability and recent advancements in magnetic resonance perfusion imaging.
