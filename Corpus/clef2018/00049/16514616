Utility of PET scans to predict disease relapse in pediatric patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. Positron emission tomography (PET) differentiates normal from abnormal cells based on metabolic activity. Numerous studies report that PET scan offers increased sensitivity, specificity and predictive values as compared to computed tomography (CT) in adult lymphoma patients.Twenty-three consecutive pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients were evaluated with PET scan either at diagnosis or during treatment, then at therapy completion and in follow-up.Twenty two of the 23 patients had a negative PET scan at the end of therapy however, ten later developed a positive scan for a total of 11 (47.8%) patients with a positive post treatment PET scan. Six tissue biopsies were performed in five patientsPET is a sensitive (100%), but not a specific (57.1%) method for evaluating post-treatment pediatric HL patients with a strong negative predictive value (NPV 100%), but poor positive predictive value (PPV
