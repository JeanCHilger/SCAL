123I-metaiodo-benzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy in the Brugada-type ECG. The degree of ST-segment elevation and amplitude of J waves, which may change in patients with the Brugada-type electrocardiogram (ECG) over time, are influenced by autonomic nervous activity and the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs. In the present study, we evaluated whether the shape of ST-segment elevation in patients with a Brugada-type ECG might alter the parameters of an 123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy and body surface signal-averaged ECG (SAECG). The subjects consisted of 12 patients with a Brugada-type ECG and 15 healthy volunteers (N group). The patients with a Brugada-type ECG were classified into the following 2 groups based on the type of ST-segment elevation: 6 patients with the coved type ST-segment elevation (C group), and 6 patients with the saddle-back type ST-segment elevation (S group). Planar and SPECT images were obtained 15 minutes (early images) and 3 hours (delayed images) after the administration of 123I-MIBG, respectively. In addition, the washout rate (% WR) of 123I-MIBG was obtained in a bull's eye map of the SPECT image. There were no significant differences in the early H/M ratio between the C and S groups. In the C group, however, there were some patients who showed a decreased accumulation or defect of 123I-MIBG in the planar and SPECT images. Furthermore, in contrast to the N and S groups, the C group showed a decreased delayed H/M ratio and increased % WR. SAECG did not show any significant differences between the S and C groups. These results of the present study suggest that the shape of ST-segment elevation may be associated with myocardial autonomic nervous function. In addition, the electric heterogeneity of the action potential in the right ventricular epicardial myocardium, which is frequently influenced by autonomic nervous activity, is closely associated with the development of Brugada syndrome.
