18F]FETO for adrenocortical PET imaging: a pilot study in healthy volunteer. Functional imaging of the adrenal cortex by means of PET may play an important clinical role. Recently, we presented the synthesis and first evaluation of a novel 11beta-hydroxylase inhibitor, [(18)F]FETO, in rats displaying high tracer accumulation in the adrenals. In this study, we aimed to investigate for the first time the potency of [(18)F]FETO as a PET tracer for the adrenal cortex in humans.An average preparation yielded 1-2 GBq of [(18)F]FETO ready to use. Ten healthy volunteers aged 24-57 years (five male and five female) were included in the study. After i.v. administration of 365 MBq [(18)F]FETO (246-391 MBq), dynamic images were acquired in 2D standard mode in 14 frames over 45 min. Afterwards, whole-body scanning was performed. In addition to visual interpretation, semi-quantitative analysis using standardised uptake values (SUVs) was conducted.[(18)F]FETO distribution was similar in all scanned volunteers. Visually, pronounced accumulation of [(18)F]FETO was found in the adrenals, whereas moderate uptake was observed-at least in some of the subjects-for liver, renal calices, gallbladder, stomach walls and pancreas. Kidney and bowels showed only faint uptake. Median SUVs for the right and left adrenal glands were 15.6 (10.0-28.6) and 15.7 (10.3-35.9), respectively. The reference tissue (liver) displayed a median SUV of 2.5 (2.2-4.6).[(18)F]FETO is a valuable tracer for adrenocortical PET imaging, combining the longer half-life of( 18)F with a high 11beta-hydroxylase selectivity. In accordance with our findings in rats, FETO PET revealed very high accumulation in the adrenal glands in healthy volunteers.
