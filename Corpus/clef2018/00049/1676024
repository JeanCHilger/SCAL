A rapid high yield synthesis of no-carrier-added (-)-[123I]iodocyanopindolol. A convenient and efficient radiosynthesis of no-carrier-added [123I]labeled (-)iodocyanopindolol, (-)-[123I]ICYP, a high affinity beta adrenergic antagonist, is described. (-)-[123I]ICYP was synthesized by a modified chloramine-T radioiodination of (-)cyanopindolol followed by a novel reversed-phase HPLC purification that provided the radiopharmaceutical as a directly injectable solution. The total synthesis time was typically less than 45 min and provided (-)-[123I]ICYP in a 59% radiochemical yield (not corrected for decay). In view of its high affinity for the beta adrenergic receptor, (-)-[123I]ICYP is a potentially useful probe for SPECT evaluation of cardiac adrenergic receptor density.
