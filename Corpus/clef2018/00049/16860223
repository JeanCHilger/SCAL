Positron emission tomography: a promising diagnostic modality for head and neck pathology. The purpose of this study is to discuss the advantages of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in the diagnosis of head and neck lesions.To illustrate this diagnostic method, we describe the nuclear medicine basic technique, present 5 cases for comparison of the results between computed tomography (CT) scan and PET, and review the literature.The 5 cases show that PET allows assessment of lesions earlier and more definitively than other diagnostic images.PET, a nuclear medicine modality, is a promising tool for diagnosis and follow-up of head and neck lesions. PET allows assessment of changes in the tissue before they would be shown by other diagnostic images. This modality permits differentiation between malignant and benign tumors. It also has the capability to distinguish between scar tissue, necrosis, tumor recurrence, and metastatic disease. It allows the assessment of the patient's progress during therapy, making possible an early identification of nonresponders to therapy.
