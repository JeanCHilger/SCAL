Construction of multifunctonal nano-delivery system crossing blood brain barrier. To construct multifunctonal nano-delivery system crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB).The magnetic nanoparticles were preprared with O-carboxylmethylated chitosan (O-CMC) and conjugated with a peptide sequence from the human immunodeficiency virus 1-tat protein and transferrin (Tf), and anti-tumor drug methotrexate (MTX), and thus constructed a O-CMC magnetic nanoparticles carrier system conjugating with Tat and Tf (O-MNPs-Tat-Tf) that combines multiple functions including crossing BBB, magnetism, receptor-mediated dual targets and anti-tumor capabilities. The appearance, diameter, and magnetism of MTX-O-MNPs-Tat-Tf carrier system were characterized with transmission electronic microscopy, atomic force microscopy and vibrating samples magnetometer. The cytotoxicity of MTX-loaded O-MNPs-Tat-Tf was investigated with C6 glioma cells. The ability of O-MNPs-Tat-Tf crossing BBB was investigated in rats by single photon emission computed tomography.The mean particle diameter was 75 nm, along with good anti-tumor property. The multi-functioned carrier system successfully crossed the BBB in rat.The establishment of MTX-O-MNPs-Tat-Tf carrier model implies a promising future for its application in therapy of cerebral diseases.
