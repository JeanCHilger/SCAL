F-18 FDG PET/CT evaluation of osseous and soft tissue sarcomas. Osseous and soft tissue sarcomas (OSTS) represent a histologic heterogeneous group of malignant tumors. Most of the current clinical data on the role of F-18 FDG PET in sarcomas come from patients studied with dedicated PET and less frequently with hardware fusion PET/CT. Therefore, we were prompted to review our experience with F-18 FDG PET/CT in OSTS.This is a retrospective study (January 2003-December 2005) of 44 patients with histologic diagnoses of OSTS who had F-18 FDG PET/CT at our institution. The group included 22 men and 22 women with an age range of 2 of 84 years (average, 37 +/- 20.2 years). The administered doses of F-18 FDG range 4.1 to 19.5 mCi (average, 14.3 +/- 3 mCi). Reinterpretation of the imaging studies for accuracy and data analysis from medical records was performed.The sensitivity and specificity of combined F-18 FDG PET/CT were 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 75.7-100) and 93.3% (95% CI = 78.7-98.1) for the primary OSTS, and 80% (95% CI = 58.4-91.9) and 86.4% (95% CI = 66.7-95.2) for metastases. When interpreted separately, CT outperformed PET for pulmonary metastases detection: CT was 76.5% sensitive and 88% specific, whereas PET was only 57.1% sensitive but 96.4% specific. For detection of other metastases, CT was 82.3% sensitive and 76% specific, with PET demonstrating 78.6% sensitivity and 92.8% specificity.Relatively similar results (except better specificity for PET and PET/CT) were noted when examining the rate of metastases detection, excluding pulmonary lesions. However, CT had a better detection rate for pulmonary metastases when compared with PET alone. A negative PET scan in the presence of suspicious CT findings in the chest cannot reliably exclude pulmonary metastases from OSTS.
