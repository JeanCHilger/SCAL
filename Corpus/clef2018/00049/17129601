Nitrogen-rich coatings for promoting healing around stent-grafts after endovascular aneurysm repair. Complications following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are related to deficient healing around the stent-graft (SG). New generations of SG with surface properties that foster vascular repair could overcome this limitation. Our goal was to evaluate the potential of a new nitrogen-rich plasma-polymerised biomaterial, designated PPE:N, as an external coating for polyethylene terephtalate (PET)- or polytetrafluoro-ethylene (PTFE)-based SGs, to promote healing around the implant. Thin PPE:N coatings were deposited on PET and PTFE films. Then, adhesion, growth, migration and resistance to apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and fibroblasts, as well as myofibroblast differentiation, were assessed in vitro. In another experimental group, chondroitin sulphate (CS), a newly described mediator of vascular repair, was added to normal culture medium, to search for possible additional benefit. PPE:N-coatings, especially on PET, increased and accelerated cell adhesion and growth, compared with control PET and with standard polystyrene culture plates (PCP). PPE:N was also found to increase the resistance to apoptosis in VSMC, an important finding as aneurysms are characterised by VMSC depletion caused by a pro-apoptotic phenotype. Addition of CS in solution further increased migration and resistance to apoptosis. In conclusion, PPE:N-coating and/or CS could promote vascular repair around SGs following EVAR.
