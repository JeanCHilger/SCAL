Sensitivity of FDG PET, GLUT1 expression and proliferative index in bronchioloalveolar lung cancer. To estimate the sensitivity of [F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and to assess the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and proliferative index (PI) in bronchioloalveolar lung cancer (BAC).Twenty-four patients with resected BAC underwent preoperative PET between October 1996 and February 2003. The surgical specimens were re-examined, and 18 patients who fulfilled the 1999 WHO definition for BAC were included in the study. The PET images were reviewed in order to determine the positive (PET+) and negative (PET-) tumours on PET. The pathology slides were stained with antibodies to GLUT1 and Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in order to determine GLUT1 expression and PI, respectively.There were 13 cases of PET+ BAC (sensitivity, 72% confidence interval, 52-93%)After applying the 1999 WHO criteria, the sensitivity of PET for detecting BAC is still relatively low. Other glucose transporters such as GLUT3 likely play a role in FDG uptake in BAC. GLUT1+ or PET+ BAC tumours have a higher stromal cell PI when compared to GLUT1- BAC or PET- BAC tumours, respectively.
