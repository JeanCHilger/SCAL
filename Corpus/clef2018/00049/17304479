Molecular imaging (SPECT and PET) in the evaluation of patients with movement disorders. In this article the role of molecular imaging with SPECT and PET in patients with movement disorders is reviewed. It is mentioned that SPECT and PET imaging with cocaine analogues ((123)I-beta-CIT,(123)I-FP-CIT, (18)F-DOPA), radioligands labeling the presynaptic dopamine transporters, is of value for the differentiation of patients with PD or Parkinson-plus syndromes with individuals with essential tremor. In addition the clinical impact of this procedure, the role of molecular imaging in the preclinical diagnosis and in the follow-up of patients with PD, as well as, in the differential diagnosis between Alzheimer's disease and Lewy-body dementia, is evaluated. Finally, the clinical impact of (123)I-IBZM-SPECT imaging, a radiopharmaceutical which labels the postsynaptic D(2) receptors and the discrimination between idiopathic PD and Parkinson-plus syndromes (multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal ganglia degeneration), is mentioned.
