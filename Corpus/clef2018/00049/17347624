Initial pretherapeutic assessment of anal epidermoid carcinoma. Anal epidermoid carcinoma is a rare malignant tumor, comprising less than 5% of all carcinomas of the colon, rectum, and anus. The primary therapy now includes radiotherapy, often in combination with chemotherapy. Radical surgery is now rarely indicated. Therapeutic indications are based on locoregional staging, the presence of visceral metastases and an evaluation of the medical history. Anorectal endosonography is helpful in evaluating locoregional extension. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography scanning and inguinal sentinel lymph node procedure should play a role in a more selective approach in patients with anal carcinoma.
