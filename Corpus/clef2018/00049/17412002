Emerging technology and practice: characteristics of PET-CT technologists. The purpose of this study was to determine how many and which computed tomography (CT) scans are performed by technologists on positron emission tomography (PET)/CT fusion scanners.A survey of registrants was conducted by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT). The sample was selected on the basis of disciplines of employment, including nuclear medicine technology (NMT), CT, and fusion. Of 676 technologists with appropriate characteristics (eg, staff technologists), a random sample of 400 was selected. A total of 173 surveys were returned (43%), and 56 respondents were identified as PET-CT technologists.Among PET-CT respondents (n = 56), 52% worked in community or university hospitals, 38% in free-standing centers, and 10% in mobile units. On the basis of the percentage of time (mean = 54%) and the number of patients per week (mean = 25), respondents spent most of their time in PET-CT or NMT. Of 53 CT-only procedures that form the ARRT's CT clinical experience requirements, 18 were identified as requirements respondents could fulfill (ie, they could be performed 3 to 5 times within a 24-month period). The average frequency of performance was at least 1 time in the past 6 months. Quality assurance procedures had higher endorsement rates (mean = 70%) and higher frequencies (mean = 1.7 times in 6 months). More than 35% of respondents could fulfill current CT clinical experience requirements.Positron emission tomography/CT technologists are mainly performing fusion scans CT-only scans are not widely performed by PET-CT technologists on fusion scanners
