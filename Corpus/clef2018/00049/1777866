Development of surgical therapy of epilepsy at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Wilder Penfield's development of surgical methods for treating focal cerebral seizures, beginning with his early work in Montreal in 1928, is reviewed. The reliance on seizure pattern and focal brain pathology was enormously enhanced by the advent of EEG and direct electrical recording from the cortex during surgery. The recognition in the early 1950's of mesial temporal structures in the pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy with automatism lead to more rational and successful surgical treatment. Positron emission tomography and especially magnetic resonance imaging have recently added to the essential diagnostic information of focal epilepsy provided by EEG.
