90Yttrium microspheres for nonresectable liver cancer: the University of Connecticut Health Center experience. To determine the outcome of 90Y selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) for primary and metastatic liver tumors at our institution and compare our results to the published literature.From July 2004 to November 2005 24 patients initiated SIRT therapy with 90Y microspheres at UCHC. Patient charts were reviewed for background, treatment planning, activity and dose, and toxicity information. Main outcome measures included patient survival, toxicity, and evidence of tumor response as indicated by available CT or PET scan reports.The median survival for the colorectal, hepatocellular carcinoma, and "other" groups were 9.0 months, 3.5 months, and 5.8 months, respectively. Post-treatment CT or PET scans were available for 15 of the 24 patients. Of the patients for whom follow-up imaging was available, 5/15 patients (33%) had a documented response, 5/15 (33%) had stable disease, and 5/15 (33%) had disease progression.SIRT with 90Y microspheres had antitumor activity in the majority of patients with primary or secondary liver cancer who had experienced disease progression with previous treatments.
