Non-invasive radioiodine imaging for accurate quantitation of NIS reporter gene expression in transplanted hearts. We studied the concordance of transgene expression in the transplanted heart using bicistronic adenoviral vector coding for a transgene of interest (human carcinoembryonic antigen: hCEA - beta human chorionic gonadotropin: betahCG) and for a marker imaging transgene (human sodium iodide symporter: hNIS).Inbred Lewis rats were used for syngeneic heterotopic cardiac transplantation. Donor rat hearts were perfused ex vivo for 30 min prior to transplantation with University of Wisconsin (UW) solution (n=3), with 10(9) pfu/ml of adenovirus expressing hNIS (Ad-NIS n=6), hNIS-hCEA (Ad-NIS-CEASignificantly higher image intensity was noted in the hearts perfused with Ad-NIS (1.1+/-0.2 0.9+/-0.07), Ad-NIS-CEA (1.2+/-0.3These data demonstrate that hNIS is an excellent reporter gene for the transplanted heart. The expression level of hNIS can be accurately and non-invasively monitored by serial radioisotopic SPECT imaging. High concordance has been demonstrated between imaging and soluble marker peptides at the maximum transgene expression on POD 5.
