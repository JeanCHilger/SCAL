Preclinical efficacy of the c-Met inhibitor CE-355621 in a U87 MG mouse xenograft model evaluated by 18F-FDG small-animal PET. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of CE-355621, a novel antibody against c-Met, in a subcutaneous U87 MG xenograft mouse model using (18)F-FDG small-animal PET.CE-355621 or control vehicle was administered intraperitoneally into nude mice (drug-treated group, n = 12 control group, n = 14) with U87 MG subcutaneous tumor xenografts. Drug efficacy was evaluated over 2 wk using (18)F-FDG small-animal PET and compared with tumor volume growth curves.The maximum %ID/g (percentage injected dose per gram of tissue) of (18)F-FDG accumulation in mice treated with CE-355621 remained essentially unchanged over 2 wk, whereas the %ID/g of the control tumors increased 66% compared with the baseline. Significant inhibition of (18)F-FDG accumulation was seen 3 d after drug treatment, which was earlier than the inhibition of tumor volume growth seen at 7 d after drug treatment.CE-355621 is an efficacious novel antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits (18)F-FDG accumulation earlier than tumor volume changes in a mouse xenograft model. These results support the use of (18)F-FDG PET to assess early tumor response for CE-355621.
