Optimal image sampling schedule: a new effective way to reduce dynamic image storage space and functional image processing time. An optimal image sampling schedule for tracer dynamic studies with positron emission tomography (PET) is proposed. This schedule incorporates the characteristics of PET measurement and uses a new cost function and the D-optimal criterion. A detailed case study of the estimation of the local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (LCMRGLc) using the tracer fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and the four-parameter FDG model is presented. As the sampling schedule designed requires only four dynamic images, the storage space and data processing time are greatly reduced, while the precision of the parameter estimates is almost the same as that achieved with a commonly used schedule. The effects of intersubject and intrasubject parameter variations on parameter estimation with the use of this optimal sampling schedule are investigated by computer simulation. The simulation results show that the estimation of parameters is sufficiently robust with respect to these intersubject and intrasubject variations. The optimal sampling schedule is quite suitable therefore for PET regional parameter estimation, as well as for image-wide parameter estimation, for different subjects.
