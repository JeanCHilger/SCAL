Biodistribution of (18)F-NaF as an imaging agent in osteoporotic rats for position emission tomography. To investigate the biodistribution of (18)-NaF as an imaging agent for position emission tomography (PET) in rat models of osteoporosis.Osteoporosis was induced in 10 rats via injection with an excess of dexamethasone phosphate sodium, and the biodistribution of (18)-NaF in the rats was studied, with another 10 normal rats as the control group. (18)-NaF PET was also performed in 8 healthy volunteers, and the uptakes of (18)-F- in the bone tissues were measured.Compared with the control rats, the osteoporotic rats showed significantly decreased (18)-F- uptake, especially in the femoral neck, lumbar vertebrae, the 7th rib and the tibia (P<0.05). Dynamic chest PET scanning in the volunteers revealed obvious (18)-F- uptake in the spine, ribs and humerus 20 s after injection of the imaging agent. (18)-F- uptake significantly increased with time in the bones, reaching the peak level 60 min after the injection, and whole-body PET at this point demonstrated obvious skeletal (18)-F- uptake, with high skeletal-to-muscle (STM) ratio that averaged 8.12.(18)-NaF is an excellent skeletal imaging agent for clinical skeletal blood flow and metabolism measurements. The uptake of (18)-NaF has significant difference between normal and osteoporotic bone tissues, indicating the value of (18)-NaF PET for study of osteoporosis.
