Prognostic value of myocardial 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) parameters in patients with heart failure: a systematic review. To derive a more precise estimate of the prognostic significance of myocardial 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) parameters [early heart mediastinal ratio (H/M), late H/M, and myocardial washout] in heart failure (HF).Eighteen studies with a total of 1755 patients, stratifying survival, and cardiac events in patients with HF by MIBG, were eligible for analysis. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) estimates for cardiac death and cardiac events associated with washout showed no significant heterogeneity and were 1.72 [95%CI (confidence interval), 1.72-2.52 P = 0.006] and 1.08 (95%CI: 1.03-1.12Our results indicate that patients with HF and decreased late H/M or increased myocardial MIBG washout have a worse prognosis compared with those with normal semi-quantitative myocardial MIBG parameters.
