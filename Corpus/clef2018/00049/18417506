Interleukin 13, CD14, pet and tobacco smoke influence atopy in three Dutch cohorts: the allergenic study. Studying gene-environment interactions may elucidate the complex origins of atopic diseases but requires large study populations. Pooling data from several cohort studies may help but may also obscure findings. Gene-environment interactions in atopy development were studied and the benefits of pooling data were evaluated. Haplotype-tagging polymorphisms in the genes interleukin (IL)13 and CD14 were genotyped in 3,062 children from the following birth cohorts: the Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) study the Prevention of Asthma in Children (PREVASC) study
