Evaluation of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Society of Nuclear Cardiology appropriateness criteria for SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging. The American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Society of Nuclear Cardiology appropriateness criteria (AC) were created to guide responsible use of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Clinical applicability of the AC has not been evaluated.Indications for testing were determined in 1209 patients and categorized as having appropriate, uncertain, or inappropriate indications the specialty of the ordering physician was noted. There were 940 (80%) appropriate, 154 (13%) inappropriate, and 79 (7%) uncertain testsIn evaluating the AC in a single-center academic setting, the majority of studies are appropriate, but a large proportion of ordered SPECT studies were categorized as uncertain, inappropriate, or no category. Although the inappropriate studies showed less ischemia than other groups, especially in women, a substantial portion of these studies (32%) were abnormal.
