Control of cancer pain in veterinary patients. Control of cancer pain is within the capabilities of most veterinarians and is achievable in most animal patients that have cancer with techniques that are currently available. Great satisfaction can be derived from not only treating the pet's cancer but its pain. Incorporating pain management into oncology practice is good for the well-being of the pet, the owner, the staff, the veterinarians, and the practice.
