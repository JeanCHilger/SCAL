Pentoxifylline treatment improves neurological and neurochemical deficits in rats subjected to transient brain ischemia. The possible neuroprotector effects of pentoxifylline (P), a methylxanthine derivative and phosphodiesterase inhibitor, were studied on male Wistar rats subjected to a model of transient brain ischemia. One group was treated, 1 h before ischemia (ISC) and 1 h after, with pentoxifylline (P), 50 and 100 mg/kg, i.p. (ISC+P). The other groups were ischemic, ISC sham operated, SO
