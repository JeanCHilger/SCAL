A novel high-sensitivity rapid-acquisition single-photon cardiac imaging camera. This study described and validated a new solid-state single-photon gamma-camera and compared it with a conventional-SPECT Anger camera. The compact new camera uses a unique method for localizing gamma-photon information with a bank of 9 solid-state detector columns with tungsten collimators that rotate independently.Several phantom studies were performed comparing the new technology with conventional-SPECT technology. These included measurements of line sources and single- and dual-radionuclide studies of a torso phantom. Simulations were also performed using a cardiothoracic phantom. Furthermore, 18 patients were scanned with both the new camera and a conventional-SPECT camera.The new camera had a count sensitivity that was 10 times higher than that of the conventional camera and a compensated spatial resolution that was moderately better. Dual-radionuclide studies using a phantom show the further potential of the new camera for a 2-tracer simultaneous acquisition. Two-minute clinical studies with the new camera and 11-min studies with the conventional camera qualitatively showed good-to-excellent image quality and improved myocardial edge definition for the new camera.These initial performance characteristics of a new solid-state single-photon gamma-camera offer great promise for clinical dynamic SPECT protocols, with important implications for applications in nuclear cardiology and molecular imaging.
