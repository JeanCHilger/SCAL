Positron emission tomography/computed tomography and radioimmunotherapy of prostate cancer. Traditional morphologically based imaging modalities are now being complemented by positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in prostate cancer. Metastatic prostate cancer is an attractive target for radioimmunotherapy (RIT) as no effective therapies are available. This review highlights the most important achievements within the last year in PET/CT and RIT of prostate cancer.Conflicting results exist on the use of choline for detection of malignant disease in the prostate gland. The role of PET/CT in N-staging remains to be elucidated further. However, F-choline and C-choline PET/CT have been demonstrated to be useful for detection of recurrence. F-choline and F-fluoride PET/CT are useful for detection of bone metastases. Prostate tumor antigens may be used as targets for RIT. Prostate-specific membrane antigen is currently under focus of a number of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. J591, a monoclonal antibody, which targets the extracellular domain of prostate-specific membrane antigen, shows promising results. HER2 receptors may also have a potential as target for PET/CT imaging and RIT of advanced prostate cancer.PET/CT in prostate cancer has proven to play a significant role, in particular for detection of prostate cancer recurrence and bone metastases. RIT of metastatic prostate cancer warrants further investigations.
