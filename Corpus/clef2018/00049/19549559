SVM-based computer-aided diagnosis of the Alzheimer's disease using t-test NMSE feature selection with feature correlation weighting. This letter shows a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technique for the early detection of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) image feature selection and a statistical learning theory classifier. The challenge of the curse of dimensionality is addressed by reducing the large dimensionality of the input data and defining normalized mean squared error features over regions of interest (ROI) that are selected by a t-test feature selection with feature correlation weighting. Thus, normalized mean square error (NMSE) features of cubic blocks located in the temporo-parietal brain region yields peak accuracy values of 98.3% for almost linear kernel support vector machine (SVM) defined over the 20 most discriminative features extracted. This new method outperformed recent developed methods for early AD diagnosis.
