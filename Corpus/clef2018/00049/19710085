Radionuclide imaging in ischaemic heart failure. Many tests are available for the investigation of patients with heart failure. The identification of the underlying aetiology of ventricular dysfunction is crucial as early treatment may limit or even reverse myocardial abnormalities.This article describes cardiac radionuclide imaging techniques and their applications in ischaemic ventricular dysfunction. Evidence for the role of these techniques is summarized with particular reference to current guidelines.Both positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) techniques are widely validated for the detection of myocardial viability and their use is recommended in both national and international guidelines.Although assessments of ventricular phase and myocardial innervation hold promise for the stratification of patients to cardiac resynchronization therapy, the poor performance of echocardiographic predictors of response in the recently published PROSPECT trial suggest that these techniques face a tough challenge.The use of integrated multimodality imaging techniques such as PET/computed tomography to assess for ischaemic causes of left ventricular dysfunction is an area that is currently under investigation, as is the role of nuclear techniques in the assessment of stem cell retention, distribution and function when used in patients with heart failure.Ongoing developments in radionuclide molecular imaging for assessment of angiogenesis, apoptosis and interstitial alterations during cardiac remodeling may have important implications for the prognosis and treatment of patients with heart failure.
