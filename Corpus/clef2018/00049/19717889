The quantification of dynamic FET PET imaging and correlation with the clinical outcome in patients with glioblastoma. The PET tracer O-(2-[18F]Fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (FET) has been shown to be valuable for different roles in the management of brain tumours. The aim of this study was to evaluate several quantitative measures of dynamic FET PET imaging in patients with resected glioblastoma. We evaluated dynamic FET PET in nine patients with histologically confirmed glioblastoma. Following FET PET, all subjects had radiation and chemotherapy. Tumour ROIs were defined by a threshold-based region-growing algorithm. We compared several standard measures of tumour uptake and uptake kinetics: SUV, SUV/background, distribution volume ratio (DVR), weighted frame differences and compartment model parameters. These measures were correlated with disease-free and overall survival, and analysed for statistical significance. We found that several measures allowed robust quantification. SUV and distribution volume did not correlate with clinical outcome. Measures that are based on a background region (SUV/BG, Logan-DVR) highly correlated with disease-free survival (r = -0.95, p < 0.0001), but not overall survival. Some advanced measures also showed a prognostic value but no improvement over the simpler methods. We conclude that FET PET probably has a prognostic value in patients with resected glioblastoma. The ratio of SUV to background may provide a simple and valuable predictive measure of the clinical outcome. Further studies are needed to confirm these explorative results.
