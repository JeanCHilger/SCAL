Corollary-and discrepancy-based approaches for examining the appropriateness of premorbid cognitive estimation in geriatric schizophrenia. This article addresses whether measures for assessing premorbid intellectual functioning are adequate for geriatric schizophrenia.We included geriatric schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD n = 37), frontotemporal dementia (FTDPearson's correlations and ANOVAs for discrepancy comparisons showed unique patterns of spared function in SSD when compared to FTD and controls.Findings lend support to the specificity of cognitive processes in SSD, even when accounting for processes common to the theoretically similar FTD. SSD showed a distinct pattern of spared ability which supports clinical utilization of discrepant measures of premorbid intellectual estimation for SSD.
