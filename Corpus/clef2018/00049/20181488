Synthesis of carbon-11-labeled tariquidar derivatives as new PET agents for imaging of breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2). Carbon-11-labeled tariquidar derivatives were first designed and synthesized as new PET agents for imaging of breast cancer resistance protein. The target tracers were prepared by O-[(11)C]methylation of their corresponding acid precursors using [(11)C]CH3OTf under basic conditions and isolated by a simplified solid-phase extraction (SPE) method in 50-60% radiochemical yields based on [(11)C]CO(2) and decay corrected to end of bombardment (EOB). The overall synthesis time from EOB was 15-20 min, the radiochemical purity was >99%, and the specific activity at end of synthesis (EOS) was 111-185 GBq/micromol.
