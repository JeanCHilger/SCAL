Synthesis and in vitro biological evaluation of carbon-11-labeled quinoline derivatives as new candidate PET radioligands for cannabinoid CB2 receptor imaging. Cannabinoids have been recently proposed as a new family of potential antitumor agents, and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) is believed to be over-expressed in tumor cells. This study was designed to develop new radioligands for imaging of CB2 receptor in cancer using biomedical imaging technique positron emission tomography (PET). Carbon-11-labeled 2-oxoquinoline and 2-chloroquinoline derivatives, [(11)C]6a-d and [(11)C]9a-d, were prepared by O-[(11)C]methylation of their corresponding precursors using [(11)C]CH(3)OTf under basic conditions and isolated by a simplified solid-phase extraction (SPE) method in 40-50% radiochemical yields based on [(11)C]CO(2) and decay corrected to end of bombardment (EOB). The overall synthesis time from EOB was 15-20 min, the radiochemical purity was >99%, and the specific activity at end of synthesis (EOS) was 111-185 GBq/micromol. Radioligand binding assays indicated compounds 6f, 6b, and 9f display potent in vitro binding affinities with nanomolar K(i) values and at least 100-2000-fold selectivity for CB2.
