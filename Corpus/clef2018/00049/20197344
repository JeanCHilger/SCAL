Clinical value of F18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography in patients with non-small cell lung cancer after potentially curative surgery: experience with 241 patients. F18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT), which allows differentiation between malignant and benign lesions based on difference in tissue glucose metabolism, has become increasingly important in lung cancer diagnosis. This study examined the clinical value of FDG-PET/CT in a large number of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after potentially curative surgery.Four hundred and ninety FDG-PET/CT of 241 patients (143 males and 98 females age range 38-87 yearsRecurrences were confirmed in 35 (15%) patients, and 206 patients (85%) had no evidence of recurrence. FDG-PET/CT correctly diagnosed recurrence in 34 of 35 patients and provided true negative findings in 198 of 206 patients who had no evidence of recurrence (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 97%, 96%, 96%, 81%, and 99%, respectively), indicating a high diagnostic performance. However, one patient had false negative studies and eight patients had false positive studies misdiagnosis was more frequently in intrathoracic sites associated with postoperative changes. Malignancies other than recurrence were detected in nine of all 241 patients (4%) including five second primary lung cancers.The present study demonstrated the high diagnostic performance of FDG-PET/CT in detecting recurrences in a large group of patients with NSCLC after potentially curative surgery. FDG-PET/CT is useful not only for diagnosis of recurrence but also for detection of other diseases.
