Endoscopy equipment and instrumentation for use in exotic animal medicine. The first descriptions of endoscopy date back to the times of Hippocrates (460-377 BC), who described the use of a rectal speculum in humans. Since that time, technologic advances have fueled the development of endoscopy equipment. The application of human pediatric instruments in exotic pet medicine has enabled these minimally invasive techniques to be applied to birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and small mammals. This article aims to summarize the development of endoscopy equipment and focuses on recent developments in miniature laparoscopy equipment that have found use in zoologic companion animal practice.
