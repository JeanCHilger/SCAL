Immunodetection and subcellular localization of Mal de Río Cuarto virus P9-1 protein in infected plant and insect host cells. Mal de Río Cuarto virus (MRCV), a member of the genus Fijivirus, family Reoviridae, has a genome consisting of 10 dsRNA segments. The segment 9 (S9) possesses two non-overlapping open reading frames (ORF-1 and ORF-2) encoding two putative proteins, MRCV P9-1 and MRCV P9-2, both of unknown function. The MRCV S9 ORF-1 was RT-PCR amplified, expressed in pET-15b vector, and the recombinant protein produced was used to raise an antiserum in rabbit. Western blot with the specific MRCV P9-1 antiserum detected a protein of about 39 kDa molecular weight present in crude protein extracts from infected plants and insects. However, no reaction was observed when this antiserum was tested against purified virus. In contrast, only virus particles were detected by a MRCV-coat antiserum used as a validation control. These results suggest that MRCV S9 ORF-1 encodes a non-structural protein of MRCV. Immunoelectron microscopy assays confirmed these results, and localized the MRCV P9-1 protein exclusively in electron-dense granular viroplasms within the cytoplasm of infected plants and insects cells. As viroplasms are believed to be the replication sites of reoviruses, the intracellular location of MRCV P9-1 protein suggests that it might be involved in the assembly process of MRCV particles.
