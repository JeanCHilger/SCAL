Bifunctional agents for imaging and therapy. Multiple, complementary techniques for tumor detection, including magnetic resonance, nuclear and optical imaging, are under active development each approach has particular strengths and advantages. Efforts are also currently underway to develop bifunctional agents, so that a single molecule can be used for imaging, therapy, and monitoring the long-term tumor response. This chapter is mainly focused on illustrating the utility of certain tumor-avid photosensitizers in developing agents for tumor imaging [fluorescence, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET)] and photodynamic therapy. Recent approaches for developing target-specific agents for photodynamic therapy (PDT) and in vivo tumor imaging are also briefly discussed.
