Assessment of lung inflammation with 18F-FDG PET during acute lung injury. The purpose of this review is to describe the current experimental and clinical data regarding the fundamentals and applications of (18)F-FDG PET during acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).Lung inflammation is a key feature of ALI. During ALI, FDG PET can be used to monitor lung neutrophils, which are essential cells in the pathophysiologic mechanisms of ALI. Pulmonary FDG kinetics are altered during experimental and human ALI and are associated with regional lung dysfunction, histologic abnormalities, and prognosis. FDG PET may be a valuable noninvasive method for gaining comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of ALI/ARDS and for evaluating therapeutic interventions.
