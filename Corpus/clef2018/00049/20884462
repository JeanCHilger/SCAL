Report: analgesic activities of ethanol extract of leaf, stem and their different fractions of Swertia chirata. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the analgesic activity of ethanol extract of leaf, stem, and their different fractions i.e. pet-ether, dichloromethane, and methanol fraction of Swertia chirata (Family-Gentianaceae) on Swiss albino mice. Acetic acid induced writhing in mice was used as the process to evaluate the analgesic activity. The ethanol extract of leaf and stem of Swertia chirata showed moderate inhibition (p<0.001) of writhing. Among different fractions pet-ether fraction showed significant inhibition (p<0.0001) of writhing where as methanol fraction showed moderate inhibition (p<0.003) of writhing as well. The inhibition of writhing was calculated in respective to control (vehicle). The test samples were administered at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight of experimental animals where diclofenac sodium at a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight was used as standard drug in this study.
