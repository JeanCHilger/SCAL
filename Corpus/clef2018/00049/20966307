Imaging of extraosseous myeloma: CT, PET/CT, and MRI features. A minority of patients with multiple myeloma have imaging findings of extraosseous involvement. Extraosseous myeloma may affect any organ and can mimic other malignancies. The objective of this article is to describe the clinical relevance of extraosseous myeloma and to present the diverse imaging findings of extraosseous myeloma.The presence of radiologically detectable extraosseous myeloma is associated with a poor prognosis and thus is an important factor in the initial workup and follow-up evaluation.
