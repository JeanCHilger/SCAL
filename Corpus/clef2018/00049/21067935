One-pot production of 18F-biotin by conjugation with 18F-FDG for pre-targeted imaging: synthesis and radio-labelling of a PEGylated precursor. The biotin-avidin affinity system is exploited in pre-targeted imaging using avidin-conjugated antibodies. (18)F-FDG is available at all PET centres. (18)F-FDG forms oximes by reaction with oxyamine. Herein we describe the synthesis of oxyamine-funtionalised biotin, its (18)F-labelling by conjugation with (18)F-FDG and confirm its ability to interact with avidin.
