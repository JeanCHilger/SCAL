Diagnostic significance of characteristic findings on ultrasonography for the stitch abscess after surgery in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. To elucidate the clinical significance of imaging modalities for detection of stitch abscess after surgery in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In 137 patients with oral SCC suspected of having lymph node metastases, local recurrence of tumor, or stitch abscess after surgery, the characteristic imaging findings related to lymph node metastases, local recurrence of tumor, and stitch abscess on ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and (18)fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) images were identified and analyzed. In all six patients with stitch abscess, characteristic findings were demonstrated on US, different from those of metastatic lymph nodes and local recurrence on CT, MRI, and 18FDG-PET images. Our results suggest that ultrasonography may be a very useful tool for diagnosis of postoperative stitch abscess and may help improve the quality of life of oral SCC patients.
