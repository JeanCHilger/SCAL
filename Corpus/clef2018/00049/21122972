Correlation between single photon emission computed tomography, AgNOR count, and histomorphologic features in patients with active mandibular condylar hyperplasia. To analyze the association between nuclear medicine examination (single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]), histology, and Argyrophilic Nuclear Organizer Region (AgNOR) count in patients with active condylar hyperplasia who have undergone condylectomy.Eight patients with a diagnosis of active condylar hyperplasia and evidence of facial asymmetry, with progressive deformation in time and on SPECT studies, were evaluated. The relationship between the rate of technetium Tc 99 intake, cartilage layer thickness, and cellular activity measured by recounting nucleolar organizers with AgNOR was evaluated.The 4 pathologic layers of condylar hyperplasia (fibrous, mesenchymal, and hypertrophic chondrocyte layers and ossification layer) showed great variability and different thicknesses among the cases analyzed. As age increased, the histologic layer thickness decreased (r = -0.73, P = .04). The age of the patients was inversely related to the number of AgNOR dots (r = -0.65, P = .08). The thickness of both mesenchymal and hypertrophic chondrocyte layers was related to cartilage island depth (r = 0.81, P = .02).Younger patients with condylar hyperplasia had a thicker condylar layer and more cellular activity measured by AgNOR count. The histologic features of this group of patients could not be associated with their SPECT findings.
