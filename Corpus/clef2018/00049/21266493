Does positron emission tomography offer prognostic information in malignant pleural mesothelioma? A best evidence topic in thoracic surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether positron emission tomography is useful in the diagnosis and prognosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Altogether 136 papers were found using the reported search, of which 15 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. We conclude that fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) accurately differentiates benign from malignant pleural disease, helps detect recurrence and provides prognostic information in terms of staging, survival and mortality. Eleven studies evaluated the role of FDG-PET in the diagnosis and prognosis of MPM. Malignant disease had a higher standardised uptake value (SUV) (6.5 ± 3.4 vs. 0.8 ± 0.6 P < 0.001) than benign pleural disease. Shorter median survival (9.7 vs. 21 months
