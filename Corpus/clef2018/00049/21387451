Diffusion-weighted MRI in early chemotherapy response evaluation of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma--a pilot study: comparison with 2-deoxy-2-fluoro- D-glucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography. To determine the feasibility of diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) in the evaluation of the early chemotherapeutic response in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), eight patients with histologically proven diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were imaged by MRI, including DWI, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) before treatment (E1), and after 1 week (E2) and two cycles (E3) of chemotherapy. In all patients, whole-body screening using T(1) - and T(2) -weighted images in the coronal plane was performed. To quantitatively evaluate the chemotherapeutic response, axial images including DWI were acquired. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were reconstructed, and the ADC value of the tumor was measured. In addition, the tumor volume was estimated on axial T(2) -weighted images. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max) ) and active tumor volume were measured on fused PET/CT images. Lymphomas showed high signal intensity on DW images and low signal intensity on ADC maps, except for necrotic foci. The mean pre-therapy ADC was 0.71 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s it increased by 77% at E2 (p < 0.05) and 24% more at E3 (insignificant)
