Clinical usefulness of combinatorial protocol with stress only myocardial perfusion SPECT, CTA and SPECT/CTA 3-dimensional fusion image. This study was designed to assess the value of a combinatorial protocol, namely, stress only myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS), 64-slice coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA), and SPECT/CTA 3-dimensional (3D) fusion imaging for the evaluation of coronary artery disease.A total of 142 patients were retrospectively reviewed. All underwent stress only MPS and 64-slice CTA before invasive coronary angiography (ICA). The SPECT/CTA 3D fusion images were generated. We compared the results of the combinatorial protocol with ICA.Seventy nine (76.0%) subjects were found to have â‰¥50% stenoses, by ICA. The sensitivity of the combinatorial examination was 100% and its specificity 80.8%. Its positive and negative predictive values were 94.0 and 100%, respectively. The number of lesion for abnormal MPS with matching significant stenoses on CTA is 94 [43 in left anterior descending (LAD) 19 in left circumflex (LCX)Stress only MPS/CTA 3D fusion imaging could provide the potential for improved diagnostic accuracy and additional information of hemodynamically relevant coronary arterial stenoses.
