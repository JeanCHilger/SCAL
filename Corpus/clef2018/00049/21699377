Pre-transplant positron emission tomography in patients with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma. This retrospective study evaluated the secondary clinical risk score at relapse, the prognostic significance of pre-transplant positron emission tomography (PET), and complete remission (CR) assessed by computed tomography (CT) after salvage chemotherapy before autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in 76 patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Median follow-up after ASCT was 23 months. Overall 11/20 PET-positive and 14/56 PET-negative patients relapsed after ASCT. In univariate analysis, only PET negativity before ASCT was significantly associated with better 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) (72.7 ± 6.3% vs. 36.1 ± 11.6%, p = 0.01) and 2-year overall survival (OS) (90.3 ± 4.1% vs. 61.4 ± 11.6%, p = 0.009). Other factors were not significant. In multivariate analysis, none of the evaluated factors were significant for PFS and OS. However, positive pre-transplant PET identified a population with worse PFS and OS at least in univariate analysis.
