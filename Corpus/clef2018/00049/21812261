Effect of bushen huoxue granule on dopamine neurotransmitter and dopamine transporter in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease. To observe the effect of Bushen Huoxue Granule (BHG) on dopamine (DA) neurotransmitter and dopamine transporter (DAT) in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) as an adjunctive therapy.Ninety-four PD patients were randomly assigned to two groups, 47 in each group. Madopar was given to all as the basic treatment group. The placebo was given to those in the control group while BHG was given to those in the treatment. The therapeutic course for all was three months. Before and after treatment DA levels in the brain of patients were detected by encephalofluctuograph (EFG) technique. Changes of DAT in the striatum of patients in the treatment group were detected by positron emission tomography (PET) and region of interest (ROI) analysis.(1) Before treatment the DA level was lower in the two groups than the normal value, showing significant difference (P < 0.01), but with no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). After treatment the DA level obviously increased in the two groups, showing significant difference from that before treatment (P < 0.01). No significant difference existed in the DA level in the two groups when compared with the normal value (P > 0.05), but with significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). Better results were obtained in the treatment group than in the control group. (2) The DAT radioactive accumulation inside the striatum increased obviously in the treatment group after treatment. ROI analysis showed the total ratio of striatum/cerebellum before and after treatment was 1.86 +/- 0.32 and 2.61 +/- 0.53 respectively, showing statistical difference (P < 0.05).BHG could improve the DA level of PD patients, and increasing DAT contents in the striatum, thus playing a role in effectively treating PD.
