Targeted nuclear imaging of breast cancer: status of radiotracer development and clinical applications. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Molecular imaging plays an important role in breast cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment response evaluation. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are the main clinical molecular imaging modalities that are based on the detection of radiotracers. This article discusses the typical radiotracers used for breast cancer imaging by PET and SPECT. In addition, radiotracers that are currently applied for human breast cancer imaging or under clinical trials are also reviewed in compliance with the categories of tumor-specific targets to which they are aimed at.
