Peritoneal strumosis: an extension study with (99m)Tc-pertecnectate. We report the case of a 35-year-old nulliparous woman, with a previous history of ovarian cystectomy diagnosed 3 years earlier due a struma ovarii type of monodermal teratoma in the right ovary and a hemorrhagic cyst in the left ovary. Progressive growth of the left adnexal mass was observed in the periodic medical check-ups. Due to this, a second laparoscopy was performed and, based on the findings, a left ovarian cystectomy, right salpingectomy and resection of multiple peritoneal implants were carried out. The pathology diagnosis was left struma ovarii and peritoneal strumosis. A whole body and SPECT/CT scan with (99m)Tc-pertechnetate was performed to detect possible peritoneal implants. This study helped to make the therapeutic decision.
