Resection of focally progressive gastrointestinal stromal tumours resistant to imatinib therapy. To analyse the outcome of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) who receive imatinib therapy and undergo subsequent resection of focally progressive disease.We reviewed the records of all cases of GIST discussed at the West of Scotland Sarcoma regional multi-disciplinary team meeting between January 2002 and December 2009 inclusive. We analysed all patients who had undergone surgery for progressive disease on imatinib therapy. Focally progressive disease was diagnosed on computated tomography (CT) and positron-emission tomography-CT and was defined by a GIST lesion initially responsive to imatinib therapy but then underwent growth with evidence of metabolic activity. All procedures were undertaken in a university teaching hospital by a single surgeon.Nine patients were identified who underwent ten resections of focally progressive GIST. Six had previously undergone resection of their primary tumour while three had presented with un-resectable disease. Nine operations were for resection of a solitary progression while one operation was for three foci of progression. Five patients underwent liver resection which was confined to the segments were there was focal progression of GIST of these one patient had multiple liver metastases and portal hypertension with a mass at the porta hepatis. The absolute survival for patients after resection was 18.4±13.7 months (mean±standard deviation), with progression free survival of 14.1±13.5 months equating to 56% at 1-year. Four patients had been switched from imatinib to sunitinib, for further multi-focal progression.Surgical resection of focally progressive GIST may prolong survival and a second or third resection is a feasible option in selected patients.
