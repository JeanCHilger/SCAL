Independent prognostic value of pre-treatment 18-FDG-PET in high-grade gliomas. The prognostic value of PET with (18F)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG) has been shown in high-grade gliomas (HGG), but not compared with consensual prognostic factors. We sought to evaluate the independent predictive value of pre-treatment FDG-PET on overall (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). We retrospectively analyzed 41 patients with histologically-confirmed HGG (31 glioblastomas and 10 anaplastic gliomas). The pre-treatment uptake of FDG was assessed qualitatively by five-step visual metabolic grading, and quantitatively by the ratio between the tumor and contralateral maximal standardized uptake value (T/CL). EFS and OS following PET were compared with FDG uptake by univariate analysis, and by two multivariate analyses: one including main consensual prognostic factors (age, KPS, extent of surgery and histological grade), and the other including the classification system of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (Recursive Partitioning Analysis, RPA). Median OS and EFS were 13.8 and 7.4 months, respectively, for glioblastomas, and over 25.8 and 12 months, respectively, for anaplastic gliomas (P = 0.040 and P = 0.027). The T/CL ratio predicted OS in the entire group [P = 0.003 Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.3] and in the glioblastoma subgroup (P = 0.018
