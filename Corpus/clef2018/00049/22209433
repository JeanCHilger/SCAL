MR imaging versus PET/CT for evaluation of pancreatic lesions. To retrospectively determine the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and combined positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant pancreatic lesions.Twenty-seven patients (15 women/12 men, mean age 56.5 years) with MR imaging and PET/CT studies performed to differentiate benign and malignant pancreatic lesions were identified between October 2008 and October 2010. Both MR and PET/CT data sets were retrospectively and blindly evaluated by two independent readers (4 readers total) with different degrees of experience, using a visual five-point score system. The results were correlated with final diagnosis obtained by histopathology.17 patients had malignant diseases and 10 patients had benign diseases. Depending on the observer, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of MRI varied between 88-94%, 50-80%, 75-89% and 71-89% respectively. Sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values and negative predictive values of PET/CT were 73%, 56%, 73% and 56% respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of MR for the differential diagnosis of pancreatic lesions was 74-89%, compared with 67% for PET/CT. The weighted Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0.47 at MR and 0.53 at PET/CT.MRI achieved higher sensitivity and specificity in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic lesions.
