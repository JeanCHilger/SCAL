Mental health implications of human attachment to companion animals. Because of the contradictory nature of findings and methodological weaknesses identified within current human-companion animal bond research, there is a need to further explore the connection between human-animal bonds and mental health.The purpose of this survey questionnaire study was to explore the relationship of attachment to companion animal and human psychological distress after controlling for demographic variables, and to investigate whether the relationship between social supports and psychological distress would be moderated by attachment to a companion animal.Results highlight the psychological vulnerability of individuals reporting a strong bond with their companion animal.These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for mental health services designed to anticipate and address client-related companion animal needs.
