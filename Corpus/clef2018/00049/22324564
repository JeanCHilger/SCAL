Cerebral blood flow and freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease. We investigated the relationship between freezing of gait (FOG) severity in Parkinson's disease (PD) and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and evaluated the effect of selegiline therapy.We evaluated 54 patients with PD (FOG positive: 21 patients, and FOG negative: 33 patients) with N-isopropyl-p-[I-123] iodoamphetamine ((123) I-IMP) SPECT and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Beck Depression Inventory. [Correction added on 18 April 2012, after online publication: In the preceding statement, 55 instead of 54 patients with PD were evaluated, and FOG negative consisted of 34 instead of 33 patients] Furthermore, we examined rCBF in FOG-negative patients treated with levodopa with or without selegiline.Z-values of bilateral Brodmann areas (BA) 10 and 11 and left BA32 showed significant increases in the FOG-positive group compared with the FOG-negative group. [Correction added on 18 April 2012, after online publication: In the preceding statement, Z-values was changed to Z-scores] There were significantly positive correlations between Z-values of these areas and FOG score, especially on both sides of BA11. [Correction added on 18 April 2012, after online publication: In the preceding statement, Z-values was changed to Z-scores] An increase in Z-values in bilateral BA10 and 11 and left BA32 in the levodopa-selegiline treatment group after 1 year was significantly inhibited compared with the levodopa treatment group. [Correction added on 18 April 2012, after online publication: In the preceding statement, left BA32 was changed to right BA32, and Z-values was changed to Z-scores]There was a close relationship between FOG severity in PD and an increase in rCBF in BA 10, 11 and 32. Furthermore, selegiline's FOG prevention effect may be related to maintaining rCBF in these same areas.
