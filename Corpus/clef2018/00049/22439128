An Unusual Case of Extraosseous Accumulation of Bone Scan Tracer in a Renal Calculus - Demonstration by SPECT-CT. Extraosseous localization of radioisotope, used in bone scan, in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions is a well-known phenomenon. The causes of extraosseous accumulation of bone-seeking radiotracers should be kept in mind when bone-imaging studies are reviewed to avoid incorrect interpretations. We report an extremely rare occurrence of extraosseous accumulation of bone scintigraphy tracer in a renal calculus, in a patient with adenocarcinoma of prostate, that was demonstrated by Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography and Computed Tomography (SPECT-CT) fusion imaging.
