Radiosynthesis of a ¹⁸F-labeled 2,3-diarylsubstituted indole via McMurry coupling for functional characterization of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in vitro and in vivo. The radiosynthesis of 3-(4-[(18)F]fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-1H-indole [(18)F]-3 as potential PET radiotracer for functional characterization of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in vitro and in vivo is described. [(18)F]-3 was prepared by McMurry cyclization of a (18)F-labeled intermediate with low valent titanium and zinc via a two-step procedure in a remote controlled synthesizer unit including HPLC purification and solid phase extraction. In this way [(18)F]-3 was synthesized in 80 min synthesis time in 10% total decay corrected yield from [(18)F]fluoride in radiochemical purity >98% and a specific activity of 74-91 GBq/μmol (EOS). [(18)F]-3 was evaluated in vitro using pro-inflammatory stimulated THP-1 and COX-2 expressing tumor cell lines (FaDu, A2058, HT-29), where the radiotracer uptake was shown to be consistent with up regulated COX-2 expression. The stability of [(18)F]-3 was determined by incubation in rat whole blood and plasma in vitro and by metabolite analysis of arterial blood samples in vivo, showing with 75% of original compound after 60 min an acceptable high metabolic stability. However, no substantial tumor accumulation of [(18)F]-3 could be observed by dynamic small animal PET studies on HT-29 tumor-bearing mice in vivo. This may be due to the only moderate COX-1/COX-2 selectivity of 3 as demonstrated by both cellular and enzymatic cyclooxygenase inhibition assay in vitro. Nevertheless, the new approach first using McMurry cyclization in (18)F-chemistry gives access to (18)F-labeled diarylsubstituted heterocycles that hold promise as radiolabeled COX-2 inhibitors.
