Boundaries of anion/naphthalenediimide interactions: from anion-π interactions to anion-induced charge-transfer and electron-transfer phenomena. The recent emergence of anion-π interactions has added a new dimension to supramolecular chemistry of anions. Yet, after a decade since its inception, actual mechanisms of anion-π interactions remain highly debated. To elicit a complete and accurate understanding of how different anions interact with π-electron-deficient 1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimides (NDIs) under different conditions, we have extensively studied these interactions using powerful experimental techniques. Herein, we demonstrate that, depending on the electron-donating abilities (Lewis basicity) of anions and electron-accepting abilities (π-acidity) of NDIs, modes of anion-NDI interactions vary from extremely weak non-chromogenic anion-π interactions to chromogenic anion-induced charge-transfer (CT) and electron-transfer (ET) phenomena. In aprotic solvents, electron-donating abilities of anions generally follow their Lewis basicity order, whereas π-acidity of NDIs can be fine-tuned by installing different electron-rich and electron-deficient substituents. While strongly Lewis basic anions (OH(-) and F(-)) undergo thermal ET with most NDIs, generating NDI(•-) radical anions and NDI(2-) dianions in aprotic solvents, weaker Lewis bases (AcO(-), H(2)PO(4)(-), Cl(-), etc.) often require the photoexcitation of moderately π-acidic NDIs to generate the corresponding NDI(•-) radical anions via photoinduced ET (PET). Poorly Lewis basic I(-) does not participate in thermal ET or PET with most NDIs (except with strongly π-acidic core-substituted dicyano-NDI) but forms anion/NDI CT or anion-π complexes. We have looked for experimental evidence that could indicate alternative mechanisms, such as a Meisenheimer complex or CH···anion hydrogen-bond formation, but none was found to support these possibilities.
