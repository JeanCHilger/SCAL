The use of multiple time point dynamic positron emission tomography/computed tomography in patients with oral/head and neck cancer does not predictably identify metastatic cervical lymph nodes. To determine whether the time course of 18-fluorine fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) activity in multiple consecutively obtained 18F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans predictably identifies metastatic cervical adenopathy in patients with oral/head and neck cancer. It is hypothesized that the activity will increase significantly over time only in those lymph nodes harboring metastatic cancer.A prospective cohort study was performed whereby patients with oral/head and neck cancer underwent consecutive imaging at 9 time points with PET/CT from 60 to 115 minutes after injection with (18)F-FDG. The primary predictor variable was the status of the lymph nodes based on dynamic PET/CT imaging. Metastatic lymph nodes were defined as those that showed an increase greater than or equal to 10% over the baseline standard uptake values. The primary outcome variable was the pathologic status of the lymph node.A total of 2,237 lymph nodes were evaluated histopathologically in the 83 neck dissections that were performed in 74 patients. A total of 119 lymph nodes were noted to have hypermetabolic activity on the 90-minute (static) portion of the study and were able to be assessed by time points. When we compared the PET/CT time point (dynamic) data with the histopathologic analysis of the lymph nodes, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 60.3%, 70.5%, 66.0%, 65.2%, and 65.5%, respectively.The use of dynamic PET/CT imaging does not permit the ablative surgeon to depend only on the results of the PET/CT study to determine which patients will benefit from neck dissection. As such, we maintain that surgeons should continue to rely on clinical judgment and maintain a low threshold for executing neck dissection in patients with oral/head and neck cancer, including those patients with N0 neck designations.
