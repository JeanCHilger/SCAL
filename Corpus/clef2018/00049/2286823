Cerebral reserve. A method for evaluating cerebro-vascular hemodynamic risk. Together with embolic risk, hemodynamic risk tends to play an important role in cerebrovascular pathology. Studies of cerebral reserve have resulted from the difficulty of accurately estimating the repercussions of arterial lesions. The vascular reserve of a given region is the ratio between maximum and baseline flow. Maximum cerebral flow is obtained by inhalation of a gaseous mixture containing CO2 5%. An excellent correlation was found between lesion size and a decrease in the reserve. Three stages could be defined by positron emission transaxial tomography: a zone of hemodynamic reserve without modification of oxygen extraction a zone of extraction reserve in which inflow insufficiency is compensated by increased oxygen extraction (this is the critical zone requiring action)
