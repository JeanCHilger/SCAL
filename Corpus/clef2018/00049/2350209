Cocaine-induced reduction of glucose utilization in human brain. A study using positron emission tomography and [fluorine 18]-fluorodeoxyglucose. We examined the effects of cocaine hydrochloride (40 mg intravenously) on regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose and on subjective self-reports of eight polydrug abusers in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose was measured by the [fluorine 18]-fluorodeoxyglucose method, using positron emission tomography. With eyes covered, subjects listened to a tape that presented white noise, "beep" prompts, and questions about subjective effects of cocaine or saline. Cocaine produced euphoria and reduced glucose utilization globally (mean reduction, 14%). Twenty-six of 29 brain regions (all neocortical areas, basal ganglia, portions of the hippocampal formation, thalamus, and midbrain) showed significant decrements (5% to 26%) in the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose. No significant effects of cocaine were observed in the pons, the cerebellar cortex, or the vermis. Right-greater-than-left hemispheric asymmetry of regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose occurred in the lateral thalamus. The findings demonstrate that reduced cerebral metabolism is associated with cocaine-induced euphoria.
