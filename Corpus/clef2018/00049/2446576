Cortical glucose utilization patterns in primary degenerative dementias of the anterior and posterior type. Regional cortical function was evaluated in 13 patients with primary degenerative dementia and six age-matched, neurologically normal control individuals. Five patients were selected on the basis of preponderant signs of posterior dementia, five had mainly signs of anterior dementia, and the remaining three evidenced mixed anterior-posterior cognitive deficits. Positron emission tomographic scans following the intravenous administration of fluorodeoxyglucose revealed a characteristic pattern of abnormalities in each group: those with posterior dementia, as primarily manifested by verbal and visuospatial deficits, had a predominant focus of hypofunction in the posterior parietal and temporal regions those with the less common anterior dementia, evidenced by prominent personality and social behavioral changes, had their most conspicuous abnormality in the anterior frontal cortex
