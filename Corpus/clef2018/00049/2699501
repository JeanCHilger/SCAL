A historical perspective of human-animal interaction as a field of study. A chronological review is given of the most important people, publications, scientific gatherings and societies which have contributed to the development and recognition of human-animal interactions as a field of study. Lorenz is recognised as the founder of this new field of study. His contribution was to emphasise the role of humans who have to have a thorough knowledge of animal behaviour and he also pointed out the fact that modern man needs to keep contact with nature. Other pioneers were Levinson who pointed out the therapeutic benefits of companion animals and the Corsons who used animals in hospital settings. The explosion of knowledge in this particular field took place during the 1980's. The first world congress on the subject was held in 1980 in London. Societies involved in this new study field, were established in the United Kingdom, Europe, United States of America, Australia, Canada and South Africa. In South Africa the interest in this field emerged during the 1980's with articles published in veterinary periodicals. It has since developed into a multi-disciplinary approach. A new chair was furthermore inaugurated to teach human-animal-interactions as part of the veterinary curriculum. There is no doubt that the new study field has important implications for the veterinary profession.
