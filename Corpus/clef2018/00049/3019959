The use of positron emission tomography in pion radiotherapy. The radioactive debris produced by pion radiotherapy can be imaged by the technique of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as a method of non-invasive in situ verification of the pion treatment. This paper presents the first visualization of the pion stopping distribution within a tumor in a human brain using PET. Together with the tissue functional information provided by the standard PET scans using radiopharmaceuticals, the combination of pion with PET technique can provide a much better form of radiotherapy than the use of conventional radiation in both treatment planning and verification.
