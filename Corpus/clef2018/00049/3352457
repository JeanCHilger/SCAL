In vivo binding of [18F]GBR 13119 to the brain dopamine uptake system. Regional rat brain uptake of [18F]GBR 13119, a high specific activity, positron-emitter labeled derivative of the potent dopamine uptake antagonist GBR 12935, is reported. Striatum to cerebellum ratios of 3 are obtained at 90 minutes post injection. Specific binding in striatum can be blocked by pretreatment with dopamine uptake system antagonists (mazindol, nomifensine) but not with receptor antagonists (spiperone, flupenthixol). [18F]GBR 13119 is proposed as a new positron-emitting radioligand for in vivo PET studies of the pre-synaptic dopamine uptake system.
