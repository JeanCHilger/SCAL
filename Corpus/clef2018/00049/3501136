A cooperative group study of clinical efficacy of the liver SPECT. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the liver SPECT about detectability of SOLs (space occupying lesion). The images were interpreted with the planar scintigram (PS) only and combination of PS and SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) by 11 physicians. Changes of false positive and false negative rate were calculated to evaluate the influence of the diffuse parenchymal liver disease and the localization of the SOLs. Addition of SPECT to PS in the cases who are suspected SOLs is effective in right hepatic lobe (right anterior and posterior segment) to detect the SOLs, but not effective in left lateral segment. Addition of SPECT to PS in the cases with diffuse parenchymal liver disease and SOLs increases the false positive rate.
