Design, synthesis, and evaluation of omega-iodovinyl- and omega-iodoalkyl-substituted methyl-branched long-chain fatty acids. The synthesis of a new methyl-branched fatty acid, (E)-19-iodo-3(RS)-methyl-18-nonadecenoic acid (19), is described. Methyl branching has been introduced at the 3-position to inhibit beta-oxidation and radioiodide has been attached as a trans-vinyl iodide. Preparation of 19 involved a 15-step sequence of reactions climaxing with formation of the methyl ester 18 by iododestannylation of methyl (E)-19-(tri-n-butylstannyl)-3(RS)-methyl-18-nonadecenoate (17) resulting from the reaction of n-Bu3SnH with methyl 3(RS)-methyl-18-nonadecynoate (16). Methyl branching was introduced at an early stage by Friedel-Crafts acylation of thiophene with 3(RS)-methyl-4-carbomethoxybutanoyl chloride (3) generated from 3-methylglutaric anhydride. The new agent, [125I]-19, showed high myocardial uptake (5 min, 4.89% dose/g 30 min, 3.32% dose/g), good heart/blood (H/B) ratios (5 min, 5.4/1
