Positron emission tomography in a case of experimental focal epilepsy in the baboon. Repetitive limbic status epilepticus was produced in one baboon by intraamygdaloid microinjection of kainic acid. Brain metabolism was analysed by positron emission tomography (PET) after intravenous administration 18fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG). In a control examination the distribution of 18FDG was symmetric in homologous parts of the brain. In contrast, during the epileptic state a restricted zone, the fronto-temporal region, showed increased 18FDG incorporation. This region corresponded to the side of kainic acid injection and to the limbic epileptogenic focus as demonstrated by EEG recording. The use of the non-invasive PET technique is suggested as an adjunct to classical EEG and clinical observation for the localization of an epileptic focus generating a status epilepticus.
