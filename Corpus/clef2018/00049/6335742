Which SPECT? A protocol has been designed to enable an intercomparison of a number of different SPECT systems to be performed. While results are still not ideal, a considerable improvement of current systems with respect to those available prior to 1983 was noted. Resolution of up to 11 mm was found for a radius of rotation corresponding to the head, and reasonable uniformity could be achieved. Further improvement using noncircular orbits, better collimators, and careful control of uniformity can be achieved. Such systems should, it is hoped, be of clinical value. However, if one had to select a system, which one would it be? The answer must surely be to mount a Siemens head, with the Elscint electronics on a Philips stand, with a cut-away surround from GE. But that might be difficult, and possibly even expensive. Back to the drawing board!
