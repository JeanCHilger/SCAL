Scintigraphic localization of phaeochromocytomas. 131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine scanning was performed in 14 patients with phaeochromocytomas. In all but one patient scintigraphy successfully localized the lesion(s). The results confirm that scintigraphic imaging with 131I-meta-iodo-benzylguanidine, a noninvasive method, is a valid and reliable procedure for imaging and localization of adrenal and extra-adrenal phaeochromocytomas, both benign and malignant.
