Biochemical characterization of Escherichia coli temperature-sensitive dnaB mutants dnaB8, dnaB252, dnaB70, dnaB43, and dnaB454. By use of PCR, the dnaB genes from the classical temperature-sensitive dnaB mutants PC8 (dnaB8), RS162 (dnaB252), CR34/454 (dnaB454), HfrH165/70 (dnaB70), and CR34/43 (dnaB43) were isolated. The mutant genes were sequenced, and single amino acid changes were identified in all cases. The mutant DnaB proteins were overexpressed in BL21 (DE3) cells by using the T7 based pET-11c expression vector system. The purified proteins were compared in regard to activities in the general priming reaction of primer RNA synthesis (with primase and single-stranded DNA [ssDNA] as the template), ATPase activity, and helicase activity at permissive (30 degrees C) and nonpermissive (42 degrees C) temperatures. The DnaB252 mutation is at amino acid 299 (Gly to Asp), and in all in vitro assays the DnaB252 protein was as active as the wild-type DnaB protein at both 30 and 42 degrees C. This region of the DnaB protein is believed to be involved in interaction with the DnaC protein. The dnaB8, dnaB454, and dnaB43 mutations, although independently isolated in different laboratories, were all at the same site, changing amino acid 130 from Ala to Val. This mutation is in the hinge region of the DnaB protein domains and probably induces a temperature-sensitive conformational change. These mutants have negligible primer RNA synthesis, ATPase activity, and helicase activity at the nonpermissive temperature. DnaB70 has a mutation at amino acid 242 (Met to Ile), which is close to the proposed ATP binding site. At 30 degrees C this mutant protein has a low level of ATPase activity (approximately 25% of that of the wild type) which is not affected by high temperature. By using a gel shift method that relies upon ssDNA substrates containing the photoaffinity analog 5-(N-(p-azidobenzoyl)-3-aminoallyl)-dUMP, all mutant proteins were shown to bind to ssDNA at both 30 and 42 degrees C. Their lack of other activities at 42 degrees C, therefore, is not due to loss of binding to the ssDNA substrate.
