A universal, multi-modality localization system for animal radiosurgery. We have developed a stereotactic localization system allowing a radiosurgical approach in a number of animal models. The system utilizes fixation adapters specially designed for a particular animal, which in turn are attached to a common Brown-Roberts-Wells (BRW) compatible Delrin head ring. Each fixation adapter is constructed using materials compatible with CT, MRI, PET, and angiographic imaging studies. With such a system, radiographic localization, computerized treatment planning, and stereotactic radiation delivery can subsequently be performed in a manner identical to the procedures used for humans.
