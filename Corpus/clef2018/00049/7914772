Temporal lobectomy in adults with intractable epilepsy. We report on 30 adult patients with intractable complex partial seizure (CPS) of the temporal lobe origin who received anterior temporal lobectomy. The average follow-up period was 41 months. The age of onset was younger and the duration of epilepsy was longer in the non-mass lesion group than in the mass lesion group. Postoperatively, 21 patients (70%) were seizure-free, four patients (13%) had only rare seizures (less than three attacks per year), three patients (10%) achieved a remarkable reduction (more than 50%) of seizure frequency, and two patients (7%) showed no worthwhile improvement. Based on our experience, anterior temporal lobectomy is an effective and safe procedure for adult patients with intractable CPS. For diagnosis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) yielded a higher sensitivity rate than computed tomography (CT), especially in the group without mass lesions. Positron emission tomography using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) was superior to single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) which had a relatively high false localization rate. With high resolution MRI and FDG-PET, localization of the epileptogenic zone was more accurate. A preresection electrocorticogram (ECoG) was used to confirm the epileptogenic focus during the operation. The residual spikes on the postresection ECoG did not necessarily predict a poor seizure control outcome after anterior temporal lobectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
