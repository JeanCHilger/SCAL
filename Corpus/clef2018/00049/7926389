Stress echocardiography: 4 years of experience at the Thoraxcenter. In this article, we report the experience on stress echocardiography at the Thoraxcenter of Erasmus University of Rotterdam in the years 1990-1994. Different types of stress have been used in conjunction with ultrasound techniques. The results have been compared with other non-invasive methods (exercise ECG testing, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with single photon emission computed tomography) and with coronary arteriography. Both the diagnostic and prognostic value of stress echocardiography have been assessed in different clinical situations, as in patients with chest pain and suspected or proven coronary artery disease, patients referred for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, patients referred for major non cardiac vascular surgery. After this period of validation, stress echocardiography has now a definite role in the clinical decision making for the evaluation of myocardial ischemia. The assessment of viable myocardium, especially in patients with advanced left ventricular dysfunction, is one of the major topic currently under investigation. Practical aspects of the interpretation of the tests, costs and organization of the stress echo laboratory, indications and newest research applications are also discussed.
