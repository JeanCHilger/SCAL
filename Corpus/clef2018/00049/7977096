Left ventricular dilatation and multivessel coronary artery disease on thallium-201 SPECT are important prognostic indicators in patients with large defects in the left anterior descending distribution. This study examines the importance of left ventricular (LV) dilatation, and evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease identified on thallium-201 (TI-201) single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) scintigrams, for predicting long-term outcome in patients with an extensive left anterior descending (LAD) perfusion deficit. Impaired contractility of the left ventricle determined by low ejection fraction, elevated LV end-systolic volume, and dilatation of the left ventricle are known as major predictors of mortality after myocardial infarction. TI-201 single-photon emission computed tomography primarily reveals status of perfusion/redistribution, but also contains indirect information on LV function. To date, there are no TI-201 SPECT data on impaired function of the left ventricle (LV dilatation) and extent of perfusion deficits, discussed together as correlates of survival. Patient data were prospectively collected in the computer data base at Emory University. A large perfusion defect involving more than one third of the LAD territory was identified in 291 of 2,652 consecutive patients examined with TI-201 SPECT initial and 3-hour redistribution studies. Follow-up data were obtained for 284 patients (98%) at 38 +/- 14 months. Of the 291 patients, 58 died. The most powerful multivariate correlates of death were LV dilatation, multivessel disease, and the ratio of the LAD severity stress score to total severity of SDs stress score. Cox model analysis was used to determine correlates of survival. Three-year survival for patients with LV dilatation was 73% versus 89% without LV dilatation (p < 0.001). Three-year survival in patients with 1-vessel disease ("LAD only") was 94% versus 78% for multivessel disease (p < 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
