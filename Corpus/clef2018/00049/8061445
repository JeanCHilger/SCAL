Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging assessment of vascularized free fibular grafts. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may be a noninvasive method for assessing perfusion of vascularized bone grafts placed for treatment of avascular necrosis. One proximal femur of seven beagles was devascularized, with insertion of a vascularized fibular graft. MR imaging at 1 week (seven dogs) and 6 weeks (five dogs) after surgery included pre- and postcontrast spin-echo sequences, unenhanced two-dimensional time-of-flight (TOF) vascular imaging, and dynamic gradient-echo imaging during infusion of gadolinium. Relative signal intensity values of selected regions obtained from the dynamic gradient-echo images were plotted as percent enhancement versus time. In the operated hip, MR imaging did not show enhancement in six of seven femoral heads and greater trochanters at 1 week after surgery, with similar results after 6 weeks. MR imaging of fibular grafts 6 weeks after surgery showed an initial rapid increase in enhancement and a subsequent slower increase in five of five dogs, although no enhancement was seen in six of seven dogs at 1 week. These findings contrasted with a rapid initial increase in enhancement followed by slow decline in non-operated hips. Two-dimensional TOF imaging did not show the vascular pedicle of the graft in any dog. Findings of radionuclide bone scanning performed 1 week after surgery were consistent with devascularization of the operated femur and fibular graft. However, tetracycline distribution and histologic findings confirmed the viability of five of five grafts within the devascularized femurs 6 weeks after surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
