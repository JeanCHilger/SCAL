Study of myocardial infarct remodeling by single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging. Left ventricular (LV) remodeling after Q-wave anterior acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was examined with single-photon emission computed tomographic thallium imaging. Initial (after adenosine infusion) and 4-hour delayed reinjection images were obtained in 34 patients aged 65 +/- 12 years. Short-axis slices from the delayed images were quantitatively analyzed by measuring the outer and inner diameters, and wall thickness. The results were compared with those in a group of normal subjects. The outer diameter was greater in patients than in normal subjects at the apical, mid- and basal levels (all p < 0.01) the average outer diameter was 16.9 +/- 1.9 mm in patients, and 12.2 +/- 1.3 mm in normal subjects (p < 0.001). Similarly, the inner diameter was greater in patients than in normal subjects at the 3 levels (all p < 0.05)
