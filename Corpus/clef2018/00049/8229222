Effect of motion on thallium-201 SPECT studies: a simulation and clinical study. Although patient motion on 201Tl SPECT studies has been reported as a source of artifacts, systematic studies on motion patterns and resultant artifacts are lacking. Accordingly, we simulated 74 motion patterns upon a normal study. The tomograms were assessed for presence of defects: The "motion pixel area index" ranged from 1 to 83 26 of 30 (87%) simulations with an index > or = 21 had defects, whereas 38 of 44 (86%) simulations with an index < 21 were normal. Defect location was dependent on motion direction
