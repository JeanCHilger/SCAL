Thallium-201 technetium-99m HMPAO single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging for guiding stereotactic craniotomies in heavily irradiated malignant glioma patients. SPECT scanning with Tl-201 and Tc-99m offers a unique, inexpensive functional imaging modality to combine with CT stereotactic craniotomy for guiding resection of necrosis and/or tumour in patients treated with escalated doses of radiation (> 6000 cGy) by either brachytherapy or radiosurgery. Thirty-two cases were analyzed, with a detailed description of the imaging and operative techniques.
