Evaluation of newborns with brain disease using 123I-IMP SPECT. Eleven newborns with suspected cerebral disease were evaluated using 123I-IMP SPECT. In a normal subject, high uptake was shown in the sensorimotor cortex, thalamus, midbrain-brainstem, and cerebellar vermis. Decreased perfusion was also noted in the frontal lobe. In hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), diffuse decreased uptake which showed no redistribution in the white matter was seen in two patients. These two patients had a poor prognosis. In one of the other 4 patients with HIE, persistent defect in parasagittal area was recognized and the patient also had a poor prognosis. In one of two patients with tuberous sclerosis, 123I-IMP SPECT showed high uptake in the area of increased density shown in CT. Thus, 123I-IMP SPECT of newborn has characteristic findings different from the adult. This tracer also might have a prognostic value of clinical improvement following HIE.
