Quantitative assessment of improvement in perfusion after coronary bypass grafting: assessed by thallium-201 bull's eye subtraction polar map method. To assess redistribution (RD) and improvement in regional perfusion after coronary bypass grafting (CABG) on thallium-201 SPECT images quantitatively, the Bull's eye subtraction polar (BS) map was created. BS map was created after subtraction of a normalized bull's eye polar map from another normalized polar map. The quantitative assessment on this map was compared to the visual qualitative analysis in 23 patients (115 segments) who received CABG. All of the improved segments after CABG showed > or = 15% on the BS map. On the other hand, 60% of the non improved segments showed < 10% on the BS map. Furthermore, 67% of the RD segments showing > or = 15% on the BS map before CABG improved in perfusion by > or = 15% on the BS map after CABG. On the BS map, an excellent correlation was observed between the extent of redistribution before CABG and the extent of improvement after CABG. Thus, BS map permits quantitative assessment of improvement in perfusion on T1 SPECT imaging, and this technique seems to be valuable for predicting improvement in perfusion after CABG.
