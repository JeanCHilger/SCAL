Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy with dementia. To provide new insights into metabolic changes in the brain of patients with dementia, we performed in vivo localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in nine patients with primary degenerative dementia and in three patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus. We compared the results with those in 26 healthy volunteers. Measurements of regional cerebral blood flow were performed in seven patients by means of single photon emission computed tomography with amphetamine I 123 as a tracer. The magnetic resonance spectra constantly showed three major peaks corresponding to N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), and choline-containing compounds. There were no age-related changes in the mean area ratio of NAA to Cr in neurologically normal volunteers. The NAA/Cr ratio was significantly reduced in patients with primary degenerative dementia. The reduction of the NAA/Cr ratio was observed even in dementia patients with no significant brain atrophy or reduction in regional cerebral blood flow. No significant reduction of the NAA/Cr ratio was seen in patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus. The NAA/Cr ratio might reflect the number and/or activity of neuronal cells in the brain. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy may well provide a useful tool for early detection of, and further pathophysiological study of, primary degenerative dementia.
