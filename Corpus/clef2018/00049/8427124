Reinjection as an alternative to rest imaging for detection of exercise-induced ischemia with thallium-201 emission tomography. Exercise thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography images were compared prospectively with 4-hour redistribution images, with 4-hour reinjection images, and with images obtained at rest on a separate day in 37 patients with documented coronary artery disease. Exercise images were abnormal in 35 patients (95%). On the basis of an improvement in thallium-201 distribution between exercise and nonexercise images, overall sensitivity for the detection of coronary artery stenosis was significantly higher with reinjection at 4 hours (p < 0.05) or with a rest injection on a separate day (p < 0.05) than with redistribution imaging (84%, 83%, and 70%, respectively). Reinjection and rest injection were positive more frequently in patients with a wall-motion abnormality (76% and 80%, respectively, vs 64% at redistribution p < 0.05 for both) or with > 90% stenosis (77% and 76%, respectively, vs 58% at redistribution
