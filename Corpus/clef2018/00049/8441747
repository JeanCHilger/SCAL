Effectiveness of the Gordon parent training. The analysis of recent reviews concerned with the efficacy of Parent Effectiveness Training (PET) demonstrates, within limits, its reliability and helpfulness as a therapeutic measure for children and adolescents. However, parents do seem to benefit more than their offsprings, on whom, judged by outcome, the effectiveness seems minor. As to its indication, open questions remain. Taking everything into account it would seem somewhat unjust or premature, to erasure PET from the catalogue of approved measures.
