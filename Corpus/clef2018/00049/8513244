Motor imagery activates the cerebellum regionally. A SPECT rCBF study with 99mTc-HMPAO. Our earlier findings of a cerebellar activation during motor imagery (Brain Res., 535 (1990) 313-317) were made with a technique with low regional resolution. Therefore we could not elucidate the distribution of the cerebellar activation. In the present study the cerebellar regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes during motor imagery (MI) was measured with a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) rCBF method (99mTc-HMPAO) with higher regional resolution during (1) silent counting, and (2) MI (which included silent counting) in 17 normal subjects. Comparing the SPECT results from the two tasks revealed the regional activations during MI. We confirmed that the most pronounced regional activations during MI were found in the cerebellum, especially in its infero-lateral parts on both sides.
