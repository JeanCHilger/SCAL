Bulky mediastinal lymphomas: role of magnetic resonance and SPECT-Ga-67 in the evaluation of residual masses. A residual mediastinal mass is a common finding during and/or after treatment for bulky mediastinal lymphoma and represents a difficult diagnostic problem. For correct therapy modulation, fibrosis must be distinguished from active disease. To assess diagnostic imaging potentials in the characterization of residual masses, 41 patients with bulky mediastinal lymphoma were examined with CT, MRI and Ga67-SPET 92 examinations were performed for each technique: 14 before treatment, 42 during and after chemotherapy, 13 after radiotherapy and 23 six months after the end of treatment. CT provides useful pieces of information on tumor size but fails to depict tissue changes: therefore, only MR and SPET results were considered and compared with clinico-biological and follow-up findings. MRI and SPET were often in agreement with each other (78/92 cases) and with clinical data (98.7%)
