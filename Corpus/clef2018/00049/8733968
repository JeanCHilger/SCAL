Preoperative grading of glioma malignancy with thallium-201 single-photon emission CT: comparison with conventional CT. To compare thallium-201 single-photon emission CT with conventional CT in grading the malignancy of gliomas and to determine the reliability of each in tumor assessment.We studied 37 patients who had gliomas (31 high grade and 6 low grade) and compared the CT findings with the thallium-201 index, which we defined as tumor uptake relative to the uptake in the contralateral hemisphere.Among the high-grade gliomas, we observed a significant correlation between breakdown volume of the blood-brain barrier and thallium-201 uptake. However, 8 of the high-grade gliomas had low thallium-201 uptake, in the same range as the low-grade gliomas. Of these, 2 were nonenhancing and the other 6 showed ring enhancement on CT scans. Analysis of variance showed no significant difference in thallium-201 indexes between low-grade gliomas and highly malignant (grade II-III) gliomas. Accuracy of thallium-201 imaging was lower (78%) than that of CT (84%) in identifying high-grade gliomas.Damage to the blood-brain barrier is a prerequisite for uptake of thallium-201 in gliomas. Tumors with central necrotic areas and moderate ring enhancement tend to be underestimated when evaluated by means of thallium-201 scintigraphy. The results indicate a need for caution when interpreting findings on images obtained with thallium-201 single-photon emission CT in preoperative evaluation of brain tumors.
