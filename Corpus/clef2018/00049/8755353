Neuroimaging techniques in the Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. Tourette's syndrome (GdT) is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder of unclear etiology characterized clinically by the presence of motor and phonic tics as well as a variety of behavioral and cognitive abnormalities such as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (TOC) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Dopaminergic pathway and movement control related structures may have some implications for pathogenesis. Neuroimaging techniques may yield relevant data for a better understanding of the symptoms and physiopathology of this disease. Among them, functional isotopic techniques such as PET and SPECT and other like quantitative EEG are the most remarkable. In this article we intend to perform a thorough review of the most recent literature, contributing with our own experience and discuss the pathogenesis of GdT.
