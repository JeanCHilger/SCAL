Clinical outcome of patients with an uncomplicated myocardial infarction: effect of revascularization. In 80 patients (pts) with an uncomplicated myocardial infarction (MI) the rate of major cardiac events (MACE) including cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and recurrent ischemia requiring hospitalization was prospectively assessed over a mean follow-up period of 17 +/- 9 months and related to clinical, angiographic and scintigraphic findings, the latter obtained from adenosine Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT imaging. Decision for revascularization was mainly based on angiographic data and was carried out in a total of 50 patients (angioplasty in 34 pts and cardiac surgery in 16 pts). The overall MACE rate was 24% with a mortality and myocardial infarction rate of 4% and 5%, respectively. Early (< 2 months) revascularization seemed to have a beneficial effect on clinical outcome as was suggested by the following findings: 1) Cardiac events (MACE) were not significantly different in patients with versus without revascularization (MACE 24% versus 23%) although the former constituted a subgroup at higher risk for ischemic events because of a more extensive coronary artery disease state. 2) In the subset of patients with at least one significant coronary artery stenosis the clinical outcome was significantly better in those who were revascularized than in those who underwent no revascularization (MACE 24% vs 47%, p < 0.05. Among a variety of factors, including the scintigraphic and angiographic extent of coronary artery disease and post-MI treatment strategy, multivariate analysis selected hypercholesterolemia (> 240 mg%) as the only independent predictor of MACE with a more than fourfold increase in risk for development of MACE. These data suggest that the natural history, especially the rate of recurrent ischemic events, can be favourably changed by an elective and early revascularization, strategically oriented by the results of the angio-graphic study. Furthermore, our data emphasized the deleterious role of hypercholesterolemia on clinical outcome in patients with a recent MI.
