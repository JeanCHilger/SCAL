Striatal D2 receptor binding in sleep bruxism: a controlled study with iodine-123-iodobenzamide and single-photon-emission computed tomography. The neurochemical mechanisms underlying sleep bruxism are little understood at present. However, recent pharmacologic evidence suggests that the central dopaminergic system may be involved in the pathophysiology of sleep bruxism. This possibility was further assessed by means of functional neuroimaging of dopamine D2 receptors with single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT). Ten controls and ten patients with polysomnographically confirmed sleep bruxism were injected intravenously with 185 MBq (5 mCi) iodine-123-iodobenzamide, a specific D2 receptor antagonist radioligand, and data acquisition was performed 90 min post-injection. Following image reconstruction, it was found that striatal D2 receptor binding potential (basal ganglia/background ratio) did not differ significantly between bruxism patients and controls. However, side-to-side differences between unilateral values of the striatal D2 binding potential ("highest side" values minus "lowest side" values) were significantly larger for the bruxism patients (p < 0.001, by two-independent-samples t test with pooled variances). It was concluded that an abnormal side imbalance in striatal D2 receptor expression can be associated with sleep bruxism. This reinforces the possibility that the central dopaminergic system plays a role in the pathophysiology of this disorder.
