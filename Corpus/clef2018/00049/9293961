Myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism in diabetes mellitus. Recent studies at our institution using positron emission tomography (PET) provide evidence that both myocardial blood flow (MBF) and glucose metabolism may be affected in patients with diabetes mellitus. A retrospective study revealed inadequate myocardial glucose uptake as assessed by 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18FDG) in 64% of type I (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, IDDM) and 36% of type II (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, NIDDM) patients. However, a study in 7 patients with IDDM and 9 controls showed that metabolic standardization using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp is associated with similar myocardial glucose uptake in both groups (0.43 +/- 0.16 vs 0.44 +/- 0.12 micromol/g per min p = nonsignificant). Furthermore, we studied MBF as assessed by [13N]ammonia in 15 IDDM patients without coronary artery disease. We found an impairment in flow reserve in diabetic patients as compared with a control group of 13 healthy volunteers (2.6 +/- 1.3 vs 4.0 +/- 0.6
