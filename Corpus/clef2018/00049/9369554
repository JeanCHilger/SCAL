Peritoneal equilibration test and its operation on CAPD patients. In order to observe the transport ability of peritoneum to small molecular substances, peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was performed in 52 CAPD patients. By analysing the relationship between peritoneal transport function and dialysis adequacy, we found the average urea KT/V and Cr were significantly lower in high and low transport groups (n = 6 and n = 2) than in high average and low average groups (n = 35 and n = 9). According to the results of PET, we adjusted the dialysis program of 11 patients and the dialysis adequacy was markedly improved. We concluded that PET was helpful for selecting and adjusting CAPD program, and discussed some questions which should be payed more attention in PET operation.
