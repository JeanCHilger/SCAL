123I-MIBG lung uptake in patients with diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this study is to clarify the relationship between 123I-MIBG lung uptake and silent myocardial ischemia (SMI), cardiac autonomic neuropathy (AN) or clinical characteristics. For the quantitative analysis, lung to upper mediastinum uptake ratio (L/M) and heart to upper mediastinum uptake ratio (H/M) were obtained from chest planar image. In addition, both lung washout ratio (%WR-L) and heart washout ratio (%WR-H) were calculated from early and delayed images. Each indices were compared in both diabetic and control groups. Mean values of H/M in diabetes with complication were significantly lower than those of control group. Particularly, AN(+)SMI(+) group showed lowest value. Similarly, mean values of %WR-H in diabetes with complication were significantly higher than those of control group and AN(+)SMI(+) group showed highest value. Although mean value of L/M in each diabetic group was significantly higher than that of control group, there was no statistical significance among each diabetes except AN(+)SMI(-) group on early image. Mean value of %WR-L in AN(+) or SMI(+) group was also significantly higher than that of control group, but there was no statistical significance among each diabetic group. The current study suggested that high pulmonary 123I-MIBG uptake in diabetes was independent of the complication of SMI or AN. Pulmonary endothelial dysfunction related with severity of diabetes mellitus was considered to be the most important factor.
