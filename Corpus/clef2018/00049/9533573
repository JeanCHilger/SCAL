Implementation of a model-based nonuniform scatter correction scheme for SPECT. In this paper four scatter-compensation schemes are considered. The four schemes are all based on a previously developed two-dimensional (2-D) scatter model. Reconstruction is achieved using the iterative expectation-maximization maximum-likelihood (EM-ML) algorithm. The schemes consist of: 1) including the model in both the forward and back projector 2) just including the model in the forward projector
