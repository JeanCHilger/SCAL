First-pass cerebral extraction of benzamide-derivative radiotracers for SPECT. Central dopaminergic receptors are widely studied for their importance in the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric diseases. We have investigated the cerebral delivery kinetics of three dopaminergic ligands in rats through the use of an indicator fractionation method to measure the tracer's regional influx rate constant with respect to regional blood flow. The aim is to collect the in vivo kinetic parameters of the radioligand cerebral distribution, which are necessary if, dealing with SPECT and "trapped" tracers, one wishes to analyse data using a graphical approach.
