Toxicity, mutagenicity, and behavioral effects of beta-CIT, a ligand for dopamine transporter exploration by SPECT. The cocaine analog beta-CIT is one of the most used compounds for SPET examination of the dopamine transporter in drug abuse and Parkinson's disease. However, the toxicity of this agent has not yet been studied. We report here acute toxicity, mutagenicity, and effect on locomotor activity of beta-CIT. Acute toxicity experiments were performed in mice and rats. The LD50 values were about 20 mg and 5 mg for mice and rats, respectively. There was no sex difference. The mutagenicity was evaluated using the Ames' test. No mutagenic effect was observed for beta-CIT. Effects on locomotor activity were measured in mice using the open-field test. beta-CIT increased locomotion (+65%) when injected at a dose of 0.312 mg/kg the maximal increase (+205%) was observed at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg
