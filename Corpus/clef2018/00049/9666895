Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of repeatedly extruded polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The paper deals with gel permeation chromatography (GPC) monitoring of the behaviour of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) after repeated extrusions. Virgin PET was submitted to three successive extrusion/drying cycles and then the samples were swelled with hexafluoroisopropanol and treated with chloroform. GPC analysis was carried out at room temperature on a B.C.S. Serial LC 2000 GPC system equipped with a series of four GPC columns with UV detection at 254 nm and chloroform as eluent. GPC results showed that after each extrusion step the molecular weight distribution of the PET was different and Mw, Mn and Mz decreased. These findings suggest that during each extrusion degradation occurs and that repeated extrusions, as in the case of the recycling PET, may cause an alteration of the molecular weight distribution of the original PET.
