Scintigraphic imaging of renal function. Scintigraphic imaging of renal physiology can be achieved by gamma camera planar imaging, single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET). Physiological information about the kidney usually requires dynamic imaging, although for some applications imaging may be static. Individual kidney renal blood flow can be measured from dynamic gamma camera imaging, although with PET it is possible to measure regional renal perfusion. Measurement of individual kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is performed routinely with Tc-99m-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), but information about GFR on a regional basis, and measurement of regional filtration fraction, require PET. Manoeuvres which interfere with renal physiology, such as captopril renography, may also yield useful diagnostic information.
