Determination of behavioural traits of pure-bred dogs using factor analysis and cluster analysis a comparison of studies in the USA and UK. The questionnaire survey of Hart and Hart (1985, Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association 186, 1811-1815) ranked the 56 most popular breeds of dog in the USA on 13 behavioural traits and is compared here with results of a similar survey conducted on the 49 most popular breeds in the UK. Of the 36 breeds in common between the studies, 24 were similar for the traits aggressivity, reactivity and ease of housetraining between the two countries. However, the characteristics of nine breeds (Airedale Terrier, Old English Sheepdog, Welsh Corgi, Irish Setter, Standard Poodle, Beagle, Samoyed, Boxer, Dalmatian) differed markedly between the two countries, and a further three (Chihuahua, Scottish Terrier, Standard Dachshund) showed smaller, but probably meaningful, shifts. These differences should be recognised when giving advice to prospective owners, and when treating unwanted behaviour in these breeds.
