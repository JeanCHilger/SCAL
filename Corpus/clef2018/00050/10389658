Application of positron emission tomography to determine cerebral glucose utilization in conscious infant monkeys. Cerebral glucose metabolism has been used as a marker of cerebral maturation and neuroplasticity. In studies addressing these issues in young non-human primates, investigators have used positron emission tomography (PET) and [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) to calculate local cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (1CMRG1c). Unfortunately, these values were influenced by anesthesia. In order to avoid this confounding factor, we have established a method that permits reliable measurements in young conscious vervet monkeys using FDG-PET. Immature animals remained in a conscious, resting state during the initial 42 min of FDG uptake as they were allowed to cling to their anesthetized mothers. After FDG uptake, animals were anesthetized and placed in the PET scanner with data acquisition beginning at 60 min post-FDG injection. FDG image sets consisted of 30 planes separated by 1.69 mm, parameters sufficient to image the entire monkey brain. Our method of region-of-interest (ROI) analysis was assessed within and between raters and demonstrated high reliability (P < 0.001). To illustrate that our method was sensitive to developmental changes in cerebral glucose metabolism, quantitative studies of young conscious monkeys revealed that infant monkeys 6-8 months of age exhibited significantly higher 1CMRG1c values (P < 0.05) in all regions examined, except sensorimotor cortex and thalamus, compared to monkeys younger than 4 months of age. This method provided high resolution images and 1CMRG1c values that were reliable within age group. These results support the application of FDG-PET to investigate questions related to cerebral glucose metabolism in young conscious non-human primates.
