Eye-head coordination abnormalities and regional cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer's disease. 1. Three patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and three healthy controls (HC) were examined for eye-head coordination. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in AD patients. 2. Eye-head coordination was analyzed using a Vision analyzer, and magnetic sensors. The authors measured the rCBF with 123I-IMP, and 99mTc-ECD SPECT. 3. AD reduced gaze accuracy and head movements, and prolonged the latency of saccade as compared to HC. AD patients had a tendency to focus on the target by using eye movements only. 4. AD reduced the rCBF in the inferior parietal part and the visual area, relative to the motor area. Damage of these areas may have caused the eye-head coordination disorders in the AD patients.
