On-line measurement of exhaled [11C]CO2 during PET. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a system for the continuous on-line measurement of expired 11CO2 during 11C PET studies.A detector system was developed that allowed continuous sampling of expired air during PET. Healthy volunteers (n = 4) underwent PET with [11C]CO2 during which expired air, tomographic tissue activity, and blood data were collected. The measured expired-air 11CO2 radioactivity time courses were filtered, and an envelope was extracted and compared with the time course of 11CO2/H11CO3 in blood.Good agreement was found between the shapes of the expired-air envelope and the time course in blood, enabling quantitative calibration against discrete blood samples.A system for the continuous monitoring of expired radioactivity during PET has been developed and evaluated with [11C]CO2. This monitoring enables the quantitative continuous measurement of 11CO2/H11CO3- in blood.
