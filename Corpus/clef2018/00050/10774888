Influence of drugs on myocardial iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake in rabbit myocardium. About 15 years ago, iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial imaging was introduced for the evaluation of myocardial sympathetic nerve function. Two uptake mechanisms for MIBG have so far been identified: uptake type I, a saturable, energy-dependent mechanism, and uptake type II, a non-saturable, energy-independent mechanism. We incubated isolated rabbit myocardial tissue samples with 123I-MIBG in order to assess the uptake characteristics and the influence of varying incubation conditions. Furthermore, we examined the effects of several drugs and uptake inhibitors on the myocardial uptake of MIBG. The in vitro myocardial uptake of MIBG reached a steady plateau at 23.87%+/-3.63% after 1 h, i.e. a concentration gradient of 10, in a thermo-independent manner within a concentration range from 1.5 to 1500 microM. This indicates an unsaturable uptake process in the tested concentrations. Preincubation with the following drugs caused a significant inhibitory effect on myocardial MIBG uptake: haloperidol, levomepromazine, metoprolol, labetalol and clomipramine. According to our findings, the uptake mechanism seems to be an unspecific process, but the concentration gradient of 10 makes passive diffusion unlikely. Further studies with uptake-II-blocking substances as well as with isolated myocardial cells will be needed to clarify the nature of the myocardial MIBG uptake mechanism.
