An endogenous circadian rhythm of respiratory control in humans. Many physiological and behavioural functions have circadian rhythms - endogenous oscillations with a period of approximately 24 h that can occur even in the absence of sleep. We determined whether there is an endogenous circadian rhythm in breathing, metabolism and ventilatory chemosensitivity in humans. Ten healthy, adult males were studied throughout 4 days in a stable laboratory environment. After two initial baseline days (16 h wakefulness plus 8 h sleep) that served to achieve a steady state, subjects were studied under constant behavioural and environmental conditions throughout 41 h of wakefulness. Ventilation, metabolism and the magnitude of the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) were measured every 2 h. Individuals' data were aligned according to circadian phase (core body temperature minimum CBTmin) and averaged. In the group average data, there was a significant and large amplitude circadian variation in HCVR slope (average of +/-0.4 l min-1 mmHg-1
