Imaging the 5-HT(1A) receptors with PET: WAY-100635 and analogues. This paper summarizes our work on WAY-100635 and analogues, labeled either with carbon-11 or fluorine-18, as potential radioligands for the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT(1A)) neuroreceptors. Other facets of our work include: (1) human studies with [O-methyl-(11)C]WAY-100634, the major radioactive metabolite of [O-methyl-(11)C]WAY-100635, and with [(11)C]CPC 222 (2) use of a human liver metabolism model to screen in vitro potential metabolic problems in humans
