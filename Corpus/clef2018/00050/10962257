PET evaluation of [(18)F]FCWAY, an analog of the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, WAY-100635. We synthesized [(18)F]FCWAY, an analog of [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635 ¿[(11)C]N-(2-(1-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-piperazinyl)ethyl))-N-(2-(pyridi nyl))cyclohexanecarboxamide¿, by replacing the cyclohexanecarbonyl group acid with a trans-4-fluorocyclohexanecarbonyl group (FC). Control and preblocking studies were performed in anesthetized monkeys. Plasma radioactive metabolite analysis showed the presence of [(18)F]FC and [(18)F]fluoride. Tissue time-radioactivity curves were corrected for metabolite contamination based on separate positron-emission tomography studies of these two labeled metabolites. Analysis using a two-tissue compartment model gave distribution volume (V) estimates (mL/mL) ranging from 33 in frontal cortex to 4 in cerebellum. Preblocking data showed uniform V of 2-3 mL/mL. These studies demonstrate that [(18)F]FCWAY has very similar kinetic characteristics to [(11)C]WAY-100635.
