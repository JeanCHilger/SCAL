Epilepsy surgery in infancy. Surgery for intractable epilepsy is being offered at progressively younger ages, including infancy. The most common causes of catastrophic epilepsy in very young surgical candidates are focal malformations of cortical development and low-grade tumors. Additional causes include Sturge-Weber syndrome, epidermal nevus syndrome, hemimegalencephaly, and prenatal or perinatal infarction. Many infants manifest with focal seizures, whereas some patients have infantile spasms in the setting of a focal epileptogenic lesion. Video electroencepholography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography are critical investigations to explore surgical options. In small series, the percentage of infants free of seizures after surgery was in the range of 60%. This is similar to that seen after epilepsy surgery in older children, adolescents, and adults. However, larger series with long-term follow up will be important. Furthermore, the extensive procedures required in infants for removal of the epileptogenic developmental lesions entail some risk, and should not be offered in the absence of severe epilepsy. Most infant candidates for epilepsy surgery have significant developmental delay. Few data are available, but anecdotal experience suggests that surgical relief of catastrophic epilepsy may result in resumption of developmental progression. For each infant, the timing of surgery must be carefully considered based on full assessment of the relative risks and benefits, derived from a detailed presurgical evaluation.
