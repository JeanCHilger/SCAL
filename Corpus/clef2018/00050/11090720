6-(18)F-DOPA PET study in patients with schizophrenia. Positron emission tomography. Presynaptic dopamine metabolism was studied in a group of patients with schizophrenia and in an age- and gender-matched normal control group using 6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-DOPA ((18)F-DOPA) and positron emission tomography (PET). Nineteen patients, nine drug-free, 10 on neuroleptics, and 13 normal control subjects underwent PET scans using (18)F-DOPA. The neuroleptic-treated patients were taking typical neuroleptics (N=4) or the atypical neuroleptic, clozapine (N=6). The ratio of specific/non-specific activity was calculated for eight cortical and subcortical regions of interest. Medication-free patients had a significant reduction in (18)F-DOPA uptake in the ventral striatum (P=0.04) and significantly increased uptake in the posterior cingulate (P=0.02) compared with normal control subjects. The 18F-DOPA PET technique proved to be useful and sensitive in detecting changes in dopamine metabolism in patients with schizophrenia in vivo. The results of this study provide evidence of an aberrant dopamine system in schizophrenia.
