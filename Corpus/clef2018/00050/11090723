Regional cerebral blood flow after recovery from bulimia nervosa. When ill, women with bulimia nervosa (BN) show alterations of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). In this study we investigated rCBF in nine women in long-term recovery from BN (RBN, n=9), i.e. more than 1 year without bingeing/purging behavior, normal weight, stable food intake, and regular menses, and compared them with age-matched healthy control women (CW, n=13). Positron emission tomography (PET) was used for the assessment of rCBF. There were no significant differences in rCBF between groups. However, rCBF was significantly inversely related to length of recovery in RBN for the left and right prefrontal cortex (BA 10), right medial orbital frontal cortex (BA 11), left subgenual cingulate (BA 25), right anterior cingulate (BA 32), left sensory motor cortex (BA 1,2,3,4), left and right lateral temporal (BA 21), and left occipital cortex (BA 17), as well as left thalamus. This finding suggests that previously reported alterations in rCBF during the ill state of BN may be a state-related phenomenon that remits with recovery. It is also possible that reductions in rCBF occur in a later stage of recovery from BN.
