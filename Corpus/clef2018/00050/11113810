Evaluation of microvascular bone graft reconstruction of the head and neck with 3-D 99mTc-DPD SPECT scans. We conducted a prospective investigation to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of computer-aided 3-dimensional (3-D) technetium 99m dicarboxypropane methylene diphosphonate ((99m)Tc-DPD) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) reconstruction in the evaluation of microvascular bone flaps used for maxillofacial reconstruction.Twenty patients who received 20 autogenous microvascular bone flaps for reconstruction of the mandible and maxilla were evaluated. Forty bone scans with subsequent computer-aided reconstruction were performed. Each graft could be assessed within 48 to 72 hours after surgery. The second bone scan was performed between 12 and 14 days after surgery.Complications were observed in 5 grafts. SPECT investigation performed at the 2 time points after reconstruction showed a significantly higher tracer uptake in grafts with an uncomplicated further course than in those that developed complications.Computer-aided 3D (99m)Tc-DPD SPECT reconstruction serves as a useful prognostic tool and helps in the very early recognition of complications. This technique adds significantly to the value of planar bone scintigraphy and conventional SPECT images.
