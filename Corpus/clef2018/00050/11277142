Surgical resection for pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer. Isolated pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer are rare. The present study reports on the 15-year experience of the Royal Prince Alfred Unit and discusses means of improving survival outcomes.This was a retrospective review, over a 15-year period, of 41 patients who had resectable pulmonary metastases of colorectal origin.Most were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Seventy-two per cent had solitary metastases. The most common procedure performed was a lobectomy. Median follow up was 21 months. Five-year survival was 24%. There were no significant prognostic indicators except for the ability to achieve clear surgical margins.Morbidity and mortality have not altered significantly over time. But an improved selection process such as the use of preoperative positron emission tomography will potentially improve survival outcomes.
