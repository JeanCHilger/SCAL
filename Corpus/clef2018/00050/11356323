A comparative study of Powell's and Downhill Simplex algorithms for a fast multimodal surface matching in brain imaging. Multimodal images registration can be very helpful for diagnostic applications. However, even if a lot of registration algorithms exist, only a few really work in clinical routines. We developed a method based on surface matching and compared two minimization algorithms: Powell's and Downhill Simplex. We studied the influence of some factors (chamfer map computation, number and order of parameters to determine, minimization criteria) on the final accuracy of the algorithm. Using this comparison, we improved some processing steps to allow a clinical use, and selected the simplex algorithm which presented the best results.
