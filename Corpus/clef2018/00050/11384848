Computer-assisted drug development (CADD): an emerging technology for designing first-time-in-man and proof-of-concept studies from preclinical experiments. Computer-assisted drug development (CADD) is an emerging technology for accelerating drug development based on the integration of mathematical modelling and simulation. This methodology provides a knowledge-based decisional tool on alternative development strategies based on the evaluation of potential risks on drug safety, and the definition of experimental design of new trials with expected power and probability of success. An example of CADD implementation is presented to design the first-time-in-man (FTIM) and the proof-of-concept (PoC) study of a new CNS compound. The final objective of the example presented is not necessarily to supply a success story of a correct prediction of human data from animal studies but to define a credible strategy suitable to design FTIM and PoC studies using preclinical data without the support of any human in vivo information. Rhesus monkey and human PK were initially estimated using allometric scaling on data collected in dogs, cynomolgus monkeys and rats. A PK/PD model was derived from a study conducted in rodent and validated by comparing the model predicted response to the one observed in a PET experiment conducted in rhesus monkey. The final PK/PD model, incorporating potential variability and uncertainty on scaled human prediction together with a receptor affinity adjustment derived from in vitro binding studies, was used to design the first-time-in-man and the proof-of-concept study.
