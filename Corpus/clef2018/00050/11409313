Effects of electrical stimulation of the Gasserian ganglion on regional cerebral blood flow after induced subarachnoid hemorrhage in pigs evaluated by 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT. It could be demonstrated that cervical spinal cord stimulation increases cerebral blood flow. The effects of electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion in the acute phase of SAH in pigs were investigated. The experiments were carried out on 11 domestic pigs divided in two groups (group I: SAH [n = 5] group II: SAH and trigeminal stimulation [n = 6]). In all animals a native SPECT was performed. The Gasserian ganglion was exposed for inserting the stimulation electrode. SAH was induced by injecting 10 ml autologous blood through a catheter placed in the suprasellar cistern. 30 minutes after SAH-induction electrical stimulation was started for two hours in group II (2.8-4.5 V, 50 Hz, 300 microseconds). 99mTc-HMPAO (400-540 MBq) was injected intravenously 110 minutes later. In group I 99mTc-HMPAO was applied after the same time interval. 80 minutes later SPECT was performed. Data were processed to calculate the uptake of radioactivity (%/kg tissue weight). The mean values were calculated for the different groups: native animal examination (%/kg tissue weight): 0.6343
