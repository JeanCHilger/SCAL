Is amygdalohippocampectomy really selective in medial temporal lobe epilepsy? A study using positron emission tomography with (18)fluorodeoxyglucose. Selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SAH) is a surgical technique effective for the treatment of medial temporal lobe epilepsy, which selectively removes the epileptogenic hippocampus and amygdala but spares the temporal neocortex. However, the benefit of SAH in terms of functional outcome is debated. In this study, we aimed to assess the metabolic consequences of SAH.Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) studies were performed in nine patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy associated with hippocampal sclerosis before and after SAH. Regions of interest were delineated on MRIs and then replaced on PET images using an automatic 3D image registration. We calculated absolute metabolic rates of glucose and normalized metabolic values in each region of interest.The comparison between preoperative and postoperative metabolic values showed a statistically significant worsening of the hypometabolism on the ipsilateral temporal pole on the superior and the hippocampal levels (p < 0.05 and 0.0045, respectively). A postoperative increase of the metabolic activity also was noted in the contralateral anterior hippocampus (p < 0.05) and the orbitofrontal cortex bilaterally (p < 0.002 and 0.001, respectively)SAH functional benefit is controversial. SAH worsened significantly the hypometabolism of a temporal structure that was not surgically removed (i.e., the temporal pole), and it improved postoperatively the metabolic activity in the contralateral hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex. Whether this postoperative improvement is linked to the selectivity of the surgical procedure must be further clarified.
