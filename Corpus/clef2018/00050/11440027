Technetium-99m sestamibi imaging to predict left ventricular ejection fraction outcome after revascularisation in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction: comparison between baseline and nitrate-enhanced imaging. Acceptance of technetium-99m sestamibi as a tracer of myocardial viability is growing, particularly when nitrate-enhanced imaging is used. However, few data are available on the ability of 99mTc-sestamibi to predict the evolution of global left ventricular ejection fraction (EF). The aim of this study was to examine the ability of resting and nitrate 99mTc-sestamibi single-photon emission tomography (SPET) to predict EF changes after revascularisation in patients who have chronic coronary artery disease with left ventricular dysfunction. Using baseline resting and nitrate 99mTc-sestamibi SPET, we studied 61 patients scheduled for revascularisation because of left ventricular dysfunction. EF was estimated using two-dimensional echocardiography before and after the intervention. A post-revascularisation improvement of > or =5 EF units was defined as significant. Using a 13-segment model, 99mTc-sestamibi activity was quantified and the nitrate-induced activity changes calculated. Three different criteria for detecting viability (defined as post-revascularisation reversible dysfunction) in asynergic segments were compared: (1) resting 99mTc-sestamibi activity > or =60% (2) nitrate 99mTc-sestamibi activity > or =65%
