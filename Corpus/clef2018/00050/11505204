FDG PET for evaluating the change of glucose metabolism in prostate cancer after androgen ablation. In the clinical study of prostate cancer, the effect of androgen ablation on glucose metabolism in cancer tissue has not been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the change in glucose utilization due to endocrine therapy for prostate adenocarcinoma. Ten patients with histologically proven prostate cancer were prospectively investigated with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography (FDG PET) prior to and after the initiation of endocrine therapy. FDG uptake was calculated to measure glucose utilization in cancer tissue. The change in FDG accumulation was compared with changes in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level and prostate size. FDG accumulation in the prostate decreased in all patients 1-5 months after the initiation of hormone therapy. The serum PSA level and prostate size measured on computerized tomography (CT) also decreased in these periods. A decrease in FDG accumulation was also demonstrated in metastatic sites. In this study, there appeared to be a decrease in FDG uptake in prostate cancer after endocrine therapy not only in primary prostate cancer lesions but also at metastatic sites, suggesting that the glucose utilization by tumours was suppressed by androgen ablation.
