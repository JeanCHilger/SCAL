Synthesis and properties of 18F-labeled potential myocardial blood flow tracers. PET centers without particle accelerators make clinical PET widely available at reduced cost. For myocardial perfusion tracers, these satellite PET centers are limited to generator- produced 82Rb(+) and 62Cu[PTSM]. Their limitations motivate a search for transportable alternatives. In search of new tracers we have synthesized several 18F-labeled amines and quaternary ammonium salts. Among them, 4-[18F]fluorotri-N-methylanilinium ([18F]FTMA) has flow-tracing properties. The compound is functional, but has properties that justify a continued search.
