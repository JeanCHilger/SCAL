Measurement of the striatal dopamine transporter density and heterogeneity in type 1 alcoholics using human whole hemisphere autoradiography. Dopaminergic mechanisms are involved in the positive reinforcing and addicting effects of alcohol. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission tomography (SPET) studies have indicated alterations in striatal dopamine transporters (DAT) and in presynaptic dopamine (DA) function in alcoholics, although also contradictory results have been reported. Normal variations in blood flow, metabolism, and receptor densities are apparently important to brain function. Such variations are known to decrease during pathophysiological processes, such as epilepsy, whereas normal receptor distributions are broadly heterogenous. We evaluated the densities and heterogeneities of striatal DAT in 8 adult-onset, Cloninger type I alcoholics and 10 controls using [125I]N-(3-iodoprop-2E-enyl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta- (4'-methylphenyl)nortropane ([125I]PE2I) as a ligand for human postmortem whole hemisphere autoradiography, which provided high resolution images of the brain when compared with in vivo PET and SPET. The mean density and heterogeneity of DAT were markedly lower in the alcoholics. A significant linear correlation existed between DAT density and heterogeneity, as well as between DAT densities in the nucleus accumbens and in the dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen) in alcoholics, but not consistently in controls. The observed low DAT density and heterogeneity in the dorsal striatum suggest that type 1 alcoholics may have a dysfunctional DA system. These data indicate that human whole hemisphere autoradiography with the analysis of binding heterogeneity may be a relevant tool to measure pathological processes in the brain.
