A database generator for human brain imaging. Sharing scientific data containing complex information requires new concepts and new technology. NEUROGENERATOR is a database generator for the neuroimaging community. A database generator is a database that generates new databases. The scientists submit raw PET and fMRI data to NEUROGENERATOR, which then processes the data in a uniform way to create databases of homogeneous data suitable for data sharing, met-analysis and modelling the human brain at the systems level. These databases are then distributed to the scientists.
