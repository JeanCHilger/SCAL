Rational synthesis of high nuclearity Mo/Fe/S clusters: the reductive coupling approach in the convenient synthesis of (Cl(4)-cat)(2)Mo(2)Fe(6)S(8)(PR(3))(6) [R = Et, (n)Pr, (n)Bu] and the new [(Cl(4)-cat)(2)Mo(2)Fe(2)S(3)O(PEt(3))(3)Cl]-1/2(Fe(PEt(3))(2)(MeCN)(4)) and (Cl(4)-cat)(2)Mo(2)Fe(3)S(5)(PEt(3))(5) clusters. A general method for the synthesis of high nuclearity Mo/Fe/S clusters is presented and involves the reductive coupling of the (Et(4)N)(2)[(Cl(4)-cat)MoOFeS(2)Cl(2)] (I) and (Et(4)N)(2)[Fe(2)S(2)Cl(4)] (II) clusters. The reaction of I and II with Fe(PR(3))(2)Cl(2) or sodium salts of noncoordinating anions such as NaPF(6) or NaBPh(4) in the presence of PR(3) (R = Et, (n)Pr, or (n)Bu) affords (Cl(4)-cat)(2)Mo(2)Fe(6)S(8)(PR(3))(6) [R = Et (IIIa), (n)Pr (IIIb), (n)Bu (IIIc)], Fe(6)S(6)(PEt(3))(4)Cl(2) (IV) and (PF(6))[Fe(6)S(8)(P(n)Pr(3))(6)] (V) as byproducts. The isolation of (Et(4)N)[Fe(PEt(3))Cl(3)] (VI), NaCl, and SPEt(3) supports a reductive coupling mechanism. Cluster IV and V also have been synthesized by the reductive self-coupling of compound II. The reductive coupling reaction between I and II by PEt(3) and NaPF(6) in a 1:1 ratio produces the (Et(4)N)(2)[(Cl(4)-cat)Mo(L)Fe(3)S(4)Cl(3)] clusters [L = MeCN (VIIa), THF (VIIb)]. The hitherto unknown [(Cl(4)-cat)(2)Mo(2)Fe(2)S(3)O(PEt(3))(3)Cl](+) cluster (VIII) has been isolated as the 2:1 salt of the (Fe(PEt(3))(2)(MeCN)(4))(2+) cation after the reductive self-coupling reaction of I in the presence of Fe(PEt(3))(2)Cl(2). Cluster VIII crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/c with a = 11.098(3) A, b = 22.827(6) A, c = 25.855(6) A, beta = 91.680(4) degrees, and Z = 4. The formal oxidation states of metal atoms in VIII have been assigned as Mo(III), Mo(IV), Fe(II), and Fe(III) on the basis of zero-field Mössbauer spectra. The Fe(PEt(3))(2)(MeCN)(4) cation of VIII is also synthesized independently, isolated as the BPh(4)(-) salt (IX), and has been structurally characterized. The reductive coupling of compound I also affords in low yield the new (Cl(4)-cat)(2)Mo(2)Fe(3)S(5)(PEt(3))(5) cluster (X) as a byproduct. Cluster X crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/n with a = 14.811(3) A, b = 22.188(4) A, c = 21.864(4) A, beta = 100.124(3) degrees, and Z = 4 and the structure shows very short Mo-Fe, Fe-Fe, Mo-S, Fe-S bonds. The oxidation states of the metal atoms in this neutral cluster (X) have been assigned as Mo(IV)Mo(III)Fe(II)Fe(II)Fe(III) based on zero-field Mössbauer and magnetic measurement. All Fe atoms are high spin and two of the three Fe-Fe distances are found at 2.4683(9) A and 2.4721(9) A.
