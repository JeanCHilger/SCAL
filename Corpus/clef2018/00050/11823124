Imaging and quantitation of the hypoxic cell fraction of viable tumor in an animal model of intracerebral high grade glioma using [18F]fluoromisonidazole (FMISO). We have demonstrated that FMISO uptake is significantly higher in tumor tissue in the C6 intracerebral glioma rat model compared to normal brain, and that there is persisting hypoxia in gliomas independent of tumor size. FMISO uptake was observed homogeneously throughout viable glioma tissue in tumor sizes ranging from 2mm to almost 1cm. Quantitation of uptake of FMISO showed a tumor/brain ratio of 1.9 and a tumor/blood ratio of 2.6 at 2 hours post injection.
