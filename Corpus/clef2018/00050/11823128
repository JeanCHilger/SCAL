PET studies of 18F-memantine in healthy volunteers. Previous studies in mice and PET investigations in a Rhesus monkey showed that the regional uptake of 18F-memantine could be blocked by pharmacological doses of memantine and (+)-MK-801. In the present study, the binding characteristics of 18F-memantine was examined in five healthy volunteers. In humans, 18F-memantine was homogeneously distributed in gray matter i.e. cortex and basal ganglia regions, as well as the cerebellum. No radioactive metabolites were detected in plasma during the time-frame of the PET studies. The uptake of 18F-memantine in receptor-rich regions such as striatum and frontal cortex could be well described by a 1-tissue compartment model. The DV" values of all gray matter regions were similar and ranged from 15 to 20 ml/ml. The white matter showed lower DV" values of 15 +/- 1.4 ml/ml. These results suggest that 18F-memantine distribution in human brain does not reflect the regional NMDA receptor concentration, and therefore, this radioligand is not suitable for the PET imaging of the NMDA receptors.
