Presymptomatic detection of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive degeneration of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. More than half of these neurons are lost in a presymptomatic phase of an estimated 4-6 years duration. It is obvious that any type of treatment aimed at slowing down the disease process should preferably be applied in this presymptomatic phase. Presymptomatic detection of PD has therefore become an important goal. In a recent study in a population of 361 asymptomatic first degree relatives of PD patients, we were able to demonstrate that presymptomatic detection is possible by means of a combination of three olfactory processing tasks and [123l] beta-CIT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. These results are a first step towards the development of a screening strategy that may be applied in the general population. Impairments of olfactory function, however, are not specific to PD but are also associated with other neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's disease) and certain lifestyle characteristics (e.g. smoking). In the next few years our research efforts will focus on two different approaches to develop a more specific screening strategy. First, olfactory processing tasks will be combined with tasks aimed at detecting subtle (visuo)motor disturbances and early cognitive impairments. In parallel, an effort will be made to define disease-specific patterns of olfactory dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders.
