Dynamic single-section CT demonstrates reduced cerebral blood flow in acute intracerebral hemorrhage. Optimum blood pressure (BP) management in acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains controversial. BP reduction may limit hematoma expansion, but may also exacerbate ischemia. Reduced regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) has been reported in ICH. Its extent and precise pattern, however, remain uncertain. Dynamic single-section CT perfusion (CTP) is rapid, easily performed and offers superior spatial resolution to PET, SPECT and MRI. It may be the most applicable method for assessing the effects of BP management on rCBF in ICH. We sought to assess whether CTP can identify rCBF abnormalities in acute ICH in 5 patients with ICH who underwent CTP within 24 h of symptom onset. rCBF was measured in serially expanded 2-mm rings around the hematoma and compared with rCBF in the uninvolved hemisphere. Mean time to CTP was 9 h (range 3-23). Mean ICH volume was 25 ml (range 9-64). Perihematoma perfusion was reduced in all patients compared with contralateral hemisphere rCBF. rCBF reduction was most pronounced immediately adjacent to the hematoma (p < 0.05 at 2 mm, p = 0.084 at 4 mm, p > 0.2 at 6 and 8 mm). Perihematoma rCBF increased as a function of the distance from hematoma perimeter. Rate of rCBF increase over distance correlated with time from onset (p = 0.006). We conclude that CTP identifies a rim of reduced rCBF in ICH. A gradient of hypoperfusion appears to extend at least 4 mm beyond the hematoma edge and may be time dependent. Whether reduced CBF is associated with perihematoma ischemia requires additional study.
