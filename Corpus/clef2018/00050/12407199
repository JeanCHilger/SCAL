Dual roles of photosynthetic electron transport in photosystem I biogenesis: light induction of mRNAs and chromatic regulation at post-mRNA level. Light regulation of photosystem I (PSI) biogenesis was studied in a unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. When Chlamydomonas cells were transferred from darkness to the light, mRNAs for both nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded PSI subunits were induced in concert. This light induction was inhibited by photosynthetic electron transport (PET) inhibitors, 3-(3,4 dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea and 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6 isopropyl-p-benzoquinone, but not by an uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. This indicated that PET plays a pivotal role in the light induction of PSI subunit mRNAs, but that photophosphorylation is not necessary. When we irradiated the Chlamydomonas cells with PSI-light (695 nm) or PSII-light (644 nm), which makes the plastoquinone pool oxidative and reductive, respectively, PSII-light caused the accumulation of PSI proteins more abundantly than did PSI-light. However, there was no difference for the PSI subunit mRNA levels between these light sources. From these results, we conclude that PET plays dual roles in the regulation of PSI biogenesis in Chlamydomonas: when cells are illuminated, PET first induces the PSI subunit mRNAs irrespective of the redox state of the intersystem electron carriers, and then their redox state fine-tunes PSI biogenesis at translational and/or post-translational steps to fulfil the chromatic adaptation.
