Acute myocardial infarction: myocardial viability assessment in patients early thereafter comparison of contrast-enhanced MR imaging with resting (201)Tl SPECT. Single photon emission computed tomography. To compare contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with resting thallium 201 ((201)Tl) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for predicting myocardial viability in patients early after acute myocardial infarction.Inversion-recovery contrast-enhanced MR images and resting (201)Tl SPECT images were obtained in 22 patients after acute myocardial infarction. The (201)Tl SPECT images were obtained 4.3 days +/- 0.2 (standard error) after the onset of myocardial infarction. Contrast-enhanced MR imaging was performed 7.9 days +/- 1.6 after (201)Tl SPECT. Transmural extent of hyperenhancement on contrast-enhanced MR images and regional (201)Tl activity were quantitatively analyzed with a 12-segment model. Regional wall thickening on follow-up cine MR images obtained 67 days +/- 17 after contrast-enhanced MR imaging was used as an index for myocardial viability. Statistical analyses were performed with the chi(2) and two-tailed Student t tests.Both contrast-enhanced MR and resting (201)Tl SPECT images showed significant correlations with regional wall thickening on follow-up cine MR images. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of contrast-enhanced MR imaging in the prediction of viable myocardium were significantly higher than those of resting (201)Tl SPECT (98.0% vs 90.3%, P <.01 75.0% vs 54.4%, P <.05Delayed contrast-enhanced MR imaging can help predict myocardial viability as seen on follow-up cine MR images after acute myocardial infarction, with significantly improved sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in comparison with those of resting (201)Tl SPECT.
