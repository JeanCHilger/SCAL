Ambulatory blood pressure and left ventricular mass in older age. The purpose of this study was to analyse the association of ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) to left ventricular mass (LVM) in a population aged over 64 years and to describe the level of ABP in subjects with and without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in older age.ABP measurement and echocardiography for calculation of LVM were assessed in 490 inhabitants (mean age 70.7 years, range 64-87 years) of a small town in southwestern Finland who were able to visit an outpatient clinic. Explanatory factors associated with LVM were assessed with linear regression analysis. LVH was defined as calculated LVM-index values exceeding 150 g/m2 in men and 120 g/m2 in women adopted from the Framingham Study.Systolic ABP was significantly associated with LVM. No correlation between diastolic ABP and LVM was found. Other factors independently related to LVM were gender, body mass index and age. The prevalence of echocardiographic LVH was 22%. Subjects with LVH had markedly higher systolic ABP levels than those without LVH (mean (SD) 24-h ABP: 132(16)/75(8) mmHg vs. 123(13)/75(8) mmHg).Systolic ABP is associated with LVM in older people. In addition, systolic ABP is superior to diastolic ABP in relation to LVM in the aged.
