A higher prevalence of abnormal regional cerebral blood flow in patients with syndrome X and abnormal myocardial perfusion. To test the hypothesis that syndrome X is a systemic vascular disorder, technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer (Tc-99m ECD) brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was used to detect abnormal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 30 patients with syndrome X. These patients were separated into group 1, 20 patients with definite myocardial perfusion defects diagnosed by thallium-201 (Tl-201) myocardial perfusion SPECT and group 2, 10 patients without any myocardial perfusion defects. Tc-99m ECD brain SPECT demonstrated hypoperfusion brain lesions in 95% (19/20) and 20% (2/10) of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively. This difference in the cidence between the two groups was significant. In group 1 and 2 patients, parietal lobes were the most common hypoperfusion areas, while the cerebellum was the least common hypoperfusion area of the brain. Syndrome X is a systemic vascular disorder with a high incidence of hypoperfusion lesions of the brain based on the findings of Tc-99m ECD brain SPECT, and is usually coincident with myocardial defects based on the Tl-201 myocardial perfusion SPECT findings.
