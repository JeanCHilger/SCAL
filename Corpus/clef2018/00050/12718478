Technetium-99m tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography in syndrome X: a preliminary report. Syndrome X is used to describe patients with chest pain and a normal coronary angiogram. We reviewed technetium-99m tetrofosmin (Tc-99m TF) myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) results and clinical data of 43 syndrome X patients and 30 healthy controls with normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no cardiac abnormalities. The Tc-99m TF myocardial perfusion SPECT results showed 12 (27.9%) syndrome X patients had normal myocardial perfusion and 31 (72.1%) had abnormal myocardial perfusion, including 6 (14.0%) patients with fixed defects. 20 (46.5%) patients with transient defects, and 5 (11.6%) patients with reverse defects. The results of exercise ECG were not related to perfusion defects in Tc-99m TF myocardial perfusion SPECT. In contrast, all of the 30 (100.0%) healthy controls had normal myocardial perfusion SPECT results. We conclude that abnormal Tc-99m TF myocardial perfusion SPECT is common in syndrome X and does not correlate well with the exercise ECG. However, further studies with larger case numbers and long term follow up in patients with myocardial events are necessary to support our findings.
