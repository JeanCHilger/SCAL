Enhancing effect of wortmannin on muscarinic stimulation of phospholipase D in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), enhanced carbachol-induced formation of [3H]phosphatidylethanol ([3H]PEt), a marker of phospholipase D (PLD) activity, in [3H]palmitic acid-labeled PC12 cells. The apparent EC50 value was 1.5 microM, and the effect was maximal at 3 microM and slightly attenuated at higher concentration. Wortmannin alone had no significant effect on [3H]PEt formation. The enhancing effect of wortmannin was observed at the initial increasing phase of [3H]PEt formation but not at the subsequent plateau phase. Wortmannin enhanced also phorbol ester-induced PLD activation. Although the precise mechanism remains to be clarified, these results suggest that MLCK may be involved in PLD regulation in PC12 cells.
