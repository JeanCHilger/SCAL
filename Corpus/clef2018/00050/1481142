Alcohol intoxication does not change [11C]cocaine pharmacokinetics in human brain and heart. There is increasing evidence that the combined use of cocaine and alcohol produces enhanced behavioral and toxic effects. We have used PET and tracer doses of [11C]cocaine in 7 normal human volunteers to assess if the distribution and clearance of cocaine are altered by alcohol intoxication. Each subject received 2 PET studies with [11C]cocaine (3-11 micrograms), one before and one during alcohol intoxication (1 g/kg). Regions of interest included the brain (n = 3) and heart (n = 4). Arterial plasma was assayed for unchanged cocaine and for labeled cocaethylene, a metabolite of cocaine found in individuals using cocaine and alcohol in combination (Hearn et al., 1991a). Alcohol intoxication did not change uptake and clearance or the steady-state distribution volume of [11C] cocaine in brain (striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum) or in heart. Moreover, labeled cocaethylene was not detected in the 10 minute plasma sample. These results suggest that the acute enhancement of behavior and toxicity associated with the combined use of cocaine and alcohol is not due to an alteration in cocaine's organ distribution or to cocaethylene formation but may be related to an additive effect resulting from the direct actions of each of these drugs.
