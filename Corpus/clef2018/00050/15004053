Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli virulence factors are found to be associated with infantile diarrhea in Brazil. We have previously shown that enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is an important pathogen among Brazilian infants. Most EAEC strains harbor a plasmid (pAA) from which a DNA fragment has been used as a probe (EAEC probe). To better understand the characteristics of EAEC in Brazil, 109 strains carrying and lacking the EAEC probe sequence were tested for the presence of pAA plasmid-borne and chromosomal factors. Common virulence factors of probe-positive and probe-negative isolates included the presence of the Pet, EAST-1, Shf, Irp2, ShET1/Pic, and Hly virulence markers. The presence of AggR or one other virulence factor (AAF/I, AAF/II, AAF/III, or Aap) was predominantly identified only in probe-positive strains. In EAEC probe-positive strains, the virulence marker Aap was found significantly more frequently (P = 0.023) in isolates from children with diarrhea (22%) than in isolates from controls (3%). EAST-1 and Shf were the markers most frequently detected (61%) in EAEC probe-negative strains and were found to be significantly associated with diarrhea (P = 0.003 and P = 0.020, respectively). Furthermore, our data suggest that AggR can be used as an important genetic marker for EAEC probe-positive strains.
