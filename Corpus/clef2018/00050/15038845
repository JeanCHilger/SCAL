Regional differences in blood volume and blood transit time in resting skeletal muscle. We examined regional differences in blood volume and transit time along the length of a resting skeletal muscle by positron emission tomography. In contrast, blood volume didn't change. The blood transit time increased significantly from proximal to distal portions, suggesting that blood flow velocity slows even though there are no changes in blood volume.
