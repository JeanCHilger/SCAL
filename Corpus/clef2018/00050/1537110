Regional myocardial perfusion and glucose metabolism in experimental left bundle branch block. Several authors have reported cases in which 201Tl scintigraphy demonstrated perfusion abnormality in the septum of patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and normal coronary arteriogram. The mechanism of this abnormality, however, remains to be clarified.To determine whether LBBB itself induces abnormal myocardial perfusion and ischemia and to elucidate its mechanism, we used an in vivo animal model. LBBB was induced by right ventricular pacing in 17 open-chest dogs. We examined myocardial perfusion and glucose uptake using 201Tl and 18F-labeled 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. 201Tl activity in the septum was reduced to 74.7 +/- 14.5% of its maximal activity, and mean activity was 86.5 +/- 5.3% in the free wall (p less than 0.05). 18F activity in the septum was also reduced compared with that in the free wall (67.4 +/- 12.1% versus 88.0 +/- 5.2%, p less than 0.05). Regional myocardial blood flow was significantly reduced in the septum compared with the free wall, averaging 0.53 +/- 0.18 ml/min/g versus 0.84 +/- 0.14 ml/min/g, respectively (p less than 0.01). Systolic thickening in the septum was reduced from 1.36 +/- 0.20 to 0.98 +/- 0.04 (p less than 0.01) after the induction of LBBB, and the intramyocardial pressure in the septum in diastolic phase, in which the major flow of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) exists, increased from 26.6 +/- 10.5 to 57.8 +/- 22.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.02). Mean aortic pressure, LAD flow, and lactate extraction rate showed no significant change.LBBB itself may reduce myocardial perfusion and glucose uptake in the septum because of impaired systolic thickening and augmented intramyocardial pressure in the septum however, this is not necessarily related to septal ischemia.
