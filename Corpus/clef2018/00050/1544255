Comparison of Tc-99m HMPAO fast SPECT with Tc-99m HMPAO conventional SPECT in patients with acute stroke. Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT is more likely to detect a stroke in early stages than CT. However, a conventional HMPAO SPECT study takes at least 30 minutes to complete. This paper compares fast Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT scans and conventional Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT scans with respect to spatial resolution and diagnostic efficacy in vitro and in a small series of patients, respectively. The spatial resolution of fast Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT did not match that of images obtained from conventional SPECT, though the difference proved to be of no clinical significance. Since fast SPECT requires only one-fourth to one-fifth the time necessary for conventional SPECT, it may be more suitable for investigating cases of acute stroke in critical clinical situations.
