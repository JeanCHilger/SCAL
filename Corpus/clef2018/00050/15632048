Accuracy of 4 different algorithms for the analysis of tomographic radionuclide ventriculography using a physical, dynamic 4-chamber cardiac phantom. Various automatic algorithms are now being developed to calculate left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction from tomographic radionuclide ventriculography. We tested the performance of 4 of these algorithms in estimating LV and RV volume and ejection fraction using a dynamic 4-chamber cardiac phantom.We developed a realistic physical, dynamic 4-chamber cardiac phantom and acquired 25 tomographic radionuclide ventriculography images within a wide range of end-diastolic volumes, end-systolic volumes, and stroke volumes. We assessed the ability of 4 algorithms (QBS, QUBE, 4D-MSPECT, and BP-SPECT) to calculate LV and RV volume and ejection fraction.For the left ventricle, the correlations between reference and estimated volumes (0.93, 0.93, 0.96, and 0.93 for QBS, QUBE, 4D-MSPECT, and BP-SPECT, respectively all with P < 0.001) and ejection fractions (0.90, 0.93, 0.88, and 0.92, respectivelyCalculation of LV and RV ejection fraction based on tomographic radionuclide ventriculography was accurate for all tested algorithms. All algorithms underestimated LV volume estimation of RV volume seemed more difficult, with different results for each algorithm. The more irregular shape and inclusion of a relatively hypokinetic RV outflow tract in the right ventricle seemed to cause the greater difficulty with delineation of the right ventricle, compared with the left ventricle.
