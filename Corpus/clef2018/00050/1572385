Volume rendering and bicolour scale in double isotope studies: application to immunoscintigraphy and bone landmarking. Combining the volume rendering and bicolour visualization techniques is proposed as an aid in interpreting single photon emission tomography (SPET) immunoscintigraphy (IS) recorded simultaneously with SPET bone landmarking (BL). The combination helps in localizing abnormal monoclonal uptake and in differentiating it from a physiological radioactivity distribution. The so-called rendered images (RIs) are obtained in both IS and BL studies according to a depth- weighted maximum activity projection algorithm. Fused BL and IS RIs are constructed by a simple, pixel by pixel addition. They are displayed using a bicolour grey-red scale, which makes it possible to visualize both studies by a transparency effect. This method was applied to patients suspected of suffering colorectal or ovarian cancer recurrences, in whom monoclonal antibodies against carcinoembryonic antigen, B72-3 or OC125 labelled with indium-111 were used.
