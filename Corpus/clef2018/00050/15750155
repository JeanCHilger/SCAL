Optimized intravenous contrast administration for diagnostic whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT. Standard application of CT intravenous contrast agents in combined PET/CT may lead to high-density artifacts on CT and attenuation-corrected PET. To avoid associated diagnostic pitfalls, we designed and compared different intravenous contrast injection protocols for routine whole-body PET/CT.Whole-body PET/CT included a topogram and a single spiral CT scan (2-row) with or without intravenous contrast, followed by an emission scan. The CT scan was used for attenuation correction of the emission data. Four groups of 10 whole-body PET/CT referrals each were investigated: (A) no intravenous contrast agent, (B) biphasic injection (90 and 50 mL at 3 and 1.5 mL/s, respectively) of intravenous contrast (300 mg/mL iodine) and CT in the craniocaudal direction with a 30-s delay, (C) triple-phase injection (90, 40, and 40 mL at 3, 2, and 1.5 mL/s, respectively) in the craniocaudal direction with a 50-s delay, and (D) dual-phase injection (80 and 60 mL at 3 and 1.5 mL/s, respectively) in the caudocranial direction with a 50-s delay. CT image quality was assessed on a scale from 1 to 3, and CT and attenuation-corrected PET images were reviewed separately for contrast-induced artifacts.Average CT image quality was poorest for protocol A (1.0) but improved to 2.8 when using intravenous contrast agents (protocols B-D). Only protocols B and C resulted in contrast-induced image artifacts that were limited to the thorax. The most homogeneous intravenous contrast enhancement without high-density image artifacts on either CT or PET after CT-based attenuation correction was achieved with protocol D.Dual-phase intravenous contrast injection and CT in the caudocranial direction with a 50-s delay yields reproducible high image quality and is now used routinely for combined diagnostic PET/CT at our hospital.
