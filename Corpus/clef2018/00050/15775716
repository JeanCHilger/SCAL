Cerebral blood flow in Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Alzheimer's disease according to three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection imaging. Regional brain perfusion was analyzed using single-photon emission computed tomography with three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSP) in 69 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), 16 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and 15 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and compared with that in 24 age-equivalent normal subjects. Nondemented PD patients revealed less parietal and frontal flow than controls. With mental impairment, flow reduction extended to other areas including occipital regions. PD with dementia and DLB showed similar reduction patterns, although frontal flow showed a greater reduction in DLB. AD showed little occipital reduction, but a severe parieto-temporal reduction. Thus, 3D-SSP appears to be useful in the detection of cortical lesions and the differential diagnosis of patients with cognitive impairment.
