Paragangliomas: clinical and secretory profile. Result of 39 cases. To define a clinical and secretory profile of paragangliomas extra-adrenal chromaffin tumors.From 1971 throughout 2002, 39 paragangliomas have been observed in 38 patients (22 male, 16 female, average age 41,2 years).Four were located above the diaphragm, 35 were sub-phrenic (6 of the organ of Zuckerkandl), 32 secreted catecholamines, 23 were hypertensive (with only one without hypersecretion of catecholamines). Among 29 (131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scans (MIBG) reviewed, 20 tumors took up the radiopharmaceutical. The treatment was surgical in 35 cases with addition of external radiotherapy and MIBG in one case each two patients died before any treatment. Two patients with persistent disease after surgery were successfully treated by surgery or MIBG. Histologically, 20 were malignant and 17 were seemingly benign. All exclusive dopamine secreting paragangliomas were malignant. Six patients relapsed two of which for a tumor initially classified as benign. The treatment of recurrences was surgical, by MIBG or by external radiotherapy. Nine patients had a family history of chromaffin tumor(s). The genetic survey made in five of these nine patients was positive in all cases.
