High-sensitivity C-reactive protein is associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients. We tested the hypothesis that elevated levels of plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP) are associated with insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia and cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients without insulin treatment. The study group consisted of 17 type 2 diabetic patients with high HSCRP (0.3-1.0 mg/dL age, 59+/-8 years, mean+/-SD
