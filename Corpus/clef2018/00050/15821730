Midbrain dopamine and prefrontal function in humans: interaction and modulation by COMT genotype. Using multimodal neuroimaging in humans, we demonstrate specific interactions between prefrontal activity and midbrain dopaminergic synthesis. A common V(108/158)M substitution in the gene for catecholamine-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an important enzyme regulating prefrontal dopamine turnover, predicted reduced dopamine synthesis in midbrain and qualitatively affected the interaction with prefrontal cortex. These data implicate a dopaminergic tuning mechanism in prefrontal cortex and suggest a systems-level mechanism for cognitive and neuropsychiatric associations with COMT.
