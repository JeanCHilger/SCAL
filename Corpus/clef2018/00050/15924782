Diagnostic value of adenosine (99m)Tc-MIBI myocardial perfusion imaging for detecting coronary artery disease. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of adenosine (99m)Tc-MIBI myocardial perfusion SPECT for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.A total of 89 patients [mean age (57 +/- 9) years,62 men, 27 women] were included in this study. Adenosine was infused intravenously at a rate of 140 microg.kg(-1).min(-1) for 6 minutes. At the end of 3 minute of adenosine infusion, 925MBq of (99m)Tc-MIBI was injected intravenously. SPECT myocardial imaging acquisition was obtained 1 hour after adenosine infusion. Coronary angiography was performed in all patients.Thirty-one patients had significant coronary artery stenosis and 58 had normal coronary angiography. Adenosine myocardial perfusion imaging was abnormal in twenty-two out of the 31 patients with significant coronary artery stenosis (sensitivity, 71%). Fifty-three out of the 58 patients with normal angiography had a normal adenosine myocardial perfusion imaging (specificity, 91%). The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of adenosine (99m)Tc-MIBI myocardial perfusion imaging for detection of coronary artery disease was 81% and 84% respectively.Adenosine myocardial perfusion imaging is probably an accurate method for detecting coronary artery disease.
