Kinetic modeling of amyloid binding in humans using PET imaging and Pittsburgh Compound-B. A valid quantitative imaging method for the measurement of amyloid deposition in humans could improve Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and antiamyloid therapy assessment. Our group developed Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB), an amyloid-binding radiotracer, for positron emission tomography (PET). The current study was aimed to further validate PIB PET through quantitative imaging (arterial input) and inclusion of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Pittsburgh Compound-B studies were performed in five AD, five MCI, and five control subjects and five subjects were retested within 20 days. Magnetic resonance images were acquired for partial volume correction and region-of-interest definition (e.g., posterior cingulate: PCG cerebellum: CER). Data were analyzed using compartmental and graphical approaches. Regional distribution volume (DV) values were normalized to the reference region (CER) to yield DV ratios (DVRs). Good agreement was observed between compartmental and Logan DVR values (e.g., PCG: r=0.89, slope=0.91)
