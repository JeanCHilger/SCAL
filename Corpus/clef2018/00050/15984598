Mite and pet allergen exposure in Brazilian private cars. The role of mite and pet allergens in the development of allergic diseases has been recognized for many years.To determine mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus [Der p 1] and Dermatophagoidesfarinae [Der f 1]), cat (Felis domesticus [Fel d 1]), and dog (Canis familiaris [Can f 1]) allergen levels in Brazilian private cars.Mite, cat, and dog allergens were measured in dust samples collected from 60 upholstered seats of private vehicles using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.Mean levels of Der p 1 (0.24 microg/g of dust range, 0.06-2.05 microg/g of dust) and Der f 1 (0.29 microg/g of dustPrivate cars constitute an important pet, but not mite, allergen reservoir for continuous contamination of the indoor environment. Pet allergens may be present even in cars whose owners do not have pets. Effective measures to reduce allergen exposure in cars should be taken routinely, especially for pet-allergic patients.
