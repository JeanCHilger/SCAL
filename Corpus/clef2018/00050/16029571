Research on clinical characteristics and ATM gene mutations in Chinese patients with ataxia-telangiectasia. To investigate the clinical manifestation and mutation characteristics of ATM gene in Chinese patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT).Sequence variants of the entire coding exons of ATM gene were tested using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and DNA direct sequencing in two Chinese patients clinically diagnosed as AT.The clinical characteristics of two AT patients were progressive cerebellar ataxia with ages at onset of childhood, ocular-cutaneous telangiectasia and recurrent pulmonary infection due to immuno-deficiency the serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) levels were higher than normal, the serum immunoglobin IgA and IgG levels were lower than normalWe have made gene diagnoses for two Chinese AT patients, in which three novel ATM gene mutations were identified.
