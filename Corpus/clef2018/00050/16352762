Advances in positron emission tomographic imaging of lung cancer. Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been established as a useful tool in the management of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and promises to be as valuable in the clinical management of other cancers. PET imaging with FDG allows the assessment of tumor glucose metabolism in vivo however, a number of other PET tracers are being used in oncologic research to assess changes in other cellular processes associated with malignant transformation of the cell. [11C]-Labeled methionine and choline are being used to assess changes in cell membrane synthesis
