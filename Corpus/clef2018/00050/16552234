Advances in imaging head and neck tumours. The intention of this article is to review the recently published studies summarizing new developments in medical imaging for head and neck tumours.Recent technological improvements in imaging have modified the diagnostic approach to these tumours. The main trends can be summarized as follows: improvement in resolution owing to the detection and study of smaller lesions (achieved with magnetic resonance surface coils and parallel imaging) acceleration of data acquisition thus achieving high-quality vascular imagingFinally, new contrast agents have been developed to detect and characterize metastatic lymph nodes, even when they do not match the classical size criteria.
