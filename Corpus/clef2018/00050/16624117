The application of adenosine stress myocardial perfusion tomographic imaging in detecting coronary artery disease. To analyze the sensitivity and specificity of adenosine stress myocardial perfusion tomographic imaging for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD).Adenosine was infused intravenously at a rate of 140 microg.kg(-1).min(-1) for 6 minutes. 3 minutes after adenosine infusion, 925 MBq of (99m)Tc-MIBI were injected intravenously. SPECT myocardial imaging acquisition was obtained 1.5 hours after adenosine infusion. If the result was abnormal, rest myocardial perfusion imaging would be performed next day. Coronary angiography was performed in all patients within one week of myocardial imaging.Total 79 cases [(62 +/- 10) years old, 35 men, 44 women] were included in this study. In the 50 cases of CAD patients confirmed by coronary angiography, 44 patients have positive adenosine (99m)Tc-MIBI myocardial perfusion SPECT. Nineteen out of 29 cases without CAD have negative adenosine myocardial perfusion tomographic imaging. The sensitivity and specificity of adenosine myocardial perfusion tomographic imaging for the diagnosis of CAD were 88.0% and 65.5%. The sensitivity of adenosine myocardial perfusion tomographic imaging for diagnosing coronary stenosis in left anterior descending, left circumflex and right coronary artery are 32/40, 21/27 and 31/32. There was no severe adverse side effect during adenosine stress test.Adenosine stress myocardial perfusion tomographic imaging is an useful non-interventional method for detecting coronary artery disease.
