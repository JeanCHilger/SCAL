Soluble CD14 at 2 yr of age: gender-related effects of tobacco smoke exposure, recurrent infections and atopic diseases. The endotoxin receptor soluble CD14 (sCD14) has been implicated in the 'hygiene hypothesis' suggesting reduced allergic sensitization with bacterial stimulation. However, the relationship between early life sCD14 and allergic diseases is conflicting. We aimed to investigate whether possible risk factors for allergic diseases were associated with sCD14 levels at 2 yr of age. In the nested case-control study of the birth cohort studies 'Environment and Childhood Asthma study in Oslo' 411 children selected with recurrent bronchial obstruction (rBO) (n=241) and no bronchial obstruction (n=170) by 2 yr were investigated with skin prick test and structured parental interview at age 2 yr. Exposure to tobacco smoke, pets and infections was recorded semi-annually by questionnaires (0-2 yr). The sCD14 was analysed from frozen, stored serum by ELISA technique. Regression analyses were performed in all subjects with complete data (n=406, 180 girls), and in girls and in boys separately. Mean sCD14 (ng/ml) was significantly higher among girls 2035 (1973-2096) vs. 1947 (1890-2004) (boys). The sCD14 was significantly reduced among girls exposed to antenatal maternal smoking and with parental asthma, after adjusting for age, parental rhino-conjunctivitis, pet keeping and childhood infections. Recurrent otitis media (OM) increased and common colds significantly decreased sCD14 levels in girls. Boys with atopic dermatitis and rBO had reduced sCD14. Pet exposure was not significantly associated with sCD14. We report novel gender-related effects of sCD14 in early life and suggest that gender, tobacco smoke exposure, age and middle ear disease in particular should be accounted for when assessing the role of sCD14 in childhood allergic diseases.
