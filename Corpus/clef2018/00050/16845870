Role of minimally invasive surgery in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism. The minimally invasive approach to parathyroid surgery is considered an efficient alternative to traditional cervicotomy when the pre-operative diagnostic work-up indicates a single parathyroid adenoma. Imaging techniques (ultrasound, SPECT), on the one hand, and intraoperative diagnostic techniques (radio-guided surgery, intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay), on the other, contribute to the success and development of specialized centres which prefer to use this type of surgery. The postoperative pain control and aesthetic results achieved with these techniques are today the main subjects of interest in the minimally invasive approach.
