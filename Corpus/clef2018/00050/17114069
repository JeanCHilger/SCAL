Head and neck cancer: how imaging predicts treatment outcome. Sophisticated imaging methods, such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, play an increasingly important role in the management of head and neck cancer. Pretreatment imaging findings have predictive value for patient outcome, independently from the currently used TNM classification, and may be used to tailor treatment to the individual patient. Based on per-treatment imaging, individualised replanning during radiotherapy may ameliorate tumour control rates and reduce toxic effects to normal tissues. Early posttreatment imaging studies contain important prognostic information, and allow selection of patients for further treatment or watchful waiting.
