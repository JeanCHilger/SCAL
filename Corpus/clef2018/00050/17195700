Sporadic campylobacter infection in infants: a population-based surveillance case-control study. Campylobacter is an important cause of foodborne illness in infants (younger than 1 year of age), but little is known about the sources of infection in this age group.Eight sites in the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) participated in a 24-month population-based case-control study conducted in 2002-2004. Cases were infants with laboratory-confirmed Campylobacter infection ascertained through active laboratory surveillance, and controls were infants in the community.We enrolled 123 cases and 928 controls. Infants 0-6 months of age with Campylobacter infection were less likely to be breast-fed than controls [odds ratio (OR) 0.2Several unique protective and risk factors were identified among infants, and these risk factors vary by age, suggesting that prevention measures be targeted accordingly. Breast-feeding was protective for the youngest infants and should continue to be encouraged.
