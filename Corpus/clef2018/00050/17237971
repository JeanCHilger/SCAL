Coenzyme precursor-assisted expression of a cholesterol oxidase from Brevibacterium sp. in Escherichia coli. The gene (choB(b)), encoding cholesterol oxidase from Brevibacterium sp. CCTCC M201008, was cloned and sequenced by PCR (GenBank accession number: DQ345780). The gene consists of 1653 base pairs and encodes a protein of 551 amino acids. ChoB(b) exhibited a homology of 98% with cholesterol oxidase gene from Brevibacterium sterolicum ATCC 21387. The cholesterol oxidase gene, cloned in the vector pET-28a, was over-expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RP grown at 23 degrees C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 microM riboflavin, the precursor of the FAD coenzyme of the enzyme. A maximum activity of 3.7 U/mg was obtained from cell free extract of E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RP harboring the pET-28a-choB(b).
