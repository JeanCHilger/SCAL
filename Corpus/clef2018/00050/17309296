Bioactive polymer fibers to direct endothelial cell growth in a three-dimensional environment. This study reports the fabrication of bioactive polymer fibers onto which signaling molecules can control and direct cell responses. To encourage and control directional biological responses, GRGDS peptides were immobilized onto the surface of 100 microm diameter poly(ethylene terephtalate) (PET) fibers (monofilaments). PET fiber surfaces were first coated with a thin polymeric interfacial bonding layer bearing amine groups by plasma polymerization. Carboxy-methyl-dextran (CMD) was covalently grafted onto the surface amine groups using water-soluble carbodiimide chemistry. GRGDS were covalently immobilized onto CMD-coated fiber surfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses enabled characterization of the multilayer fabrication steps. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were seeded and grown on fibers to investigate cell patterning behavior (i.e., adhesion, spreading, cytoskeleton organization, and cell orientation). Cell adhesion was reduced on CMD-coated fibers, whereas amine- and GRGDS-coated fibers promoted cell adhesion and spreading. Cell adhesion was enhanced as the GRGDS concentration increased. Epifluorescence microscopic visualization of cells on RGD-coated substrates showed well-defined stress fibers and sharp spots of vinculin, typical of focal adhesions. In comparison to plasticware commonly used in cell cultures, fiber curvature promoted cell orientation along the fiber axis.
