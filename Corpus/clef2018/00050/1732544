Synthesis and evaluation of radioiodinated 2-(2(RS)-aminopropyl)-5- iodothiophenes as brain imaging agents. Methods have been developed for the preparation of 2-(2(RS)-aminopropyl)-5-iodothiophenes. The syntheses and physical properties of 2-(2(RS)-aminopropyl)-5-iodothiophene and N-isopropyl-2-(2(RS)-aminopropyl)-5-iodothiophene are described. The radioiodinated agents are of interest because of the high expected uptake and prolonged brain retention that may result from binding to high-capacity, relatively nonspecific amine binding sites. Radioiodine was introduced into the 5-position of 2-(2(RS)-aminopropyl)-5-iodothiophene and N-isopropyl-2-(2(RS)-aminopropyl)-5-iodothiophene by radioiodination of the corresponding 5-boronic acid or 5-(trimethylstannyl) derivatives. Tissue distribution studies in rats with 2-(2(RS)-aminopropyl)-5-[125I]iodothiophene showed high brain uptake (5 min, 2.77% dose/g 30 min, 2.51% dose/g) and good brain/blood (B/B) ratios (5 min, 6/1
