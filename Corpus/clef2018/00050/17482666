The diagnostic value of PET/CT scanning in patients with cervical cancer: a prospective study. To investigate the clinical value of PET/CT as a supplement to FIGO staging in patients with cervical cancer stage >or=1B.This prospective study included 120 consecutive patients. After staging, a whole-body PET/CT scan was performed and these examinations were divided into two groups: (1) patients suitable for radical hysterectomy including lymph node dissection and (2) patients referred to combined chemo/radiation therapy. The results were compared to histopathological findings and/ or follow-up.Twenty-seven patients underwent radical surgery four of these had PET/CT scans revealing pathological foci in the pelvis. Three (11%) were true positiveWhole-body FDG PET/CT scanning for newly diagnosed cervical cancer FIGO stage >or=1B has a high sensitivity and specificity, and can be a valuable supplement to the FIGO staging procedure.
