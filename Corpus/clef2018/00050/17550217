Conditional univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyze the data.After adjustment for possible confounders, the following factors were positively related to DM1: parents' job-related issues changed or lost job (odds ratio [OR] 11.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-81.8) other severe life events--severe accident, hospitalization or death of close friend, quarrels between parents, war in republics of former Yugoslavia, near-drowning in a pool, falling down, unhurt participant of an accident (OR 68.5, 95% CI 13.5-349.0)These results support the hypothesis that stressful life events and psychological dysfunctions are associated with DM1.
