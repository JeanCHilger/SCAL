Precollaborative study of the GeneQuence Salmonella assay using 24-hour enrichment protocols for detection of Salmonella spp. in select foods. New enrichment protocols are described for use with a DNA hybridization (DNAH) method for detection of Salmonella spp. in select foods. GeneQuence Salmonella, in its original version, utilized a 3-stage enrichment of minimum 42 h duration. New 2-stage procedures of 24-28 h duration are described for raw poultry, raw beef, pasteurized egg products, milk chocolate, and dry pet food. In the validation study described here, a total of 345 samples were tested by the abbreviated DNAH method in parallel with either the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Bacteriological Analytical Manual (FDA/BAM) or U.S. Department of Agriculture-Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) reference culture procedures. Results showed an overall sensitivity for the DNAH method of 97.1% (false-negative rate 2.9%). There were no false-positive results by the DNAH method therefore the specificity was 100%. Overall agreement between the DNAH and reference culture methods was 98.5%. There were no significant differences in performance between the DNAH and reference methods for any of the foods tested as determined by Chi-square analysis. It is recommended that the DNAH method be subjected to AOAC collaborative study.
