Quantitation in gated perfusion SPECT imaging: the Cedars-Sinai approach. Cedars-Sinai's approach to the automation of gated perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging is based on the identification of key procedural steps (processing, quantitation, reporting), each of which is then implemented, in completely automated fashion, by use of mathematic algorithms and logical rules combined into expert systems. Our current suite of software applications has been designed to be platform- and operating system-independent, and every algorithm is based on the same 3-dimensional sampling scheme for the myocardium. The widespread acceptance of quantitative software by the nuclear cardiology community (QGS alone is used at over 20,000 locations) has provided the opportunity for extensive validation of quantitative measurements of myocardial perfusion and function, in our opinion, helping to make nuclear cardiology the most accurate and reproducible modality available for the assessment of the human heart.
