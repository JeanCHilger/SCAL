Synthesis and biological evaluation of the mitochondrial complex 1 inhibitor 2-[4-(4-fluorobutyl)benzylsulfanyl]-3-methylchromene-4-one as a potential cardiac positron emission tomography tracer. A series of fluorinated chromone analogs with IC50 values ranging from 9 to 133 nM for the mitochondrial complex 1 (MC-I) has been prepared. A structure-activity relationship (SAR) study of the most potent fluorinated chromone analog 10 demonstrated the linkage heteroatom preference of the side chain region of the molecule while maintaining potent MC-I inhibitory activity. Tissue distribution studies 30 min after [(18)F]10 administration to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats demonstrated high uptake of the radiotracer from the blood pool into the myocardium (2.24% ID/g), kidney (1.93% ID/g), and liver (2.00% ID/g). After 2 h about 66% of the activity in the myocardium at 30 min had been retained, whereas approximately 70% had been cleared from the liver and kidney. MicroPET images of SD rats after [(18)F]10 administration allowed easy assessment of the myocardium through 60 min with minimal lung or liver interference.
