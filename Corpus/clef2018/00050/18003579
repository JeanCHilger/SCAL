About mastopathy. The authors review knowledge of the clinical, imaging and pathological diagnosis of mastopathy syndrome and the issues of its therapy and care. They observe that no unified nomenclature exists, all the disciplines judge the idea of mastopathy differently. Clinical and imaging diagnosis is uncertain, the correct diagnosis can be established only by the pathologist. The role of surgery is minimal. The precancerous nature of mastopathy is also discussed, the rate of malignant transformation is low. Malignant transformation of benign lesions is very rare. The most important tools are close observation, systematic care of patients by a team of professionals, possibly by the same persons, in the same institute. Further research, and more exact definitions are necessary.
