Added value of PET and PET-CT in oesophageal cancer: a review of current practice. Oesophageal carcinoma is a relatively rare form of cancer. However, it is also one of the most deadly forms of cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of only 3% for patients with nodal disease, and 42% for those without nodal disease. It is therefore very important to accurately stage the disease at diagnosis and before therapy. In this article, we review the role of commonly used investigative techniques in the diagnosis and staging of oesophageal carcinoma, with special emphasis on PET and PET-CT scanning. The literature is reviewed in the context of our recent experience. A retrospective review of 129 patients with oesophageal carcinoma, who underwent PET or PET-CT scanning over a 24-month period confirmed the incremental value of PET and PET-CT scanning in the staging of oesophageal carcinoma.
