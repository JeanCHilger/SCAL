Attenuation compensation of cone beam SPECT images using maximum likelihood reconstruction. Attenuation compensation for cone beam single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging is performed by cone beam maximum likelihood reconstruction with attenuation included in the transition matrix. Since the transition matrix is too large to be stored in conventional computers, the E-M maximum likelihood estimator is implemented with a ray-tracing algorithm, efficiently recalculating each matrix element as needed. The method was applied and tested in both uniform and nonuniform density phantoms. Test projections sets were obtained from Monte Carlo simulations and experiments using a commercially available cone beam collimator. For representative regions of interest. reconstruction of a uniform sphere is accurate to within 3% throughout, in comparison to a reference image simulated and reconstructed without attenuation. High- and low-activity regions in a uniform density are reconstructed accurately, except that low-activity regions in a more active background have a small error. This error is explainable by the nonnegativity constraints of the E-M estimator and the image statistical noise.
