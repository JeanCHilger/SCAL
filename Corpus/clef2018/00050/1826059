Age-related changes in human D1 dopamine receptors measured by positron emission tomography. The effects of age on the binding parameters of 11C-SCH23390, the highly selective ligand for central D1 dopamine receptors, at specific binding sites in the brain were studied. Seventeen healthy male volunteers (20-72 years old) participated. Regional radioactivity in the brain was followed for 40 min by positron emission tomography (PET). A high accumulation of radioactivity was observed in the striatum and there was a conspicuous accumulation in the neocortex. A two-compartment model was used to obtain quantitative estimates of rate constants of association (K3) and dissociation (k4). The binding potential (k3/k4) of the dopamine D1 receptors in the striatum and frontal cortex decreased by 35% and 39%, respectively, with age. The value of k3 decreased by 58% in the striatum and 83% in the frontal cortex, whereas the value of k4 decreased by 35% in the striatum and 72% in the frontal cortex with age.
