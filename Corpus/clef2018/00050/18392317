Uptake of (18)F-FLT and (18)F-FDG in primary head and neck cancer correlates with survival. The aim of the study was to determine the practicability of (18)F-FLT in tumours of the head and neck area in terms of visualization, a possible correlation between FLT uptake and proliferation fraction as determined by Ki-67 immunostaining, and if tumoural FLT-uptake has a prognostic meaning, as determined by a correlation to patient survival time. Results were compared to (18)F-FDG.20 patients with previously untreated lesions of the head and neck area, which were clinically highly suspicious to be malignant, underwent PET scans with (18)F-FLT and (18)F-FDG, a CT of the head and neck area, and a biopsy. Tumour tracer uptake was determined by standardized uptake value (SUV) normalized to body weight and /non-tumor ratios (T/N). (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT uptake were compared with histopathologic and immunohistochemical results.19 patients had malignant tumours one patient had a benign cystadenoma (so called Warthin's tumour) of the parotid gland. One negative lesion turned out to be a malignant T1 stage squamous cell carcinoma in both PET scans, the Warthin's tumour was false positive with (18)F-FDG but showed only faint uptake with (18)F-FLT, resulting in a sensitivity of 95 % for both tracers. Of all lesions, maximum SUVs of (18)F-FLT ranged from 1.53 to 11.70 (mean +/- SD 5.81 +/- 2.28) those of FDG from 2.63 to 16.50 (mean +/- SD 8.91 +/- 3.58), p < 0.001. (18)F-FLT-T/N ranged from 0.94 to 5.85 (mean +/- SD, 3.18 +/- 1.21), (18)F-FDG-T/N was from 0.92 to 7.50 (mean +/- SD, 3.6 +/- 1.74), n.s. The mean survival time was 18 months in a maximum follow up time of 36 months. A significant correlation between both PET tracers and survival was detected, but no correlation between the amount of Ki-67 positive cells and FLT.In head and neck cancer in the primary setting (18)F-FLT does not provide additional visual information in comparison to (18)F-FDG.(18)F-FLT uptake is inversely correlated with patient survival, as well as (18)F-FDG.
