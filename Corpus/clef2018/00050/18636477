Coronary vasospasm produces reversible perfusion defects observed during adenosine triphosphate stress myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography. Adenosine triphosphate stress thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (ATP-SPECT) is useful for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD), although sometimes false positive results are observed. It has not been established whether a coronary spasm is responsible for the false positive findings during ATP-SPECT.We investigated whether coronary spasm is one of the factors which produces reversible defects on ATP-SPECT.Eighty-six patients (mean age: 62 y 58 men) who underwent both spasm-provocation testing by coronary angiography and ATP-SPECT, were selected for the study. Patients with coronary narrowing (>30%), myocardial infarction, or heart failure were excluded. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether the spasm-provocation test result was positive (vasospastic angina [VSA] group, n = 46) or negative (non-VSA group, n = 39).The body mass index was lower in the VSA group than in the non-VSA group (p = 0.005). On ATP-SPECT imaging, any type of reversible defect was observed more frequently in the VSA group (68%) than in the non-VSA group (36%, p = 0.0027). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the presence of reversible defects was one of the factors accounting for the presence of coronary vasospasm (p = 0.0022, R2 = 0.172).The findings suggest that reversible defects on ATP-SPECT imaging are frequently present in patients with coronary vasospasm. Coronary spasm may be considered as 1 of the factors, which produce reversible defects on ATP-SPECT, observed in patients with chest symptoms and angiographically normal coronary arteries.
