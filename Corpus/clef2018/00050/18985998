Rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist, improves peritoneal alterations resulting from an encapsulated peritoneal sclerosis model. Inflammation, fibrosis, and angiogenesis underlie the pathophysiology of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS). The irreversible sclerosis of visceral and parietal peritoneum that characterizes EPS can be seen in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients after long periods on dialysis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are the major regulator of key metabolic pathways of various inflammatory responses in fibrosing processes in most tissues. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the PPAR agonist rosiglitazone on the progression and regression of peritoneal alterations in chlorhexidine gluconate-induced EPS in rats. We divided 53 nonuremic Wistar albino rats into 5 groups: control group--isotonic saline 2 mL, injected intraperitoneally (IP) daily for 3 weeks chlorhexidine gluconate (CG) group--CG 2 mL per 200 g body weight, injected IP daily for 3 weeks
