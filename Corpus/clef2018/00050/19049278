Unexpected intermediates and products in the C-F bond activation of tetrafluorobenzenes with a bis(triethylphosphine)nickel synthon: direct evidence of a rapid and reversible C-H bond activation by Ni(0). The reaction of (PEt(3))(2)Ni(eta(2)-C(14)H(10)), a source of the reactive Ni(PEt(3))(2) moiety, with 1,2,4,5-F(4)C(6)H(2) yields a mixture of three C-F bond activation products that include the unexpected products (PEt(3))(2)NiF-2,3,5,6-F(4)C(6)H and (PEt(3))(2)NiF-2,3,5-F(3)C(6)H(2). Monitoring the reaction mixture via (19)F and (1)H NMR also reveals the presence of the C-H bond activation product, (PEt(3))(2)NiH-2,3,5,6-F(4)C(6)H which is produced in a rapid equilibrium reaction. This observation provides insight into the steps necessary to modify nickel complexes for selective C-F bond activation in a variety of polyfluorinated aromatic substrates, but also expands the potential of simple nickel compounds for C-H bond activation and functionalization reactions.
