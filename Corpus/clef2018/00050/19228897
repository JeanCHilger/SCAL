Current human-animal bond course offerings in veterinary schools. The human-animal bond (HAB) is viewed as growing in importance for practicing veterinarians, veterinary students, and society in general. The fields and activities concerning the HAB are interdisciplinary and varied. There is widespread belief that HAB programs are important for veterinarians, although many practitioners feel that their instruction on this topic was not as complete as desired. Most activities associated with the HAB are conducted in specific centers, but only about half of the veterinary schools in North America have such centers, and the instructional programs they offer to students show much variation. The purpose of this study was to survey North American veterinary schools and to document the activities related to the HAB and HAB centers that are available to veterinary students.
