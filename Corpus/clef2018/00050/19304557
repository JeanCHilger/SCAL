Preclinical studies of [61Cu]ATSM as a PET radiopharmaceutical for fibrosarcoma imaging. [61Cu]diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) ([61Cu] ATSM) was prepared using in house-made diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (ATSM) ligand and [61Cu]CuCl2 produced via the natZn(p, x)61Cu (180 muA proton irradiation, 22 MeV, 3.2 h) and purified by a ion chromatography method. [61Cu]ATSM radiochemical purity was >98 %, as shown by HPLC and RTLC methods. [61Cu]ATSM was administered into normal and tumor bearing rodents for up to 210 minutes, followed by biodistribution and co-incidence imaging studies. Significant tumor/non-tumor accumulation was observed either by animal sacrification or imaging. [61Cu]ATSM is a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for tumor hypoxia imaging.
