Imaging of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) arising from interstitial cells of Cajal, represent the first type of solid tumor, which is very sensitive to a specific molecularly targeted tyrosine kinase receptor blocker (i. e., imatinib). On CT, which is considered as the reference technique, GISTs typically present as large, well-delineated, heterogeneous and sometimes exophytic masses. In contrast with the absence of lymph node involvement, hepatic metastasis as well as mesenteric involvement can be observed. MR-enteroclysis is indicated to investigate the local extent of the disease in specific cases whereas MR imaging is used to detect hepatic metastasis. Because of a specific treatment, contrast-enhanced imaging is needed for the follow-up of treated tumors. Evaluation of tumor response to treatment is best assessed with CT which still remains the reference imaging technique whereas FDG-PET imaging is used in specific cases.
