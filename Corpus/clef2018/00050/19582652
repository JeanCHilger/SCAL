Sensitivity of neurochemical dementia diagnostics in CSF compared to 99mTc-SPECT in Alzheimer's dementia. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia is currently changing from a late and exclusion diagnosis towards a pathophysiology-based early and positive diagnosis. Especially advances in neuro-chemical dementia diagnostics in the cerebrospinal fluid (NDD-CSF) and imaging techniques like PET, SPECT or MRI are of particular interest. Unfortunately, many studies investigated only either one or other technique. In the present study 56 patients (average 67.1 years average mini-mental status test (MMST) 22.2) were examined with the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia. All patients both underwent NDD-CSF as well as 99mTc-SPECT. Only the SPECT, but not the NDD-CSF correlated with disease severity. Sensitivity of NDD-CSF was 89 % and SPECT 48 % for all patients and 93 % resp. 61 % for patients with MMST < 24. Below MMST 20 both methods had equal sensitivity. Both diagnostic techniques showed no statistic coherence (p = 0.27), neither after correction for subgroups like disease severity or the APOE genotype. Our results are compatible with the hypothesis that the NDD-CSF reflects beta-amyloid-aggregation and Tau-Protein pathology as a pathophysiologic biomarker. Our results suggest that SPECT is rather a state parameter for the rCBF changes following cortical neurodegeneration.
