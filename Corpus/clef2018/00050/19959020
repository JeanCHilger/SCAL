Role of neuroimaging in the evaluation of tremor. The role for neuroimaging in the management of patients with tremor is gradually increasing, particularly with respect to stereotactic neurosurgery and deep brain stimulation where less than 2-mm tolerance is required for accurate electrode placement. The routine use of single photon emission CT technology to image the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system is proving helpful in distinguishing essential and dystonic tremors from neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism and in improving our understanding of the pathophysiology of rarer tremors.
