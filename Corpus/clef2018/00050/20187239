Parkinson's disease: 10 years of progress, 1997-2007. Many people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and their family members ask their physicians "What is happening in research on Parkinson's disease? Is there anything new?" As the initial speaker at the symposium organized by the Parkinson's Disease Foundation in celebration of its 50th anniversary, I sought to address these questions, focusing on research published between the years 1997 and 2007. I cataloged the advances I considered most important in the field, recognizing my viewpoint is a subjective one and most likely differs from similar listings that others would put together. Space limitation allows me to discuss only a tiny fraction of the remarkable new findings that have been discovered during this 10-year span. Nevertheless, I expect the readers of this summation of advances in the field to be as impressed as I am on the wealth, breadth, and excitement stirring in the field of PD research. Included in this overview are highlights in both laboratory science and clinical science of PD research. In the former category are advances in knowledge on the genetics of PD potential etiologic and pathogenic causes, especially the better understanding of endogenous factors within dopaminergic neurons
