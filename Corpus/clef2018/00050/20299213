(11)C]Dimebon, radiosynthesis and lipophilicity of a new potential PET agent for imaging of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's diseas. [(11)C]Dimebon (2-[(11)C]methyl-8-methyl-5-(2-(6-methylpyridin-3-yl)ethyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole), a new potential PET agent for imaging of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease, was prepared by N-[(11)C]methylation of desmethyl-Domebon precursor with [(11)C]CH(3)OTf and purified with a semi-preparative HPLC method in 30-40% decay corrected radiochemical yield and 222-296GBq/mumol specific activity at EOB. The measured lipophilicity coefficient (LogP) value of [(11)C]Dimebon was 2.53.
