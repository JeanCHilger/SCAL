Radiologic equipment. A summary of articles in the past year that were deemed pertinent to diagnostic radiology and nuclear medicine equipment is presented. In diagnostic radiology, considerable work involving evaluation and considerations of digital schemes was noted, especially in chest radiography. Several review papers appeared that provide much information on digital techniques in one document. In the area of new developments, a design of a flat screen digital image intensifier has been reported, and a detection system for scanned projection radiography is described. As efficiency is quite important, the article concerning characteristics and evaluation of a 45-second film processor is timely. Developments in nuclear medicine included a four-headed scintillation camera, a new modular camera, and a new design for a positron emission scanner.
