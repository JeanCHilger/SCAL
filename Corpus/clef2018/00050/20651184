The challenge of detector designs for PET. The use of PET, especially the use of PET/CT scanners, has expanded rapidly over the past few years. Although most of the detector development efforts have been focused on scintillator-based designs, other technologies, such as wire chambers, time projection chambers, and solid-state devices, are also being pursued.Many of these new technologies have not translated into commercial systems. This article will explore some of the basic challenges of PET detector designs.
