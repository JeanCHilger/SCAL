A systematic review of the factors affecting accuracy of SUV measurements. There is growing interest in using PET/CT for evaluating early response to therapy in cancer treatment. Although widely available and convenient to use, standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements can be influenced by a variety of biologic and technologic factors. Many of these factors can be addressed with close attention to detail and appropriate quality control. This article will review factors potentially affecting SUV measurements and provide recommendations on ways to minimize when using serial PET to assess early response to therapy.Scanner and reconstruction parameters can significantly affect SUV measurements. When using serial SUV measurements to assess early response to therapy, imaging should be performed on the same scanner using the same image acquisition and reconstruction protocols. In addition, attention to detail is required for accurate determination of the administered radiopharmaceutical dose.
