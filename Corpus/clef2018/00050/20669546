Importation of infectious diseases to Europe via animals and animal products: risks and pathways. Importation of tropical infectious diseases to Europe via animals and animal products. Most emerging and resurgent diseases observed in France in recent decades have been zoonoses, and some have caused unprecedented health crises. The growing international trade in domestic and wild animals and foodstuffs of animal origin is contributing to the emergence or resurgence of such zoonoses, along with accidental or deliberate introduction of certain species into new geographical areas, and the recent craze for exotic pets. Thus, in France, we have witnessed the introduction and sometimes the establishment of new diseases through insect vectors (e.g. bluetongue), foodstuffs of animal origin intended for human or animal consumption (e.g. bovine spongiform encephalopathy and trichinellosis), and diseased or asymptomatically infected animals. This is notably the case of the highly pathogenic influenza virus subtype H5N1 carried by poultry and wild birds, and also pathogens carried by imported pet species (e.g. rabid dogs illegally imported from Morocco, and pet rats infected with cowpox virus). Globalization and global warming will also favor the emergence of new tropical diseases in Europe, and especially African diseases such as Rift Valley fever. Finally, it should be remembered that some diseases with potentially severe economic consequences have disappeared from Europe while remaining active on other continents. This is the case of rinderpest, for example, which led to the creation of the first veterinary school in the world (in Lyon, France) nearly 250 years ago, and which has now been eradicated from Europe.
