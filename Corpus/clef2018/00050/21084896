Whole-brain perfusion measurement using 320-detector row computed tomography in patients with cerebrovascular steno-occlusive disease: comparison with 15O-positron emission tomography. The 320-detector row computed tomography (CT) can provide whole-brain CT perfusion (CTP) maps with continuous angiographic images by performing a single dynamic scan. We investigated the reliability of CTP cerebral blood flow (CTP-CBF) with 320-detector row CT by comparing findings with O-positron emission tomography (PET-CBF).Whole-brain CTP and PET were performed in 10 patients with chronic unilateral steno-occlusive disease. We compared absolute and relative CBF values of bilateral middle cerebral artery territories between CTP and PET.Although mean CTP-CBF values were approximately 30% lower than mean PET-CBF values, the mean ischemic-to-nonischemic CBF ratios of CTP and PET were almost identical (P = 0.804). Regression analysis showed a significant correlation between CTP-CBF and PET-CBF values for each patient (r = 0.52-0.85, P < 0.001).Whole-brain CTP using 320-detector row CT is useful for evaluating the degree of ischemia for the entire brain with chronic cerebrovascular disease.
