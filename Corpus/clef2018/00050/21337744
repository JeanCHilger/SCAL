Possibility of an emission computer tomography for an estimation cerebral perfusion at patients with carotid stenoses before and after stenting. To estimate possibilities for studies of cerebral perfusion with brain scintigraphy for revealing and an estimation of features of change brain perfusion at patients with a cardio-cerebral vascular pathology before and after carotid stenting (CAS).11 patients with established (after carotid angiography) stenosis of internal carotid artery and coronary artery disease have been studied with SPECT with analogue HMPAO teoxim--Tc99M after intravenous introduction 700 MBk up to and in 5 days and in the remote period after stenting. For analysis of results the program "Neurogam" have been used. Standartized perfusion maps have been created.Before performing CAS various variants of the image cerebral perfusion maps have been obtained: from diffuse insignificant reduction in both hemispheres of a brain up to the regions hypoperfusion, characteristic for ischemic changes. Regions of hypoperfusion on the side opposite to a stenosis or occasion were revealed. SPECT, performed after cas on 5th day or after 2-3 months found increase of general brain perfusion, disappearance of symmetric both asymmetric regions hypoperfusion and reduction of a degree local hypoperfusion on the side of stenting.Maps of brain perfusion before and after CAS adequately reflect microcirculation of a brain with local changes of perfusion. Use of perfusion parameters gives possibility to estimate changes of brain perfusion before and after CAS in patients with combined carotid and coronary pathology.
