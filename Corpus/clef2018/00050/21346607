A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the dopamine D₃ receptor antagonist ABT-925 in patients with acute schizophrenia. There is substantial preclinical and clinical evidence to suggest a potential role for the dopamine D₃ receptor in the treatment of schizophrenia. ABT-925 is a selective dopamine D₃ receptor antagonist with an approximately 100-fold higher in vitro affinity for dopamine D₃ versus D₂ receptors. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, escalating-dose, parallel-group study assessed the efficacy and safety of ABT-925 in the treatment of patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. One hundred fifty-five patients were assessed over a 6-week double-blind treatment period (placebo: n = 48 ABT-925 50 mg once daily [QD]: n = 53
