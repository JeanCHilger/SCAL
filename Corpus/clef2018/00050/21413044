Placental site in the second trimester of pregnancy and its association with subsequent obstetric outcome. To determine if placental location in the second trimester of pregnancy is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.We performed a retrospective study on 16 236 patients having ultrasound examination at 14 to 23 weeks of gestation between 2000 and 2007. The placental location was classified into one of four groups: 'central', 'fundal', 'lateral' and 'covering Os'. Obstetric outcomes of non-central placenta were compared to those with 'central' placenta.Women with a 'fundal' placenta were at increased risk of developing pre-eclampsia (PET) (odds ratios (OR) = 2.27 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.31-3.93), a preterm delivery before 34 weeks (OR = 2.23Non-central placental location in the second trimester is associated with an increase risk of adverse obstetric outcome.
