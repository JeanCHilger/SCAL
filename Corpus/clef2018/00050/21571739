External radiation exposure of personnel in nuclear medicine from 18F, 99mTC and 131I with special reference to fingers, eyes and thyroid. The radiation exposure of fingers, thyroid and eyes of workers handling radiopharmaceuticals during various nuclear medicine procedures was measured using thermoluminescent dosemeters. Dosemeters were placed on the finger tips of 19 workers on several different occasions for various procedures. Additionally, the routinely determined whole-body doses to various groups of workers were analysed. The finger dose measurements demonstrated clear differences between the various tasks, from 0.0012 µGy MBq(-1) (unpacking and installing (99)Mo/(99m)Tc-generator) to 3.0 µGy MBq(-1) (syringe withdrawal, injection and waste handling of (18)F-FDG). As long as the worker was handling (99m)Tc, the dose to the fingers was well below the ICRP dose limits, even when the activity was high. Special concern should, however, be devoted to the handling of (18)F, since the dose to the fingers could easily reach the dose limits. The estimated dose to eyes and thyroid was well below the dose limits. Since the introduction of the positron emission tomography/computed tomography facility, the annual whole-body dose has increased for those directly involved in the handling of (18)F. The annual whole-body dose of 0.2-2.5 mGy was, however, well below the dose limits.
