COX10 codes for a protein homologous to the ORF1 product of Paracoccus denitrificans and is required for the synthesis of yeast cytochrome oxidase. Respiratory-defective mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae assigned to pet complementation group G19 lack cytochrome oxidase activity and cytochromes a and a3. The enzyme deficiency is caused by recessive mutations in the nuclear gene COX10. Analyses of cytochrome oxidase subunits suggest that the product of COX10 provides an essential function at a posttranslational stage of enzyme assembly. The wild type COX10 gene has been cloned by transformation of a mutant from complementation group G19 with a yeast genomic library. Based on the nucleotide sequence of COX10, the primary translation product has an Mr of 52,000. The amino-terminal 190 residues constitute a hydrophilic domain while the carboxyl-terminal region is hydrophobic and has nine potential membrane-spanning segments. The sequence of the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic region is homologous to an unidentified protein encoded by a reading frame (ORF1) located in one of the cytochrome oxidase operons of Paracoccus denitrificans. The two proteins share 24% identical residues and exhibit very similar hydrophobicity profiles. The bacterial homolog, however, lacks the hydrophilic amino-terminal region of the yeast protein.
