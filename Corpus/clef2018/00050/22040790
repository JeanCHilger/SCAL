Multimodality imaging of melanoma metastases to the abdomen and pelvis. Disease in the abdomen and pelvis is frequent in patients with metastatic melanoma (MM). Multidetector row computed tomography is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis and follow-up of MM. However, positron emission tomographic scan may be used as well as other newer imaging modalities, particularly for imaging of the abdominal and pelvic metastases. The aim if this exhibit is to review the distribution and features of melanoma metastases to the abdomen and pelvis as well as the role of currently available imaging modalities.
