PET/MRI of inflammation in myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to explore post-myocardial infarction (MI) myocardial inflammation.Innate immune cells are centrally involved in infarct healing and are emerging therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease however, clinical tools to assess their presence in tissue are scarce. Furthermore, it is currently not known if the nonischemic remote zone recruits monocytes.Acute inflammation was followed in mice with coronary ligation by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)FDG) positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, polymerase chain reaction, and histology.Gd-DTPA-enhanced infarcts showed high (18)FDG uptake on day 5 after MI. Cell depletion and isolation data confirmed that this largely reflected inflammation CD11b(+) cells had 4-fold higher (18)FDG uptake than the infarct tissue from which they were isolated (p < 0.01). Surprisingly, there was considerable monocyte recruitment in the remote myocardium (approximately 10(4)/mg of myocardium, 5.6-fold increaseThis study shed light on the innate inflammatory response in remote myocardium after MI.
