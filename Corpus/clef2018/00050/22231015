Minimally invasive input function for 2-18F-fluoro-A-85380 brain PET studies. Quantitative neuroreceptor positron emission tomography (PET) studies often require arterial cannulation to measure input function. While population-based input function (PBIF) would be a less invasive alternative, it has only rarely been used in conjunction with neuroreceptor PET tracers. The aims of this study were (1) to validate the use of PBIF for 2-(18)F-fluoro-A-85380, a tracer for nicotinic receptors (2) to compare the accuracy of measures obtained via PBIF to those obtained via blood-scaled image-derived input function (IDIF) from carotid arteriesTen healthy volunteers underwent a dynamic 2-(18)F-fluoro-A-85380 brain PET scan with arterial and, in seven subjects, concurrent venous serial blood sampling. PBIF was obtained by averaging the normalized metabolite-corrected arterial input function and subsequently scaling each curve with individual blood samples. IDIF was obtained from the carotid arteries using a blood-scaling method. Estimated Logan distribution volume (V(T)) values were compared to the reference values obtained from arterial cannulation.For all subjects, PBIF curves scaled with arterial samples were similar in shape and magnitude to the reference arterial input function. The Logan V(T) ratio was 1.00 ± 0.05 all subjects had an estimation error <10%. IDIF gave slightly less accurate results (V(T) ratio 1.03 ± 0.07PBIF scaled with arterial samples accurately estimates Logan V(T) for 2-(18)F-fluoro-A-85380. Results obtained with PBIF were slightly better than those obtained with IDIF. Due to arteriovenous concentration differences, venous samples cannot be substituted for arterial samples.
