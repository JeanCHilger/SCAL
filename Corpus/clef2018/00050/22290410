STIR: software for tomographic image reconstruction release 2. We present a new version of STIR (Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction), an open source object-oriented library implemented in C++Â for 3D positron emission tomography reconstruction. This library has been designed such that it can be used for many algorithms and scanner geometries, while being portable to various computing platforms. This second release enhances its flexibility and modular design and includes additional features such as Compton scatter simulation, an additional iterative reconstruction algorithm and parametric image reconstruction (both indirect and direct). We discuss the new features in this release and present example results. STIR can be downloaded from http://stir.sourceforge.net.
