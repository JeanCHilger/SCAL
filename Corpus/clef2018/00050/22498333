Role of FDG PET-CT in Takayasu arteritis: sensitive detection of recurrences. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the maximum standardized uptake value (max SUV) of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) provides a quantitative indication of disease activity in Takayasu arteritis (TA) cases.The clinical value of FDG-PET for assessing TA has been investigated. Clinical evaluation of disease activity is often difficult, because most patients develop recurrent inflammation while receiving corticosteroid treatment.Thirty-nine TA patients underwent FDG-PET/CT at Tokyo Medical and Dental University from 2006 to 2010 (35 women and 4 men median age, 30 years). Disease activity was defined according to National Institutes of Health criteria. Biomarkers including C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were measured. Forty subjects without vasculitis served as control subjects.The max SUV was significantly higher in active than in inactive cases and control subjects (active [n = 27], median value, 2.7 vs. inactive [n = 12], 1.9 control [n = 40], 1.8FDG-PET/CT is useful for detection of active inflammation not only in patients with active TA before treatment but also in relapsing patients receiving immunosuppressive agents. The max SUV is useful for assessing subtle activity of TA with high sensitivity.
