Impact of F18-fluorodeoxyglycose positron emission tomography/computed tomography on the management of resectable pancreatic tumours. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) using F18-fluorodeoxyglucose has been shown to be valuable in the management of malignant disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of this technique on the management of patients with resectable pancreatic tumours.Thirty-six patients with 37 potentially resectable pancreatic tumours on diagnostic CT imaging underwent PET/CT scans. Operative findings, histological reports and/or clinical follow-up served as standard of reference. The impact of PET/CT on patient management was estimated by calculating the percentage of patients whose treatment plan was altered due to PET/CT.Pancreatic adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 30 patients, neuroendocrine tumours in 3, mass-forming pancreatitis in 3 and serous cystadenoma in 1. The median standard uptake (max) value was 5.0 (range 2.2-12.0). Sensitivity and specificity of detecting extrapancreatic metastatic disease were 73% and 100%, respectively. Three occult liver metastases were detected at laparotomy following negative PET/CT. PET/CT findings influenced the management of 8 (22%) patients - 3 with liver metastases, 3 with bone metastases, 1 with lymph node metastases and 1 by identifying the benign appearance of the pancreatic tumour.PET/CT achieves a significant diagnostic impact in detecting extrapancreatic metastatic disease. F18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT appears to be useful in assessing suspicious pancreatic masses.
