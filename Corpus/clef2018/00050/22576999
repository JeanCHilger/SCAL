Parametric imaging of myocardial viability using ¹⁵O-labelled water and PET/CT: comparison with late gadolinium-enhanced CMR. The perfusable tissue index (PTI) is a marker of myocardial viability. Recent technological advances have made it possible to generate parametric PTI images from a single [(15)O]H(2)O PET/CT scan. The purpose of this study was to validate these parametric PTI images.The study population comprised 46 patients with documented or suspected coronary artery disease who were studied with [(15)O]H(2)O PET and late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR).Of the 736 myocardial segments included, 364 showed some degree of LGE. PTI and perfusable tissue fraction (PTF) diminished with increasing LGE. The areas under the curve of the PTI and PTF, used to predict (near) transmural LGE on CMR, were 0.86 and 0.87, respectively. Optimal sensitivity and specificity were 91 % and 73 % for PTI and 69 % and 87 % for PTF, respectively.PTI and PTF assessed with a single [(15)O]H(2)O scan can be utilized as markers of myocardial viability in patients with coronary artery disease.
