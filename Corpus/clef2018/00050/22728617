Naming impairment in Alzheimer's disease is associated with left anterior temporal lobe atrophy. There is considerable debate about the neuroanatomic localization of semantic memory, the knowledge of culturally shared elements such as objects, concepts, and people. Two recent meta-analyses of functional imaging studies (fMRI and PET) sought to identify cortical regions involved in semantic processing. Binder and colleagues (Binder et al., 2009) identified several regions of interest, widely distributed throughout the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. In contrast, Lambon Ralph and colleagues (2010) focused on the anterior temporal lobe, and found that when the potential for signal loss is accounted for (due, for example, to distortion artifact or field of view restriction), significant regional activation is detected. We set out to determine whether the anterior temporal lobe plays a significant role in picture naming, a task which relies on semantic memory. We examined a relatively large sample of patients with early Alzheimer's disease (N=145), a multifocal disease process typically characterized in the early stages by problems with episodic memory and executive function. Hypothesis-driven analyses based on regions of interest derived from the meta-analyses as well as exploratory analyses across the entire cerebral cortex demonstrated a highly specific correlation between cortical thinning of the left anterior temporal lobe and impaired naming performance. These findings lend further support to theories that include a prominent role for the anterior temporal lobe in tasks that rely on semantic memory.
