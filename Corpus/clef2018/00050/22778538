Endoscopic-ultrasound-guided tissue sampling facilitates the detection of local recurrence and extra pelvic metastasis in pelvic urologic malignancy. Pelvic lymph node dissection is the gold standard for assessing nodal disease in prostate or bladder cancer and is superior to CT, MRI and PET staging. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) provides an alternative, less invasive method of cytohistologic material acquisition, but its performance in pelvic urologic malignancy is unknown. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of EUS guided tissue sampling for these malignancies when compared to a composite cytohistologic and surgical gold standard. A median of 3 FNA passes were performed (n = 19 patients) revealing a sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 94.4% (72-99), 100% (2-100), 100% (80-100) and 50% (1-98) respectively. The perirectal space was the most frequently sampled location irrespective of the primary urological cancer origin. Final diagnosis established by EUS tissue sampling included bladder cancer (n = 1), bladder cancer local recurrence (n = 8), bladder cancer extra pelvic metastases (n = 1), prostate cancer (n = 2), prostate cancer local recurrence (n = 4), prostate cancer extra pelvic metastases (n = 1), testicular cancer extra pelvic metastases (n = 1) and a benign seminal vesicle (n = 1). EUS guided sampling of the gut wall, lymph nodes, or perirectal space yields suitable diagnostic material to establish the presence of primary, local recurrence or extra pelvic metastases of pelvic urologic malignancy.
