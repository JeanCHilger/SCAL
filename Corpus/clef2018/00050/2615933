Cerebral correlates of imagining colours, faces and a map--I. SPECT of regional cerebral blood flow. The distribution of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was assessed by single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in subjects during a resting state and during imagining either colours or faces or a route on a map. Twelve out of 30 subjects reported the spontaneous occurrence of mental visual images during the resting state. In these subjects flow in both orbitofrontal regions was higher than in those subjects who had not experienced spontaneous imagery. Voluntary imagery led to an increase of regional flow indices in basal temporal regions of both hemispheres and to a rightwards shift of global hemispheric asymmetry. The local changes were distinctly more marked with faces than with any of the other two stimuli. Imagining faces was also the only condition that led to an increase of activity in the left inferior occipital region which has been suggested by previous studies as being a crucial area for visual imagery. It is concluded that the observed differences of rCBF patterns between imagery conditions are related to the amount of information conveyed by the mental image. In contrast to the results of a companion study on DC-shifts accompanying imagery there was no effect of the visual versus spatial character of the images.
