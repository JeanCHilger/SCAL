Oral administration of chymotrypsin labile peptide for a new test of exocrine pancreatic function (PET) in comparison and pancreozymin-secretin test. A new test using N-benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid (N-BT-PABA) for an evaluation of exocrine pancreatic function was compared with a pancreozymin-secretin test in 38 subjects. Urinary recovery of PABA, which is absorbed from the intestine and conjugated in the liver after an oral administration of N-BT-PABA, depends mainly on chymotrypsin activity. The recovery rate of PABA in urine decreases in chronic pancreatitis, in which chymotrypsin activity in the duodenal juice is disturbed. The recovery rate of PABA in calcifying chronic pancreatitis was 40.2 +/- 15% and significantly less than 81.2 +/- 7.4% in normal subjects (P less than 0.01). The amount of PABA in urine during eight hours was correlated with parameters of volume output- bicarbonate concentration and amylase output stimulated by injections of pancreozymin and secretin (P-S test). The new test using N-BT-PABA is useful for the evaluation of exocrine pancreatic function in general practice.
