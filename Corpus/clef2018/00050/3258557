Diagnostic imaging of post-irradiation changes in the chest. Thirty-nine patients were studied with regard to post-irradiation changes in the chest. Twenty of these were reviewed retrospectively and 19 studied prospectively. All patients had chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of the chest following radiotherapy. Nineteen also had ventilation and perfusion studies of the lung, including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and these were correlated with the chest radiographs and computed tomography. The majority showed abnormalities on computed tomography, the commonest being areas of lung opacification and evidence of volume loss. Several patients also showed a reduction in the size of pulmonary vessels. In most but not all, the changes were also seen on the chest radiographs. Abnormalities were not confined to the radiation fields, the vascular changes being present in large areas of lung which had not been directly irradiated. The structural and functional abnormalities correlated well as shown by ventilation and perfusion scintigraphy. However, single photon emission computed tomography was more sensitive than planar scintigraphy in showing perfusion defects, and it also showed some defects in areas of lung which appeared normal on computed tomography and the chest film. Computed and photon emission tomography were considerably more sensitive than chest radiography in showing the changes due to irradiation. The chest radiograph is clearly an insensitive indicator of post-irradiation change in the lung. Functional abnormalities are more profound and extensive than the chest film suggests, even when it is positive. There are clear implications for the planning of radiotherapy fields affecting the chest in patients who have good prospects of long-term survival. The maximum damage is related to irradiation of the hilum or mediastinum and this should be avoided wherever possible.
