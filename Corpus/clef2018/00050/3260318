In vitro binding properties and autoradiographic imaging of 3-iodobenzamide ([125I]-IBZM): a potential imaging ligand for D-2 dopamine receptors in SPECT. The in vitro binding properties of the [125I] labeled benzamide (S(-)-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-methyl]-2-hydroxy-3-iodo-6-methoxy- benzamide, IBZM) were determined in bovine and mouse caudate membrane homogenates and by autoradiography of mouse brain slices. [125I]-IBZM binding is saturable and reversible with a Bmax of 373 +/- 51 fmol/mg protein and a Kd of 3.1 +/- 0.62 nM (mean +/- SD, Scatchard analyses) and 0.56 nM as calculated by association and dissociation time constants. In competition experiments, Ki values for the D-2 antagonists YM-09151-2 and spiperone are 4 orders of magnitude lower than the Ki value for the D-1 antagonist SCH-23390 and S(-)-IBZM is ten-fold more potent than R(+)-IBZM. [125I]-IBZM has a low affinity for serotonin S-2 and for alpha receptors. Therefore, it is a highly selective ligand for dopamine D-2 receptors. Autoradiographic images of brain sections incubated with [125I]-IBZM show the dopamine D-2 receptors of the striatum, nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle with a high ratio of specific to nonspecific binding. Thus, S(-)-IBZM, when labeled with [123I], may be useful for in vivo imaging of dopamine D-2 receptors by single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT).
