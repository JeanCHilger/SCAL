Lung volume calculations from 81Krm SPECT for the quantification of regional ventilation. Lung volumes, calculated from 81Krm single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the lungs, were compared with functional residual capacity (FRC), measured with the helium dilution technique in controls and in patients with various pulmonary diseases. SPECT volume was greater than FRC, which was attributed to non-gas-containing structures in the lung such as the alveolar walls, the interstitium, the blood vessels and the blood, included in the SPECT volume. A good correlation (r = 0.91) was found between the two volumes and there was no difference in this relationship between patients and controls. It was concluded that the relative volume distribution, calculated from SPECT, can be used for the quantification of ventilation from 81Krm SPECT steady-state count distributions.
