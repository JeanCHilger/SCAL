A comparison of Tc-99m HM-PAO and I-123 IMP cerebral SPECT images in Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia. SPECT images of the brain can be obtained using either 123I labelled amines or 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime (HM-PAO). Both materials produce images which are blood flow dominated and so appear similar in normal subjects, although the respective mechanisms of uptake are not yet finally established. It seems likely, however, that the different mechanisms of uptake are responsible for recent reports of some differences seen in images obtained with the two types of agent in patients with cerebral pathology, mainly cerebrovascular disease. In this study, 12 demented patients, 6 with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and 6 with multi infarct dementia (MID), were imaged with 123I-isopropylamphetamine (IMP) and 99mTc-HM-PAO and the images compared. Significantly more lesions were seen with IMP than HM-PAO (P less than 0.02) out of a possible 120 sites, 41 lesions were seen with IMP compared to 28 with HM-PAO, 23 being seen with both agents. However, it is concluded that either agent can be used for the differential diagnosis of dementia, a task for which the new cerebral blood flow agents seem well suited.
