SPECT using Bremsstrahlung to quantify 90Y uptake in Baker's cysts: its application in radiation synovectomy of the knee. The use of SPECT with Bremsstrahlung radiation has been investigated in studies on patients undergoing 90Y therapy for persistent synovitis of the knee. In particular, its value in the estimation of 90Y uptake into Baker's cysts was assessed and, to this end, realistic 'knee phantoms' were employed in order to calibrate for cysts of different size. Problems associated with the measurement of the extensive Bremsstrahlung spectrum and the estimation of cyst volume have been discussed. It is shown that, although the apparent volume of a cyst is markedly dependent on the chosen count rate threshold, volumes greater than about 30 ml can be estimated with reasonable accuracy using a threshold of 50%. The uptake of 90Y in cysts, measured on 3 occasions within the first 2 days in 10 patients, showed wide variation (0%-40%) between patients and was poorly related to the size of cysts on arthrograms and to the clinical response to therapy. In these studies, the ability to analyse SPECT slices provided a distinct advantage over planar imaging for discriminating between 90Y uptake in cysts and adjacent sites. Retention of 90Y in the total knee was also widely variable, with losses of 2%-38% observed 2 days after injection which, in general, were not fully accounted for by uptake in liver or lymph nodes. The changing distribution of 90Y colloid in the knee during the first two days, as observed in some patients, might explain part of the discrepancy.
