Efficacy of transcatheter embolization for massive bleeding from pelvic fracture. To investigate the effectiveness of percutaneous transcatheter embolization (PET) for massive bleeding from pelvic fracture, 89 patients treated in a recent 5-year period when PET was adopted (group II) were analyzed and compared with former 177 patients (group I). The results obtained were as follows: 1) Although there was no difference between the groups on overall mortality within 24 hours, the rate of hemorrhagic death directly caused by pelvic fractures and the incidence of complications in group II were significantly less than in group I. 2) PET directly improved vital sign and decreased transfusion. 3) Bleeding sites near greater ischiatic notches on angiogram were frequently seen without detectable fractures of posterior pelvic ring on plain X-ray films. 4) Any side effects were not associated with PET. These results confirm that PET can identify bleeding sites, control hemorrhage and improve mortality and morbidity of severe pelvic fracture.
