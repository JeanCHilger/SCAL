Simulation and experimental study of respiratory motion effect on image quality of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The effect of respiratory motion on the image quality of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was investigated by computer simulation and experimentation. In the computer simulation, the phantom was assumed to be cylindrical with a uniform background and a spherical cold or hot spot. To simulate respiratory motion, a cyclic linear motion parallel to the axis of rotation of a gamma camera was assumed. The contrast in the transaxial images was calculated for various respiratory amplitudes and its dependence on lesion size and object contrast was investigated. In the experiments, a moving phantom was used to simulate respiratory motion. The simulation and the experimental results were in good agreement within the range of statistical error. The effect on the lesion detectability was investigated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, and a method for correcting respiratory motion was devised.
