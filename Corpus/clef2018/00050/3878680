Cardiac radioisotopic tomography. In addition to positron tomography, which involves the use of radioactive elements of physiological or pathological significance, there is another technic available, that of gamma emission tomography, which makes use of conventional tracer elements, and which therefore has important clinical applications which complete plane projection imaging. This method can be used both to investigate myocardial blood supply, using thallium 201 and to evaluate cardiac kinetics--of both the right and left ventricles--after labeling of the blood flow with technetium 99m.
