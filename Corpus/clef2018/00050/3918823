Total-body scintigraphy with 131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine for detection of neuroblastoma. Total-body scintigraphy with 131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) was performed in 20 patients with neuroblastoma. In patients who were in complete remission no pathological concentration of 131I-MIBG was found. In 16 patients with residual, recurrent or metastatic neuroblastoma the tumor localizations were correctly identified by 131I-MIBG-scintigraphy In 5 patients additional tumor sites were found. In most patients an inverse relationship between myocardial and tumoral concentration of 131I-MIBG was noted. Dosimetric assessment of 131I-MIBG uptake in patients with metastatic disease revealed cases with considerable tracer concentration and long effective half lives in tumor localizations. It is concluded that 131I-MIBG total-body scintigraphy is useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of neuroblastoma and that therapeutic use of this agent is feasible, if patients are selected upon the merits of dosimetry.
