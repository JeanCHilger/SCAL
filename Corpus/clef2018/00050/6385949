Enzyme immunoassay of Chlamydia in birds. Serum samples from 192 free-living birds (27 species) were tested for antibodies against Chlamydia using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 97 (51%) were seropositive. The highest antibody prevalence was among pheasants (96%), ducks (88%), and blackbirds (86%). None of 41 starlings tested were seropositive. The serotesting of 42 confined pheasants indicated 100% exposure to the organism. The ELISA is a sensitive, rapid serologic method that can be of epidemiologic and diagnostic value for detecting exposure to Chlamydia. The ELISA could also be used for mass-screening of pet birds where chlamydiosis may be considered a potential public health hazard.
