Effects of non-linear flow and spatial orientation on technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime single-photon emission tomography. The effects of two post-acquisition corrections on the visual and quantitative analysis of technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) single-photon emission tomography (SPET) were determined. The corrections were for: (1) the improper spatial orientation of the patient data sets, and (2) the non-linear uptake of HMPAO across the blood-brain barrier. Reorienting the SPET image data sets removed observers' uncertainty in assessment caused by suspected head tilt however, it increased their uncertainty due to perceived subtle perfusion deficits. Applying the correction to compensate for the decrease in uptake of HMPAO in high-flow regions resulted in an increase in the number of positive assessments. In a study involving 30 patient studies, intra-observer reliability increased from 62% to 83% (average of two observers) after applying both of the corrections, while inter-observer reliability improved from 62% to 81%. Quantitative methods of analysing the images are also affected by the corrections. In an ROI-based classification scheme, the quantitative assessments of more than one-half of the images are affected by the two corrections. These results need to be considered when comparing both quantitative and visual results from different studies in which the corrections may or may not have been applied.
