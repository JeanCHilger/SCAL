Uptake mechanisms of meta-[123I]iodobenzylguanidine in isolated rat heart. In order to clarify the uptake and retention mechanisms of radioiodinated meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) in heart, the kinetics of no-carrier-added [123I]MIBG were studied in the isolated working rat heart in interaction with pharmacologic agents. The tracer was administered in the perfusate as a 10-min pulse, followed by a 90-min washout period. Kinetic analysis of the externally monitored time-activity curves of control hearts showed avid uptake (Ki = 4.4 +/- 0.7 mL/min/g), and monoexponential clearance (ko = 0.0056 +/- 0.0017 l/min), indicating a distribution volume (Vd = Ki/ko) of 834 +/- 214 mL/g. Blocking experiments (n = 41) were performed with neuronal uptake (uptake-1) inhibitor desipramine (DMI 50-100 nM) and the extraneuronal uptake (uptake-2) inhibitor N-(9-fluorenyl)-N-methyl-beta-chloroethylamine (SKF550
