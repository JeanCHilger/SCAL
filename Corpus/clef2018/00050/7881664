Distribution of regional density and vascular permeability in the adult respiratory distress syndrome. Although recent X-ray computed tomography (CT) data show that ventral-dorsal gradients in density are common in the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we hypothesized that the ventral-dorsal gradient of pulmonary vascular permeability would be evenly distributed in patients with ARDS. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing previously reported data (Am Rev Respir Dis 1991 143:150-154) obtained by the nuclear medicine imaging technique of positron emission tomography (PET). Measurements of regional lung density (LD), extravascular density (EVD), and the pulmonary transcapillary escape rate (PTCER
