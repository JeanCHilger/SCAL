Evaluation of liver function in carbon tetrachloride-damaged rabbits by dynamic SPECT: comparison of 99mTc-GSA and 99mTc-Sn colloid. Technetium-99m-DTPA-galactosyl human serum albumin (99mTc-GSA) is a new ligand that binds specifically to asialoglycoprotein receptors in hepatocytes. We performed liver dynamic SPECT using 99mTc-GSA and 99mTc-Sn colloid in nine normal control rabbits and 17 chronically CCI4-damaged rabbits (total 29 examinations), and also performed liver function tests (ICGR15, Alb, etc). Using the obtained dynamic SPECT data, we analyzed the liver kinetics of 99mTc-Sn colloid using a one-compartment model (hepatic blood flow [K]) and 99mTc-GSA using a two-compartment model (hepatic blood flow and receptor binding [K1], catabolism [K2]). As the CCl4-treated period increased, K1 decreased most significantly. K1 showed the most significant statistical correlation with the results of liver function tests, ICGR15 (p < 0.0001), Alb, PT, HP, Bil and GPT. Further, only K1 showed a correlation with the hepatic fibrosis of the HAI score. From the present results, liver dynamic SPECT using 99mTc-GSA may be said to provide a novel method for the evaluation of hepatic functional reserve.
