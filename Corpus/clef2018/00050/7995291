Patency of the infarct-related coronary artery--a pertinent factor in late recovery of myocardial fatty acid metabolism among patients receiving thrombolytic therapy? The decrease in mortality among patients receiving thrombolytic therapy for myocardial infarction is greater than would be expected from the improvement in left ventricular contractile function alone thus some additional advantage of recanalization of the infarct-related coronary artery probably exists. Changes in the post-infarction myocardial metabolic state with respect to artery patency have not been studied with a gamma camera previously. A single-photon emission tomography scan using the fatty acid analogue para-123I-iodophenylpentadecanoic acid was performed at rest before hospital discharge on nine patients with first anterior myocardial infarction. All patients had received intravenous thrombolytic therapy at the beginning of the insult. The semiquantitative analysis of the left ventricle included a total of 44 segments in each patient. The test was repeated 3 months later, with the patients divided into two groups: six patients had an angiographically patent left anterior descending coronary artery (group A), and three an occluded artery (group B). In group A the number of myocardial segments with abnormal (< 70% of maximum) fatty acid uptake was initially 20.2 +/- 4.7 (mean +/- SD) and was reduced to 11.3 +/- 6.1 during the follow-up (95% confidence interval of the decrease 16.0-1.7 segments). In group B the number of these aberrant segments was fairly constant (21.7 +/- 13.1, initial test, and 21.3 +/- 13.3, retest). Our preliminary results suggest that even when thrombolytic therapy fails to prevent myocardial infarction, myocardial fatty acid metabolism has a better change of recovering if the relevant coronary artery has regained its patency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
