Formulation of a single-component kit for the preparation of technetium-99m labelled ethyl cysteinate dimer: biological and clinical evaluation. Ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) labelled with reduced technetium-99m has recently been proposed as a promising radiopharmaceutical for brain perfusion imaging. In the present study a single-component kit formulation has been developed, thus simplifying the radiolabelling procedure. A method of analysis by electrophoresis has also been developed, permitting identification of radiochemical impurities in the preparation. 99mTc-ECD prepared by the single-component kit was further evaluated in primates and humans. The results demonstrated that the complex is stable in vivo, rapidly extracted and retained in the brain tissue for a sufficient time for single-photon emission tomography studies. Therefore the present single-component kit formulation can be proposed as a reliable instant freeze-dried kit for routine preparation of 99mTc-ECD required for scintigraphic assessment of regional cerebral blood flow.
