Habituation and motion sickness. The vestibular, cerebellar, and reticular systems are central in importance, in motion sickness and habituation, to the effects of motion. Nuclear medicine single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies of cerebral blood flow and power spectral electroencephalographic recordings during motion sickness were used to determine alterations in the central nervous system. The rotating chair with and without visual stimulation was used to study the rate of habituation and the effect of antimotion sickness medications on this rate. An increase of theta waves over the frontal cortex indicated a decreased activation of the higher centers during motion sickness. Motion sickness also produces an increase of blood flow in the central cerebellum that has connections to the reticular system. This increase in cerebellar activity is relayed to the reticular system whereby neural recruitment builds up to trigger the vomiting center, producing motion sickness. Habituation may be a conditioned compensatory activation of the reticular neurons that prevents this disruption of normal activation. The rate of habituation when motion sickness was prevented by scopolamine was slowed, indicating that, if the central nervous system is not challenged by disruption of normal activation, it does not produce the compensatory reactions that result in habituation.
