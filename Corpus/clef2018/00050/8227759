99mTc-HMPAO single photon emission tomography in late life depression: a pilot study of regional cerebral blood flow at rest and during a verbal fluency task. Relative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured at rest and during a verbal fluency task in ten elderly patients with major depressive disorder and nine controls. At rest, depressed patients showed significant reductions in the cortico-cerebellar ratios of tracer uptake in the right and left parietal, left temporal and left occipital regions. During the task relative rCBF increased in patients such that these differences disappeared. Relative rCBF did not correlate with severity of depressed mood or endogenous features but did correlate positively with severity of psychotic symptoms. Frontal relative rCBF correlated negatively with somatic symptoms and anxiety.
