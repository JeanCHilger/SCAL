Metabolic acidosis and breathlessness during exercise and hypercapnia in man. 1. A previous study showed that when combined with exercise in normal subjects, hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory stimuli did not have a specific effect on the intensity of the sensation of breathlessness in addition to their stimulation of ventilation. The aim of the present study was to assess the significance of another reflex ventilatory stimulus, metabolic acidosis, in the genesis of this sensation. 2. Six subjects performed progressive exercise tests (mean workload, 103 W range, 88-125 W) with normal acid-base status. Following NH4Cl-induced metabolic acidosis (mean change in base excess, -3.6 mmol l-1
