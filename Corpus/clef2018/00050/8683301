Iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine dosimetry in cancer therapy: risk versus benefit. In the treatment of neural crest tumors, such as pheochromocytoma, with[131I]MIBG, bone marrow toxicity limits the amount of administered activity and, thus, a therapeutically useful tumor dose.We calculated tumor doses in a series of diagnostic studies with [123I]MIBG using accurate quantification of SPECT and planar scintigraphy. By extrapolating diagnostic results to therapeutic activities of [131I]MIBG, we could compare the results with whole-body doses from a series of therapies.The tumor dose was DT = 2.2 mGy MBq(-1) (median value of 27 measurements, range 0.04 < or = DT < or = 20 mGy MBq(-1) and the whole-body dose in a series of 16 patients undergoing 50 therapies was DWB = 0.12 +/- 0.04 mGy MBq(-1) (mean +/- s.d.). The therapeutic ratio varied between 130 to below 10 in some patients.The results were compared with published data. We found clearly skewed distribution of tumor doses, with a majority of tumors receiving only a few mGy per MBq administered activity. In some patients, however, doses did reach 20 mGy MBq(-1).
