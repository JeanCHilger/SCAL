Nodal spread of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity detected with PET-tyrosine, MRI and CT. The uptake of L-1-[11C]-tyrosine (TYR) in cervical lymph nodes of eleven patients with squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity was studied with PET to detect lymphogenic metastases.The TYR-PET results were compared with clinical, MRI, CT, histopathologic findings and historical data of patients studied with FDG. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and the positive and negative predictive values were calculated.TYR-PET had sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 95%. In contrast, the sensitivity and specificity for MRI were 33% and 96%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for CT were 55% and 91%, respectively. TYR-PET results compared favorably with FDG.With TYR-PET, SCC metastases of the oral cavity can be visualized with high sensitivity and specificity. TYR-PET can be an additional tool for further evaluation of neck malignancies.
