Radioimmunotherapy of medullary thyroid cancer with iodine-131-labeled anti-CEA antibodies. This study evaluates the pharmacokinetics, dosimetry, toxicity and therapeutic potential of radiolabeled NP-4 and MN-14 anti-CEA antibodies in medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).Eighteen patients with advanced MTC entered exploratory clinical studies with therapeutic doses of 131I-labeled NP-4 and MN-14 murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) reactive with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Doses administered ranged from 46 mCi for 131I-MN-14 lgG to 195 mCi for 131I-MN-14 F(ab)2 in patients negative for human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA).The radioconjugate blood half-life (T1/2) for the whole lgG was 42.5+/-5.0 hr compared to 18.8+/- 4.1 hr for the bivalent fragments. Tumor doses of 17.5+/-11.0 and 11.4+/-6.3 cGy/mCi were estimated for 131I-MN-14 lgG and F(ab)2, respectively. Tumor/red marrow dose ratios exceeded 3:1 for most lesions. Red marrow doses of up to 350 cGy generally could be delivered with < grade 4 toxicity. Seven of 14 evaluable patients showed evidence of anti-tumor effects lasting up to 26 months, based on physical exam, tumor markers or computed tomography.This study demonstrates that anti-CEA MAbs may be suitable for radioimmunotherapy of metastatic or recurrent MTC.
