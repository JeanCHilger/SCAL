Somatostatin receptor: scintigraphy and radionuclide therapy. Peptide receptor scintigraphy is more sensitive at the biological than anatomical level, in contrast to conventional imaging, which it complements. Neuroendocrine tumours have the most somatostatin receptors in vitro and their metastases are somatostatin receptor positive in vitro, so that [111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]octreotide (OCT) can be used to image them. OCT was compared with conventional imaging techniques (CON) in a European Multicentre Trial. In 350 evaluable patients, CON detected 88%, and OCT 80% (glucagonomas 100%, VIPomas 88%, carcinoids 87%, non-functioning islet cell tumours 82%, insulinomas 46%) of tumour sites but there was no systematic use of abdominal single-photon-emission computerised tomography. OCT demonstrated multiple tumour sites in 62 of 178 patients in whom CON had found only 1 lesion, with 60% confirmed. 12/16 lesions detected by OCT in 11 patients with no lesions according to CON were also confirmed. The impact of OCT on management was evaluated in 235 patients and affected 40%: it determined 29 surgical decisions, led to octreotide therapy in 47, and modified octreotide dose in 18. Six end-stage patients with neuroendocrine tumours were treated with OCT radionuclide therapy (up to a cumulative dose of 53 GBq per patient) in a phase I trial. There were no major side-effects after up to 2 years treatment, with impressive effects on hormone production and a likely anti-proliferative effect.
