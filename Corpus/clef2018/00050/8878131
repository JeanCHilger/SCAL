Reduction of 123I-iomazenil uptake in haemodynamically and metabolically impaired brain areas in patients with cerebrovascular disease. Iomazenil is a specific ligand for central-type benzodiazepine receptors (BZR). In order to determine the clinical significance of the findings of 123I-iomazenil single photon emission tomography (SPET) in cerebrovascular disease (CVD), we compared the cerebral uptake of 123I-iomazenil with oxygen metabolism measured by positron emission tomography (PET). Depending on the severity of the haemodynamic and/or metabolic impairment based on our institutional criteria [a reduction of < 30.6 ml 100g-1 min-1 in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and an increase of > 0.52 in the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF)], the cortical areas were classified into four groups as follows: Group I, normal CBF and OEF Group II, normal CBF and increased OEF
