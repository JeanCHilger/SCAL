Regional cerebral blood volume measured by dynamic susceptibility contrast MR imaging in Alzheimer's disease: a principal components analysis. Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI is an alternative to positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics in patients with Alzheimer's disease. DSC MRI allows the construction of high resolution images of cerebral blood volume (CBV) without the use of radionuclides or ionizing radiation. In this study, DSC MRI data were collected from 16 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and 16 age-matched control subjects. Characteristic patterns of regional CBV variation were found using principal component analysis. Three such patterns were identified: a global variation pattern, an anterior-to-posterior CBV gradient, and a temporoparietal pattern. Group differences in the principal component scores associated with the global and temporoparietal patterns (P = .08 and P = .007, respectively) suggest that these deficits reflect characteristic CBV abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease. Using only these two scores, the Alzheimer's disease group was classified with a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 88%. Additionally, disease severity, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), was correlated significantly with the third principal component score (Pearson's r = .50, P = .05).
