Kawasaki disease evaluated by two-dimensional echocardiogram and dipyridamole 201Tl-chloride myocardial SPET. Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) is a disease of unknown aetiology that affects infants and children, with most patients having myocardial involvement. To evaluate the incidence and nature of myocardial involvement, 30 patients with Kawasaki disease underwent both dipyridamole 201Tl-chloride myocardial single photon emission tomography (SPET) and two-dimensional echocardiography (2D-Echo), which were performed within 7 days of each other. The SPET image of 15 of 30 (50%) patients showed 27 segments with myocardial perfusion abnormalities: 6 patients had one or more segments showing redistribution 6 patients had both one or more segments of reverse redistribution and redistribution
