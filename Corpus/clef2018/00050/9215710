Role of the dorso-caudal neostriatum in filial imprinting of the domestic chick: a pharmacological and autoradiographical approach focused on the involvement of NMDA-receptors. Newly hatched domestic chicks were either acoustically imprinted on 400 Hz tone pulses or visually imprinted on a rotating red light. Compared to naive control animals, both groups of imprinted chicks expressed significantly enhanced stimulus evoked 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (2-FDG) uptake in circumscribed areas of the dorso-caudal neostriatum (Ndc). This enhanced excitability after imprinting seems not to be related to changes of NMDA-receptor densities as measured by quantitative receptor autoradiography. However, pharmacological blockade of NMDA-receptors in the dorso-caudal neostriatum leads to a marked suppression of stimulus-evoked 2-FDG uptake in the dorso-caudal neostriatum and also in the interconnected imprinting relevant forebrain area, medio-rostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale (MNH). Furthermore, chicks which received bilateral Ndc injections of the competitive NMDA antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphono valeric acid (APV) during the imprinting experiments showed a dose-dependent decrease of imprinting success compared to vehicle-injected controls. These results indicate that the dorso-caudal neostriatum may represent a polysensory associative brain region in which visual and acoustic features of imprinting objects may be integrated. The activation in this area evoked by the imprinting stimulus during and after imprinting is critically dependent on NMDA-receptor activation, which appears to be required for this learning process.
