Quantification of cerebral blood flow and partition coefficient using iodine-123-iodoamphetamine. The aim of this study was to develop a simple, noninvasive method for quantifying both regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and the partition coefficient (lambda) using N-isopropyl-p[123I]iodoamphetamine and SPECT.By employing a two-compartment model (influx, K1: outflux, k2), a new method was introduced that requires two serial SPECT scans at 30 min and 60 min, and a single arterial sample 5 min after tracer injection. The integral of the arterial input function is inferred from the sample by using the correlation obtained from 25 subjects. Two original mathematical functions, phi for K1 and gamma for lambda (= K1/k2), were obtained from the input functions of 12 subjects. The values of K1 and lambda are determined from the two scans and the single arterial sample by using these functions. The values obtained for K1 (= rCBF) and lambda were compared with those obtained by nonlinear least-squares fitting analysis and the 133Xe inhalation SPECT method.K1 and lambda were in good agreement with the values obtained by nonlinear least-squares fitting analysis (r = 0.873 in K1 and r = 0.825 in lambda), and rCBF values were closely correlated with those obtained by the 133Xe method (r = 0.843).The proposed method has three advantages: (a) accurate, simultaneous quantification of both rCBF and the partition coefficient (b) simplicity and noninvasiveness
