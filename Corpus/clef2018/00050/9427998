Evaluation of recombinant protein r140, a polypeptide segment of tegumental glycoprotein Sm25, as a defined antigen vaccine against Schistosoma mansoni. To investigate the role of tegumental glycoprotein Sm25 in protective immunity against schistosomiasis, codons 43-182 of its gene (GP22) were amplified by PCR and cloned in the pET 15b bacterial expression system. Recombinant protein r140 was inducibly expressed in the presence of rifampicin and purified by Ni-affinity chromatography. In different vaccination trials, Balb/c mice and Fischer rats repeatedly immunized with r140 in combination with one of several adjuvants (alum, cholera toxin or complexed into proteosomes) produced high titre anti-r140 responses. These antibodies detected an N-glycanase sensitive. 25 kDa antigen in a detergent solubilized worm fraction using Western immunoblotting. The choice of adjuvant affected the isotype distribution of the specific anti-r140 antibodies. Despite the presence of high antibody titres and isotypes which have been shown to correlate with protective immunity, protection against subsequent cercarial challenge was not observed. In addition, no appreciable effects on worm sex ratios or liver egg yields were detected in mice. Studies involving biotin labelling of membrane proteins in live worms showed that the majority of anti-r140 reactive molecules present in adult schistosomes are biotinylated after permeabilization of the parasite surface. Several possibilities to account for the lack of protective immunity are analysed.
