Therapy or euthanasia? How far may (and should) the veterinarian go in the treatment of an animal?. Veterinarians are often faced with the question of whether they should treat or--in accordance with the animal owner--to end the life of a pet animal. This situation can be described as a moral dilemma. Can this moral dilemma be solved? The author argues that we have special moral obligations to care for pet animals. The special, quasi-personal relationships between pet animal and animal owners provide veterinarians in most cases with moral reasons to carry out the treatment.
