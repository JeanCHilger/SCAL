No serotonin 5-HT2A receptor density abnormality in the cortex of schizophrenic patients studied with PET. To investigate putative abnormalities of cortical 5-HT2A receptor density in schizophrenia, we used positron emission tomography and [18F]setoperone, a high-affinity 5-HT2A receptor radioligand, in 14 neuroleptic-free or -naive schizophrenic patients and in 15 normal controls. No significant difference between the groups was observed in the whole or regional cortical binding potential of [18F]setoperone, indicating an absence of major 5-HT2A receptor cortical density abnormalities in schizophrenics.
