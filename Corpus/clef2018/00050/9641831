Studies on the bottles of mineral water and the foreign plastic like substances. The containers of mineral water and the foreign plastic substances which were found in the mineral water were investigated. Most of plastic bottles were made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and the caps were made of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) or aluminum. PE liners were attached to some caps. Most of the foreign plastic substances were PET while others were PE, PP, Teflon and rubber. Some bottles had a scratch on the top inside. The origin of most PET fragments was presumed to be scraped off the bottles by the lowering of the injection nozzle during the water filling process. The sources of the other substances were also determined.
