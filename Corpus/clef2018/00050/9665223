Risk stratification with pre-hospital discharge exercise technetium-99m sestamibi myocardial tomography in men after acute myocardial infarction. Exercise thallium-201 imaging early after acute myocardial infarction (MI) may provide information concerning risk of future cardiac events. The prognostic value of exercise technetium-99m sestamibi (MIBI) single-photon emission computed tomography in such patients has not been established.Submaximal exercise stress testing with MIBI tomography was done before hospital discharge in 134 consecutive men after acute MI. Patients were monitored for occurrence of late cardiac events (nonfatal MI or cardiac death). Coronary revascularization was done in 31 patients (23%) < or = 3 months after testing. Nonfatal MI or cardiac death occurred in 30 (23%) of the overall group of 133 patients monitored (mean 35+/-19 months) and in 25 (25%) of the 102 patients treated medically. A history of congestive heart failure, failure to reach 85% of age-predicted maximal heart rate, and an isolated fixed MIBI defect were associated with significantly increased risk (p < 0.05) of a late cardiac event in both groups of patients. A reversible MIBI defect was not associated with increased risk. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, only a history of congestive heart failure (relative risk 4.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7 to 10.4, p < 0.002) and an isolated fixed MIBI defect (relative risk 2.1, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.3, p < 0.05) were independent predictors of increased risk in the total group of 133 patients. In the 102 patients treated medically, only a history of congestive heart failure (relative risk 4.9, 95% CI 1.9 to 13.1) and achievement of 85% of age-predicted maximal heart rate (relative risk 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.9) were independent predictors of risk.Early post-MI submaximal exercise testing with MIBI tomography provides limited prognostic information for late cardiac events. An isolated fixed MIBI defect is associated with increased risk but not as strongly as other variables, particularly a history of congestive heart failure.
