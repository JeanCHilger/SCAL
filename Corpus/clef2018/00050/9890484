Tl-201 myocardial perfusion SPECT: role of nitrate-augmented redistribution. TI-201 myocardial perfusion SPECT is commonly used to assess myocardial perfusion and viability. Nitrate-augmented redistribution with repeated injection facilitates the detection of reversible segments compared with standard redistribution. In this study, we investigated the potential of nitrate augmentation to improve myocardial perfusion and viability assessment without repeated injection and we also compared nitrate-augmented redistribution with delayed redistribution.Eighteen patients underwent a stress-redistribution TI-201 SPECT study. Immediately after redistribution SPECT, each patient was administered 0.6 mg glyceryl trinitrate and nitrate-augmented redistribution SPECT acquired 30 minutes later. Each patient then returned the next day and was injected with a booster dose of TI-201 30 minutes before the delayed redistribution SPECT acquisition. For each SPECT study, the myocardium was divided into 11 segments, and perfusion to each segment was scored on a four-point scale by consensus. An overall cardiac perfusion score was derived by summing the perfusion score for each segment.Reduced stress perfusion was identified in 150 segments: 23 (15.3%) had improved perfusion after redistribution 60 (40%) segments had improved perfusion after nitrate-augmented redistributionTI-201 SPECT with nitrate-augmented redistribution is as good or better than delayed redistribution with repeated injection for myocardial perfusion and viability assessment. TI-201 SPECT with nitrate-augmented redistribution has significant logistical and economic advantages over traditional delayed redistribution with TI-201 repeated injection.
