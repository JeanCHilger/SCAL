Colloidal aggregates of insoluble inclusions in human goiters. To shed some light on the physicochemical properties of the thyroid follicular colloid, we have screened retrospectively the autoradiographs of 60 human nodular goiters labeled 17 h preoperatively with 100 microCi 125I for evidence of colloid compartmentalization. In 87% (52/60) of all goiters examined, sporadic or multiple colloidal inclusions ('colloid stones') not mixing with newly labeled Tg were detected. The detailed analysis of 17 goiters revealed a mean incidence of 0.09+/-0.11 'colloid stones' of variable size per follicle ranging from 0.02+/-0.01 (10) to 0.43+/-0.09 (5) (mean values +/- S.D., number of sections examined in brackets). In this study we did not find a clear-cut association of incidence of 'colloid stones' with sex, age or nosologic group (hyperthyroid, preclinically hyperthyroid, euthyroid). The existence of different colloidal compartments as demonstrated in this and other studies is of considerable importance for thyroid function, interpretation of iodine kinetics, and studies on the role of iodine on growth and function of the thyrocytes. Different thyroidal iodine compartments could well be of functional relevance, for example in the adaptation of thyroid hormone secretion to antithyroid drugs or in severe and prolonged iodine deficiency, when very slow compartments become an important source of minimal quantities of iodine and thyroid hormone. 'Colloid stones', for example, may well explain the repeatedly observed, surprisingly large total iodine store in human endemic goiters, even in the presence of severe iodine deficiency. It is evident that the existence of multiple iodine compartments and, in particular, of particulate slow-turnover pools complicates the interpretation of total glandular iodine measurements with modern techniques such as X-ray fluorescence and positron emission tomography.
