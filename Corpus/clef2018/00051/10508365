I. Near C(3) symmetry is displayed by the 19-atom In-P polyhedron that forms the central structural unit in the title compound (see structure), which was synthesized by reaction of InCl(3) with PEt(3) and PhP(SiMe(3))(2). In addition to In-P bonds, the cage has In-In and P-P bonds. Six terminal chloro ligands and three PEt(3) ligands surround the cluster core which itself encloses a central chloride anion.
