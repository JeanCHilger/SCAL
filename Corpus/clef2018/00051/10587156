Gangliogliomas: characterization by registered positron emission tomography-MR images. The purpose of this study was to correlate 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) and MR imaging features of cerebral gangliogliomas before and after PET-MR image registration.After registration of PET and MR images, all six gangliogliomas in our series were shown to have heterogeneous metabolic activity. Areas of hypermetabolic activity were seen in all lesions. In five of the six cases, PET-MR image registration provided information regarding tumor metabolism that was not available on nonregistered hard-copy examinations.
