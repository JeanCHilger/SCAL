In vivo occupancy of striatal and temporal cortical D2/D3 dopamine receptors by typical antipsychotic drugs. [123I]epidepride single photon emission tomography (SPET) study. The dopamine hypothesis proposes that antipsychotic drugs act primarily through limbic cortical D2/D2-like dopamine receptor blockade.To evaluate this hypothesis with the D2/D3-selective SPET probe [123I]-epidepride.[123I]-epidepride SPET scans were performed on 12 patients with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotics and II age-matched healthy controls. [123I]-epidepride 'specific binding' to D2/D3 dopamine receptors was estimated, and relative percentage D2/D3 receptor occupancy by typical antipsychotic drugs determined.Mean (s.d.) daily dose was 669.12 (516.8) mg chlorpromazine equivalents. Mean percentage D2/D3 receptor occupancy was 81.6 (8.1) and 73.2 (13.9) in the temporal cortex and striatum respectively.Typical antipsychotic drug treatment is associated with substantial temporal cortical D2/D3 receptor occupancy. The relationship between this and efficacy is poor in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
