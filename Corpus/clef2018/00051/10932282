Ictal urinary urge indicates seizure onset in the nondominant temporal lobe. The authors describe six patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy whose seizures were characterized by an aura of ictal urinary urge. All seizures originated in the nondominant temporal lobe as evidenced from interictal spikes, ictal EEG, and MRI. Ictal SPECT, which was obtained in two patients, showed a hyperperfusion of the insular cortex, indicating a critical role of the insula for the generation of this symptom. Ictal urinary urge represents a new lateralizing sign indicating a seizure onset in the nondominant temporal lobe.
