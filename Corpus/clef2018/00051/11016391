Instrumental validation of percutaneous transmyocardial revascularization: follow-up data at one year. Despite the clinical efficacy of percutaneous transmyocardial revascularization (PTMR), up to date there are still no instrumental validations to demonstrate both the improved perfusion of treated areas and cardiac function.During the first year of follow-up after PTMR, 27 patients (group A) underwent 99mTc MIBI exercise-single photon emission tomography (SPET), while 30 patients (group B) underwent serial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) evaluations with analysis of cardiac volumes and subendocardial layer thickness in systole.All 57 patients had a significant angina Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class improvement. Group A patients (75%) had improved exercise-SPET perfusion in treated areas at 12 weeks after PTMR, and at the next follow-up. Group B patients had non-significant reduction in global volume and no significant change in ejection fraction. However, there was an improvement in thickness of the subendocardial-treated areas in systole that persisted during follow-up.The use of SPET and TTE validates the clinical efficacy of PTMR.
