A 2D/3D hybrid PET scanner with rotating partial slice-septa and its quantitative procedures. This paper presents a PET scanner capable of acquiring projection data in three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) modes simultaneously. The scanner has rotating partial slice-septa, and coincidence events are stored as 2D data or as 3D data depending on whether the lines of response are collimated by the septa or not. 68Ge/Ga rod sources can be set on the rotating septa, and a transmission scan for attenuation correction is performed in the 2D mode. The scanner allows simultaneous 3D-emission/2D-transmission scanning or post-injection transmission scanning with little cross-talk. A blank scan for detector normalization is also performed with the rotating rod sources in the 2D mode, from which we can derive the normalizing factors in both modes. The 3D/2D difference method is available for scatter correction, even in a dynamic study where the source distribution is changing. A 'summation method' is proposed as a new image reconstruction algorithm, in which the high- and low-frequency components of images are reconstructed from the 3D and 2D data respectively. In this method, most of the scatter contribution in the 3D data is removed by high-pass filtering, not by subtracting estimated scatter distribution, and hence the method is expected to be robust for scatter from outside the axial field of view. Computer simulations revealed that the rotating partial septa offer a single-scatter to true ratio similar to that of the conventional full septa if the depth of the partial septa is properly lengthened, with a small increase in multiple scattering.
