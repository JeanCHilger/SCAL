Functional imaging of the auditory cortex: role of magnetoencephalography. We present the different methods for detecting cerebral activity in the auditory cortex. Positron emission tomography (PET) and functional MRI (fMRI) measure such activity indirectly by calculating the blood flow rate or the consumption of oxygen. The direct methods of detection record the electrical or magnetic activity by eletroencephalography (EEG), or magnetoencephalography (MEG), respectively. The aim of this study was to define the role of MEG amongst these different techniques using the data from recordings of evoked magnetic fields in 5 healthy subjects. The localizations demonstrated the tonotopic organization of the auditory cortex, with high-pitched sounds showing a more medial cortical projection than low-pitched sounds. These various techniques are complementary. PET allows a pharmacological study of the cortex, and could be used in patients with cochlear implants. FMRI is non-invasive, and has a high spatial resolution. EEG has an excellent temporal resolution, and EEG recordings do not require major equipment or infrastructure. MEG has a better spatial resolution, with the same temporal resolution, as EEC. MEG is particularly useful in the localization of the cortical generators of middle-latency auditory evoked responses.
