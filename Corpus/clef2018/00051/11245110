Quantitative analysis of regional wall motion and thickening by quantitative gated SPECT: comparison with visual analysis. Electrocardiograph-gated myocardial SPECT permits a quantitative assessment of global and regional functions by quantitative gated SPECT software. To validate quantitative indexes of wall motion and wall thickening, the authors compared these indexes with visual scores.Gated myocardial SPECT was performed 60 minutes after the administration of Tc-99m sestamibi at rest in 42 patients with coronary artery disease. Regional wall motion (measured in millimeters and wall thickening (expressed as a percentage) were calculated by quantitative gated SPECT software in nine left ventricular myocardial segments and the results were compared with the five-point visual score interpretations of cinematic display.A high correlation of wall motion was observed between the quantitative and visual analyses (r = 0.810 P < 0.001). In addition, a high but somewhat less significant correlation of wall thickening was observed between the quantitative and visual analyses (r = 0.606In conclusion, regional wall motion and wall thickening can be evaluated quantitatively by electrocardiograph-gated myocardial SPECT and quantitative gated SPECT software. This will be useful for functional assessments made with various interventions.
