PET/SPECT: functional imaging beyond flow. In this review, first principles of positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) are discussed together with the relative strengths and weaknesses of both techniques. With both modalities it is possible to image and, especially with PET, to measure regional tissue function, the particular function being interrogated depending on the actual tracer being used. In the second part, the use of PET for neuroactivation studies is presented, illustrated with some key examples from the literature using both perfusion and metabolism tracers. It is argued that the future of PET (and SPECT) neuroactivation studies lies in the use of ligands. Possible approaches for performing ligand activation studies are discussed.
