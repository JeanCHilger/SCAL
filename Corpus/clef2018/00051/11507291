Tl-201 chloride and Tc-99m MIBI accumulation in lung adenocarcinoma in patients with and without distant metastases. The relation between Tl-201 chloride accumulation by the tumor and its distant metastatic potential were evaluated in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and compared with the same parameters achieved using Tc-99m MIBI.Fifty-six patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma were examined before therapy was begun. They were classified according to the radiologic findings and pathologic diagnosis into two groups: distant metastases and no distant metastases. All patients underwent dual-isotope imaging with Tl-201 chloride and Tc-99m MIBI. Regions of interest were placed over the tumor uptake (T) and contralateral normal lung tissue (N) areas on one transverse view with clearly defined lesions, and the T:N ratio and retention index were calculated.The early and delayed T:N ratios and retention index using Tl-201 chloride SPECT in the distant-metastases group were significantly greater (P < 0.001 to P < 0.05) than were those in the no-distant-metastases group. There was no significant correlation between the T:N ratio and retention index and distant metastatic potential using Tc-99m MIBI SPECT.Tl-201 chloride SPECT may be more effective than Tc-99m MIBI SPECT for evaluating the distant metastatic potential of primary lung adenocarcinoma.
