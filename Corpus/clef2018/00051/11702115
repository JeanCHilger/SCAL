FDG-PET for clinical use. Results of the 3rd German Interdisciplinary Consensus Conference, "Onko-PET III", 21 July and 19 September 2000. Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most powerful molecular imaging technique currently available for clinical use. Because deranged tumour metabolism is a common finding in many malignancies, PET is frequently used for tissue characterisation, staging and therapy control. Four previous consensus studies in Germany, performed up to 1997, have established indications for fluorine-18 fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET in oncology, neurology and cardiology. More than 10,000 references on FDG-PET have been published in the meantime, mostly on oncological issues. Therefore, it was the aim of the present paper to provide an update on the clinical use of FDG-PET in oncology. For this purpose a systematic literature search was performed in all common medical literature databases. All hits were manually checked and abstracts, case reports, technically oriented papers and reviews were excluded from analysis. A questionnaire comprising 24 items was developed for standardised quality assessment according to evidence-based medicine (EBM) criteria. We selected 533 papers for further review by an interdisciplinary panel of 58 experts from oncology, radiology and nuclear medicine. Clinical use was judged according to the following grading scheme: 1a, established clinical use 1b, clinical use probable
