Internal strontium-89 radiotherapy for malignant bony metastasis. This work was done to evaluate the indication, effectiveness, and side effects of internal radiotherapy with radioactive nuclide strontium-89 (89Sr) in patients with malignant metastasis in the bone.Fifty-six patients with skeletal metastasis received this internal radiotherapy. The patients were observed and followed up with respect to pain control, lesion improvement and side effects.The overall effective rate of pain control was 76.8% with the effective rate of prostatic cancer and breast cancer higher than 80%. The lesions in 81.8% patients as assessed by SPECT imaging, were improved. The mild lowering of white cells, platelets and red cells was the main side effect.Internal radiotherapy with 89Sr is very useful for patients with malignant cancer metastasis in the bone.
