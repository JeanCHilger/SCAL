Assessment of myocardial viability by positron emission tomography. Accurate assessment of myocardial viability is critical for identifying patients likely to benefit from coronary revascularization. Positron emission tomography (PET) has several advantages over single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), including higher sensitivity and specificity, as well as the ability to measure myocardial blood flow and myocardial metabolism in absolute terms, which is important in understanding the pathophysiology of ischemic cardiomyopathy. The most commonly used PET tracer is [18F]2-fluoro-2deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). The dependence of ischemic myocardium on glucose metabolism makes FDG an ideal tracer in this setting. Studies have shown positive and negative predictive values for the detection of viable myocardium in the range of 48-94%, and 73-96%, respectively. FDG is superior to SPECT using thallium or technetium myocardial perfusion agents, as well as echocardiography with dobutamine infusion. FDG PET also provides important prognostic information. Patients with evidence of myocardial viability by FDG PET have fewer cardiac events and survive longer if revascularized compared to patients who are treated medically. This article will review myocardial metabolism, PET procedures and interpretive criteria, as well as problems and limitations. Data from the literature regarding diagnostic and prognostic information will also be summarized.
