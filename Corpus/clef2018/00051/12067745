Neuroanatomy and neurophysiology in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a major mental disorder, characterized by their set of symptoms, including hallucinatory-delusional symptoms, thought disorder, emotional flattening, and social withdrawal. Since 1980s, advances in neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques have provided tremendous merits for investigations into schizophrenia as a brain disorder. In this article, we first overviewed neuroanatomical studies using structural magnetic resonance imaging (s-MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and postmortem brains, followed by neurophysiological studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), in patients with schizophrenia. Evidences from these studies suggest that schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder, structurally and functionally affecting various cortical and subcortical regions involved in cognitive, emotional, and motivational aspects of human behavior. Second, we reviewed recent investigations into neurobiological basis for schizophrenic symptoms (auditory hallucinations and thought disorder) using these indices as well as hemodynamic assessments such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional MRI (f-MRI). Finally, we addressed the issue of the heterogeneity of schizophrenia from the neurobiological perspective, in relation to the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological measures.
