Molecular imaging of cancer with positron emission tomography. The imaging of specific molecular targets that are associated with cancer should allow earlier diagnosis and better management of oncology patients. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a highly sensitive non-invasive technology that is ideally suited for pre-clinical and clinical imaging of cancer biology, in contrast to anatomical approaches. By using radiolabelled tracers, which are injected in non-pharmacological doses, three-dimensional images can be reconstructed by a computer to show the concentration and location(s) of the tracer of interest. PET should become increasingly important in cancer imaging in the next decade.
