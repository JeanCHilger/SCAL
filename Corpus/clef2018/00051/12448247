Left ventricular function and infarction size after primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction. There is little information available on long-term changes in left ventricular function and infarct size after acute myocardial infarction treated with primary angioplasty.From 1996 to 1998, 100 consecutive patients were treated with primary angioplasty for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Left ventricular ejection fraction was determined by radionuclide ventriculography before discharge, after six weeks and after a mean follow-up time of 20 months (range 11-37). Infarct size was assessed by technetium 99m-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion tomography (SPECT) at rest, performed at the same time intervals.Mean ejection fraction was 56% at discharge, 55% after six weeks and 57% after 20 months of follow-up. A mean perfusion defect of 19% was measured by SPECT after one week. After six weeks and 20 months of follow-up, the mean perfusion defects were reduced to 14% (p < 0.001) and 15%, respectively.Left ventricular function was well preserved and infarct sizes small to moderate 20 months (range 11-37) after primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction, demonstrating that the initial successful effect of the treatment was maintained.
