Preparation of [11C] radioligands with high specific radioactivity on a commercial PET tracer synthesizer. High specific radioactivity is required for receptor studies with PET. Hereby we wish to report our experience using Nuclear Interface PET Tracer Synthesizer for preparation of Carbon-11 radioligands and module's modifications, which allowed to achieve high specific radioactivity.
