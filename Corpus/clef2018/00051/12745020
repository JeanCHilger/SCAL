Synthesis of fluorine-18-labeled ciprofloxacin for PET studies in humans. Ciprofloxacin (1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid), a widely-prescribed antibiotic, was labeled with fluorine-18 with the aim to perform positron emission tomography studies in humans for pharmacokinetic measurements. Due to a lack of chemical activation of ciprofloxacin for a direct nucleophilic exchange reaction a novel two-step synthetic approach, which employed an activated 6-fluoro-7-chloro substituted precursor molecule, was developed. The radiosynthesis yielded, starting from 52.5 +/- 11.3 GBq of [(18)F]fluoride, 1.3 +/- 0.6 GBq (n = 13) [(18)F]ciprofloxacin ready for intravenous administration in about 130 min synthesis time. A series of analytical tests was performed in order to prove the identity of the radiolabeled compound and its suitability for human applications.
