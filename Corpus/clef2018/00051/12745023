18F]Fluoroazomycinarabinofuranoside (18FAZA) and [18F]Fluoromisonidazole (18FMISO): a comparative study of their selective uptake in hypoxic cells and PET imaging in experimental rat tumor. The present study compares the uptake of [(18)F]Fluoroazomycinarabinofuranoside ((18)FAZA), a recently developed hypoxia tracer for PET imaging of tissue hypoxia, with an established tracer [(18)F]Fluoromisonidazole ((18)FMISO) both in vitro, using Walker 256 rat carcinosarcoma cells, and in vivo in experimental rat tumors eleven to twelve days after tumor cell implantation. In vitro studies indicated that hypoxia-selective uptake of both (18)FAZA and (18)FMISO in tumor cells, 20 and 100 minutes post-incubation was of the same magnitude (20 min: 1.24 +/- 0.4% ((18)FAZA) 1.19 +/- 0.7% ((18)FMISO)
