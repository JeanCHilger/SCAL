The human action recognition system and its relationship to Broca's area: an fMRI study. Primate studies have identified populations of neurons that are capable of action recognition. These "mirror neurons" show spiking activity both when the monkey executes or observes a grasping movement. These neurons are located in the ventral premotor cortex, possibly the homologue of "Broca's area" in human. This led to the speculation that action recognition and language production share a common system [Trends Neurosci. 21 (1998), 188]. To test this hypothesis, we combined an action recognition with a language production (VERB) and a grasping movement task (MOVE) by using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Action recognition-related activation was observed in the left inferior frontal gyrus and on the border between the inferior frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus (defined as IFG/PG), the ventral occipitotemporal junction, the superior and inferior parietal cortex, and in the intraparietal sulcus in the left hemisphere. An overlap of activations due to the language production, movement execution, and action recognition was found in the parietal cortex, the left inferior frontal gyrus, and the IFG-PG border (IFG/PG). The activation peaks of action recognition and verb generation were always different in single subjects, but no consistent spatial relationship was detected, in accord with the hypothesis that action recognition and language production share a common functional architecture.
