Immunoscintigraphic localization of renal tumours in an extracorporeal perfusion model with a monoclonal antibody against gamma-glutamyltransferase. Monoclonal antibody 138H11 against human gamma-glutamyltransferase has been shown to react immunohistochemically with 98% of all tested clear-cell type and chromophilic renal cell carcinomas, but not with renal chromophobic carcinomas, Duct-Bellini carcinomas or oncocytomas. In normal kidney the target epitopes of mAb 138H11 are located in the luminal brush-border membrane of proximal tubule cells, whereas in renal carcinomas the epitopes are found surrounding the whole tumour cells. These results form the basis of the present immunoscintigraphic study designed to evaluate mAb 138H11 in an extracorporeal perfusion model. Immediately after nephrectomy, human tumour-bearing kidneys were perfused with 99mTc-labelled mAb 138H11 in Euro-Collins solution. High specific uptake in 4/4 renal clear cell carcinomas could be demonstrated by planar immunoscintigraphy and single-photon-emission computed tomography, "regions of interest" investigation and immunohistochemistry. In contrast, a perfused oncocytoma showed up as an unlabelled lesion. The results indicate a possible use for mAb 138H11 in immunoscintigraphy or even therapy, provided high tumour uptake can be confirmed in patients.
