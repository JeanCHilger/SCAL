Assessment of myocardial viability with 201Tl myocardial SPECT 24 hours after injection. Recently many investigators reported that conventional stress-redistribution myocardial scintigraphy with 201Tl underestimated the presence of ischemic but viable myocardium. We studied the usefulness of 24 hour 201Tl myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to assess myocardial viability and investigated the factors affect to the quality of 24 hour SPECT images. Study patients were consisted with 70 patients with old myocardial infarction (OMI), 72 patients with angina pectoris without OMI (AP) and 43 patients with angiographically proven normal coronary arteries. To obtain SPECT images, 10 minute and 4 hour imagings were sampled 30 seconds per projection. Twenty-four hour imaging was sampled 60 seconds per projection. Twenty-four hour images were visually interpreted as good, moderate and poor quality. Then study patients were divided into 2 groups, group A with good 24 hour images and group B with moderate or poor 24 hour images. One hundred and fifty-eight patients (85.4%) of study patients had 24 hour SPECT images on a good quality. Only 4 patients (2.2%) had poor quality SPECT. All of these 4 patients had broad myocardial infarction. In patients with OMI 61 patients (87.1%), in AP 63 patients (87.5%) and in normal 35 patients (81.4%) had a good 24 hour SPECT. Total sampling counts and myocardial ROI counts were significantly higher in group A than in group B. Body weight was significantly higher and there were more male patients in group B than in group A. Late redistribution was seen in 20 patients (28.5%) with OMI and in 11 patients (15.3%) with AP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
