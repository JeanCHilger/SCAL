Analysis of stereoisomers involved products of synthesized 18F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-mannose (FDM) is eventually involved in side products of 18F-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) synthesized by the acetylhypofluorite method. We attempted the measurement of existence ratio of FDM and FDG, FDM alpha and FDM beta, FDG alpha and FDG beta by 400 MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The ratio of FDM to FDG were 4.0%. The amounts of FDG beta were much larger than those of FDG alpha. The difference between the amounts of FDM alpha and FDM beta were not significant. 1H-NMR spectroscopy could be utilized in quantitative analysis of products and byproducts in cyclotron chemicals. The FDM in FDG synthesized in our cyclotron system was not considered to affect a lot of influence in PET study.
