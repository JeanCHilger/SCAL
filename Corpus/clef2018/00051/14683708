Assessment of microPET performance in analyzing the rat brain under different types of anesthesia: comparison between quantitative data obtained with microPET and ex vivo autoradiography. MicroPET (positron emission tomography) has been implemented for use in experiments with small animals. However, the quantification and optimal conditions for scanning are not established yet. The aim of this study was to compare the results obtained by microPET with those by ex vivo autoradiography of rat brain slices, based on the 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) method, and to establish the optimal conditions for scanning. As an example, we examined glucose metabolism in the rat brain under 6 types of anesthesia and in the conscious state. The scanning conditions for the rat brain were (1) use of a 4-mm-thick leaden jacket, (2) an energy window of 350-650 keV, and (3) a coincidence time window of 6 ns. Under these conditions, the quantitative ROI data from microPET showed a good correlation with the corresponding ROI data from FDG autoradiography in the animal study (r2=0.81). With our protocol, when anesthesia was started 40 min after the FDG injection, the glucose metabolism was almost the same as that in the conscious rat brain.
