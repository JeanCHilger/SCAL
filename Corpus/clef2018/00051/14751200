Focal network involvement in generalized seizures: new insights from electroconvulsive therapy. Generalized seizures are commonly thought to involve the entire brain homogeneously. However, recent evidence suggests that selective cortical-subcortical networks may be crucial for the initiation, propagation, and behavioral manifestations of generalized seizures, while other brain regions are relatively spared. Here we review previous studies, and describe a new human model system for the investigation of generalized seizures: single-photon emission computed tomography, ictal-interictal difference imaging of generalized tonic-clonic seizures induced by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Bitemporal ECT activates focal bilateral frontotemporal and parietal association cortex, sparing other regions bifrontal ECT activates mainly prefrontal cortex
