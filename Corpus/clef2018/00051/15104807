Confocal Raman microscopy of morphological changes in poly(ethylene terephthalate) film induced by supercritical CO(2). Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film was exposed to supercritical (sc) CO(2) and confocal Raman microscopy was used to investigate the morphological changes induced. The study evaluates the use of oil and dry objectives in confocal mode to obtain depth profiles of PET film. These results were compared with the data obtained by mapping of the film cross-section. A significant gradient of degree of crystallinity normal to the surface of PET film down to 60 microm has been observed. The gradient of the degree of morphological changes are functions of exposure time and pressure.
