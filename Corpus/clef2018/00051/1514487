Side effects during adenosine thallium imaging with single-port or double-port infusion protocols. The double-port infusion protocol during adenosine thallium imaging involves the use of two infusion systems, one for adenosine and one for thallium. The single-port infusion protocol, on the other hand, uses one infusion system both adenosine and thallium are injected via a "Y" connection. This study examined the possibility that the single infusion system, by displacing a column of blood filled with adenosine, may be responsible for a greater incidence of side effects. In a parallel study, 140 patients underwent adenosine thallium imaging with the single-port system (group 1) and 140 patients underwent imaging with the double-port system (group 2). Both groups were comparable in age (67 +/- 10 years vs 64 +/- 11 years), gender (men comprised 56% of patients in group 1 and 64% in group 2), resting heart rate, and systolic blood pressure. More patients in group 1 had chest pains (57% vs 44%
