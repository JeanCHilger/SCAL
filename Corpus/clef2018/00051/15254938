Visual hallucination in Parkinson's disease with FDG PET. To determine the characteristics of cerebral glucose metabolism in Parkinson's disease patients with visual hallucinations, group comparison studies using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography were performed. Nondemented Parkinson's disease patients in advanced stages were classified into two groups: (1) patients without visual hallucinations (2) patients with visual hallucinations. Compared to patients without hallucinations, the relative regional cerebral glucose metabolic rate was greater in the frontal areas in patients with visual hallucinations, and the increase reached a significant level in the left superior frontal gyrus. Relative frontal hypermetabolism may be a feature of Parkinson's disease patients with visual hallucinations.
