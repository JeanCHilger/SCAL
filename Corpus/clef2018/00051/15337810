Receptor imaging in oncology by means of nuclear medicine: current status. To date, our understanding of the role of receptors and their cognate ligands in cancer is being successfully translated into the design and development of an arsenal of new, less toxic, and more specific anticancer drugs. Because most of these novel drugs are cytostatic, objective response as measured by morphologic imaging modalities (eg, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) cannot be used as a surrogate marker for drug development or for clinical decision making. Positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to image and quantify the in vivo distribution of positron-emitting radioisotopes such as oxygen-15, carbon-11, and fluorine-18 that can be substituted or added into biologically relevant and specific receptor radioligands. Similarly, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can be used to image and quantify the in vivo distribution of receptor targeting compounds labeled with indium-111, technetium-99m, and iodine-123. By virtue of their whole-body imaging capacity and the absence of errors of sampling and tissue manipulation as well as preparation, both techniques have the potential to address locoregional receptor status noninvasively and repetitively. This article reviews available data on the in vivo evaluation of receptor systems by means of PET or SPECT for identifying and monitoring patients with sufficient receptor overexpression for tailored therapeutic interventions, and also for depicting tumor tissue and determining the currently largely unknown heterogeneity in receptor expression among different tumor lesions within and between patients.
