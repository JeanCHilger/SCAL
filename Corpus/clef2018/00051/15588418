Influence of culture method on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human adipo-stromal cells in nonwoven fabrics. The initial attachment, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of stromal cells from human fat tissue were investigated in three-dimensional nonwoven fabrics prepared from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fiber with different diameters. The largest number of cells initially attached was observed in the nonwoven fabrics prepared from PET fiber with a diameter of 22.0 microm, irrespective of fabric porosity. The number of cells attached was larger and the cells were distributed more homogeneously in the fabrics by the agitated seeding method than by the static seeding method. The culture method depended on the time profile of cell proliferation. Cell proliferation improved in the following order: stirred (spinner flask) culture method > agitated culture method > static culture method. In addition, cells proliferated homogeneously in fabrics by the stirred culture method. When evaluated as a measurement of cell osteogenic differentiation, the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was not influenced by the diameter of fabrics. The static culture method tended to enable cells to enhance ALP activity, in contrast with the stirred and agitated culture methods. It is concluded that fabric fiber diameter and culture method greatly affected the proliferation and differentiation of cells in nonwoven fabrics.
