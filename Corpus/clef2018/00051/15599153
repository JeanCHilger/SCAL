Positive end-expiratory pressure above lower inflection point minimizes influx of activated neutrophils into lung. To compare the effects of low vs. high tidal volume (Vt) with three positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) strategies on activated neutrophil influx into the lung.Prospective, randomized controlled animal study.Animal laboratory in a university hospital.Newborn piglets.Surfactant-depleted piglets were randomized in littermate pairs to PEEP of either 0 (zero end-expiratory pressure [ZEEP]VT and PEEP changes on influx constants of 18FDG were assessed by analysis of variance. A within-litter comparison of Vt was nonsignificant (p = .50). A between-litter comparison, ordered in linear trend rank, from ZEEP, to PEEP 8, to PEEP>LIP, showed a strong effect of PEEP on influx constant (p = .019).PEEP set above the LIP on the inspiratory limb of the pressure-volume curve affords a stronger lung protection than VT strategy.
