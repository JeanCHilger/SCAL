Higher Gensini score of coronary arteries in acute inferior myocardial infarction with precordial ST-segment depression. To investigate the significance of precordial ST-segment depression in acute inferior myocardial infarction, we compared the Gensini score of coronary artery stenosis between 2 groups of patients with and without precordial ST-segment depression. Group I consisted of 28 patients who showed ST-segment depression on admission (greater than or equal to 1 mm in V2-V6) and Group II (n = 16) those without ST-segment depression (less than 1 mm). The Gensini score of the coronary arteries (56 +/- 29 vs. 28 +/- 18 p less than 0.001), the partial score of the infarction-related artery (29 +/- 16 vs. 17 +/- 11
