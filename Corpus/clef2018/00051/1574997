Estimation of regional cerebral utilization of [11C]-L-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylalanine (DOPA) in the primate by positron emission tomography. The intracerebral kinetics of [11C]-labelled L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, L-DOPA, was investigated in rhesus monkeys by positron emission tomography (PET). Through the labelling of the L-DOPA molecule in different positions and observation of a series of pharmacological challenges it was possible to establish that the kinetic conversion of the radiotracer in the striatum represents the process of decarboxylation to [11C]-labelled dopamine. The rate constant for this process can be estimated using a two-compartment model. The use of [11C]-L-DOPA and PET will thus provide a possibility for in vivo studies of blood-brain barrier transport of the amino acid as well as for the estimation of the ability for brain tissue to decarboxylate the tracer by the action of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase.
