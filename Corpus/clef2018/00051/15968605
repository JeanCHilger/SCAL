Myocardial perfusion in women with systemic lupus erythomatosus and no symptoms of coronary artery disease. The aim of the study was to assess myocardial perfusion in women with systemic lupus erythomatosus (SLE) and no symptoms of coronary artery disease (CAD).Twenty two women with SLE of mean age 40.5 +/- 7.2 were enrolled in the study. The average duration time of the disease was from 2 to 19 years, mean 8 +/- 4.6 years. The inclusion criterion was the absence of stenocardial symptoms. The myocardial perfusion was studied by using Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) utilising (99m)Tc-MIBI and a triple-head gamma-camera. We also analyzed risk factors of heart ischemic disease in our group.Myocardial perfusion stress scanning showed abnormal perfusion in 12 patients, 54.5% of the whole group, mostly in the anterior wall. At rest hypoperfusion abnormalities were found in 7 individuals. In patients with positive myocardial perfusion, out scanning, risk factors of CAD were more pronounced than in a sub-group with a negative result of myocardial perfusion scanning.In young women with SLE and no symptoms of coronary artery disease, myocardial perfusion defects may be detected by means of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. Exercise and resting electrocardiography tests could be not sufficient for CAD diagnosis in women with SLE. The presence of coronary artery disease risk factors in women with SLE could be an indication to perform myocardial perfusion SPECT scanning.
