Application of PET-CT for diagnosis of cancer. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), which is applied to the phenomenon of activated uptake of glucose in tumor cells, has been widely used and recognized as an excellent nuclear medicine examination for detecting almost any kind of tumor. However, PET is not good to identify the anatomical location of lesions, examinees actually need to view both PET and CT or MRI images. PET-CT was established in 2000, and recently approved by MHLW in December 2003. The image of PET-CT is momentarily fused from both the PET and CT image, namely the functional and anatomical image. Thus, PET-CT achieves more accurate and convenient identification of tumors.
