Use of human VEGF(165) gene for therapeutic angiogenesis in coronary patients: first results. The paper presents the first results of therapeutic angiogenesis in clinical cardiosurgery: human VEGF(165) gene transplantation to coronary patients. The use of this therapeutic method is particularly effective in patients with inoperable cardiovascular injuries, i.e. patients with the most severe condition, in whom treatment remains little effective at the modern level of cardiosurgery development.
