Imaging in the evaluation of the patient with suspected acute coronary syndrome. Over the last decade, major advances have been made in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes (ACSs). However, effective implementation of these treatments requires timely and accurate identification of the high-risk patient among all those presenting to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms suggestive of ACS. The opportunity for improving outcomes is time-dependent, so that early identification of the patient who has true ACS is essential. This necessity further increases the need for rapid triage tools, especially in the current setting of ED and hospital overcrowding that has become the norm in large urban centers.
