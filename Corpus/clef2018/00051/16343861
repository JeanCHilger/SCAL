Striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability in male smokers. It has been reported that the activation of the nicotine receptor evokes central endogenous dopamine release. However, whether smoking affects striatal dopamine D(2)/D(3) availability over the long run has not been well established in vivo. Fifteen male smokers and their matching controls were recruited. Striatal dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor availability was assessed by single photon emission computed tomography with [(123)]IBZM Iodo-benzaimide. There was no significant difference in striatal D(2)/D(3) receptor availability between smokers and controls.
