Guest exchange dynamics in an M4L6 tetrahedral host. Guest exchange in an M(4)L(6) supramolecular assembly was previously demonstrated to proceed through a nonrupture mechanism in which guests squeeze through apertures in the host structure and not through larger portals created by partial assembly dissociation. Focusing on the [Ga(4)L(6)](12-) assembly [L = 1,5-bis(2',3'-dihydroxybenzamido)naphthalene], the host-guest kinetic behavior of this supramolecular capsule is defined. Guest self-exchange rates at varied temperatures and pressures were measured to determine activation parameters, revealing negative DeltaS and positive DeltaV values [PEt(4)(+): DeltaH = 74(3) kJ mol(-1), DeltaS = -46(6) J mol(-1) K(-1), k(298) = 0.003 s(-)) NEt(4)(+): DeltaH = 69(2) kJ mol(-1), DeltaS = -52(5) J mol(-1) K(-1), k(298) = 0.009 s(-1)
