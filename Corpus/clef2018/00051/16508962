Adhesion and proliferation of fibroblasts on RF plasma-deposited nanostructured fluorocarbon coatings: evidence of FAK activation. We used combined plasma-deposition process to deposit smooth and nanostructured fluorocarbon coatings on polyethylenethereftalate (PET) substrates, to obtain surfaces with identical chemical composition and different roughness, and investigate the effect of surface nanostructures on adhesion and proliferation of 3T3 Swiss Albino Mouse fibroblasts. Untreated PET and polystyrene (PS) were used as controls for cell culture. We have found that the statistically significant increase of cell proliferation rate and FAK (a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase) activation detected on ROUGH fluorocarbon surfaces is due to the presence of nanostructures. Changes in cytoskeletal organization and phospho FAK (tyr 397) localization were evident after 60 min on cells adhering to ROUGH surfaces. This change was characterized by the formation of actin stress fibers along lamellar membrane protrusion instead of usual focal contacts. Also the morphology of the adhering fibroblasts (60 min) adhering on ROUGH surfaces was found quite different compared to cells adhering on smooth ones.
