Dual-tracer dopamine transporter and perfusion SPECT in differential diagnosis of parkinsonism using template-based discriminant analysis. Clinical differential diagnosis in parkinsonism can be difficult especially at early stages. We investigated whether combined perfusion and dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging can aid in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders: idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), dementia with Lewy bodies (LBD), and essential tremor (ET).One hundred twenty-nine patients were studied, retrospectively (69 males 24 MSA, 12 PSP, 8 LBD, 27 ET, and 58 IPDCharacteristic patterns for perfusion and DAT were found for all pathologies. In the parkinson-plus group, MSA, PSP, and LBD could be discriminated in 100% (+CV) of the cases. When including IPD, discrimination accuracy was 82.4% (99% without CV). 2beta-Carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane imaging as a single technique was able to discriminate between ET and neurodegenerative forms with an accuracy of 93.0% (+CV) inclusion of perfusion information augmented this slightly to 97.4% (+CV).Dual-tracer DAT and perfusion SPECT in combination with discrimination analysis allows an automated, accurate differentiation between the most common forms of parkinsonism in a clinically relevant setting.
