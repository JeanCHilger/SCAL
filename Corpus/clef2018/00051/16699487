Dermatological zoonosis by fungi in Japan. Dermatophytosis, cryptococcosis and sporotrichosis are dermatological zoonosis caused by fungi. Control of dermatophytosis is still difficult, although it is well known as a transmittable disease from animal to human. Exotic animals such as hamster, guinea pig and rabbit, some imported from foreign countries, have become a frequent source of human dermatophytosis, and the emergence of fungal pathogens followed. The nasal cavity of dogs and cats is an important reservoir of pathogens of cryptococcosis, in addition to bird droppings. Though there have been many reports of human sporotrichosis caused by patients' pet, especially cats in Europe and U.S., since there has been no report of zoonotic transmission of sporotrichosis, zoonosis is not believed do be present in Japan. The interrelation and cooperation of medical and veterinary doctors and all other scientists involved is therefore required to prevent fungal zoonosis, because the condition may be partly due to changes in the environments of human and animal life and the more intimate relationships between humans and animals.
