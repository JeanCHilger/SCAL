123I-IMT SPECT for evaluation of the response to radiation therapy in high grade gliomas: a feasibility study. Assessing response to radiation therapy in patients with high grade gliomas is needed upon making decisions toward further therapy strategies. Currently used standard imaging tools such as CT and MRI are not sensitive enough to detect early therapy effects. We prospectively investigated if single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using radiolabelled amino acid derivate (123)I-methyltyrosine (IMT) would be useful for this aim. 10 patients with histologically proven high grade gliomas, who were candidates for radiation therapy, were enrolled in this investigation. All patients were examined by IMT SPECT before radiation therapy and 4 weeks after the initiation of the hypofractionated application of 40 Gy. Patients were followed up for 39 months the tumours to background ratios (T/B) for IMT under/before radiation therapy were correlated to survival times. Initially, SPECT depicted an abnormal intratumoural IMT uptake in all patients (mean T/B ratios 1.37-1.87). In four out of 10 patients, the mean T/B ratios decreased by more than 10% under radiation therapy. In six other patients, the BQ decreased by less than 10% or increased. There were no significant correlations between the degree of changes in T/B and survival (r = -0.1, p = 0.973). Serial IMT SPECT measurements allow detection of changes in amino acid accumulation in high-grade gliomas under radiation therapy. However, these changes seem to possess no prognostic value in respect to survival prediction.
