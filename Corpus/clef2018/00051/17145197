Heterogeneous factors in dementia with Parkinson's disease: IMP-SPECT study. Nature of the dementing process in Parkinson's disease, and particularly its relationship with Alzheimer's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease or frontal dementia remains controversial.We hypothesize that origins of dementia in Parkinson's disease are heterogeneous, so we compared cortical regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) between Parkinson's disease patients with and without dementia.Forty consecutive patients with Hoehn-Yahr stage III or IV Parkinson's disease were used (13 patients had dementia (PDD group), and 27 patients had no dementia (PDND group)).There were significant rCBF reductions in the left parietal association cortex and left frontal association cortex in PDD. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that only rCBF of the left frontal association cortex was significant. PDD patients were divided into three groups according to rCBF patterns: frontal hypoperfusion group, Alzheimer's disease-like group, and diffuse Lewy body disease-like group.Controversial study results involving PDD patients may be mainly due to heterogeneity in dementing processes in Parkinson's disease.
