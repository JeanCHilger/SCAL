Optimizing experimental protocols for quantitative behavioral imaging with 18F-FDG in rodents. Small-animal PET provides the opportunity to image brain activation during behavioral tasks in animal models of human conditions. The present studies aimed to simplify behavioral imaging procedures without a loss of quantitation by using an intraperitoneal route of administration (no cannulation, no anesthesia) and using a standardized uptake value (SUV) to reduce scan duration.Sixteen animals with carotid artery cannulations were studied with 18F-FDG small-animal PET accompanied by serial arterial blood sampling. Ten of these animals were anesthetized and were inside the tomograph during 18F-FDG uptake, whereas 6 animals were awake in their home cages and scanned after 60 min of uptake. Of the 10 anesthetized animals, 6 received intraperitoneal 18F-FDG, whereas 4 received intravenous 18F-FDG, and all 6 awake animals received intraperitoneal 18F-FDG. Intravenously injected animals were positioned far enough inside the tomograph to obtain region-of-interest-based measures from the heart and the brain. In all animals, a full arterial input function and plasma glucose levels were obtained. To establish the optimal time during 18F-FDG uptake for blood sampling when using an SUV, a Patlak kinetic model was used to derive absolute rates of glucose metabolism and compared with SUVs calculated using different plasma points from the arterial input function.A single plasma point taken at 60 min after injection for intraperitoneal injections or 45 min after injection for intravenous injections provides a sensitive index of glucose metabolic rate with the highest correlation with data obtained from a fully quantitative input function.These studies support an experimental protocol in which animals can receive the 18F-FDG tracer injection intraperitoneally, away from the small-animal tomograph and with minimal impact on behavior. Further, animals can occupy the tomograph bed for a 10- to 30-min scan with a consequent increase in animal throughput.
