Development of the automated Patlak plot method and its verification in clinical examples. The Patlak plot method is widely used in general clinical practice to calculate mean cerebral blood flow (mCBF) because it does not require arterial blood sampling and the procedure used is relatively simple. However, it has been pointed out that the calculation is affected by operator subjectivity and experience, and reproducibility is poor when the operator changes. The Patlak plot method consists of the following three procedures: (1) a region of interest (ROI) in the normal cerebral hemisphere is chosen to obtain the time-activity curve (2) an ROI in the aortic arch is determined to obtain the time-activity curve
