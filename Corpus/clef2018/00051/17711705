Evaluation of myocardial viability with 201Tl/18F-FDG DISA-SPECT technique in patients with acute myocardial infarction after emergent intracoronary autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells transplantation. To evaluate the myocardial viability with (201)Tl/(18)F-FDG DISA-SPECT technique in patients with acute myocardial infarction underwent emergent intracoronary autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) transplantation.Patients with first acute myocardial infarction underwent emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either intracoronary transplantation of autologous BM-MNC (n = 20) or to sodium chloride concluding heparin (control, n = 20) via a micro infusion catheter group immediately after PCI. Change in global left ventricular function (LVEF measured by echocardiography) and the myocardial viability detected by (201)Tl/(18)F-FDG DISA-SPECT from baseline and 6-months post transplantation were analyzed.Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was improved in both groups and the absolute increase (DeltaLVEF) in BM-MNC group was significantly higher than that in control group (7.6% +/- 2.8% vs. 3.0% +/- 2.8%, P < 0.001). In addition, the absolute decrease of myocardial infusion defect detected by (201)Tl SPECT was more significant in BM-MNC group than that in control group (6.7% +/- 3.0% vs. 2.6% +/- 2.6%, P < 0.001) and the number of mismatched segments (indicating viable myocardium) detected by (18)F-FDG SPECT in border zone was also significantly higher in BM-MNC group than that in control group.Improved myocardial viability and reduced myocardial infusion defect post emergent intracoronary transplantation of autologous BM-MNC in patients with acute myocardial infarction could be detected by (201)Tl/(18)F-FDG DISA-SPECT technique.
