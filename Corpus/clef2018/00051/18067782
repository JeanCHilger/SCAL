Single-center report of 5-year follow-up on 94 patients underwent transmyocardial laser revascularization. Transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMLR) has been used in the treatment of patients with end-stage coronary artery disease (CAD) since 1990. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of TMLR in patients with diffuse CAD.Ninety-four consecutive patients underwent TMLR in one center from July 1997 to December 2000. The follow-up data of these patients were obtained through face-to-face, mail questionnaires, or telephone interviews in July 2004 and December 2004. Four cases failed to respond. Mean follow-up time was (5.5 +/- 1.0) years.Mean Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) angina scores of TMLR patients were 3.1 +/- 0.8 at baseline, 1.7 +/- 0.9 at 1 year (P < 0.05), 1.7 +/- 0.9 at 3 years (P < 0.05), and 1.9 +/- 0.9 at 5 years (P < 0.05). At an average of 5 years, 69% of the patients had > or = 1 angina class reduction, mean NYHA class level (1.9 +/- 0.9) ameliorated compared to the baseline (2.5 +/- 0.7, P < 0.001), the rate of re-hospitalization was 2.7 times/person. Kaplan-Meier survival rate was 87% at 1 year, 69% at 3 years and 64% at 5 years. The causes of death were attributed more to heart failure (58.9%) and myocardial infraction (14.7%) after TMLR. The patients with no angina relief, or who died after TMLR, had a higher percentage of preoperative unstable anginas or prior myocardial infraction compared to the survivors. The assorted shapes of myocardial laser channels were detected in some patients by the color Doppler velocity technique.TMLR provided a long-term improvement in the quality of life, including CCS angina class or NYHA heart functional class for about 70% of Chinese patients with severely disabling angina pectoris. The various myocardial laser channels would always be visible after TMLR. 5-years after TMLR as a sole therapy, the survival rate of the patients was 64%.
