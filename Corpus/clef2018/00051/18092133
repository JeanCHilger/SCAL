Quantitative FDG-uptake by positron emission tomography in progressive hypertrophy of rat hearts in vivo. Quantitative myocardial fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for assessing glucose uptake in vivo is reliable in normal rat heart.To assess the applicability of myocardial FDG-PET on multiple occasions in the longitudinal disease process of progressive hypertrophy of rat heart.Six salt-sensitive Dahl rats (Dahl-S) developing progressive hypertrophy with subsequent dilated cardiomyopathy were compared with salt-resistant Dahl rats (controls). FDG-PET was applied twice at early stage (ES: 14-18 weeks) and at late stage (LS: 22-26 weeks) of hypertrophy. Standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated for comparing between different animal weights and different injection dosages of FDG. For validating the quantitative study, radioactivity of a total of 36 tissue samples was compared with the corresponding PET values.The left ventricular mass in Dahl-S increased by 17% at ES and by 25% at LS. The SUV in Dahl-S was 95% of controls at ES and reduced to 62% at LS (P=0.023). The heart function started to deteriorate after LS. Linear regression analysis showed a good correlation between the radioactivity of tissue samples and PET values (Y=1.20X, P<0.0001, R2=0.979).Small animal PET studies on longitudinal multiple occasions in vivo were feasible and useful for the repeating assessment of glucose uptake. The reduction of glucose uptake in progressive hypertrophy of heart over time may precede its progression to heart failure.
