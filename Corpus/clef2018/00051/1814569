Regional cerebral glucose metabolism compared in rodents and humans. In order to compare regional brain glucose metabolism in rats and humans, this parameter was measured using Sokoloff's deoxyglucose method in rats, and positron emission tomography with magnetic resonance imaging in humans. An atlas of cerebral regions of interest common to both species was developed to facilitate the evaluation of the relationship in regional values. We found among the regions studied a significant positive correlation in their metabolic values (r = 0.72, P less than 0.001) and coefficients of variation (r = 0.59, P less than 0.01) suggesting that regional brain glucose consumption is comparable between rat and human. Results of this study support the view that rat and human brain may be phylogenetically linked functionally as well as anatomically.
