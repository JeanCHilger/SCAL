Estimation of relative regional neuroreceptor concentration by PET or SPECT: Theoretical comparisons of using a single late image or a late plus early image. The potential for using a single (SPECT) single-photon-emission computed tomography or (PET) positron emission tomography image to estimate quantitatively the relative regional neuroreceptor concentration depends on acquiring the image at a time when changes in the regional radioactivity localization are much more sensitive to changes in receptor concentration than to changes in delivery. Using the binding of [(11)C]carfentanil to the opiate receptor as a model, the authors have applied a computer simulation approach to determine the joint and marginal probability distributions for the ipsilateral/contralateral ratio of receptor concentrations and delivery. They have found that the probability distributions depend on the sensitivities for both delivery and receptor. Incorporation of data at an early time point results in a significant sharpening of the probability distributions. There is an insignificant effect of subtraction of the radioactivity localization in a control region.
