3-D maximum a posteriori estimation for single photon emission computed tomography on massively-parallel computers. A fully three-dimensional (3-D) implementation of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) method for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is demonstrated. The 3-D reconstruction exhibits a major increase in resolution when compared to the generation of the series of separate 2-D slice reconstructions. As has been noted, the iterative EM algorithm for 2-D reconstruction is highly computational the 3-D algorithm is far worse. To accommodate the computational complexity, previous work in the 2-D arena is extended, and an implementation on the class of massively parallel processors of the 3-D algorithm is demonstrated. Using a 16000- (4000-) processor MasPar/DECmpp-Sx machine, the algorithm is demonstrated to execute at 2.5 (7.8) s/EM-iteration for the entire 64x64x64 cube of 96 planar measurements obtained from the Siemens Orbiter rotating camera operating in the high-resolution mode.
