Predictors, procedures, and perspective for temporal lobe epilepsy surgery. Surgery for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy is established as a promising treatment option. Although practiced for decades now, there is an ongoing discussion on who is a candidate, when we should operate, how the preoperative evaluation and surgery should be performed, and what perspective will result for the individual after surgery. In light of significant improvements with respect to safety and outcome, generally accepted features will be extracted, and some more ambivalent aspects will be discussed. Major future developments in this field will be based on multimodal imaging and correlation with electro-clinical and neuropsychological findings.
