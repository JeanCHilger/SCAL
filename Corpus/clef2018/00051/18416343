Update in liver imaging. Over the last decade, liver imaging has experienced a revolution providing a bewildering array of options for detection and characterisation of liver lesions. Cross-sectional imaging modalities like computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have improved in speed and resolution, thereby facilitating multiphasic scanning of the liver. The advent of the use of contrast agents for ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging has further paved the way for definitive diagnosis in an attempt to obviate the need for invasive diagnosis. This article captures advances made in ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography and brings the specialist up to date with the latest in liver imaging.
