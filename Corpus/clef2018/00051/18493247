alpha2A-adrenoceptor antagonism increases insulin secretion and synergistically augments the insulinotropic effect of glibenclamide in mice. The imidazoline-type alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonists (+/-)-efaroxan and phentolamine increase insulin secretion and reduce blood glucose levels. It is not known whether they act by antagonizing pancreatic beta-cell alpha2-adrenoceptors or by alpha2-adrenoceptor-independent mechanisms. Many imidazolines inhibit the pancreatic beta-cell KATP channel, which is the molecular target of sulphonylurea drugs used in the treatment of type II diabetes. To investigate the mechanisms of action of (+/-)-efaroxan and phentolamine, alpha2A-adrenoceptor knockout (alpha2A-KO) mice were used.Effects of (+/-)-efaroxan, 5 mg kg(-1), and phentolamine, 1 mg kg(-1), on blood glucose and insulin levels were compared with those of the non-imidazoline alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist [8aR,12aS,13aS]-5,8,8a,9,10,11,12,12a,13,13a-decahydro-3-methoxy-12-(ethylsulphonyl)-6H-isoquino[2,1-g][1,6]naphthyridine (RS79948-197), 1 mg kg(-1), and the sulphonylurea glibenclamide, in alpha2A-KO and control (wild type (WT)) mice.In fed WT mice, (+/-)-efaroxan, phentolamine and RS79948-197 reduced blood glucose and increased insulin levels. Fasting abolished these effects. In fed alpha2A-KO mice, (+/-)-efaroxan, phentolamine and RS79948-197 did not alter blood glucose or insulin levels, and in fasted alpha2A-KO mice, blood glucose levels were increased. Glibenclamide, at a dose only moderately efficacious in WT mice (5 mg kg(-1)), caused severe hyperinsulinaemia and hypoglycaemia in alpha2A-KO mice. This was mimicked in WT mice by co-administration of RS79948-197 with glibenclamide.These results suggest that (+/-)-efaroxan and phentolamine increase insulin secretion by inhibition of beta-cell alpha2A-adrenoceptors, and demonstrate a critical role for alpha2A-adrenoceptors in limiting sulphonylurea-induced hyperinsulinaemia and hypoglycaemia.
