In-beam PET measurements of biological half-lives of 12C irradiation induced beta+-activity. One of the long-standing problems in carbon-ion therapy is the monitoring of the treatment, i.e. of the delivered dose to a given tissue volume within the patient. Over the last 8 years, in-beam positron emission tomography (PET) has been used at the experimental carbon ion treatment facility at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI) Darmstadt and has become a valuable quality assurance tool. In order to determine and evaluate the correct delivery of the patient dose, a simulation of the positron emitter distribution has been compared to the measurement. One particular effect is the blurring as well as the reduction of the measured activity distribution via washout. The objective of this study is the investigation of tissue dependent effective half-lives from patient data. We find no significant dependence of the effective half-life on the Hounsfield unit but on the local dose. The biological half-life within the high dose region is longer than in the low dose region. Furthermore, the influence of the overall treatment time on the kinetics of the positron emitter is reported. There are indications for a metabolic response of the tissue on the irradiation. Taking into account the biological half-life in the simulation leads to an improvement of the quality of the PET-images in some cases.
