Protocol for measuring myocardial blood flow by PET/CT in cats. The aim of this study was to establish a protocol for measuring myocardial blood flow (MBF) by PET/CT in healthy cats. The rationale was its future use in Maine Coon cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) as a model for human HCM.MBF was measured in nine anaesthetized healthy cats using a PET/CT scanner and (13)NH(3) at rest and during adenosine infusion. Each cat was randomly assigned to receive vasodilator stress with two or three adenosine infusions at the following rates (microg/kg per minute): 140 (Ado 1, standard rate for humans), 280 (Ado 2, twice the human standard rate), 560 (Ado 4), 840 (Ado 6) and 1,120 (Ado 8).The median MBF at rest was 1.26 ml/min per g (n = 9 range 0.88-1.72 ml/min per g). There was no significant difference at Ado 1 (n = 3MBF can be safely measured in cats using PET. An intravenous adenosine infusion at a rate of 280 microg/kg per minute seems most appropriate to induce maximal hyperaemic MBF response in healthy cats. Higher adenosine rates appear less suitable as they are associated with a large heterogeneity in flow increase and rate pressure product, most probably due to the large variability in haemodynamic and heart rate response.
