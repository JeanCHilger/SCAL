Automated synthesis of radiopharmaceuticals for PET: an apparatus for [1-C]labelled aldoses. This paper describes an instrumentation system for positron emission tomography (PET). A variety of [1-(11)C]labelled aldoses, such as [1-(11)C]-D-glucose, and galactose by a modification of the Kiliani-Fischer method have been produced. The instrumentation is fully automatic and consists of a synthesis system and control system. The synthesis system has the following functions: supplying reagents performing reactions
