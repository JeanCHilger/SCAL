Neural responses in rat brain during acute immobilization stress: a [F-18]FDG micro PET imaging study. We used the [F-18]FDG micro PET neuroimaging technique to investigate changes in brain activity induced by acute stress in rats. Animals were given immobilization stress for 1 or 2 h, or 1-h stress followed by 1-h recovery, after which their brains were scanned. Plasma corticosterone levels measured at various time points in separate groups of rats showed a rapid increase during stress and slower decrease after termination of the stress. Immobilization stress given for an hour activated the hypothalamus, entorhinal and insular/piriform cortices, and raphe pallidus nucleus. At the same time, the dorsal hippocampus, thalamus, other cortical areas (motor, somatosensory and barrel field), striatum, superior colliculus and cerebellum were deactivated. With 2-h immobilization stress, the activity of the hypothalamus, various cortical areas and dorsal hippocampus habituated during the second hour while that of the thalamus and cerebellum did not. During 1-h recovery, the hypothalamic activation and widespread cortical deactivation disappeared, but the dorsal hippocampus, thalamus and cerebellum still remained significantly deactivated. Additional brain areas such as the septum and prelimbic cortex now showed deactivation during recovery. Changes in glucose metabolism in the dorsal hippocampus and hypothalamus exhibited a highly significant negative correlation, supporting the view that the hippocampus is involved in regulating the stress response of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. The advantages and limitations of the [F-18]FDG micro PET used in this study are discussed.
