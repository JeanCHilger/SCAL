Vacuum-UV irradiation-based formation of methyl-Si-O-Si networks from poly(1,1-dimethylsilazane-co-1-methylsilazane). The vacuum-UV (VUV)-induced conversion of commercially available poly(1,1-dimethylsilazane-co-1-methylsilazane) into methyl-Si-O-Si networks was studied using UV sources at wavelengths around 172, 185, and 222 nm, respectively. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS), X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements, as well as kinetic investigations, were carried out to elucidate the degradation process. First-order kinetics were found for the photolytically induced decomposition of the Si-NH-Si network, the subsequent formation of the methyl-Si-O-Si network and the concomitant degradation of the Si-CH(3) bond, which were additionally independent of the photon energy above a threshold of about 5.5 eV (225 nm). The kinetics of these processes were, however, dependent on the dose actually absorbed by the layer and, in the case of Si-O-Si formation, additionally on the oxygen concentration. The release of ammonia and methane accompanied the conversion process. Quantum-chemical calculations on methyl substituted cyclotetrasilazanes as model compounds substantiate the suggested reaction scheme. Layers <100 nm in thickness based on mixtures of poly(1,1-dimethylsilazane-co-1-methylsilazane) and perhydropolysilazane (PHPS) were coated onto polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foils by a continuous roll to roll process and cured by VUV irradiation by using wavelengths <200 nm and investigated for their O(2) and water vapor-barrier properties. It was found that the resulting layers displayed oxygen and water vapor transmission rates (OTR and WVTR, respectively) of <1 cm(3) m(-2) d(-1) bar(-1) and <4 g m(-2) d(-1), respectively.
