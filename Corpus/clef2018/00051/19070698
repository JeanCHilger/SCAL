Imaging regional variation of cellular proliferation in gliomas using 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine positron-emission tomography: an image-guided biopsy study. To compare regional variations in uptake of 3'-deoxy-3'- [(18)F]-fluorothymidine (FLT) images using positron-emission tomography (PET) with measures of cellular proliferation from biopsy specimens obtained by image-guided brain biopsies.Fourteen patients with a supratentorial glioma that required an image-guided brain biopsy were imaged preoperatively with dynamic PET after the administration of FLT. Maps of FLT irreversible uptake rate (K(i)) and standardized uptake value (SUV) were calculated. These maps were co-registered to a gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) sequence that was used for biopsy guidance, and the mean and maximum K(i) and SUV determined for each biopsy site. These values were correlated with the MIB-1 labelling index (a tissue marker of proliferation) from these biopsy sites.A total of 57 biopsy sites were studied. Although all measures correlated with MIB-1 labelling index, K(i)(max) provided the best correlation (Pearson coefficient, r=0.68 p<0.001). In low-grade gliomas the K(i)(mean) (+/-SD) was significantly higher than in normal tissue (3.3+/-1.7x10(-3)ml(plasma)/min/ml(tissue) versus 1.2+/-0.7x10(-3)ml(plasma)/min/ml(tissue)FLT PET is a useful marker of cellular proliferation that correlates with regional variation in cellular proliferation however, it is unable to identify the margin of gliomas.
