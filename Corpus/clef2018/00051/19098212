Spectrum of 18F-FDG PET/CT findings in oncology-related recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. The objective of our study was to review recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) anatomy and describe the typical (18)F-FDG (FDG) PET/CT appearance of vocal cord paresis due to oncology-related RLN injury including a spectrum of presentations, causes, and sites of nerve injury.Oncology-related RLN palsy may be caused by direct tumor invasion or its therapy. FDG PET/CT findings should be recognized to avoid misdiagnosis. Laryngoscopy confirms the suspected diagnosis and excludes primary vocal cord neoplasm.
