Association between [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and prognostic parameters in breast cancer. This study analysed the correlation between [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) in breast tumours, and histopathological and inmunohistochemical prognostic factors.FDG-PET was performed before surgery in 275 women with primary breast cancer. The standarized uptake value (SUV) was compared with histopathological findings after surgery.A positive relationship was found between the SUV and tumour size (r = 0.46, P < 0.001), axillary lymph node status (P < 0.001), histological type (P < 0.001), histological grade (P < 0.001), oestrogen receptor status (P < 0.001), p53 (P < 0.001) and Ki-67 (P < 0.001) expression. Multivariable linear regression showed that tumour size, histological grade, Ki-67 expression, oestrogen receptor status and histological type were significantly related to the SUV.The SUV is a preoperative and non-invasive metabolic factor that relates to some prognostic factors in breast cancer.
