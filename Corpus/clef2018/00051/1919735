Optimal scan time of oxygen-15-labeled water injection method for measurement of cerebral blood flow. We investigated the optimal scan time for obtaining the maximal signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by PET imaging following 15O-water bolus injection. We performed sequential measurements with dynamic scans of six subjects injected at rest while listening to white noise. Each dynamic data set was edited into images corresponding to different scan times and were calibrated to CBF images by the table look-up method. For each scan time, we evaluated a pixel-by-pixel standard deviation of the CBF for sequential measurements. The S/N-ratio of CBF in the gray matter was 10.2 +/- 1.7 and 13.6 +/- 2.9 at a 40 and 120 sec scan time, respectively. The gain of the 120-sec over 40-sec scan time corresponds to an 80% increase in the number of trials to reach the same S/N-ratio in a stimulation-activation study. The simulation study supported the results, in which the maximal S/N-ratio of the CBF was demonstrated to be 90 and 120 sec at a CBF of 80 and 60 ml/100 ml/min, respectively. It is concluded that the optimal scan time of the 15O-water bolus injection method is in the interval from 90 to 120 sec.
