Design, synthesis, and preliminary in vitro and in vivo evaluation of N-(2-diethylaminoethyl)-4-[18F]fluorobenzamide ([18F]-DAFBA): a novel potential PET probe to image melanoma tumors. In order to develop a PET radiopharmaceutical to image malignant melanoma, we synthesized N-(2-diethylaminoethyl)-4-[(18)F]fluorobenzamide ([(18)F]-DAFBA). In vitro studies show a high uptake of [(18)F]-DAFBA by the B16F1 melanoma cells. No significant binding was seen for DAFBA to the sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors in vitro. The in vivo biodistribution studies performed in normal ICR mice showed a low uptake in the normal tissues followed by further elimination of radioactivity from these tissues with time. The biodistribution studies performed in C57 mice bearing the melanoma tumor xenograft showed a rapid uptake of radioactivity in the tumor that reached a plateau within 30 min postinjection. The F-18 uptake in the tumor was 7.00 +/- 2.76, 6.57 +/- 1.66, and 5.80 +/- 0.98%ID/g at 60, 120, and 180 min, respectively. A steady uptake of radioactivity in the tumor and low uptake in normal tissues resulted in high tumor to normal tissue ratios. For example, at 180 min postinjection, the tumor to tissue ratios were 14.90 +/- 6.47, 21.90 +/- 4.68, 32.91 +/- 6.11, 39.73 +/- 11.78, and 6.33 +/- 1.9, for the spleen, lungs, muscle, blood, and liver, respectively. The radioactivity rapidly cleared from the blood pool, and it decreased from 0.68 +/- 0.21%ID/g at 60 min to 0.13 +/- 0.03%ID/g at 180 min. The F-18 uptake in the bones at 60, 120, and 180 min was 0.91 +/- 0.27, 0.57 +/- 0.32, and 0.17 +/- 0.05%ID/g, respectively. This low uptake in the bones reflects its in vivo resistance toward defluorination. A low residual activity in normal tissues and a high tumor uptake signifies the superior imaging potential of this compound. Because of these positive traits, [(18)F]-DAFBA could help delineate the tumor and its metastases when used for imaging applications. Further in vivo studies are underway to assess the potential of [(18)F]-DAFBA as a promising PET imaging probe.
