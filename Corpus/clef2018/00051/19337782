Preclinical and the first clinical studies on [11C]CHIBA-1001 for mapping alpha7 nicotinic receptors by positron emission tomography. 4-[(11)C]methylphenyl 2,5-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane-2-carboxylate ([(11)C]CHIBA-1001), a 4-methyl-substituted derivative of the selective alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 nAChR) partial agonist 4-bromophenyl 1,4 diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane-4-carboxylate (SSR180711), is a potential radioligand for mapping alpha7 nAChRs in the brain by positron emission tomography (PET). In this study, we performed preclinical and first clinical PET studies using [(11)C]CHIBA-1001 for imaging alpha7 nAChRs in the human brain.[(11)C]CHIBA-1001 was synthesized by methylation of the tributylstannyl precursor with [(11)C]CH(3)I in a palladium-promoted Stille cross-coupling reaction. The radiation absorbed-dose of [(11)C]CHIBA-1001 in humans was calculated from distribution data in mice. The acute toxicity of CHIBA-1001 at a dose of 3.20 mg/kg body weight, which is more than 41,000-fold the clinical equivalent dose of [(11)C]CHIBA-1001, was evaluated. The mutagenicity of CHIBA-1001 was studied by a reverse mutation test in Salmonella typhimurium (Ames test). Metabolite analysis in the mouse brain was carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography. The first clinical PET imaging of alpha7 nAChRs with [(11)C]CHIBA-1001 in a normal volunteer was also performed.A suitable preparation method for [(11)C]CHIBA-1001 injection was established. The radiation absorbed-dose by [(11)C]CHIBA-1001 in humans was low enough for clinical use, and no acute toxicity or mutagenicity of CHIBA-1001 was found. Most radioactivity in the mouse brain was detected as an unchanged form, although peripherally [(11)C]CHIBA-1001 was degraded. We successfully performed brain imaging by PET with [(11)C]CHIBA-1001 in a normal volunteer. A 90-min dynamic scan showed a rapid accumulation and gradual washout of radioactivity in the brain. The highest distribution volume of [(11)C]CHIBA-1001 was found in the thalamus however, regional differences in brain radioactivity were small. Peripherally, [(11)C]CHIBA-1001 was stable in humans: >80% of the radioactivity in plasma was detected as the unchanged form for 60 min.These results demonstrate that [(11)C]CHIBA-1001 is a suitable radioligand to use in clinical trials for imaging alpha7 nAChRs in the human brain, providing acceptable dosimetry and pharmacological safety at the dose required for adequate PET imaging.
