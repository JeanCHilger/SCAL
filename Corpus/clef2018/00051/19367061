National survey of radiation protection for workers in positron emission tomography facilities in Japan-1st report: occupational role assignment, radiation exposure to medical workers. We have investigated the role assignment and radiation exposure of medical workers (including receptionists) in PET (positron emission tomography) facilities in Japan using a questionnaire. The survey period was from October 1st to November 15th 2006. The response rate for the questionnaire was 60.0% (72/120 facilities). Nurses were engaged in the intravenous administration of radioactive FDG in 66.9% of PET facilities. In 89.5% of PET facilities, radiological technologists mainly performed the PET examination. The average radiation exposure to medical workers was 0.13 mSv/month (n: 709, S.D.: 0.16) as the effective dose. It was shown that radiation exposure was significantly different depending on the occupation and content of work (p<0.01). The radiation exposure of cyclotron operators and radiological technologists was higher than that of the other occupations (p<0.01). The highest radiation dose to one worker per a PET facility was 0.60 [mSv month(-1)], which was 4.6 times higher than the average dose of 0.13 [mSv month(-1)]. We have clarified the actual conditions of radiation protection in PET facilities in Japan for the first time.
