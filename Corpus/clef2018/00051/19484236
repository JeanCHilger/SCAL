99mTcO(MAG2-3G3-dimer): a new integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-targeted SPECT radiotracer with high tumor uptake and favorable pharmacokinetics. This report presents the synthesis of a cyclic RGD dimer conjugate, MAG(2)-G(3)-E[G(3)-c(RGDfK)](2) (MAG(2)-3G(3)-dimer, G(3) = Gly-Gly-Gly, MAG(2) = S-benzoyl mercaptoacetylglycylglycyl), and evaluation of its (99m)Tc complex, (99m)TcO(MAG(2)-3G(3)-dimer), as a new radiotracer for imaging the tumor integrin alpha(v)beta(3) expression.An in vitro displacement assay was used to determine the integrin alpha(v)beta(3) binding affinity of MAG(2)-3G(3)-dimer against (125)I-c(RGDyK) bound to U87MG human glioma cells. The athymic nude mice bearing U87MG glioma xenografts were used for biodistribution and planar imaging studies.We found that (1) MAG(2) is such a highly effective bifunctional chelator that (99m)TcO(MAG(2)-3G(3)-dimer) can be prepared in high yield (radiochemical purity >95%) and with high specific activity ( approximately 5 Ci/micromol) using a kit formulation (2) (99m)TcO(MAG(2)-3G(3)-dimer) has very high solution stability in the kit matrix(99m)TcO(MAG(2)-3G(3)-dimer) is a very attractive radiotracer for early detection of integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-positive tumors and has significant advantages over the (18)F-labeled RGD peptide radiotracers with respect to the cost, availability, and easiness for routine clinical preparation.
