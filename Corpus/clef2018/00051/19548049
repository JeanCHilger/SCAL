Effects of food intake and anesthetic on cardiac imaging and uptake of BMS747158-02 in comparison with FDG. BMS747158-02 is an (18)F-labeled agent being developed for PET myocardial perfusion imaging. This study examined impacts of feeding state and anesthetic on cardiac imaging and uptake of this agent in rats in comparison with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG).Studies were performed in rats either nonfasted or food deprived for 20 hours and anesthetized with either sodium pentobarbital (Pentob) or ketamine and xylazine (Ket/Xyl). Influences of the feeding state and anesthesia were examined by measurement of blood glucose levels, and tissue biodistribution and cardiac imaging of BMS747158-02 and FDG. The blood glucose levels were lower in fasted than nonfasted rats before anesthesia (91 +/- 11 vs 122 +/- 10 mg/dL) and the levels did not significantly change when anesthetized with Pentob. However, the levels increased markedly by 262 +/- 64 mg/dL in nonfasted rats anesthetized with Ket/Xyl. At 60 minutes post-injection, the heart uptake of FDG was significantly lower in fasted than nonfasted rats (0.2 +/- 0.1 vs 2.8 +/- 1.5%ID/g). However, the heart uptake of BMS747158-02 did not differ under these conditions (3.3 +/- 0.9 vs 3.6 +/- 0.9%ID/g, respectively). In nonfasted rats, the heart uptake of FDG was markedly lower when anesthetized with Ket/Xyl than with Pentobl (0.2 +/- 0.1 vs 2.8 +/- 1.5%ID/g). In contrast, the heart uptake of BMS747158-02 was similar with both anesthetics (3.6 +/- 0.5 vs 3.6 +/- 0.9%ID/g). Consistent with the biodistribution studies, the myocardium was not visible following FDG imaging in fasted rats, but clearly seen with BMS747158-02 in both fasted and nonfasted rats anesthetized with either anesthetic.Unlike FDG, BMS747158-02 cardiac images are clear and not affected by the feeding state and anesthetics.
