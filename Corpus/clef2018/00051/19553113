Dopamine D(3) receptor antagonists: The quest for a potentially selective PET ligand. Part two: Lead optimization. The lead optimization process to identify new selective dopamine D(3) receptor antagonists is reported. DMPK parameters and binding data suggest that selective D(3) receptor antagonists as potential PET ligands might have been identified.
