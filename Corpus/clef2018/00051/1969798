Interaction of suriclone with central type benzodiazepine receptors in living baboons. The interaction of suriclone and two of its main metabolites with central type benzodiazepine receptors, which had been labeled in vivo with the radioligand [11C]RO 15-1788, was investigated in living baboons. The concentration of radioligand bound to the receptors, as measured in brain transverse sections by positron emission tomography, decreased rapidly after the i.v. administration of suriclone at doses known to induce pharmacological effects. The rate and extent to which [11C]RO 15-1788 binding was displaced increased with increasing doses of suriclone. The half-inhibitory dose (ID50) was determined to be 0.08 mg/kg in vivo. The rapid inhibitory effect of suriclone on the in vivo binding of [11C]RO 15-1788 in the brain seems to reflect its ability to act at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, at or near to the benzodiazepine binding site, to induce its pharmacological activity. The i.v. injection of the demethylated metabolite of suriclone, RP 35,489, only caused a slight displacement of [11C]RO 15-1788 binding even at a dose of 2 mg/kg. Thus, suriclone appears to be more potent than RP 35,489 to displace the benzodiazepine 11C antagonist in vivo. The sulfoxide metabolite, RP 46,166, did not significantly change the kinetics of [11C]RO 15-1788 binding in the brain. The slight effects produced by high doses of RP 35,489 and RP 46,166 on [11C]RO 15-1788 binding in the brain suggest that these metabolites are probably not responsible for the expression of biological activity of suriclone mediated by benzodiazepine receptors.
