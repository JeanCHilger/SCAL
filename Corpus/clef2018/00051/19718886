Autism and brain imaging. Our knowledge of brain defects in autistic patients has considerably improved since the advent of MRI and PET These imaging methods provide a precise anatomical picture of the brain and, above all, permit statistical comparisons. Visual inspection of brain MR images obtained in 77 children with autism revealed anomalies in the temporal lobe. Statistical analysis showed a loss of grey matter in the superior temporal sulcus of 21 children with autism. PET functional studies show reduced blood flow in the same region. No activation was seen in the superior temporal sulcus during presentation of complex sounds, contrary to normal children. All these studies are consistent with structural and functional anomalies of the superior temporal sulcus, a brain region involved in the treatment of the complex sensory inputs necessary for normal social interactions. These anomalies may at least partly explain the behavioural difficulties of children with autism.
