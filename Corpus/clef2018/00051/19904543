Treatment of cystic craniopharyngioma with phosphorus-32 intracavitary irradiation. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of phosphorus-32 colloid ([(32)P]) intracavitary irradiation on the treatment of patients with cystic craniopharyngiomas.Twenty patients with predominantly cystic craniopharyngiomas were admitted from 1981 to 2006. Eleven patients had [(32)P] intracavitary irradiation by stereotactic injection or Ommaya cyst instillation as the primary treatment, and the remaining nine had the same internal irradiation as an adjuvant treatment after tumor resection. A calculated irradiation dose of 400 approximately 500 Gy per once was delivered to the cyst wall.The patients were followed up ranging from 36 to 336 months no operative morbidity or mortality was found from [(32)P] intracavitary irradiation. Fourteen patients (70%) had tumor progression and required further two to four times intracavitary irradiation. All 20 cases achieved tumor shrinkage or stabilization with effective outcome 3-6 months after the last [(32)P] therapy. For patients with cystic craniopharyngioma, [(32)P] administration by stereotactic injection or Ommaya cyst instillation is a safe and helpful option, which could improve the life quality, prolong the life span, and enhance the survival rate of cystic craniopharyngioma patients.
