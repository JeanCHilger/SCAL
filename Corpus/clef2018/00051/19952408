Automated synthesis of 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose by on-column hydrolysis. To study automated synthesis of 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) via on-column hydrolysis.Automated synthesis of (18)F-FDG was performed by the on-column hydrolysis procedure in TRACERlab FXF-N synthesizer. (18)F-FDG injection was obtained via nucleophilic fluorination of 1, 3, 4, 6-tetra-O-acetyl-2-O-trifluoromethanesulfony-beta-D-mannopyranose as the precursor molecule with (18)F-fluoride, hydrolysis of the (18)F-labeled intermediate on SEP-PAK C18 cartridges with 2 mol/L NaOH solution, and purification and neutralization with SEP-PAK cartridges.The uncorrected radiochemical yield of (18)F-FDG was more than 60% within the total synthesis time shorter than 20 min. The radiochemical purity of (18)F-FDG was above 99%.On-column hydrolysis is simple and practical for the automated synthesis of (18)F-FDG. (18)F-FDG injection produced by this procedure can be used in clinical PET imaging.
