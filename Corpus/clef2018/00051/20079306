Evaluation of fluorodeoxyglucose-position-emission tomography-computer tomography imaging on head and neck squamous cell carcinomas including primary tumors and lymph node metastases. To evaluate (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-position-emission tomography-computer tomography imaging ((18)F-FDG-PET-CT) on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma(HNSCCA) and lymph node metastasis.(18)F-FDG-PET-CT imaging of 20 patients with HNSCCA was evaluated retrospectively.All the primary tumors were correctly diagnosed by (18)F-PET-CT imaging and SUV(avg) of the primary tumors was (6.22 +/- 2.20). All the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and the negative predictive value were 100%. In detecting lymph node metastasis, the sensitivity was 51%, specificity 97.7%, false positive rate 2.3%, false negative rate 49%, positive predictive value 82%, and negative predictive value 91.2%.(18)F-FDG-PET-CT imaging was valuable in detecting HNSCCA and lymph node metastasis. SUV was helpful for differential diagnosis between benign or malignant tumors but it needs further study to determine the cutoff SUV for differentiating lymph node metastasis.
