Studying the properties of the updating coefficients in the OSEM algorithm for iterative image reconstruction in PET. We have studied the properties of the pixel updating coefficients in the 2D ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm for iterative image reconstruction in positron emission tomography, in order to address the problem of image quality degradation-a known property of the technique after a number of iterations. The behavior of the updating coefficients has been extensively analyzed on synthetic coincidence data, using the necessary software tools. The experiments showed that the statistical properties of these coefficients can be correlated with the quality of the reconstructed images as a function of the activity distribution in the source and the number of subsets used. Considering the fact that these properties can be quantified during the reconstruction process of data from real scans where the activity distribution in the source is unknown the results of this study might be useful for the development of a stopping criterion for the OSEM algorithm.
