Diagnostic work-up for lymph node metastases of urological tumors. Both CT and MRI are currently the most frequently used and recommended modalities for lymph node staging of uro-oncological diseases. Their diagnostic usefulness is limited particularly for recognition of micrometastases and lymph nodes <10 mm. FDG- and choline-based PET/CT procedures also do not offer much improvement in these cases. Meanwhile however PET/CT has been included in the EAU guidelines for seminomas and is recommended for further management of residual tumors after chemotherapy. Magnetic resonance imaging with lymphotropic monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles appears to exhibit great potential and can detect smaller metastases and micrometastases even in normal-sized lymph nodes in uro-oncological diseases. Nevertheless, Guerbet has withdrawn its application to the EMEA for marketing authorization of its product Sinerem (superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles). In the meantime diffusion-weighted MRI represents a promising technique and is already being evaluated in fields outside the realm of urology.
