Mathematical methods to determine quantitative parameters of myocardial 123I-MIBG studies: a review of the literature. (123)I-meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine ((123)I-MIBG) scintigraphy is used to visualize and quantify the sympathetic nerve activity. Although it has been used since 1980 to identify myocardial innervation, it is not yet regarded a routine sympathetic imaging agent in this respect. The lack of large multicentre studies and the presence of variations in the protocols that are used for planar MIBG acquisition confines the comparability of study results and application of normal values. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the variations in mathematical methods that are currently used to quantify the heart-to-mediastinum ratio and washout rate (WOR). In addition, normal values were evaluated in concordance with these methods. A systematic literature search yielded 169 unique manuscripts, of which 30 contained a complete description of the acquisition protocol for planar MIBG acquisition, image analysis and quantification of the parameters. The results indicate not only large variations in mathematical methods, but also in various aspects of the protocols that are used during acquisition. In many manuscripts method-specific normal values were used however, these values were generally generated from small, single-centre studies. This study stresses the need to produce guidelines to achieve a standardized method for MIBG acquisition, image analysis and methods to quantify parameters.
