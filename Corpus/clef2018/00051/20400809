Bayesian reconstruction strategy of fluorescence-mediated tomography using an integrated SPECT-CT-OT system. Following the assembly of a triple-modality SPECT-CT-OT small animal imaging system providing intrinsically co-registered projection data of all three submodalities and under the assumption and investigation of dual-labeled probes consisting of both fluorophores and radionuclides, a novel multi-modal reconstruction strategy is presented in this paper aimed at improving fluorescence-mediated tomography (FMT). The following reconstruction procedure is proposed: firstly, standard x-ray CT image reconstruction is performed employing the FDK algorithm. Secondly, standard SPECT image reconstruction is performed using OSEM. Thirdly, from the reconstructed CT volume data the surface boundary of the imaged object is extracted for finite element definition. Finally, the reconstructed SPECT data are used as a priori information within a Bayesian reconstruction framework for optical (FMT) reconstruction. We provide results of this multi-modal approach using phantom experimental data and illustrate that this strategy does suppress artifacts and facilitates quantitative analysis for optical imaging studies.
