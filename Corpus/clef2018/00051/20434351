Post-elution processing of (44)Ti/(44)Sc generator-derived (44)Sc for clinical application. The (44)Ti/(44)Sc (T(1/2)(44)Ti=60a) generator provides cyclotron-independent access to positron-emitting (44)Sc (T(1/2)=3.97d) for PET imaging. This work aims to post-elution processing of initial (44)Sc generator eluates in order to reduce its volume, HCl concentration and remove the oxalate anions. The on-line adsorption of (44)Sc on cationic resin AG 50W-X8 (200-400 mesh, H(+)-form) is achieved with >98% efficacy. Subsequently, the purified (44)Sc is desorbed by using 3ml of 0.25M ammonium acetate (pH=4.0). The post-processing takes 10min. The overall yield of the post-processing reached 90%, which is referred to the (44)Sc obtained from the (44)Ti/(44)Sc generator. In addition to the chemical purification, the content of (44)Ti breakthrough was further reduced by one order of magnitude. The 185MBq generator finally provides 150MBq of (44)Sc containing <10Bq of (44)Ti ready for labeling.
