Is it time for biomarker-based diagnostic criteria for prodromal Alzheimer's disease? Drug candidates targeting amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology in Alzheimer's disease are in different phases of clinical trials. These treatments will probably be most effective in the earlier stages of the disease, before neurodegeneration is too severe, but at the same time symptoms are vague and the clinical diagnosis is difficult. Recent research advances have resulted in promising biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid analyses for tau and Abeta, magnetic resonance imaging measurement of atrophy, and positron emission tomography imaging of glucose metabolism and Abeta pathology, which allow identification of prodromal Alzheimer's disease. More details are needed, however, on how these biomarkers can be standardized, to allow a general implementation in the clinical routine diagnostic work-up of patients with cognitive disturbances.
