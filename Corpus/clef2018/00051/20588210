Gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging: the further improvements of an excellent tool. Cardiac imaging with gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) allows the evaluation of myocardial perfusion and analysis of global and regional left ventricular function. Gated SPECT is a validated and established diagnostic and prognostic method for evaluation of patients with suspected and known coronary artery disease. Significant improvements in software and gamma camera technology in SPECT cardiac imaging have been obtained. New detectors open a scenario for faster imaging with lower radiation dose to the patient. Appropriate use of the SPECT imaging is regulated by evidence-based guidelines and appropriateness criteria as well as by third-party payers in an effort to restrain the unsustainable growth of imaging testing recently observed. Future of cardiac SPECT imaging will be driven by societal demand for cost effective, accurate, and safe testing, which will improve meaningfully patients' management and outcomes.
