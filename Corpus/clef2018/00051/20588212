Role of quantitative myocardial perfusion PET as a clinical translation research tool. In biology and medicine, "translational research" indicates the "translation" from the language of molecular biology in animal experiments to human physiology in order to improve our insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of cardiac diseases and to verify the mechanism of action or the potential of newly developed drugs. Positron emission tomography (PET) plays a major role in this setting due to four major characteristics: 1) extremely high sensitivity 2) excellent temporal resolution
