Application of technetium-99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography in acute myocardial infarction: measuring the efficacy of therapy. Infarct size and myocardial salvage measured by technetium (Tc)-99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging have been applied as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials of acute myocardial infarction (MI). The major advantage of these endpoints over mortality is the ability to use much smaller sample sizes to compare different treatment strategies in acute MI. Multiple categories of evidence validate SPECT infarct size and myocardial salvage as surrogate endpoints, including: association with other variables used to measure infarct size association with markers of myocardial perfusion
