Molecular imaging in nuclear cardiology: translating research concepts into clinical applications. Molecular imaging provides a novel approach for the early non-invasive detection of critical molecular or cellular processes associated with initiation of disease, before the manifestation of anatomical changes or late physiological consequences. This article reviews the current and future role of molecular imaging in evaluation of cardiovascular diseases, including the early detection of atherosclerosis, ischemia-induced angiogenesis, and post-infarction left ventricular remodeling. Cardiovascular molecular imaging with radiolabeled probes has already translated into clinical practice in the evaluation of critical metabolic and receptor mediated process in the heart, however, the true clinical impact of targeted molecular imaging has not yet been realized. The advancement of cardiovascular molecular imaging will require the development of novel targeted probes, hybrid high-sensitivity and high-resolution imaging systems, and the collaboration of basic and clinical imaging communities. The application of molecular imaging in combination with conventional anatomical and physiological imaging should provide new insights into the pathophysiology of disease that may allow a more personalized approach to the evaluation and management of cardiovascular diseases.
