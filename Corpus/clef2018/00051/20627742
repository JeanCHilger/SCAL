Potential value of color-coded dynamic breast-specific gamma-imaging comparing (99m)Tc-(V)-DMSA, (99m)Tc-MIBI, and (99m)Tc-HDP in a mouse mammary tumor model. Using a mouse mammary tumor model based on orthotopic transplantation of luciferase-expressing mouse ILC cells (KEP1-Luc cells), we evaluated the diagnostic value of three clinically applied tracers: (99m)Tc-(V)-DMSA, (99m)Tc-MIBI, and (99m)Tc-HDP. Uptake of the tracers is compared using static and dynamic imaging procedures. We found that dynamic imaging in combination with pixel-by-pixel color coding has an added value over (high resolution) static imaging procedures. Such dynamic imaging procedures could enhance the potential of breast-specific gamma-imaging.
