1- Cholinesterase (ChE) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid, and thus shuts off neural transmission (1, 2). There are two types of ChE: acetylcholinesterase (AChE, also known as erythrocyte cholinesterase or acetylcholine acetylhydrolase) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE or BuChE, also known as plasma cholinesterase, pseudocholinesterase, or acylcholine acylhydrolase). Both enzymes are present in cholinergic and noncholinergic tissues as well as in plasma and other body fluids. They differ in substrate specificity, behavior in excess substrate, and susceptibility to inhibitors (1, 2). BChE is encoded by the
