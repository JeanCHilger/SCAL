Differentiation of hepatocellular adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia using 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the use of PET/CT with (18)F-fluorocholine in the differentiation of hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) from focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). Patients with liver lesions larger than 2 cm suspicious for HCA or FNH were prospectively included. All patients underwent PET/CT with (18)F-fluorocholine and histopathological diagnosis was obtained by either liver biopsy or surgery. The ratios between the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of the lesion and the mean SUV of normal liver parenchyma were calculated and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed. Ten patients with FNH and 11 with HCA were included. The mean SUV ratio was 1.68±0.29 (±SD) for FNH and 0.88±0.18 for HCA (p<0.001). An SUV ratio cut-off value between 1.12 and 1.22 differentiated patients with FNH from those with HCA with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This pilot study showed that PET/CT with (18)F-fluorocholine can differentiate HCA from FNH.
