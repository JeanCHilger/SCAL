The effect of focal cerebral atrophy in positron emission tomographic studies of aging and dementia. We used x-ray computed tomographic (XCT) scans to measure the degree of cerebral atrophy in brain regions defined by a region of interest (ROI) anatomy atlas. The same atlas was employed for quantitation of local cerebral glucose metabolic rates (LCMRglc) by PET. PET data were obtained from 9 young controls, 7 healthy elderly controls, and 10 patients with dementia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in atrophic brain regions was assumed to be metabolically inert, and LCMRglc measurements were corrected for the degree of atrophy. Significantly greater atrophy was seen for 7 of 8 regions in comparisons between demented patients and age-matched controls. This atrophy was most pronounced in superior parietal (SP) regions. Decreases in parietal LCMRglc in dementia patients and SP LCMRglc in old controls were no longer significant after correction for atrophy. These results emphasize the need to consider focal atrophy effects in regional quantitative analyses of emission tomographic data.
