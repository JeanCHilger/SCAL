Modern nuclear medicine evaluation of neuroblastoma. The neuroblastoma is an embryonic tumor of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, and is metastatic or otherwise high risk for relapse in nearly 50% of cases, with a long-term survival of <40%. Therefore, exact staging with radiological and nuclear medicine imaging methods is crucial for finding the adequate therapeutic choice. The tumor cells express the norepinephrine transporter, which makes metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), an analogue of norepinephrine, an ideal tumor specific agent for imaging. On the other hand, MIBG imaging has several disadvantages as limited spatial resolution, limited sensitivity in small lesions, need for two or even more acquisition sessions, and a delay between the start of the examination and result. Most of these limitations can be overcome with positron emission tomography (PET) using different radiotracers. Furthermore, MIBG imaging is not sufficient for operative or biopsy planning. With this regard, a combination with morphological imaging methods is indispensable. This article will discuss the therapeutic strategy for primary and follow-up diagnosis in neuroblastoma using different nuclear medicine and radiological imaging methods as well as multimodality imaging.
