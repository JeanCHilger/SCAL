The role of PET with 13N-ammonia and 18F-FDG in the assessment of myocardial perfusion and metabolism in patients with recent AMI and intracoronary stem cell injection. Over the last decade, the effects of stem cell therapy on cardiac repair after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have been investigated with different imaging techniques. We evaluated a new imaging approach using (13)N-ammonia and (18)F-FDG PET for a combined analysis of cardiac perfusion, metabolism, and function in patients treated with intracoronary injection of endothelial progenitors or with conventional therapy for AMI.A total of 15 patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups based on different treatments (group A: bone marrow-derived stem cells group B: peripheral blood-derived stem cellsA significant decrease (P < 0.05) in the number of scarred segments and infarct size was observed in group A, along with an increase in MBF (P < 0.05) and a mild improvement in cardiac function. Lack of infarct size shrinkage in group B was associated with a marked impairment of MBF (P = 0.01) and cardiac dysfunction. Ambiguous changes in infarct size, MBF, and LVEF were found in group C. No differences in number of viable segments or in extent of viable area were found among the groups. At clinical follow-up, no major cardiac events occurred in group A patients, whereas 2 patients of group B experienced in-stent occlusion and one patient of group C received a transplant for heart failure.Our data suggest that a single nuclear imaging technique accurately analyzes changes in myocardial perfusion and metabolism occurring after stem cell transplantation.
