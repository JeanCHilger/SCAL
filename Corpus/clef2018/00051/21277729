The value of pre operative S-100B and SUV in clinically stage III melanoma patients undergoing therapeutic lymph node dissection. High preoperative serum S-100B values and Standardized Uptake Values (SUV) of Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in PET for clinically stage III melanoma patients could be indicators of recurrence after surgical treatment. Aim was to assess the correlation and the prognostic value of these markers.All melanoma patients with palpable nodal metastases, without distant metastases, were included from February 2004 to December 2007. Preoperative SUV and S-100B was determined. The correlation between SUV and S-100B and their relations with DFS and DSS were calculated by Cox Proportional Hazard Analysis.62 Patients, median age 56.9 years, were included in the study. An elevated S-100B was found in 31 patients (50%) and elevated SUV in 24 patients (38.7%). No relation was found between S-100B and SUV. DFS was reduced (31.1%) for patients with an elevated S-100B (HR = 3.1 p = 0.02) in comparison to a normal S-100B (44.6%). The DFS was 42.0% for patients with a SUV below the cut-off point and 29.0% for patients with an elevated SUV (HR = 1.1S-100B and SUV in stage III melanoma are not correlated and each have different associations with various histopathological factors. S-100B, in contrast with SUV, is associated with nodal tumor load, and when elevated, predicts a shorter DFS.Preoperative serum S-100B and Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) in clinically stage III melanoma are not correlated. S-100B is a strong predictor for Disease Free Survival (DFS) in stage III melanoma.
