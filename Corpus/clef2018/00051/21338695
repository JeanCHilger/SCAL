Meta-analyzing brain dysfunctions in dyslexic children and adults. We examined the evidence from functional imaging studies for predominance of a phonological left temporo-parietal (TP) dysfunction in dyslexic children and predominance of a visual-orthographic left occipito-temporal (OT) dysfunction in dyslexic adults. Separate meta-analyses of 9 studies with children (age means: 9-11 years) and of 9 studies with adults (age means: 18-30 years) and statistical comparison of these meta-analytic maps did find support for a dysfunction of a left ventral OT region in both children and adults. The findings on a possible predominance of a left TP dysfunction in children were inconclusive. Contrary to expectation, underactivation in superior temporal regions was only found for adults, but not for children. For children, underactivation was found in bilateral inferior parietal regions, but this abnormality was no longer present when foci identified by higher dyslexic task-negative activation (i.e., deactivation in response to reading compared to baseline) were excluded. These meta-analytic results are consistent with recent findings speaking for an early engagement of left OT regions in reading development and for an early failure of such an engagement in dyslexia.
