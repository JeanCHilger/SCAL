Efficient synthesis and chiral separation of 11C-labeled ibuprofen assisted by DMSO for imaging of in vivo behavior of the individual isomers by positron emission tomography. The pharmacological mechanisms focusing on chiral isomer of ibuprofen are not fully understood. Only the (S)-isomer of ibuprofen inhibits cyclooxygenases, which mediates the generation of prostanoids and thromboxanes. Consequently, (S)-isomers represent a major promoter of the anti-inflammatory effect, and the effects of the (R)-isomers have not been widely discussed. However, more recently, the cyclooxygenase-independent pharmacological effects of ibuprofen have been elucidated. Pharmacokinetic studies with individual isomers of ibuprofen by positron emission tomography should aid our understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms of ibuprofen. The efficient (11)C-labeling of ibuprofen for chiral separation via the TBAF-promoted Î±-[(11)C]methylation was achieved by using DMSO rather than THF as the reaction solvent. The robust production of the radiochemically labile (11)C-labeled ibuprofen ester was realized by the protective effect of DMSO on radiolysis. After intravenous injection of each enantiomer of [(11)C]ibuprofen, significantly high radioactivity was observed in the joints of arthritis mice when compared to the levels observed in normal mice. However, the high accumulation was equivalent between the enantiomers, indicating that ibuprofen is accumulated in the arthritic joints regardless of the expression of cyclooxygenases.
