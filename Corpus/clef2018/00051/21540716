Clinical value of combined single photon emission computerized tomography and conventional computer tomography (SPECT/CT) in sports medicine. Integrated hybrid single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT)/computer tomography (CT) is a promising new diagnostic imaging modality for orthopedic patients. A high diagnostic yield is available from combining the detection of abnormal bone metabolism with SPECT, to the precise anatomical detail available in high resolution CT. With this review, we endeavor to illustrate the clinical value and future perspectives of SPECT/CT in sports medicine.
