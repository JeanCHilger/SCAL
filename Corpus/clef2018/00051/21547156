Multimodality Imaging of Integrin α(v)β(3) Expression. Over the last decade, integrin α(v)β(3) has been studied with every single molecular imaging modality. Since no single modality is perfect and sufficient to obtain all the necessary information for a particular question, combination of certain molecular imaging modalities can offer synergistic advantages over any modality alone. This review will focus on multimodality imaging of integrin α(v)β(3) expression, where the contrast agent used can be detected by two or more imaging modalities, such as combinations of PET and optical, SPECT and fluorescence, PET and MRI, SPECT and MRI, and lastly, MRI and fluorescence. Most of these agents are based on certain type(s) of nanoparticles. Contrast agents that can be detected by more than two imaging modalities are expected to emerge in the future and a PET/MRI/fluorescence agent will likely find the most future biomedical/clinical applications. Big strides have been made over the last decade for imaging integrin α(v)β(3) expression and several PET/SPECT probes have been tested in human studies. For dualmodality and multimodality imaging applications, a number of proof-of-principle studies have been reported which opened up many new avenues for future research. The next decade will likely witness further growth and continued prosperity of molecular imaging studies focusing on integrin α(v)β(3), which can eventually impact patient management.
