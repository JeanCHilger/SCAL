Extent of resection for neuroendocrine tumors of the small intestine. Neuroendocrine tumors of the small intestine have been diagnosed with increasing frequency over the past 35 years and presently account for approximately 2% of all gastrointestinal neoplasms. While most of these tumors are discovered incidentally during emergency laparotomy or in the clinical setting of unknown primary cancer with hepatic metastases, the growing awareness of this rare entity and improved diagnostic methods promote earlier diagnosis. The classical carcinoid syndrome with flush, diarrhea and cardiac strain is observed only in 20-30% of patients. The clinical symptoms necessitate a special preoperative preparation of the patient including evaluation of cardiac function.Prospective studies assessing the efficacy of surgical treatment strategies for neuroendocrine neoplasms of the small intestine do not exist. However, retrospective studies have demonstrated that curative as well as palliative resection of the primary tumor improves the prognosis and the quality of life of patients. Besides limited resection of the small bowel in order to avoid postoperative short bowel syndrome an effective clearance of the regional lymph nodes is essential. A primary tumor site in the terminal ileum requires dissection of the lymph nodes on the right side of the ileocolic artery which usually implies an additional resection of the right colon. In cases of a primary tumor site located in the lower ileum up to the distal jejunum, a cone-shaped resection of the mesenterium of the small bowel with extension of lymphadenectomy into adjacent segments with preservation of vascularization is performed.
