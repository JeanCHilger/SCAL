The improved syntheses of 5-substituted 2'-[18F]fluoro-2'-deoxy-arabinofuranosyluracil derivatives ([18F]FAU, [18F]FEAU, [18F]FFAU, [18F]FCAU, [18F]FBAU and [18F]FIAU) using a multistep one-pot strategy. We and others have previously reported a four-step radiosynthesis of a series of 2'-deoxy-2'-[(18)F]fluoro-5-substituted-1-β-D-arabinofuranosyluracil derivatives including [(18)F]FAU, [(18)F]FEAU, [(18)F]FFAU, [(18)F]FCAU, [(18)F]FBAU and [(18)F]FIAU as thymidine derivatives for tumor proliferation and/or reporter gene expression imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). Although the radiosynthesis has been proven to be reproducible and efficient, this complicated multistep reaction is difficult to incorporate into an automated cGMP-compliant radiosynthesis module for routine production. Recently, we have developed a simple and efficient one-pot method for routine production of [(18)F]FMAU. In this study, we studied the feasibility of radiosynthesizing [(18)F]FAU, [(18)F]FEAU, [(18)F]FFAU, [(18)F]FCAU, [(18)F]FBAU and [(18)F]FIAU using this newly developed method.Similar to the radiosynthesis of [(18)F]FMAU, 5-substituted 2'-[(18)F]fluoro-2'-deoxy-arabinofuranosyluracil derivatives ([(18)F]FAU, [(18)F]FEAU, [(18)F]FFAU, [(18)F]FCAU, [(18)F]FBAU and [(18)F]FIAU) were synthesized in one-pot radiosynthesis module in the presence of Friedel-Crafts catalyst TMSOTf and HMDS.This one-pot radiosynthesis method could be used to produce [(18)F]FAU, [(18)F]FEAU, [(18)F]FFAU, [(18)F]FCAU, [(18)F]FBAU and [(18)F]FIAU. The overall radiochemical yields of these tracers varied from 4.1%±0.8% to 10.1%±1.9% (decay-corrected, n=4). The overall reaction time was reduced from 210 min to 150 min from the end of bombardment, and the radiochemical purity was >99%.The improved radiosyntheses of [(18)F]FAU, [(18)F]FEAU, [(18)F]FFAU, [(18)F]FCAU, [(18)F]FBAU and [(18)F]FIAU have been achieved with reasonable yields and high purity using a multistep one-pot method. The synthetic time has been reduced, and the reaction procedures have been significantly simplified. The success of this approach may make PET tracers [(18)F]FAU, [(18)F]FEAU, [(18)F]FFAU, [(18)F]FCAU, [(18)F]FBAU and [(18)F]FIAU more accessible for preclinical and clinical research.
