Rapid aqueous [18F]-labeling of a bodipy dye for positron emission tomography/fluorescence dual modality imaging. We report the rapid nucleophilic [(18)F]-radiolabeling of a bodipy dye in aqueous solutions. This radiolabeled dye, whose biodistribution and clearance has been studied in mice, is stable in vivo and can be used as a positron emission tomography/fluorescence dual modality imaging agent.
