PET/CT imaging of clear cell renal cell carcinoma with I labeled chimeric antibody. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) presents problems for urologists in diagnosis, treatment selection, intraoperative surgical margin analysis, and long term monitoring. In this paper we describe the development of a radiolabeled antibody specific to ccRCC (124I-cG250) and its potential to help urologists manage each of these problems. We believe 124I-cG250, in conjunction with perioperative Positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging and intraoperative handheld gamma probe use, has the potential to diagnose ccRCC, aid in determining a proper course of treatment (operative or otherwise), confirm complete resection of malignant tissue in real time, and monitor patients post-operatively.
