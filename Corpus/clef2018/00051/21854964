Temporal dynamics of cortical sources underlying spontaneous and peripherally evoked slow waves. Slow waves are the most prominent electroencephalographic feature of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. During NREM sleep, cortical neurons oscillate approximately once every second between a depolarized upstate, when cortical neurons are actively firing, and a hyperpolarized downstate, when cortical neurons are virtually silent (Destexhe et al., 1999 Steriade et al., 1993a, 2001). Intracellular recordings indicate that the origins of the slow oscillation are cortical and that corticocortical connections are necessary for their synchronization (Amzica and Steriade, 1995
