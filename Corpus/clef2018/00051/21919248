Methyl-[ Most anti-cancer drugs are aimed at curbing the processes of rapid cell proliferation and an increased rate of DNA synthesis, which are both necessary for the progression of all cancers and the development of neoplastic tumors. Usually invasive procedures such as biopsies are used to confirm the presence of malignant tumors, but it can be difficult to take multiple biopsies from a patient if the cancer has metastasized to several different areas of the body (1). Therefore, non-invasive imaging methods that use radiolabeled thymidine analogs (a nucleoside present only in the DNA) in conjunction with positron emission tomography (PET) have been developed to detect tumors and to evaluate the efficacy of anti-cancer treatments in animals and humans (1). Initially,
