Characterization of adrenal metastatic cancer using FDG PET/CT. The adrenal gland is a common location for metastasis from a primary tumor in another organ. This study evaluated the properties of adrenal lesions in cancer and non-cancer patients and investigated what variables may help predict adrenal metastasis. This retrospective study used 18fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT on 371 patients with adrenal lesions (N = 260 with a primary tumor and N= 111 with an unknown primary tumor). Parameters such as the presence of a tumor, nodule, enlarged adrenal, maximum standardized uptake (SUVmax ratio) were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to identify variables that may predict risk of adrenal metastasis. Subjects with adrenal metastasis versus those without had a higher frequency of primary lung tumors (53.7% versus 28.6%, respectively Pâ‰¤ 0.001) but a lower frequency of gastrointestinal cancer (9.3% versus 20.4%, respectively
