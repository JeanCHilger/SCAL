Synthesis, radiofluorination and pharmacological evaluation of a fluoromethyl spirocyclic PET tracer for central σ1 receptors and comparison with fluoroalkyl homologs. The spirocyclic σ(1) receptor ligand 1 (1'-benzyl-3-(fluoromethyl)-3H-spiro[[2]benzofuran-1,4'-piperidine]) was prepared in four steps starting from methoxy derivative 5. Due to its high σ(1) affinity (K(i)=0.74nM) and selectivity against several other relevant targets, 1 was investigated as (18)F-labeled PET tracer and its biological properties were compared with those of homologous fluoroalkyl derivatives 2-4. The fluoromethyl derivative 1 was faster metabolized in vitro than homologs 2-4. In contrast to the radiosynthesis of [(18)F]2-4, the nucleophilic substitution of the tosylate 15 using the K[(18)F]F-K(222)-carbonate complex required heating to 150°C in DMSO to achieve high labeling efficiencies. Whereas radiometabolites of [(18)F]2-4 were not detected in vivo in the brain of mice, two radiometabolites of [(18)F]1 were found. Analysis of ex vivo autoradiography images provided rather low target-to-nontarget ratio for [(18)F]1 compared with [(18)F]2-4. [(18)F]1 showed a fast uptake in the brain, which decreased continuously over time. The brain-to-plasma ratio of the radiotracer [(18)F]1 was only exceeded by the fluoroethyl tracer [(18)F]2.
