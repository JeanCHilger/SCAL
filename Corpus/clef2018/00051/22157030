Ga-68 DOTA-NOC uptake in the pancreas: pathological and physiological patterns. Gallium-68 (Ga-68) DOTA-1-NaI3-octreotide (DOTA-NOC) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is increasingly used for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), often found primarily in the pancreas. However, physiologic uptake of DOTA-NOC has been described in the uncinate process of the pancreas. We studied DOTA-NOC uptake in this organ.Ninety-six patients underwent 103 DOTA-NOC scans, with pathology-proven pancreatic NET (n = 40) and nonpancreatic NET or biochemical suspicion of NET (n = 63).DOTA-NOC uptake was detected in 35 documented pancreatic tumor sites (SUV: 5.5-165 mean: 25.7 Â± 28.8Pancreatic DOTA-NOC uptake must be interpreted with caution, and further studies are required.
