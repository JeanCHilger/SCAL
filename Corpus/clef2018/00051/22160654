FDG-PET performed concurrently with initial I-131 ablation for differentiated thyroid cancer. Differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) are commonly treated by total thyroidectomy followed by I-131 radioiodine ablation to eradicate any residual thyroid tissue and to detect any metastatic lesions on post-treatment whole body scans (TxWBS). However, some DTCs do not trap iodine, resulting in negative whole body scanning. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has proven to be a valuable diagnostic technique for detecting many types of malignant tumors and metastases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate FDG-PET performed concurrently with initial I-131 ablation for its ability to detect lymph node metastasis and for its role in the management of DTC patients.A total of 54 patients (16 males and 38 females median age = 50 years) with histologically proven DTC underwent both FDG-PET and subsequent I-131 ablation. A dose of 3.7 GBq I-131 was administered to 51 patients, 2.96 GBq was administered to 1 patient, and 2.22 GBq was administered to 2 patients. FDG-PET or PET/CT was performed 3-4 days prior to ablation. TxWBS was conducted 1 week after therapy. FDG-PET scans and TxWBS were interpreted by consensus of 2 experienced radiologists. Serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels at 3-6 months after ablation were compared between PET-positive and PET-negative patients.FDG-PET was positive in 25 sites (thyroid bed: n = 9 cervical lymph nodes: n = 12FDG-PET performed concurrently with I-131 ablation can detect lymph node metastases in which radioiodine does not accumulate and may influence the management and treatment options for DTC patients.
