Response to sunitinib in combination with proton beam radiation in a patient with chondrosarcoma: a case report. Chondrosarcoma is well-known to be primarily resistant to conventional radiation and chemotherapy.We present the case of a 32-year-old Caucasian man with clear cell chondrosarcoma who presented with symptomatic recurrence in his pelvis and metastases to his skull and lungs. Our patient underwent systemic therapy with sunitinib and then consolidation with proton beam radiation to his symptomatic site. He achieved complete symptomatic relief with a significantly improved performance status and had an almost complete and durable metabolic response on fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.Our findings have important clinical implications and suggest novel clinical trials for this difficult to treat disease.
