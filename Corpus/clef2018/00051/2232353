Left ventricular ejection fraction derived from resting 201Tl myocardial images. To determine if resting 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy (rest-Tl) provides the information on left ventricular function, we compared preliminarily the parameters derived from rest-Tl with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) derived from left ventriculography while the parameters included Extent Score (ES), Severity Score (SS), Percent Uptake (PU), Area Index (AI). AI was derived from the averaging of [(A/B) x 100] in three or four central slices of short axis view on single photon emission computed tomography (A
