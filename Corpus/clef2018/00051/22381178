Calcium channel blocker toxicity in dogs and cats. The widespread use and availability of calcium channel blockers in human and veterinary medicine pose a risk for inadvertent pet exposure to these medications. Clinical signs can be delayed by many hours after exposure in some cases, with hypotension and cardiac rhythm changes (bradycardia, atrioventricular block, or tachycardia) as the predominant signs. Prompt decontamination and aggressive treatment using a variety of modalities may be necessary to treat patients exposed to calcium channel blockers. The prognosis of an exposed patient depends on the severity of signs and response to treatment.
