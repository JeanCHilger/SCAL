Preload dependence of gated cardiac SPECT-derived ventricular volumes in hemodialysis patients. In hemodialysis (HD) patients, the intravascular volume expansion of the pre-HD state leads to a high preload. We aim to examine its effect on myocardial perfusion gated SPECT (MPGS)-derived left ventricular (LV) volumes.The study comprised 50 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on HD with normal 2-day stress/rest MPGS performed for kidney transplantation risk assessment. Patients (pts) comprised 23 men/27 women, with mean age of 59.4 ± 7.1 years. The time elapsed from the last HD session in hours was calculated on both days, and patients were classified according to whether it was higher (group A: 19 pts), lower (group B: 27 pts), or equal (group C: 4 pts) on the stress vs the rest day. End-diastolic, end-systolic volumes (EDV, ESV), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were determined using QGS™ software. Transient ischemic dilation (TID) ratios were derived from the nongated images using QPS™ software.Volumes were significantly higher at stress in group A, at rest in group B, and similar in group C. TID ratios were significantly higher in group A vs groups B and C.MPGS-derived ventricular volumes are preload dependent. The high preload of the pre-HD state may mimic ischemic TID if occurring on the stress day and create confusion if coinciding with the rest day.
