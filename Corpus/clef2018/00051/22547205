An innovative approach for locally advanced stage III cutaneous melanoma:  radiotherapy, followed by nodal dissection. Patients with advanced nodal melanoma are typically managed with a regional nodal dissection however, they have a high rate of distant relapse after surgery. This study assesses the role of preoperative radiotherapy to assist with the regional control in this subset of patients. Patients who had histologically confirmed stage III malignant melanoma and were treated with preoperative radiotherapy between 2004 and 2011 were eligible. All patients were staged with computer tomography and most with [F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. Patients received preoperative radiotherapy, followed by a planned regional dissection at 12-14 weeks from completion with assessment of clinical, radiological and pathological responses. The primary outcome measure was the 1-year actuarial in-field control. There were 12 patients, with nine having disease of the axilla. All patients received radiotherapy up to a median dose of 48 Gy in 20 fractions, with seven patients achieving a partial clinical response. Ten patients proceeded to surgery, with four patients developing minor wound complications. The FDG-PET response did not appear to correlate with the pathological response. The 1-year in-field control rate was 92% (95% confidence interval 54-99) and the 1-year relapse-free survival was 54% (95% confidence interval 21-78). For selected patients with high-volume regional disease, we have successfully used preoperative radiotherapy, followed by a nodal dissection. Whether this type of protocol is of value in a more general group of patients with high-volume regional disease is currently under investigation.
