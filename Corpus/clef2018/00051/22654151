Role of biotechnology in the treatment of polyester fabric. Poly (ethylene terephthalate) fibre [PET] is the commonly used fibre for majority of end-use applications, however, the desire for improved textile properties such as wettability or hydrophilicity are increasing. Biotechnology can be defined as the application of scientific and engineering to the processing of materials by biological agents to provide goods and services. The environmental issues associated with the textile processing are not new. Currently and in the years to come, besides lower cost of operation, improved durability, wear comfort and development of new attributes for textiles, the new criteria for judging the new processes is ecology. This paves the way for biotechnology. This article throws light on the applications of enzymes for the treatment of polyester fabrics.
