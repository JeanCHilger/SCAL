Technique for the use of standard outlines for attenuation correction and quantification in SPECT. A technique is described for using a set of standard outline images for attenuation correction and quantification in SPECT. The effectiveness of the method was investigated using an anatomical phantom and in a series of 123I-mIBG patient imaging studies. In the latter measurements the ability of the technique to quantify the activity of various features in the images was compared to the use of CT images for attenuation correction. The mean difference between the two measurements was 4.4%.
