Dogs, distemper and osteitis deformans: a further epidemiological study. There is extensive evidence linking paramyxoviruses, notably measles and respiratory syncytial virus, with Paget's disease of bone. The epidemiology of Paget's disease does not fit with that of known human paramyxovirus infections and it is possible that the disease is a zoonosis with domestic animals acting as host. Canine distemper, a paramyxovirus of the morbillovirus family (closely related to measles) is therefore a potential candidate. We have surveyed previous pet ownership in 150 Paget's patients each of whom was matched with two general practice controls one from an inner city practice and the other from a suburban practice both in Greater Manchester. Recall of previous dog ownership was higher in Paget's patients with differences being more marked against inner city than suburban controls. 88% of the patients had lived in the same household as a dog at some stage compared with 79% of the inner city controls (P less than 0.05) and 83% of the suburban controls (n.s.). The differences were greater in the years 1930-60 during which the proportion of patients owning dogs was largest. For Paget's patients and controls alike, recalled exposure to dogs with canine distemper appeared to cluster in certain periods between 1930 and 1960. Unexpectedly, significantly more (7 out of 22, P less than 0.01) of the patients with a known first degree relative suffering from Paget's disease had no previous history of dog ownership when compared with the other patients (10 out of 128).
