An unusual presentation of giant cell arteritis. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a chronic vasculitis that typically presents with headache, fever and polymyalgia although atypical presentations are known. We present a case of GCA with nonproductive cough and pyrexia of unknown origin emphasizing this atypical nature of presentation. We report a rare association of GCA with granulomatous hepatitis. We also support the use of PET scanning in diagnosing and monitoring this condition.
