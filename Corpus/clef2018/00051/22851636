Age effects on serotonin receptor 1B as assessed by PET. Previous imaging studies have suggested that there is an age-related decline in brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) measures in healthy subjects. This paper addresses whether the availability of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B (5-HT(1B)) is seen to decrease with aging via PET imaging.Forty-eight healthy control subjects (mean age ± SD, 30 ± 10 y age range, 18-61 y5-HT(1B) BP(ND) decreased in the cortex at an average rate of 8% per decade without and 9% with gray matter masking. A negative association with age was also observed in all individual cortical regions. Differences in the putamen and pallidum (positive association) were significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. No sex- or race-related effects on 5-HT(1B) BP(ND) were found in any regions.These findings indicate that age is a relevant factor for 5-HT(1B) in the cortex of healthy adults.
