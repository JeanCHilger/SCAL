Long-term evaluation of TiO2-based 68Ge/68Ga generators and optimized automation of [68Ga]DOTATOC radiosynthesis. Interest in using (68)Ga is rapidly increasing for clinical PET applications due to its favorable imaging characteristics and increased accessibility. The focus of this study was to provide our long-term evaluations of the two TiO(2)-based (68)Ge/(68)Ga generators and develop an optimized automation strategy to synthesize [(68)Ga]DOTATOC by using HEPES as a buffer system. This data will be useful in standardizing the evaluation of (68)Ge/(68)Ga generators and automation strategies to comply with regulatory issues for clinical use.
