Pixel overflow artifacts in SPECT evaluation of the skeleton. The successful application of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) techniques to radionuclide evaluation of the skeleton depends on strict quality control measures, recognition of potential artifacts, and the selection of appropriate cases for specific reprocessing techniques. The application of simple image-processing routines to problems of "hot spot" and bladder pixel overflows facilitated a reduction in the technical inadequacy rate from 19% to 2% for SPECT evaluation of 100 hips, as well as improvement in diagnostic image quality in a variety of additional cases.
