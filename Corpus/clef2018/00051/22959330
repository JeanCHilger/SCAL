Positron emission tomography-computed tomography in tumors of the locomotor apparatus. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is a hybrid imaging technique that combines the anatomic information from CT with the metabolic information acquired from PET after the administration of specific radiotracers, the most commonly used of which is F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). In oncology, this technique is based on the increased uptake of FDG by malignant lesions. In the locomotor apparatus, some uptake by bones and soft tissues is physiological or benign and this uptake must be differentiated from uptake by malignancies, whether primary or secondary. The most important limitations are active inflammatory or infectious processes, which are positive on PET images, and malignant lesions that are smaller than 1cm, cystic, necrotic, or low-grade, which are negative on PET images. PET/CT in the locomotor apparatus is especially useful for the detection of metastases from the most common tumors. It is also used for staging and monitoring the response to treatment of some hematological tumors like lymphoma, where it is fundamental to determine whether the bone marrow has been infiltrated, or myeloma. Lastly, although it is not yet an established indication, PET/CT is being increasingly used to study sarcomas, because it can provide additional information that can be useful for the characterization and grading of tumors, for guiding biopsies, for staging and re-staging, and for evaluating the response to neoadjuvant therapy as well as for evaluating new drugs in clinical trials.
