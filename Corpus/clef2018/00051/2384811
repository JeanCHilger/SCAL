Volume rendering in three-dimensional display of SPECT images. Three-dimensional display utilizing volume rendering is valuable in the display of SPECT data. Volume rendering enhances continuity of structures compared to slice display, and cine display of volume rendered images facilitates understanding of spatial relationships. Image contrast and noise characteristics were analyzed for depth-weighted maximum activity projection, a form of volume rendering proposed by the authors for "hot spot" imaging in nuclear medicine. Contrast in the rendered images was nearly equal to that in slice display, and substantially improved compared to planar images. Image noise was reduced compared to both projection and slice display. Rendered images may be generated automatically in only a few minutes following filtered backprojection, permitting routine clinical use.
