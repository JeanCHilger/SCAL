Cortical pathophysiology and clinical neurologic abnormalities in acute cerebral ischemia. A serial study with single photon emission computed tomography. We studied brain cortical radioactive tracer activity in a consecutive series of nine patients with acute hemispheric ischemic stroke at their first cerebral ischemic stroke at their first cerebral ischemic episode. Results from N,N,N'-trimethyl-N'- (2-hydroxy-3-methyl-5-[123-I]-iodobenzyl)-1,3 propanediamine-2HCl (four patients) and technetium Tc 99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (five patients) single photon emission computed tomographic studies were compared with x-ray computed tomography (CT) and clinical findings within the first 48 hours, on day 10, and on day 30 after the clinical ictus. Cortical hypoactivity agreeing with the clinical findings was found on all initial scans but not in the follow-up studies. Cortical activity on the affected side in patients with stroke was significantly lower when compared with cortical activity in sex- and age-matched controls (n = 21). Computed tomography (with contrast) was less sensitive in detecting the ischemic lesions. These studies demonstrate that in the acute phase of stroke there is a single photon emission computed tomographic cortical disturbance that agrees with clinical findings, even when computed tomography scan infarction is limited to subcortical structures.
