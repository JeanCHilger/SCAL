Echocardiographic evaluation of simple transposition of great vessels subjected to physiologic correction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cardiovascular morphology after Senning's operation for transposition of the great vessels (TGV) using DÃ¶ppler-echocardiography. The study included 25 patients (pts) aged 17 to 127 months (mean = 60 +/- 27) who were evaluated 6 to 112 months (mean = 42 +/- 27) after surgery. The following parameters were analysed: right (RV) and left ventricular (LV) morphology and function tricuspid regurgitation and its severity
