Keeping pets from the psychological viewpoint. The research data are based on a representative psychological study (280 persons without domestic animals, 345 dog owners and 305 persons keeping other pets in their homes) and on an interdisciplinary pilot study in 30 households provided with dogs. The following major results deserve attention: Man and dog share a relationship of interaction and of mutual dependence. Animals are determined and shaped by man and vice versa. The dog contributes a great deal to the satisfaction of crucial human needs, to quality of life and well-being. As to adequate keeping of dogs suited to the animal there are still deficiencies in terms of knowledge in addition, discernible tendencies towards humanization in pets frequently forestall desirable behavior. To convey and to enlarge existing awareness and existing behavioral norms in connection with animal-adjusted behavior, adequate feeding, proper care, vaccination prophylaxis but also in connection with personal hygienic necessities in dealing with the pet is therefore of particular significance. The bacteriological as well as the psychological results reveal that if nutrition, care and prophylaxis appropriate to the animal and personal physical hygiene are observed correctly, health hazards for man caused by the animal and vice versa are practically impossible to occur. Traceable pathogenic findings are results of human lapses and shortcomings
