Design and clinical utility of a fan beam collimator for SPECT imaging of the head. A long bore fan beam collimator for imaging the head was designed and constructed for a SPECT system with a rotating scintillation camera. In order to avoid the patient's shoulder during rotation of the camera with a thick camera housing, the long bore design is necessary to allow the collimator to get close to the patient's head for improved spatial resolution. Operating at the minimum radius of rotation, the prototype fan beam collimator provides about the same spatial resolution as the high resolution collimator, while the geometric efficiency is equal to approximately 85% of that of the general purpose and approximately 55% higher than the high resolution collimator. Images from a phantom study demonstrate good image quality and are void of artifacts. Comparative clinical studies on temporomandibular joints (TMJ) between the LEGP and fan beam collimators also confirm the superior image quality obtained with the fan beam collimator.
