Proposal for a quality control procedure for rotating gamma camera tomographic systems. Single photon emission computerized tomography using a rotating gamma camera needs accurate calibration of electromechanical components, detection system and reconstruction software. A complete group of quality control procedures, developed on the basis of experience and experimental data acquired using a series of widely used gamma camera SPECT systems is presented. The procedures are divided into controls related to the rotational movement. of the detector and controls on the principal physical parameters characterizing a tomographic image. All quality controls here presented were performed with commercial phantoms.
