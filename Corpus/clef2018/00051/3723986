Scintigraphic diagnosis of neuroblastoma using meta-iodobenzylguanidine. In 1979/80 meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) was introduced as a radiopharmaceutical agent with high affinity to the adrenal medulla. It could be shown, that scintigraphic imaging with 131J labeled MIBG is a sensitive and highly specific method for localization of pheochromocytoma. In this connection we could demonstrate in 1983 that neuroblastoma can be visualized scintigraphically with MIBG as well. Until now 13 patients were examined with 131J-MIBG by our group: In 10 children with histologically proven neuroblastoma we found a specific enrichment in the tumor area. Besides the primary tumor local recurrence and metastases to bones, bone marrow and brain were detected. There was no neuroblastoma manifestation without MIBG uptake. In 3 patients with tumors other than neuroblastoma no uptake of MIBG was noticed. The results agree with those of other studies: If the physiological pattern of distribution is taken into consideration and if the proper imaging technique is adapted, 131J-MIBG scintigraphy is a highly sensitive and specific method for staging, monitoring of disease and follow-up of neuroblastoma.
