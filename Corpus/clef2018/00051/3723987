Initial experiences in the treatment of children with metastatic and recurrent neuroblastoma using meta-iodobenzylguanidine. At four involved hospitals 16 children were treated with Metaiodobenzylguanidine (131J-MIBG). These children had a relapse of neuroblastoma stage III or IV or did not respond sufficiently to chemotherapy. In 10 children extreme bone pain disappeared and they became free of fever during the MIBG-treatment. 10 children responded to the therapy demonstrated either by decrease of the solid tumor part or by decrease of catecholamines in urine or plasma or by decrease of bone-marrow involvement. One patient reached a complete remission continuing up to present time (longer than 180 days). 9 patients died meanwhile of tumor progression. 131J-MIBG is an effective instrument, to get a decrease of the tumor up to a complete remission in extensively pretreated patients with tumor relapse, which are refractory to chemotherapy.
