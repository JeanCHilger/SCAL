Quantitative determination of regional extravascular lung water and regional blood volume in congestive heart failure. Regional extravascular lung water (rELW) and blood volume (rBV) in five controls and 14 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) were measured by constant infusion of H215O and inhalation of 11CO using positron emission tomography (PET). The analysis of 18 regions per patient revealed a relatively homogeneous level of rELW in the controls (mean = 0.11 +/- 0.02 g/cc range, 0.08-0.21), whereas this increase in patients with CHF (0.17 +/- 0.02 g/cc
