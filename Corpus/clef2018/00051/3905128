Assessment of bone grafts used for acetabular augmentation in total hip arthroplasty. A study using roentgenograms and bone scintigraphy. Total hip arthroplasty was performed in 13 hips with acetabular bone grafts for secure component fixation. The incorporation and healing of acetabular bone grafts were investigated with the aid of roentgenograms, planar bone scans, and a newer scintigraphic technique, three-dimensional single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Conventional roentgenograms proved unreliable in evaluating bone graft reconstitution because of overlapping trabecular bone patterns of the graft and iliac wing. There was no evidence of graft failure or acetabular loosening. Bone grafts in the late follow-up group (four to seven years postoperation) exhibited normal radionuclide activity, whereas grafts less than one year postsurgery demonstrated patterns of increased activity. SPECT was helpful in producing an anatomic reconstruction of the acetabulum. The observation that bone grafts exhibited normal biological viability is crucial for ensuring secure acetabular component fixation on a long-term basis.
