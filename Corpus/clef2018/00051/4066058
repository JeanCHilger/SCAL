Synthesis of 15O-labeled butanol via organoborane chemistry. Oxygen-15 labeled 1-butanol and 2-butanol were prepared by the reaction of O2-15O with tri-n-butylborane and tri-sec-butylborane in tetrahydrofuran. The reaction products were isolated and identified via reversed-phase high performance column chromatography and gas chromatography. Radiochemical yields of 50% (EOB) were obtained. The use of 15O-labeled butanol is suggested for cerebral blood flow measurements in conjunction with PET.
