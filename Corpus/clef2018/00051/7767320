An automated [15Q]H2O production and injection system for PET imaging. A computer controlled [15O]H2O injection system has been designed for multiple bolus injections during PET cerebral blood flow studies. The system is housed in a lead safe, and radiation exposure to nearby personnel is low we have measured rates of approx. 100 microSv/h (10 mR/h) during 2 min of [15O]H2O production and < 50 microSv/h (< 5 mR/h) after 3.7 GBq (100 mCi) has been produced. Reproducibility studies show that the injected activity varies with a coefficient of variation of 2-3%.
