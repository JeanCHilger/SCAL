Single photon emission computed tomography of the brain in patients with chemical sensitivities. Chemical sensitivities display a recurrent pattern on scintigraphic examinations of the brain. The pattern can include mismatching between early and late imaging, multiple hot and cold foci distributed throughout the cortex without regard to lobar distribution (salt and pepper pattern), temporal asymmetries, and sometimes increased activity in the basal ganglia. This study used Desert Shield/Desert Storm veterans who present with abnormal neurological and psychological symptoms as a model to exhibit abnormalities by brain scintigraphy. These are typical of those seen in patients with documented exposure to neurotoxic compounds who develop a clinical syndrome that has been termed "chemical sensitivity." Exposure to cocaine, alcohol, and other substances of abuse can result in abnormal scintigrams of the brain using tracers such as [technetium-99m]hexamethylpropyleneoxime. This study used techniques combining regional cerebral blood flow data with delayed distributional data after the intracellular conversion of the tracer into a hydrophilic molecule. In addition to delayed image abnormalities, a mismatch occurs in the regional activity between the two image sets of the veterans. This degree of mismatch was not seen in control subjects who were screened for avoidance of neurotoxic agents. Patterns identified from examinations performed on patients with known exposure to petroleum distillates, pesticides and other materials linked with neurotoxicity were identified in some veterans of the Desert Shield/Desert Storm operation. A single case of repeated examinations on a veteran showed a reversion of these patterns toward normal after therapy. This reversion followed independent assessments of clinical improvement.
