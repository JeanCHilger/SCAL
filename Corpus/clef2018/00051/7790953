PET studies on brain monoamine transporters with carbon-11-beta-CIT in Parkinson's disease. The cocaine analog 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-[4-iodophenyl]tropane (beta-CIT) labeled with 11C was used to study dopamine reuptake sites with PET.Three normal subjects and nine patients with Parkinson's disease were investigated. Each of them underwent a dynamic PET scan (25 timeframes over 80 min) with [11C]-beta-CIT. A dose of 102.5-211.3 MBq (2.77-5.71 mCi) of this ligand was administered intravenously and a PET examination with an ECAT 931/08 PET camera was carried out. Ratios between the striatal/cortical/thalamic/midbrain and cerebellar uptake of this radioligand were calculated.The highest accumulation of [11C]beta-CIT was observed in the caudate and putamen, though there was some uptake in the thalamus and the midbrain. Cortical uptake was negligible. Carbon-11-beta-CIT accumulated significantly less in the putamen of the Parkinson's patients than in the normal subjects. The putamen-to-cerebellum ratio in the Parkinson's patients was 1.59 +/- 0.04 and 1.80 +/- 0.13s (p = 0.028) in the normal subjects. In the caudate, there was no significant difference between the Parkinson's patients and the normal subjects.These results imply that [11C]beta-CIT is a useful compound for carrying out a PET examination of the function of the presynaptic monoaminergic neurons both in normal and pathological brains.
