Specificity and sensitivity of exercise-induced ST segment elevation for detection of residual viability: comparison with fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of exercise-induced ST segment elevation for the detection of residual myocardial viability.Assessment of residual viability after myocardial infarction is relevant for establishing indication for revascularization. We have previously shown that exercise-induced ST segment elevation is a marker of residual viability.We studied 34 patients with a previous Q wave myocardial infarction (anterior in 21, inferior in 13) of whom 18 (group A) had exercise-induced ST segment elevation in more than one lead (mean [+/- SD] 1.8 +/- 0.9 mm, range 1 to 4) and 16 (group B) did not. All patients underwent rest technetium-99m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), fluorine-18 (F-18) fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and coronary angiography. The time elapsed between the infarction and the viability study was 72 +/- 108 days (range 15 to 400) in group A and 516 +/- 545 days (range 14 to 1,800) in group B.The presence and site of previous infarction were confirmed by SPECT studies in all 34 patients. Uptake of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose within the infarcted area was present in 18 of 18 patients in group A but in only 9 (56%) of 16 in group B (p < 0.01). In patients with an anterior infarction, the sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of exercise-induced ST segment elevation for detection of residual viability were 82%, 100% and 86%, respectively (95% confidence intervals 46% to 83.5%, 59% to 100% and 55.6% to 87.1%, respectively).Exercise-induced ST segment elevation in infarct-related leads has a high specificity and acceptable sensitivity for detection of residual viability within the infarcted area.
