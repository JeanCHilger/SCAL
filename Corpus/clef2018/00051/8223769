Repeated fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography of the brain in infants with suspected hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury. Positron emission tomography (PET) permits the study of cerebral metabolism in vivo. We performed repeated PET studies with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer to measure cerebral glucose metabolism for estimation of neurological prognosis in infants with suspected hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury. Fourteen infants (gestational age 35.3 +/- 4.67 weeks) were examined during the neonatal period (at age 38.4 +/- 2.7 weeks) and again at the age of 3.5 +/- 0.7 months one further infant was studied only once at the age of 2.5 months. All children also underwent ultrasound examinations. Electroencephalography and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were performed according to their clinical condition and their neurological development has been followed. FDG accumulated most actively in the subcortical areas (thalami, brainstem and cerebellum) and the sensorimotor cortex during the neonatal period. The repeated PET study showed that the uptake of FDG was markedly high and increased in all brain sections of infants with normal development (n = 11), whereas those with delayed development (n = 4) had significantly lower values (P < or = 0.005).
