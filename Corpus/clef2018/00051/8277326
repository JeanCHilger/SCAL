Metabolic and cognitive changes in hereditary ataxia. Fourteen subjects (affected, n = 7 at risk, n = 7) from one well-known kindred with adult onset autosomal dominant olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA), were studied with [18F]-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cognitive testing and scored neurological examination, and compared with normal controls. The neurological examination, MRI and cognitive tests showed no significant differences between at risk and normal control subjects. Mild cognitive deficits were seen in affected subjects
