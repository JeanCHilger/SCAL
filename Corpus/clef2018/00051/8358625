Simultaneous demonstration of Fos-like immunoreactivity and 2-deoxy-glucose uptake in the inferior colliculus of the mouse. Fos-like immunoreactivity and 2-deoxy-glucose uptake can be visualized in adjacent sections of the same brain by applying a modified cytochemical reaction protocol. This study demonstrates that the two methods correspond to each other in mapping the tonotopic organization of the inferior colliculus.
