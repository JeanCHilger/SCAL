99mTc-ECD dynamic SPECT in "luxury perfusion" of subacute stroke. To evaluate the cerebral pharmacokinetics of 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer (99mTc-ECD) at blood flow levels beyond the normal range, we investigated "luxury perfusion" in subacute stroke, ictal hyperperfusion in epilepsy and post-decompressive hyperemia in head trauma. All 7 patients showed a hyperactive area on SPECT studies using 99mTc-HM-PAO. 99mTc-ECD static image demonstrated a hyperactive area in both epilepsy and head trauma, and a hypoactive area in "luxury perfusion." On the dynamic SPECT of 99mTc-ECD in both epilepsy and head trauma, brain distribution of the tracer was determined within 2 min. postinjection and remained stable for up to 1 hour however, "luxury perfusion" area showed a change from initial hyperactivity to late hypoactivity with the passage of time. The time activity curve in "luxury perfusion" area demonstrated a steep decrease of counts/pixel for up to 4-5 minutes postinjection, and a moderate decrease in the following phase. The early wash-out mechanism of 99mTc-ECD from "luxury perfusion" area can be described by a biexponential function including an initial steep decrease representing the rapid loss of the lipophilic complexes which were not metabolized in injured brain tissue.
