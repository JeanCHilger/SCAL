Evidence for limbic system activation during CO2-stimulated breathing in man. 1. The role of supra-brainstem structures in the ventilatory response to inhaled CO2 is unknown. The present study uses positron emission tomography (PET), with infusion of H2(15)O, to measure changes in relative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in order to identify sites of increased neuronal activation during CO2-stimulated breathing (CO2-SB) in awake man. 2. Five male volunteers were scanned during CO2-SB (mean +/- S.E.M. end-tidal PCO2, 50.3 +/- 1.7 mmHg
