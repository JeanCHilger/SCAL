Bartonella (Rochalimaea) antibodies, dementia, and cat ownership among men infected with human immunodeficiency virus. To determine the association between recent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia and serum antibodies to Bartonella (Rochalimaea) henselae, we performed a nested case control study within the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study in Los Angeles. We measured serum IgG and IgM antibodies to B. henselae with use of enzyme immunoassay in 369 HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative participants with and without recent neuropsychological deterioration. Data on pet ownership were also collected. IgM antibodies to B. henselae were strongly associated with neuropsychological decline or dementia (OR = 6.695% CI = 1.4-31.9
