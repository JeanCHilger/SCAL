Intractable epilepsy in children. Although most children with epilepsy have a good prognosis, a small but significant minority have seizures that either do not respond to conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or have significant adverse reactions to AEDs. Many children may benefit from epilepsy surgery. Surgical treatment of epilepsy is becoming a well-established therapy for infants and young children with severe, medically intractable seizures. As in older children and adults, the presurgical evaluations of possible surgical candidates typically consist of a detailed history, neurologic and neuropsychologic examination, and anatomic and functional neuroimaging. The "gold standard" test, however, is the recording of ictal events by using simultaneous EEG and videomonitoring. Although temporal lobe resection is the most commonly performed surgery in older children and adults, nontemporal lobe resection, corpus callosotomy, and hemispherectomy are commonly performed in younger children. Efficacy of surgery in children compares favorably with results from adult patients. In addition, because the immature brain is more plastic than the mature brain, recovery of function is often greater after surgery in children than in adults. Early surgery in children with intractable epilepsy is recommended.
