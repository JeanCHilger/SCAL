Cerebral activation during performance of a card sorting test. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is used clinically for evaluating frontal lobe function, but there is some controversy as to its specificity for detecting frontal lobe damage. To investigate the cerebral regions essential to the performance of the Card Sorting Test, we measured the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 18 normal subjects by PET under the three conditions: (i) during the Modified Card Sorting Test (MCST) (ii) during a matching-to-sample (MTS) task, based on the MCST, but with selective attention to one of three stimulus categories (colour, number or shape) as a control to cancel the effects of maintenance of sets in the MCST
