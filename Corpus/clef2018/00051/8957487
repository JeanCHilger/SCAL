Questionability of the benefits of routine laparotomy as the surgical approach for pheochromocytomas and abdominal paragangliomas. Improvement of preoperative imaging of pheochromocytomas and abdominal paragangliomas may render routine laparotomy questionable as the surgical approach of choice for these lesions.We studied the records of 100 patients with chromaffin tumors who underwent abdominal exploration. The disease was familial in 28 patients and was malignant in 19. Seventy-five patients had intraadrenal disease (bilateral in 13). Computed tomography (CT), metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed since 1979, 1984, and 1987 in 97, 73, and 43 patients, respectively. False-positive and false-negative results were defined as any discrepancy between imaging results and surgical findings.Overall accuracy of preoperative localization was 85% with CT scan, 77% with MIBG scintigraphy, and 86% with MRI. In unilateral pheochromocytoma, accuracy was 94% with CT scan, 80% with MIBG scintigraphy, and 96% with MRI. When all three studies were performed (n = 38), overall accuracy was 97% and only one extraadrenal tumor in a patient with familial pheochromocytoma was overlooked.The outstanding accuracy of available imaging techniques questions the strategy of routine laparotomy for sporadic and seemingly benign pheochromocytomas, favoring more elective approaches such as the posterior approach or laparoscopy.
