A reappraisal of exercise electrocardiographic indexes of the severity of ischemic heart disease: angiographic and scintigraphic correlates. We explored how the exercise electrocardiographic (ECG) indexes generally presumed to signify severe ischemic heart disease (IHD) correlate with coronary angiographic and scintigraphic myocardial perfusion findings.In exercise testing, it is generally assumed that the early onset of ST segment depression and its occurrence at a low rate-pressure product (ischemic threshold) the amount of maximal ST segment depressionWe prospectively carried out a symptom-limited 12-lead Bruce protocol thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) exercise test in 66 consecutive subjects with stable angina, > or = 70% stenosis of at least one coronary artery, normal rest ECG and left ventricular wall motion and a prior positive exercise ECG. The above ECG indexes, vessel disease (VD), a VD score and the quantitative thallium-SPECT measures of the extent, maximal deficit and redistribution gradient of the perfusion abnormality were characterized.Maximal ST segment depression could not differentiate the number of diseased vessels was not related to VD score, maximal thallium deficit or redistribution gradientIn this homogeneous study group, the exercise ECG indexes did not necessarily signify more severe IHD by angiographic and scintigraphic criteria. Lack of concordance between the exercise ECG, angiography and myocardial scintigraphy suggests that these diagnostic modalities examine different facets of myocardial ischemia, underscoring the need for caution in the interpretation of their results.
