Behavior of Na131I and meta(131I) iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) in municipal sewerage. Behavior of 131I activity in primary sludge at the Ann Arbor, Michigan, Municipal Waste Water Treatment Plant was studied in relation to known radioiodine therapy events at the University of Michigan Hospital complex. The principal compounds administered are Na131I, which has widespread use, and meta (131I) iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), which is a compound unique to the University of Michigan, although labeled antibodies and other forms are also used in therapy and research. The objectives of the study were to determine the environmental fate of such discharges and to determine radiation exposures to workers and the public when sludges are incinerated. Approximately 17% of the MIBG activity administered in a therapy was found in the primary sludge, whereas only 1.1% of the Na131I was in sludge. When land applied, the short half life of 131I in the sludge presents few radiological health concerns however, incineration, which is done in winter months, is assumed to release organically bound 131I to the atmosphere. Radiation doses due to incineration of sludge containing measured concentrations were calculated for a maximally exposed worker to be 1.7 microSv (0.17 mrem) of which 0.48 microSv (0.048 mrem) was due to a 2-d upset condition. For a more typically exposed worker, and a member of the public, the committed effective dose equivalents were 1.2 microSv (0.12 mrem) and 0.06 microSv (0.006 mrem), respectively, for a 22-wk incineration period with release of all radioiodine in the sludge. Transport time to the treatment plant for radioiodine was found to be much longer than that of normal sewage, possibly due to organic material in sewer lines that absorb iodine. The residence time of radioiodine in the sewer also appears to be longer than expected
