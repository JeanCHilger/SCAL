Radiation safety considerations for PET centers. This article explains why technologists handling positron-emitting radionuclides may have higher measured radiation exposures than technologists working with single-photon emitting radionuclides. We will summarize measurements we have made, as well as those reported by other authors. In addition, we will describe the procedures implemented to minimize exposure.
