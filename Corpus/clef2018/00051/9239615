Technical improvements in fluorine-18-FDG PET imaging of the abdomen and pelvis. PET tumor imaging of the abdomen and pelvis is prone to artifacts due to urinary tract activity. A new technique has been developed to reduce such artifacts and enhance study interpretation.Thirty minutes after the injection of 18F-FDG, 500 cc 0.45% NaCl were administered intravenously over 30 min and a Foley catheter was placed in the bladder. At the start of imaging (60 min post-injection), furosemide was given (0.3 mg/kg). Prior to imaging the pelvis, the urinary catheter was clamped and saline was introduced retrograde into the bladder until full.This technique has been used successfully in more than 130 patients, resulting in a marked improvement in study quality and tumor detection.Hydration and administration of furosemide, along with placement of a Foley catheter in the bladder, have proven effective in eliminating image artifacts originating from the kidneys, ureters and bladder. Backfilling the bladder also provides a well-defined anatomic landmark for study interpretation.
