19F NMR of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose for tumor diagnosis in mice. An NDP-bound hexose analog as a new NMR target for imaging. A well-known radiopharmaceutical 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose widely used for positron emission tomography diagnosis in terms of glucose utilization, was re-evaluated here as a nuclear magnetic resonance pharmaceutical for cancer detection. The uptake and metabolism of FDG in the experimental tumor, MH134, transplanted to the peritoneum of C3H mice as an ascitic tumor was studied extensively by ex vivo 19F NMR. Prolonged retention of FDG and its metabolites over 2 days was confirmed in the tumor cells as well as in the heart. In these tissues, the 6-phosphate of the injected compound was converted reversibly to its epimer 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-mannose and further to their NDP bound forms. The metabolites were almost cleared within a day from the other healthy organs where the formation of NDP-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-mannose was low. Thus, the 19F NMR signal of NDP-FDM detected 1 day after the FDG injection could be used as a target signal for tumor detection. Through the use of in vivo 19F NMR spectra and 19F chemical shift images, the feasibility of this proposal was demonstrated. It was concluded that FDG-NMR has a potential for tumor diagnosis in animals.
