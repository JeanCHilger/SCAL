11C-methionine: an effective radio-tracer for PET scan in the detection of tumors of low proliferating capacity. 11C-methyl-methionine is available at the PET Center of University Medical School Debrecen since June, 1996. The first 5 oncological examinations were indicated for clinically suspected recurrent/residual tumorous tissue of low-grade/low proliferative capacity, following the negative or inconclusive results of previous 18F-deoxyglucose (FDG) examinations. In these situations, the methionine examinations provided conclusive results in 4 cases (out of the total of 5 examinations). On the basis of published data and own experience, the authors recommend methionine PET investigations for diagnosis, differential diagnosis and therapy monitoring of tumours of low-grade/low proliferative capacity following inconclusive results of previous FDG examination.
