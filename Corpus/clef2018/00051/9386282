Input function in PET brain studies using MR-defined arteries. The internal carotid arteries were drawn as region of interests (ROIs) on proton density weighted MR images. After transferring the ROIs from the MR to the PET images from the same subject, time-radioactivity curves were calculated for each ROI and the radioactivity curves were used for determination of the blood input function in dynamic brain PET studies. The method is validated by comparing measurements with those from an external on-line continuous flow-through arterial blood-sampling system.
