Metabolic imaging by positron emission tomography early after myocardial infarction as a predictor of recovery of myocardial function after reperfusion. Myocardial ischemia leads to alterations in myocardial substrate metabolism that have been shown to reflect severity of ischemic injury. The purpose of this study was to correlate oxidative metabolism with recovery of contractile function in patients with acute myocardial infarction.Regional blood flow and oxidative metabolism were assessed by dynamic positron emission tomography early after myocardial infarction treated with thrombolytic therapy in 18 patients. The extent of myocardial perfusion abnormally (carbon 11-labeled acetate uptake relative amplitude < or = 50%) was inversely correlated with the ejection fraction obtained within 8 hours of the onset of chest pain (r = -0.81Thus in patients studied with positron emission tomography early after myocardial infarction, comparison of regional perfusion and oxidative metabolism was more predictive of recovery in contractile function than was assessment of either one alone.
