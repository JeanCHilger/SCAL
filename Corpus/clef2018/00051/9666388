Evaluation of long-term prognosis in patients with heart failure: is cardiac imaging with iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine useful?. The effect of cardiac sympathetic activity on long-term prognosis in patients with heart failure was evaluated by cardiac imaging with iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) in 46 patients admitted for the first episode of heart failure (idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy: 18, ischemic heart disease: 10, hypertensive heart disease: 7, valvular heart disease: 4, others: 7). Cardiac imaging was performed with 123I-MIBG and thallium-201 (201Tl) at rest on separate days before discharge. Using whole body imaging, the ratio of cardiac uptake of the isotope to total injected dose was calculated (percentage uptake). The cardiac uptake ratio of 123I-MIBG (percentage uptake of 123I-MIBG divided by percentage uptake of 201Tl) and percentage washout of 123I-MIBG from the heart over 3 hours were calculated as scintigraphic parameters. Cardiac events were defined as cardiac death or deterioration of heart failure requiring readmission. Scintigraphic parameters, clinical parameters, left ventricular function obtained by echocardiography and neurohumoral parameters were compared between the event group and event-free group. During the follow-up period of 26.9 +/- 13.9 (7.1-53.8 months), cardiac events developed in 14 patients (cardiac death in 10 and deterioration of heart failure in 4 30%). Univariate analysis showed uptake ratio and washout rate of 123I-MIBG, percentage uptake of 201Tl, New York Heart Association class at discharge, fractional shortening of the left ventricle, serum norepinephrine and atrial natriuretic peptide levels differed significantly between the two groups. Cox proportional-hazard analysis showed that the uptake ratio was an independent predictor of cardiac events (p < 0.0001). When a cut-off point in the uptake ratio equal to or less than 0.50 and age equal to or more than 65 years old were included in the Cox proportional-hazard analysis instead of actual numbers, relative risks of cardiac events by each index were 31.2 (95% confidence interval, 3.9 to 247.6
