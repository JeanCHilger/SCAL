Development of step-specific PET tracers for studying fatty acid beta-oxidation: biodistribution of [1-(11)C] octanoate analogs in rats and a cat. To evaluate the potential of [1-(11)C]-3-(R,S)-methyloctanoate (BMOA), [1-(11)C]-2-octynoate, and [1-(11)C]-2-decynoate as PET tracers for studying particular steps in fatty acid beta-oxidation, we examined the pharmacokinetics of these compounds in rats and a cat. In rats given these compounds, high levels of radioactivity accumulated in the heart, liver, and kidneys, suggesting their potential as tracers for studying beta-oxidation in these tissues. These organs were clearly visible with PET in a cat given BMOA, indicating the utility of BMOA for imaging these organs.
