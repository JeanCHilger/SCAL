Activation of the insular and opercular regions of the monkey by drinking as revealed by positron emission tomography. We measured the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the monkey using positron emission tomography (PET) in the following conditions: self-initiated (SELF), visually-initiated (VISUAL), and color-discriminating go/no-go (GONOGO) hand movement tasks with reward of water, free reward condition (REWARD), and resting states (REST). The insulae, frontal opercula, and mouth sensorimotor area were activated in any of SELF, VISUAL, GONOGO, and REWARD, when compared with REST. These findings suggest that the insular and opercular regions play an important role in the neural processes involved in drinking.
