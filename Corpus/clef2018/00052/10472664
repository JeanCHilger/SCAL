Positron emission tomography receptor studies in epilepsy. Investigations with specific PET ligands that bind to specific neuro-receptors give information on abnormalities of neurotransmission involved in the pathophysiology of the epilepsies. Data need to be interpreted in the light of optimal structural imaging. Objective voxel-based and region-based analyses, with correction of partial volume effect, are complementary. Central benzodiazepine (cBZR) and opioid receptors have been studied most. Reduced cBZR binding is commonly seen at an epileptic focus, in a more restricted distribution than an area of hypometabolism, and sometimes also in projection areas. In contrast to acquired lesions causing partial seizures, focal increases in cBZR binding have been demonstrated in malformations of cortical development and also in areas of brain that appear normal on MRI, indicating the widespread nature of the abnormalities. Focal abnormalities of cBZR are also commonly found in patients with partial seizures and normal MRI. It is not yet clear how useful these data will prove to be in presurgical evaluation. Mu- and delta-opioid receptors have been found to be increased in temporal neocortex overlying mesial temporal epileptic foci, but with different patterns of increase. Dynamic studies of the binding of 11C-diprenorphine to opioid receptors are possible using PET, and have implied the release of cerebral endogenous opioids at the time of serial absences and reflex seizures induced by reading. Other tracers, that have been applied less widely, label the enzyme monoamine oxidase type B and peripheral benzodiazepine and histamine H1 receptors.
