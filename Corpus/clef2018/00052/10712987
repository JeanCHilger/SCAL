Safety, hemodynamic profile, and feasibility of dobutamine stress technetium myocardial perfusion single-photon emission CT imaging for evaluation of coronary artery disease in the elderly. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. The evaluation of coronary artery disease by exercise stress testing is frequently limited by the patient's inability to exercise. Although pharmacologic stress testing with dobutamine is an alternative, the safety of dobutamine myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in the elderly has not been previously studied.We studied the safety and feasibility of dobutamine (up to 40 microg/kg/min)-atropine (up to 1 mg) stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy using technetium single-photon emission CT imaging in 227 patients > or = 70 years old (mean +/- SD age, 75 +/- 4 years). A control group of 227 patients < 70 years old (mean age, 55 +/- 11 years matched for gender, prevalence of previous infarction, beta-blocker therapy, and severity of resting perfusion abnormalities) was studied to assess age-related differences in the safety and the hemodynamic response. A feasible test was defined as the achievement of the target heart rate and/or an ischemic end point (angina, ST-segment depression, or reversible perfusion abnormalities).No myocardial infarction or death occurred during the test. The target heart rate was achieved more frequently in the elderly patients (87% vs 79% p < 0.05). The elderly patients had a higher prevalence of supraventricular tachycardia (7% vs 1%Dobutamine-atropine stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy is a highly feasible method for the evaluation of coronary artery disease in the elderly. Elderly patients have a higher risk for developing hypotension and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias during a dobutamine stress test. However, dobutamine-induced hypotension is often asymptomatic and rarely necessitates the termination of the test.
