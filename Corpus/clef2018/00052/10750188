The cortical interactions in short time intervals during the search for verbal associations. Cortical connectivity was studied in tasks of generating the use of words in comparison with reading aloud the same words. These tasks were used earlier in PET and high-density ERP recording studies, which described both the functional anatomy and time course of involvement of cortical areas in word processing. We developed a new method for studying the synchrony of EEG spectral components within the short time intervals compatible with the duration of particular cognitive operations. The wavelet transform of the ERP records and calculation of correlations between the wavelet curves were used to reveal connections between cortical areas. Three stages of intracortical communications developing over the course of task performance were discovered: between the right and left frontal areas (0-200 ms after the stimulus presentation), between the left frontal and left posterior temporo-parietal areas (250-500 ms), and, finally, between the left temporal and right fronto-centro-temporal areas. These findings are in good agreement with the results of the previous PET and ERP studies and supplement them with the circuitry of cortical information transfer. Also, they suggest some differences in information processing during automated reading and performance of more complicated use-generation task.
