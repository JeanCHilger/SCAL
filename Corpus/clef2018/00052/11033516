Neuropsychological correlates of cerebral blood flow anomalies and MRI lesions after rupture of anterior communicating artery aneurysms. The aim of this study was to investigate relations between neuropsychological disorders resulting from rupture of aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery, regional cerebral blood flow anomalies and brain lesions revealed on MRI. Blood flow was analyzed in 22 consecutive patients at least 3 weeks after surgery using single photon emission computed tomography. Flow values were calculated in 10 regions of interest on each side of the brain. Attention, motor control, executive functions, short-term and long-term learning (verbal, visuo-spatial), categorical evocation, general intellectual performances were investigated. Flow drop was observed over frontal areas, which predominated on the right side. The correlation analyses showed that
