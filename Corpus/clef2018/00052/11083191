Accuracy of exercise stress technetium 99m sestamibi SPECT imaging in the evaluation of the extent and location of coronary artery disease in patients with an earlier myocardial infarction. This study assessed the accuracy of exercise methoxy isobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in the evaluation of the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with an earlier myocardial infarction.We studied 135 patients (mean age, 57+/-10 years 115 men) at a mean of 4.1 years (median, 1 year) after myocardial infarction with symptom-limited bicycle exercise stress and rest MIBI SPECT imaging. Coronary angiography was performed within 3 months. Significant CAD was defined as a stenosis of 50% or larger in luminal diameter in 1 or more major coronary arteries. Myocardial perfusion defects (fixed, reversible, or both) were detected in 107 of the 113 patients with significant CAD and in 10 of the 22 patients without significant CAD (sensitivity, 95%Exercise MIBI SPECT imaging is an accurate method for the diagnosis and localization of CAD in patients with an earlier myocardial infarction. The technique provides a high specificity and moderate sensitivity for the diagnosis of multivessel CAD on the basis of myocardial perfusion abnormalities in more than 1 vascular region.
