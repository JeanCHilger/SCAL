Nicorandil affords cardioprotection in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty: assessment with thallium-201/iodine-123 BMIPP dual SPECT. It has been reported that nicorandil restores blood flow to reperfused myocardium in patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, whether nicorandil might decrease infarct size remains unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of nicorandil on infarct size with thallium-201/beta-methyl-p-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) dual-isotope single photon emission computed tomography.A total of 62 patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous nicorandil (4 mg in 5 minutes at admission, immediately followed by 6 mg/hr over a 24-hour period) or placebo. All patients were divided into 4 groups: Group N-a, 16 patients with preexisting angina treated with nicorandil N-b, 15 patients without preexisting angina treated with nicorandilThe BMIPP severity index was similar among the 4 groups. Only the thallium severity index in the N-a group was significantly less (P<.05). The ratio of the thallium severity index to that of BMIPP in the N-a group was significantly decreased compared with those of the other groups.Nicorandil has a protective effect in patients with acute myocardial infarction and preexisting angina treated with primary balloon angioplasty.
