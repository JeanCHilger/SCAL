Absolute quantitation of coronary steal induced by intravenous dipyridamole. The study was done to determine whether coronary steal (defined as an absolute decrease in perfusion from resting blood flow) is induced by intravenous (IV) dipyridamole in patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD).Myocardial ischemia during coronary vasodilation is usually attributed to coronary steal. However, there is limited data on the absolute magnitude of coronary steal in humans.Eighteen patients with multivessel CAD underwent dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with 13NH3 at rest and after infusion of IV dipyridamole. Eight myocardial sectors were analyzed per short axis slice and myocardial blood flow calculated with a two-compartment model in absolute terms.Coronary steal occurred in 8 of the 18 patients. In the 8 patients with coronary steal, myocardial blood flow decreased from 90 +/- 18 ml/100 g/min at rest to 68 +/- 27 ml/100 g/min following dipyridamole in the segments with steal, and increased from 87 +/- 19 to 138 +/- 16 ml/100 g/min following dipyridamole in the segments without steal. Significant clinical correlates of coronary steal were either ST elevation or the combination of ST depression and angina.Coronary vasodilation with IV dipyridamole is associated with significant reductions in blood flow to collateral-dependent myocardium consistent with coronary steal in about 45% of patients with severe CAD.
