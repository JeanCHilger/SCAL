The use of seizure-alert dogs. We report our experience of training dogs to assist people with epilepsy by providing a useful warning of seizures. An unexpected finding has been that human subjects report an improvement in seizure rate. This may be related to increased confidence and activity levels. We have observed some hazards associated with untrained dogs, which raises questions about future experimental design. We plan further research to test our method and assess outcomes more formally. Recent changes in UK quarantine law provide an opportunity for further international collaboration.
