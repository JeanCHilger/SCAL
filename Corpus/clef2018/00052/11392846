Receptor occupancy and antipsychotic drug action measured by PET and SPECT. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies have demonstrated consistent findings of high dopamine D2 receptor occupancy (> 65-70%) in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Further, the risk of extrapyramidal side effects has been shown high in patients with occupancy above 80%. On the basis of these findings, an optimal interval for D2 receptor occupancy between 70% and 80% has been suggested. It has also been shown that several atypical antipsychotics induce marked occupancy of central 5-HT2 and D2 receptors in vivo. However, a low D2 occupancy has been observed in patients with clinical dose of clozapine or quetiapine. The antipsychotic effect of these atypical drugs with a low D2 receptor occupancy has been widely discussed with respect to actions on other receptor systems, limbic selectivity of antipsychotic action and episodic transient occupancy. The recent advances in PET/SPECT and developments of new radioligands have made it possible to evaluate antipsychotic drug actions directly in humans. The empirical data from occupancy measurements will enable us to open future directions of investigation of antipsychotic action and improvement of antipsychotic treatment.
