Cortical connectivity during word association search. Cortical connectivity was studied in tasks of generating the use of words in comparison with reading aloud the same words. These tasks were used earlier in PET and high density ERP recordings studies (Posner and Raichle, 1997 Abdullaev and Posner, 1998), in which both the functional anatomy and the time course of cortical areas involved in word processing were described. The wavelet transforms of ERP records and the calculation of correlations between wavelet curves were used to reveal connections between cortical areas. Three stages of intracortical communications while task performance were found. These were: (1) the connections between right and left frontal and central areas which preceded stimulus delivery and persisted up to 180 ms after it
