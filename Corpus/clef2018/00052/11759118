99mTc-Sestamibi SPECT is a useful technique for viability detection: results of a comparison with NH3/FDG PET. Assessment of myocardial viability by 99mTc-Sestamibi Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) has been suggested as a more readily available and cheaper alternative to Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with 13N-ammonia (NH3) and 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG). We hypothesized that a semi-quantitative evaluation by SPECT could delineate myocardial viability with an acceptable concordance to PET.Fifty patients (age 57+/-7 years ejection fraction 28 +/- 8%), with ischemic cardiomyopathy, underwent SPECT and PET imaging in random order. Viability by SPECT was defined as a defect size <50% of the segment area, or a defect representing > or =50% of the segment but with a mean activity > or =50% of peak activity. PET viability was defined as a perfusion score >2 and FDG score < or =2 (five-point scale, 0 = normal, 4 = absent activity).By segmental comparison to PET. SPECT yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 82% for detection of viable myocardium. The positive and negative predictive values were 96% and 58%, respectively.In patients with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy 99mTc-Sestamibi SPECT can delineate viable myocardium with an acceptable segmental concordance to NH3/FDG PET.
