Neurally mediated syncope and cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor function. To evaluate the mechanism of neurally mediated syncope (NMS), we investigated basal autonomic nerve function using a conventional pharmacological method and [123I]-metaiodobenzyl-guanidine (MIBG) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Nine patients with NMS, whose syncope was induced by head-up tilt test with or without isoproterenol, underwent [123I]-MIBG SPECT. Eight of nine NMS patients showed reduced myocardial uptake (two patients, diffuse four patients, anteroseptal and inferior
