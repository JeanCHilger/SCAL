(Z)-1,4-diamino-2-butene as a vector of boron, fluorine, or iodine for cancer therapy and imaging: synthesis and biological evaluation. Polyamine vectors are attractive for tumor targeting. We envisaged (Z)-1,4-diamino-2-butene (Z-DAB), an unsaturated analogue of putrescine as vector of (10)B, (18)F and (131)I for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), and tumor imaging by positron emission tomography or scintigraphy respectively. In the present work, the synthesis and characterization of new derivatives of Z-DAB were reported. Z-DAB was actively transported in cells via the polyamine transport system and converted into the spermidine analogue.(E)-2-iodo-1,4-diamino-2-butene (E-I-DAB) was not taken up by the polyamine transport system and may not be suitable for tumor imaging. In contrast, (Z)-2-[4-(5,5-dimethyl-dioxaborinan-2-yl)phenyl]methyl-1,4-diamino-2-butene (Z-4-Bbz-DAB) was a substrate of the transport system and allowed significant boron accumulation in 3LL cells. Its potential in BNCT will be evaluated.
