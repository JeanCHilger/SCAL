Cerebral metabolic changes in early multiple system atrophy: a PET study. Previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies have shown widespread hypometabolism in the brain of advanced MSA but the time course of these metabolic abnormalities is largely unknown. In order to clarify the principal disease processes in multiple system atrophy (MSA) in the early stage, we investigated regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMGglc) and nigral dopaminergic function in nine patients with early stage of MSA using [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and 6-L-[(18)F]fluorodopa ((18)F-Dopa) positron emission tomography (PET) (two men and seven women age, 59.3+/-5.4 years
