Management of patients with symptomatic carotid artery occlusion. The annual risk of stroke in patients with symptomatic carotid artery occlusion (CAO) and impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF) is approximately 10%. Increased oxygen extraction fraction measured by positron emission tomography (PET) and low cerebrovascular reactivity assessed by transcranial Doppler is associated with an increased risk of recurrent ischemic stroke in these patients. Recently, other risk factors have been identified: (1) symptoms of purported hemodynamic origin (2) ongoing symptoms in the presence of documented symptomatic CAO
