Stroke: imaging and differential diagnosis. Structural and vascular imaging helps to differentiate haemorrhagic from acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and rule out non-stroke causes, as well as identify specific subtypes of stroke such as carotid dissection and venous thrombosis. However, it is negative in most AIS patients within 3-6 hrs of onset and thus does not allow efficient patient classification for management purposes. Physiologic neuroimaging with PET, SPECT and combined diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MR gives access to tissue perfusion and cell function/homeostasis. It has near 100% sensitivity in AIS, even in small cortical or brainstem strokes. In middle-cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, physiologic imaging also allows pathophysiological differentiation into four tissue subtypes: i) already irreversibly damaged ("core") ii) severely hypoperfused ("penumbra"), which represents the main target for therapy
