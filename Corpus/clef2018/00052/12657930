Ductulo-insular pancreatic endocrine neoplasms: clinicopathologic analysis of a unique subtype of pancreatic endocrine neoplasms. Pancreatic neoplasms with mixed ductal and endocrine components are a heterogeneous group of tumors. The least recognized of these are pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) displaying benign-appearing tumor-associated ductules. To characterize these ductulo-insular pancreatic endocrine tumors (DI-PETs), we reviewed a series of 92 resected PETs. To be considered as a DI-PET we required the presence and tight intermingling of ductules with the dominant endocrine component (including the presence of ductulo-insular units). A total of 15 PETs fulfilled our criteria (16.3%). The average age of the DI-PET patients was similar to typical PETs (54 years vs 56 years). These tumors were smaller and more often insulin positive than typical PETs (p <0.05). Diffuse stromal fibrosis was more frequent in DI-PETs (11 of 15 73.3.7%) compared with PETs (8 of 72
