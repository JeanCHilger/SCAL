Malignant melanoma and (18)F-FDG-PET: Should the whole body scan include the legs? (18)F-FDG-PET (FDG-PET) is established in staging and follow-up of malignant melanoma. The legs are affected in 10-40% at time of diagnosis even if the primary is at the arms and torso. Imaging including the legs may detect distant manifestations but increases duration of the scan by approximately 30 min. We intended to disclose the diagnostic benefit of scanning the legs and to evaluate the therapeutic benefit resulting.In this retrospective analyse 213 consecutive PET studies of 153 patients with suspected or recent malignant melanoma were re-evaluated for metastatic spread by a blinded investigator. Histopathological follow-up was assessed for confirmation.Suspicious findings at the legs were depicted in 53 patients on 76 occasions. 38/53 showed pathologic uptake in the torso as well. In 15/53 patients it was restricted to the legs. One of them had a hitherto unknown, clinically relevant finding that was not apparent in palpation and inspection. In 6 other patients with primary location at the legs a validation of the positive PET findings was not possible up to now.Metastases and local recurrence of malignant melanoma at the legs were found in 41% of women and 27% of men. However, a long scan does not yield relevant additional data. We found isolated new manifestations at the legs in only 1/153 patients. We recommend performing a long scan only in patients with previous melanoma manifestations restricted to the legs. In all other cases a short scan of the torso and proximal thighs is sufficient. This allows a higher number of PET-scans without loss of diagnostic power and a shorter examination time.
