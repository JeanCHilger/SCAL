High non-specific binding of the beta(1) -selective radioligand 2-(125)I-ICI-H. As results of cardiac biopsies suggest, myocardial beta(1) -adrenoceptor density is reduced in patients with chronic heart failure. However, changes in cardiac beta(2)-adrenoceptors vary. With suitable radiopharmaceuticals single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) offer the opportunity to assess beta-adrenoceptors non-invasively. Among the novel racemic analogues of the established beta(1)-selective adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 89.406 the iodinated 2-I-ICI-H showed high affinity and selectivity to beta(1)-adrenoceptors in murine ventricular membranes. The aim of this study was its evaluation as a putative sub-type selective beta(1)-adrenergic radioligand in cardiac imaging.Competition studies in vitro and in vivo were used to investigate the kinetics of 2-I-ICI-H binding to cardiac beta-adrenoceptors in mice and rats. In addition, the radiosynthesis of 2-(125)I-ICI-H from the silylated precursor 2-SiMe(3)-ICI-H was established. The specific activity was 80 GBq/ micro mol, the radiochemical yield ranged from 70 to 80%.The unlabelled compound 2-I-ICI-H showed high beta(1)-selectivity and -affinity in the in vitro competition studies. In vivo biodistribution studies apparently showed low affinity to cardiac beta-adrenoceptors. The radiolabelled counterpart 2-(125)I-ICI-H showed a high degree of non-specific binding in vitro and no specific binding to cardiac beta(1)-adrenoceptors in vivo.Because of its high non-specific binding 2-(125)I-ICI-H is no suitable radiotracer for imaging in vivo.
