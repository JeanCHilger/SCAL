Changes in regional cerebral blood flow distribution during postexercise hypotension in humans. This investigation compared patterns of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during exercise recovery both with and without postexercise hypotension (PEH). Eight subjects were studied on 3 days with randomly assigned conditions: 1) after 30 min of rest 2) after 30 min of moderate exercise (M-Ex) at 60-70% heart rate (HR) reserve during PEH
