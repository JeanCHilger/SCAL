Blood oxygen level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging in patients with stress-induced angina. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MRI reflects tissue oxygenation and may be useful for the detection of myocardial ischemia in patients with suspected coronary artery disease.We studied 25 patients with stress-induced angina using a T2*-sensitive echo planar imaging sequence before and during adenosine in a single-slice approach. BOLD-MRI results were compared with quantitative angiography and adenosine thallium single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Although image quality was variable because of artifacts, no data were excluded from the analysis. During adenosine, a mean signal intensity decrease was observed for myocardial segments related to coronary stenoses >75%. On average, a nonsignificant increase was observed in the other segments. The angiographically determined stenosis was correlated with BOLD-MRI results. Including all segments and using BOLD-MRI signal intensity increase cutoff value of 1.2%, BOLD-MRI had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 47% to correctly classify severe stenoses. Adenosine thallium SPECT data from distal segments of the same coronary territory were also correlated with BOLD-MRI. However, variability was substantial.In patients with stress-induced angina, adenosine BOLD-MRI detects myocardial ischemia in myocardial segments related to severe coronary stenoses. Its potential will increase with additional improvement of spatial coverage and image quality.
