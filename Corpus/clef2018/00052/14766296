Cloning, high-level expression, single-step purification, and binding activity of His6-tagged recombinant type B botulinum neurotoxin heavy chain transmembrane and binding domain. Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are highly potent toxins that inhibit neurotransmitter release from peripheral cholinergic synapses and associate with infant botulism. BoNT is a approximately 150kDa protein, consisting of a binding/translocating heavy chain (HC 100kDa) and a toxifying light chain (LC
