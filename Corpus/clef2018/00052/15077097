Clinical outcome of percutaneous coronary intervention with antecedent mutant t-PA administration for acute myocardial infarction. We investigated the acute-phrase and chronic-phase outcomes of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with or without antecedent mutant tissue-type plasminogen (t-PA) administration.Thirty-nine patients with a first AMI within 6 hours of onset were randomly assigned to the treatment group (1,600,000 IU IV monteplase, n = 19) or the nontreatment group (n = 20), followed by PCI. Clinical outcomes were then evaluated.Patient characteristics did not differ between the 2 groups. A significantly higher number of patients in the monteplase group achieved Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction trial (TIMI) grade 2 flow or more at the first angiography (84.2% vs 40.0% P <.005), reduced number of devices (1.44 vs 1.80 devices, P <.05), and reduced procedure times (59.7 vs 86.7 minutesOur results suggest that PCI with antecedent mutant t-PA for AMI not only accelerates reperfusion, thereby facilitating PCI, but also attenuates restenosis in the chronic phase.
