Inferior frontal region hypoperfusion in Parkinson disease with dementia. Dementia is more frequent in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) then in general population. The mechanism for mental deterioration in PD remains controversial. The aim of our study was comparison of the regional cerebral perfusion quantified by single photon emission computed tomography in patients suffering from idiopathic Parkinson's disease with and without dementia.We examined 49 PD patients: 22 PD patients with dementia and 27 PD patients without dementia. Dementia was recognized according to ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria. Cognitive functions were executed by means of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and neuropsychological assessment. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Modified Hoehn & Yahr Scale was used to quantify the severity of PD. SPECT was performed with Siemens Diacam single--head rotating gamma camera after intravenous application of technetium 99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO). The perfusion values were expressed as cortical or basal ganglia regions of interest (ROIs)/cerebellum activity ratios.In both examined group of patients the lowest uptake was in basal ganglia region, while the highest uptake was in occipital region. In the subgroup of PD patients with dementia significant hypoperfusion affecting the inferior frontal cortices was observed.In Parkinson's disease with dementia hypoperfusion in inferior frontal region can be found.
