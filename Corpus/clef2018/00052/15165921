Effect of pravastatin on myocardial perfusion after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. We studied the effect of pravastatin on coronary perfusion after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. An exercise test performed within 2 weeks after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty induced reversible perfusion defects in 66% of patients taking pravastatin and 64% of those taking placebo. At follow-up, the exercise test still induced reversible perfusion defects in 3% of patients taking pravastatin and 29% of those taking placebo.
