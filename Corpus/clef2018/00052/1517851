Fast maximum-likelihood reconstruction. A significant problem in application of maximum-likelihood reconstruction to SPECT and PET studies is the very long computation time required for this iterative algorithm. An approach is presented in which the basic calculations involved in projection and backprojection are performed only once and stored in computer memory, thus significantly reducing the computation time.
