Flumazenil positron emission tomography and other ligands for functional imaging. Most PET receptor studies in idiopathic generalized epilepsy conducted to date include only small numbers of patients and should be interpreted with caution. Differences between earlier and later studies can largely be explained by different inclusion criteria and improving methodology. The finding of some increase of GABAA receptor binding in IGE has a potential pathologic basis in microdysgenesis. Future studies aiming to elucidate the pathophysiology of IGEs may benefit from the use of subtype-specific opioid ligands, available now, and GABAB ligands, if and when they become available.
