Clinical research and surgical treatment of posttraumatic epilepsy. In order to investigate the susceptible factors of posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE) and the surgical treatment, the relative factors of 18 cases of intractable PTE and 35 cases of non-PTE patients with posttraumatic seizures (PTS) and the surgical treatment of PTE patients were studied retrospectively. The results showed that there was significant difference in the degree of unconsciousness after head injury, incidence of intracerebral hematoma and acute subdural hematoma between PTE group and non-PTE group. Of the 18 cases of PTE undergoing surgical treatment, the effectiveness of 11 cases was satisfactory and that of the remaining 7 was not. Between the two groups, there was difference in the localization of interictal epileptic discharge (IED) and ictal discharge (ID) as demonstrated by preoperative EEG. It was concluded that PTE was associated with the severity of head injury and intracranial hematoma. The localization of epileptogenic loci by preoperative EEG presumably contributed to the PTE surgical effects.
