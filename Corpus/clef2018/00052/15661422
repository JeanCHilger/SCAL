Application of targeted radiotherapy/gene therapy to bladder cancer cell lines. A targeted radiotherapy/gene therapy strategy for transitional cell carcinoma of bladder is described, using [131I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine ([131I]MIBG), a radionuclide combined with a tumour-seeking drug. The aim is to decrease side effects from radiation toxicity, while increasing radiation dose to tumour. This tumour cell kill approach is augmented by radiological bystander effects.The bladder cancer cell line EJ138 was transfected with a gene encoding the noradrenaline transporter (NAT) under the control of tumour-specific telomerase promoters. Resulting uptake of [131I]MIBG was assessed by gamma-counting of cell lysates, and NAT transgene expression by real-time RT-PCR. Cell kill of monolayers and disaggregated spheroids, dosed with [131I]MIBG, was assessed by clonogenic assay.NAT gene transfected cells exhibited a significantly increased active uptake of [131I]MIBG, leading to dose-dependent cell kill. Clonogenic assay of disaggregated spheroids, a three-dimensional model, suggested cell kill via bystander effects.Expression of a functional NAT after in vitro transfection of bladder cancer cells with the NAT gene under the control of telomerase promoters leads to active uptake of [131I]MIBG and dose-dependent cell kill. This strategy could produce a promising new treatment option for bladder cancer.
