Changes in regional cerebral blood flow during brain maturation in children and adolescents. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was studied by SPECT using 133Xe in 42 children, aged 2 days to 19 years, considered as neurologically normal. rCBF was measured on cortical regions and on the cerebellum and thalamus. Curves for reference values and standard deviation were defined for each region. At birth, cortical rCBFs were lower than those for adults after birth they increased until 5 or 6 yr of age to values 50%-85% higher than those for adults and thereafter decreased, reaching adult levels between 15 and 19 yr. Neonatal values of rCBF on cerebellum and thalamus were slightly higher than adult level, but not significantly
