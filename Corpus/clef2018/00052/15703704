Cerebrovascular effects of sodium nitroprusside in the anaesthetized baboon: a positron emission tomographic study. The effects of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a potent hypotensive agent, on cerebral blood flow (CBF) have been extensively studied in clinical and experimental situations but the results remain controversial. Whereas its properties would predict a dilatation of cerebral blood vessels, most studies report either no change or a decrease in CBF. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of SNP on CBF, cerebral blood volume (CBV), and cerebral oxygen metabolism (CMRO2), by means of positron emission tomography in the anaesthetized baboon. Measurements were performed during normotension (mean arterial pressure (MABP): 97+/-16 mm Hg) and repeated following SNP-induced hypotension (MABP: 44+/-9 mm Hg). Sodium nitroprusside led to an increase in CBF and CBV (+30% and +37%, respectively, P<0.05), whereas no change in CMRO2 was noted. Linear regression analysis of CBF values as a function of MABP confirmed that CBF increases when MABP is reduced by SNP. The comparison between these cerebrovascular changes and those found during trimetaphan-induced hypotension in our previously published studies further argues for a direct dilatatory effect of SNP on cerebral blood vessels.
