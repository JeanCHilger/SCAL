Pattern of glucose hypometabolism in frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) often coexists with motor neuron disease (MND). To characterize glucose hypometabolism in patients with FTD with MND (FTD/MND), the authors compared the glucose metabolism of 8 patients with FTD/MND with that of 29 patients with FTD. All of the patients with FTD/MND showed glucose hypometabolism only in the frontal area, whereas most patients with FTD had hypometabolism in the frontal and temporal areas. FTD/MND also showed a more symmetric pattern of glucose hypometabolism than FTD.
