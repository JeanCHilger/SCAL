Fluvastatin prevents renal injury and expression of lactin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 in rabbits with hypercholesterolemia. Lipid abnormalities are often complicated by renal dysfunction. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are the first-line choice for lowering cholesterol levels. The present study was designed to investigate whether statins could prevent and invert the development of renal injury in cholesterol-fed rabbits and to find the possible mechanism of their effects by detecting gene and protein expression of lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) in the renal artery.Twenty-four male New Zealand white rabbits were divided into three groups: (1) control group, regular granules chow (2) HC-diet group, granules chow with 1% cholesterol and 5% lard oilHigh cholesterol diet induced hypercholesterolemia (HC) complicated by renal dysfunction with increased levels of serum lipid and Cr, decreased GFR and delayed excretion and extensively thickened renal arterial intima in the HC-diet group. Rabbits in the control group showed a minimal LOX-1 expression (mRNA and protein) in the endothelium and neointima of the renal artery. Intimal proliferation of the renal artery in the HC-diet group was associated with a marked increase of LOX-1 expression (protein and mRNA). Treatment with fluvastatin improved renal function, attenuated intimal proliferation of the renal artery and markedly decreased the enhanced LOX-1 expression in the endothelium and neointima of the renal artery in rabbits.Fluvastatin treatment could prevent the development of renal injury in patients with HC and early atherosclerosis (AS). This beneficial effect might be mediated by its pleiotropic effects including a decrease in total cholesterol exposure level and prevention of LOX-1 expression in atherosclerotic arteries.
