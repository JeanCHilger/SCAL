Initial experience in use of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography in thyroid carcinoma patients with elevated serum thyroglobulin but negative iodine-131 whole body scans. This study aims to examine the usefulness of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in thyroid carcinoma patients with elevated serum thyroglobulin (Tg) but negative iodine-131 (I-131) whole body scans.17 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma who underwent FDG PET/CT scans were reviewed retrospectively over a period of one year from July 2003 to June 2004. All these patients had completion thyroidectomy and subsequently presented with elevated serum Tg but negative post-therapy I-131 whole body scans. Nine of these patients underwent FDG PET/CT in a hypothyroid state, while the remainder underwent FDG PET/CT while on thyroxine replacement.15 out of 17 PET/CT scans revealed lesions consistent with metastases, giving a sensitivity of 88.2 percent. Four of these patients were amendable to surgical treatment. Two scans were negative.FDG PET/CT is a sensitive diagnostic tool to detect radioiodine-negative recurrences/metastases in patients with thyroid carcinoma. Our preliminary results are comparable with published results based on PET.
