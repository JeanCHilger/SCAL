Chronic malignant catarrhal fever: a case in a sika deer (Cervus nippon). A condition resembling chronic malignant catarrhal fever was seen in a 9-month-old pet sika hind (Cervus nippon). From an initial acute depression, pyrexia, and anorexia, the condition progressed to include hypopyon, keratitis, lethargy, loss of condition, sloughing of one hoof and eventually death after seven weeks. There were multiple, 5 to 8mm diameter dark-red nodules throughout the mesenteries and mediastinum, along abdominal organ ligaments, and about the uterus and kidneys. Histopathology showed the nodules to be organising vascular thrombi. Concurrent perivascular mononuclear infiltrations and intravascular thrombi in many tissues confirmed that the condition was malignant catarrhal fever.
