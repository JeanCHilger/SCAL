Prognostic significance of blood brain barrier permeability in acute hemorrhagic stroke. Blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption is accompanied by edema in the surrounding areas of the intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The aim of the study was to clarify the correlation between BBB breakdown and outcome in ICH.Twenty-seven patients with primary ICH were included in the study. Each patient underwent CT and DTPA-SPECT, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and modified Rankin score were performed as well.DTPA-SPECT had a significant correlation with the modified Rankin score after 3 months (p = 0.008) and 6 months (p = 0.01). The CT scan was directly correlated with the NIH score on days 1, 7 and 30 (p = 0.01, p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively). No correlation was found between DTPA-SPECT and CT scan data.The degree of BBB breakdown, as imaged by the DTPA-SPECT technique, was directly correlated with the late functional outcome. The CT scan has an inverse correlation with the NIH score. These findings may have broad clinical implications.
