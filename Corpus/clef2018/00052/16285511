The expression of recombinant protein of human interleukin-24 and its anti-tumor mechanism. The hIL24 cDNA sequence was cloned into prokaryotic high expressive vector pET-21a(+) and recombinant hIL24 was expressed in E. coli with IPTG induction. The purified recombinant hIL24 exhibits following functions in HeLa cell: inhibiting cell growth, inducing apoptosis, inducing PMBC to secrete IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-r and inhibiting blood vessel formation. Our preliminary results suggest that the apoptosis induced by rhIL24 is through down-regulating expression of anti-apoptosis factor Bcl-2 and activation of mitochondria apoptosis pathway.
