Echocardiographic assessment of interventricular septal defect corrected during the first year of life. To evaluate the medium term results of surgical closure of ventricular septal defect (VSD) performed during the first year of life, using echocardiography (echo).We studied prospectively 29 patients aged from 17 to 68 months (mean = 37) who underwent surgical closure of perimembranous VSD during the first year of life. The postoperative follow-up time ranged from 6 to 60 months (mean = 26). Fifteen age-matched normal children were used as a control group in evaluating the left ventricular (LV) systolic function. The echo study included: 1) the assessment of LV systolic function using the shortening fraction, ejection fraction, pre-ejection to ejection time ratio (PET/ET), aortic flow acceleration time, acceleration to ejection time ratio, mean aortic flow acceleration 2) detection and quantification of residual VSD as well as tricuspid and or aortic regurgitationThe LV systolic function parameters from patients versus (vs) normals showed a significantly different shortening fraction (34 +/- 5 vs 39 +/- 4 p = 0.005) and PET/ET ratio (0.34 +/- 0.04 vs 0.31 +/- 0.03Our study shows that surgical closure of perimembranous VSD performed during the first year of life was possible without significant mobility. Furthermore, the echo allowed a complete and noninvasive cardiac evaluation of the anatomic, functional and hemodynamic status of this group of patients, thus limiting the need for postoperative control cardiac catheterization.
