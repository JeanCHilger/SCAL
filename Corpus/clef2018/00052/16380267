Expression, purification, and characterization of His-tagged Staphylococcus xylosus lipase wild-type and its mutant Asp 290 Ala. The gene encoding the extracellular lipase of Staphylococcus xylosus (SXL) was cloned using PCR technique. The sequence corresponding to the mature lipase was subcloned in the pET-14b expression vector, with a strong T7 promoter, to construct a recombinant lipase protein containing six histidine residues at the N-terminal. High level expression of the lipase by Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells harbouring the lipase gene containing expression vector was observed upon induction with 0.4 mM IPTG at 37 degrees C. One-step purification of the recombinant lipase was achieved with Ni-NTA resin. The specific activity of the purified His-tagged SXL was 1500 or 850 U/mg using tributyrin or olive oil emulsion as substrate, respectively. It has been proposed that the region near the residue Asp290 could be involved in the selection of the substrate. Therefore, we also mutated the residue Asp 290 by Ala using site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant SXL-D290A was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified with the same nickel metal affinity column. The specific activity of the purified His-tagged SXL-D290A mutant was 1000 U/mg using either tributyrin or olive oil emulsion as substrate. A comparative study of the wild type (His(6)-SXL) and the mutant (His(6)-SXL-D290A) proteins was carried out. Our results confirmed that Asp290 is important for the chain length specificity and catalytic efficiency of the enzyme.
