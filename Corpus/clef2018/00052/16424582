Comparison of region-of-interest analysis and human observers in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease using [99mTc]TRODAT-1 and SPECT. This study determined the relative accuracy of diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) using SPECT imaging data, comparing a semi-quantitative region-of-interest (ROI) approach and human observers. A set of patients with PD and normal healthy control subjects were studied using the dopamine transporter tracer [(99m)Tc]TRODAT-1 and SPECT. The sample comprised 81 patients (mean age +/- SD, 63.4 +/- 10.4 years age range, 39.0-84.2 years) and 94 healthy controls (mean age +/- SD, 61.8 +/- 11.0 years
