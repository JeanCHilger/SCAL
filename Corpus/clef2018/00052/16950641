Use of PET for evaluation of treatment response in oncology. 18FDG -PET is now usually included in the treatment strategy, for the staging or the diagnosis of recurrence. In lymphoma, PET is well documented for evaluation of tumour response. For solid tumours, despite good published results, the accuracy of PET has to be confirmed by large series of patients. A good interpretation of PET needs a SUV analysis. New radiotraceurs of the nuclear synthesis could certainly improve the accuracy of response evaluation by PET.
