Less activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in response to a meal: a feature of obesity. In an exploratory positron emission tomography study of postprandial regional cerebral blood flow, which is a marker of neuronal activity, obese men differed from lean men in several brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex. The subjects received a meal proportional to their body size therefore, the meal volume was different for each person.We investigated whether differences in the brain responses of obese and lean men to a meal represent satiety or feelings of gastric distension.We studied 9 lean (x +/- SD body fat: 15 +/- 5% age: 33 +/- 10 y) and 9 obese (body fat: 31 +/- 4%Compared with lean men, obese men had consistently less postprandial activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, irrespective of meal size.Because the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the inhibition of inappropriate behavior, satiety, and meal termination, differential responses of neuronal activity to food intake in this area may contribute to a propensity for obesity or to the difficulty in losing weight experienced by obese men.
