The ECG measurement in the bathtub using the insulated electrodes. The ECG recording in the bathtub was studied using insulated electrode. Prior studies of the ECG recording in the bathtub used conductive electrodes having some problems such as the possibility of the electric shock and sensitivity to contamination of the electrode surfaces. The insulated electrodes were made of copper plate coated with PET film. The electrodes were attached on bathtub at both sides of the chest. High-input-impedance amplifier was designed to amplify ECG signal sensed by insulated electrodes of high impedance. The recorded signals in this study were noisier than those recorded with conventional conductive electrodes. But the R peaks in the recorded signals were large enough to be auto-detected. Further study will improve SNR by reducing of power line noise and common-mode noise.
