PET study of effects of combination of different points on glucose metabolism in the patient of cerebral infarction. To observe effects of combination of different points on glucose metabolism in the patient of cerebral infarction.Neiguan (PC 6), Shuigou (GV 26), Fengchi (GB 20), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Yinlingquan (SP 9), Taichong (LR 3) were selected for the Xingnao Kaiqiao group (n =7), and Hegu (LI 4), Quchi (LI 11), Zusanli (ST 36), Yanglingquan (GB 34) and Xuanzhong (GB 39) for the routine acupuncture group (n = 5). PET-CT was used to observe the local cerebral glucose metabolism.The cerebral regions activated in the the Xingnao Kaiqiao group included infarction center, gyrus temporalis superior, thalamus, gyrus temporalis inferior, gyrus rectus, insula, lateral occipital lobe, parietal lobe and cerebellum, and in the routine acupuncture group included gyrus frontalis inferior, caudate nucleus, cingulated gyrus, hippocampus, precuneus and parietal lobe.PET is very suitable for exploring acupuncture mechanisms in treatment of cerebral infarction, and further shows the specificity of acupoints-brain functional region.
