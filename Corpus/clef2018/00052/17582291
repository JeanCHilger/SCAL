Diagnostic value of 99mTc-N-NOET myocardial perfusion imaging during exercise for coronary artery disease. To assess the value of (99m)Tc-N-NOET ((99m)Tc-N-ethoxy-N-ethyl dithiocarbamato-nitrito) myocardial perfusion SPECT for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.A total of 42 patients [mean age (54 +/- 9) years, 35 men] with suspected chest pain were included in this study. 740 MBq of (99m)Tc-N-NOET was injected intravenously during bicycle exercise when the heart rate attained reached more than 85% of the expected maximum, or in cases of angina pectoris, severe arrhythmias and ischemic ST segment changes. (99m)Tc-N-NOET 740 MBq, SPECT myocardial imaging acquisitions were obtained at 15 minutes and 2 hours after (99m)Tc-N-NOET injection. Coronary angiography was performed in all patients.Coronary artery stenosis was detected in 26 patients and normal coronary angiography was shown in 16 patients. (99m)Tc-N-NOET myocardial perfusion imaging was abnormal in twenty-one patients out of the 26 patients with significant coronary artery stenosis (sensitivity, 81%) 14 out of 16 patients with normal angiography had a normal myocardial perfusion imaging (specificity, 88%). The positive predictive value, negative predictive value and predictive accuracy of (99m)Tc-N-NOET myocardial perfusion imaging for detection of CAD was 91%, 74% and 83%, respectively. The sensitivity of the imaging for detecting single vessel, double vessels and triple vessels disease were 60% (6/10), 86% (6/7) and 100% (9/9), respectively. There was mild (99m)Tc-N-NOET lung uptake in patients with coronary artery stenosis 15 minutes post (99m)Tc-N-NOET injection.SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging with (99m)Tc-N-NOET supplied an important diagnostic tool for detecting coronary artery disease. Lung uptake with stress (99m)Tc-N-NOET might be related to coronary artery disease.
