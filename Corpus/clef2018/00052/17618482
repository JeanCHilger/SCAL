Characterization of polyelectrolyte multilayer films on polyethylene terephtalate vascular prostheses under mechanical stretching. Layer-by-layer (LBL) polyelectrolyte films offer extensive potentials to enhance surface properties of vascular biomaterials. From the time of implantation, PET prostheses are continuously subjected to multiple mechanical stresses such as important distorsions and blood pressure. In this study, three LBL films, namely (1) poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride), (2) poly(L-lysine)/hyaluronan, and (3) poly(L-lysine)/poly(L-glutamic acid) were built on to isolated PET filaments, thread, and vascular prostheses. The three LBL films uniformly covered the surface of the PET samples with rough, totally smooth, and "wrinkled" appearances respectively for (PAH/PSS)(24), (PLL/HA)(24), and (PLL/PGA)(24) systems. We then assessed the behavior of these LBL films, in an aqueous environment [by environmental scanning electronic microscopy (ESEM)], when subjected to unidirectional longitudinal stretches. We found that stretching induces ruptures in the multilayer films on isolated filaments for longitudinal stretches of 14% for (PSS/PAH)(24), 13% for (PLL/PGA)(24), and 30% for (PLL/HA)(24) films. On threads, the rupture limit is enhanced to be respectively 26, 20, and 28%. Most interestingly, we found that on vascular prosthesis no rupture is visible in any of the three multilayers types, even for elongations of 200% (200% undergone by the PET prostheses is representative of those encountered during graft deployment) which by far exceeds elongations observed under physiological conditions (10-20%, blood pressure). In term of mechanical behaviors, these preliminary data constitute a first step toward the possible use of LBL film to coat and functionalize vascular prosthesis.
