An efficient analytical calculation of probability matrix in 2D SPECT. Expectation Maximization iterative reconstruction algorithms are being widely used in PET and SPECT imaging. The system probability matrix is usually calculated by using Monte Carlo simulations, since the analytical calculation is a rather complicated problem, especially in 3D reconstruction however, realistic Monte Carlo simulations in 3D are time consuming and simplifications are necessary. In this paper, the probability matrix in the case of 2D SPECT is analytically calculated, using only two basic parameters: (i) the total number of image pixels and (ii) the number of projection angles. In the more general phase three more parameters will be taken into account: (i) the distance between the detectors and the object to be imaged
