The role of imaging in United States courtrooms. The rapid evolution of brain imaging techniques has increasingly offered more detailed diagnostic and prognostic information about neurologic and psychiatric disorders and the structural and functional brain changes that may influence behavior. Coupled with these developments is the increasing use of neuroimages in courtrooms, where they are used as evidence in criminal cases to challenge a defendant's competency or culpability and in civil cases to establish physical injury or toxic exposure. Several controversies exist, including the admissibility of neuroimages in legal proceedings, the reliability of expert testimony, and the appropriateness of drawing conclusions in individual cases based on the findings of research uses of imaging technology. This article reviews and discusses the current state of these issues.
