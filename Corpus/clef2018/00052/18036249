Tissue is the issue-sarcoidosis following ABVD chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma: a case report.  Thirty two year old Caucasian female presented 2 months post partum with fevers, cough and shortness of breath. CT scan of the chest to rule out pulmonary embolism revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of the nodes revealed classic Hodgkin's lymphoma and she received ABVD chemotherapy. She was in remission as confirmed by a PET/CT scan. Five months later she had another PET/CT scan which showed areas of hypermetabolism indicating a possible relapse. Biopsy revealed sarcoidosis. She received steroids and 18 months later remained in clinical remission. This rare case of sarcoid following classic Hodgkin's lymphoma illustrates that clinical presentation, physical exam, lab investigations and even PET/CT scans may not be able to discriminate between Hodgkin's lymphoma and sarcoidosis. Tissue biopsy and pathological diagnosis remain the gold standard.
