New surgical technologies in oncology. Despite new efficient methods of pharmaco- and radiotherapy, surgery is still applied to most patients with malignant tumors as the main treatment. Rational definition of indications to a surgical intervention based upon precise morphological verification of the diagnosis and correct staging is half a battle of surgical success. When planning the time and volume of surgery, its aim (whether it is radical, palliative, or reconstructive intervention) should be understood very clearly. The ideology of oncosurgery has changed to a great extent. On the one hand, wide clinical application of contemporary imaging techniques (CT, MRI, and PET) has resulted in more frequent detection of non-advanced tumors. Another aspect of present-day big oncosurgery is the application of advanced surgical techniques as well as the development of broad resection techniques and methods of en bloc removal of locally advanced tumors from different locations. By examples of thoracoabdominal tumors (neoblastomas of the bronchi, mediastinum, stomach, and kidney) and bone tumors the author considers the main aspects of modern operative strategy in oncology.
