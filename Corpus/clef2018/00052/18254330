The study of 99mTc-N(NOEt)2 imaging in experimental nasopharyngeal carcinoma mice models. To evaluate the validity of 99mTc-N(NOEt)2 imaging in nasopharyngeal carcinoma mice model compared with 99mTc-MIBI imaging.Biodistribution of 99mTc-N(NOEt)2 were performed on Kunmin mice. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma BALb/c nude mice models were replicated by subcutaneous injection of CNE cells. After intravenous injection of 99mTc-N(NOEt)2 or 99mTc-MIBI images were acquired with SPECT, regions of interesting (ROI) were drawn to evaluate the uptake of 99mTc-N(NOEt)2 or 99mTc-MIBI in tumor imaging. Tumor to non-tumor ratios (T/N) were used as index of evaluation.Biodistribution study indicated most of 99mTc-N(NOEt)2 was accumulated in liver, kidney, lung and heart. The T/N values had no significant difference between 99mTc-N(NOEt)2 and 99mTc-MIBI at 30 min post injection. The peak T/N value of 99mTc-N(NOEt)2 reached at 120 min post injection. The best time for imaging was 120 min post injection. The T/N ratio was significantly higher in the group of 99mTc-N(NOEt)2 than that of 99mTc-MIBI at 120 min.99mTc-N(NOEt)2 can be used for nasopharyngeal carcinoma mice model imaging. The best time of imaging is 120 min. 99mTc-N(NOEt)2 is a potential imaging agent for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
