Diagnostic value of multislices computed tomography and magnetic resonance in deeply seated tumors of pharynx, neck and larynx. Ultrasound, CT, MR examinations are complementary in preoperative and post-treatment follow up diagnosis in neck region pathology as well as conventional angiography in vascular tumors. The paper presents retrospectively analized CT and MR examinations of 100 patients treated in ORE Department of Military Medical Institute. The limitations and value of CT and MR methods were taken into the consideration. The high value of spiral multislice CT method should be pointed in pathology of larynx due to possibility of precise evaluation of soft tissues with nodular changes and cervical vascular system, expansion into the cartilage structures and functional examination performed during fonation. MR method is more sensitive than CT in localization of neoplastic infiltration among soft tissues structures, so the method is highly essential in estimation of post-surgical cases as well as fusion of nuclear medicine and CT or MR finding or PET.
