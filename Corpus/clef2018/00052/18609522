Aneurysmorrhaphy is an easy technique for arteriovenous fistula salvage. The life-saving procedures for patients in chronic renal failure (CRF) are hemodialysis (HD) or successful kidney transplantation. HD requires a properly placed and functioning vascular access, most often obtained by creating an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). The long-term patency of AVFs is limited, in addition to other factors, by the development of intimal hyperplasia and the process results in venous wall thickening and progressive fistula occlusion. Another problem is limited patency, due to the development of pseudoaneurysm, which is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, infection and bleeding, difficult cannulation for dialysis, pain and cosmetic defects. Treatment is focused on rapidly progressing pseudoaneurysms, which can predispose to rupture, technical problems during cannulation because of pseudoaneurysm size or a growing intraluminal thrombus. Most of these patients are scheduled for pseudoaneurysm removal and new fistula construction or, occasionally, an endovascular procedure involving stent graft implantation. This paper describes a simple and inexpensive technique of managing an AVF pseudoaneurysm, i.e. aneurysmorrhaphy. To offset the weakening of the venous wall by suture following aneurysmorrhaphy, an external polyethylene terephthalate (PET) prosthesis was implanted in the vein to prevent the development of intimal hyperplasia in the de novo created AVF.
