Molecular imaging-guided gene therapy of gliomas. Gene therapy of patients with glioblastoma using viral and non-viral vectors, which are applied by direct injection or convection-enhanced delivery (CED), appear to be satisfactorily safe. Up to date, only single patients show a significant therapeutic benefit as deduced from single long-term survivors. Non-invasive imaging by PET for the identification of viable target tissue and for assessment of transduction efficiency shall help to identify patients which might benefit from gene therapy, while non-invasive follow-up on treatment responses allows early and dynamic adaptations of treatment options. Therefore, molecular imaging has a critical impact on the development of standardised gene therapy protocols and on efficient and safe vector applications in humans.
