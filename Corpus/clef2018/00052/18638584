Effectiveness of anemia and chronic kidney disease as predictors for presence and severity of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing stress myocardial perfusion study. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and anemia portend a higher risk of cardiac events and mortality. We sought to ascertain whether coronary artery disease (CAD) by myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography is more common in patients with CKD (glomerular filtration rate < or =60 ml/min/1.73 kg/m(2)) and/or anemia (hemoglobin level < or =13 g/L) and the impact of different degrees of CKD. One thousand five hundred eighty patients (mean age 65 +/- 10 years) underwent gated myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography and clinical evaluation. Patients were divided into 4 groups (group 1, no anemia/no CKD, n = 800 group 2, anemia/no CKD, n = 195
