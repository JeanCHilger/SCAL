A fully automated one-pot synthesis of [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635 for clinical PET applications. A fully automated synthesis of the important 5HT(1A) receptor radioligand, [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635 (I), was developed based on the optimized one-pot "wet" synthesis procedure. A modern automated apparatus was constructed from commercially available components and operated via LabView software. In average, (906+/-525)MBq (n=94) of (I) was obtained from 40 min bombardment at 50 microA beam current within 50 min synthesis time. The specific radioactivity (SA) at the time of injection was (50.5+/-29.3)GBq/mumol (n=94).
