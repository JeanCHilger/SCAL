Simple quantification of myocardial perfusion by pixel-by-pixel graphical analysis using carbon-11 acetate: comparison of the K-complexes of carbon-11 acetate and nitrogen-13 ammonia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the measurement of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and develop a method for producing parametric perfusion images with carbon-11 (11C-)acetate by a simple graphical analysis method.A total of 14 patients underwent dynamic PET acquisition using nitrogen-13 (13N-)ammonia and 11C-acetate at rest to measure the influx rate constants of the tracers (K*amm and K*ace, respectively). Using the early phase of dynamic data (30-150 s), K*amm and K*ace were calculated pixel-by-pixel by the graphical analysis method.The patients were divided into two groups (groups A and B). The regression equation relating K*amm and K*ace was calculated with group A. K*amm and K*ace were linearly correlated (r2=0.718, P<0.001). The regression equation was K*ace=0.736.K*amm+0.086. By using this equation, K*ace was converted into MBFace. To validate this equation, MBFace and MBF measured with 13N-ammonia (MBFamm) in group B were compared. MBFamm and MBFace exhibited a good linear correlation. The regression line was very close to the line of identity (MBFace=1.01.MBFamm +0.01, r2=0.838, P<0.001). The image quality of MBFace was generally better than that of MBFamm.Using the graphical analysis method, it is convenient and reliable to measure myocardial perfusion and develop parametric images with 11C-acetate under resting conditions.
