A head immobilization system for radiation simulation, CT, MRI, and PET imaging. An aquaplast mask/marker immobilization system for the routine radiation therapy treatment of head and neck disease is described. The system utilizes a commercially available thermoplastic mesh indexed and mounted to a rigid frame attached to the therapy couch. The apparatus is designed to permit CT, MRI, and PET diagnostic scans of the patient to be performed in the simulation and treatment position utilizing the same mask, thereby facilitating image correlation. Studies employing weekly simulation indicate that patient treatment position movement can be restricted to 3 mm over the course of treatment. This easily constructed system permits rapid mask formation to be performed on the treatment simulator, resulting in an immobilization device comparable to masks produced with vacuum-forming techniques. Details of construction, verification, and central axis CT, MRI, PET markers are offered.
