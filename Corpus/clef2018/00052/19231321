Usefulness of abnormal heart rate recovery on exercise stress testing to predict high-risk findings on single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging in men. Abnormal heart rate recovery (HRR) after maximal exercise treadmill testing predicts adverse cardiac outcomes, although whether abnormal HRR on exercise treadmill testing should prompt further diagnostic cardiac testing is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of high-risk stress single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) findings in patients with abnormal HRR. A total of 509 men who had been referred for exercise stress MPI and were without other abnormal exercise treadmill testing findings (ischemic electrocardiographic changes or exercise treadmill testing-induced angina) were included in this study. Abnormal HRR was defined as a decrease in heart rate <or=12 beats at 1 minute after maximal exercise. Overall, 11% had abnormal HRR. Patients with abnormal HRR had significantly more mild or greater coronary heart disease (summed stress score [SSS] >or=4, 49% vs 27% p = 0.001), severe coronary heart disease (SSS >8, 36% vs 7%
