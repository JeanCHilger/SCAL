Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma. Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma is a subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which has distinct clinical and molecular features, many of which are similar to that of nodular sclerosing/classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Anthracycline-based chemotherapy forms the foundation for treatment of this lymphoma. This review will discuss controversial topics that warrant further study, such as the superiority of third generation regimens over CHOP-based regimens (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), the use of involved field radiotherapy, and the assessment of clinical response by positron emission tomography scans.
