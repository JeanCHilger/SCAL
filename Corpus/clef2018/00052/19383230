Prediction of functional outcome in stunned myocardium after myocardial infarction using BMIPP and tetrofosmin imaging. The predictive value of combined (123)iodine-labelled 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3R,S-methyl pentadecanoic acid imaging ((123)I-BMIPP) and early technetium-99m ((99m)Tc)-tetrofosmin imaging was compared with combined (123)I-BMIPP and delayed (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin or (123)I-BMIPP and thallium-201 ((201)Tl) imaging for functional outcome of stunned myocardium after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 37 patients with AMI. All patients underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention with/without stenting within 24 h of symptoms. Resting (201)Tl, (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin and (123)I-BMIPP imaging were performed within 10 days of hospital admission (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin imaging was also performed 6 months later. Segments were mismatched when the (123)I-BMIPP score was greater than the (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin or (201)Tl scores, and were matched when all scores were the same. Left ventricular function was estimated using wall motion score. Sensitivity and regional wall motion were significantly better in mismatching (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin-early/(123)I-BMIPP segments than mismatching (201)Tl/(123)I-BMIPP or (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin-delayed/(123)I-BMIPP segments. It is concluded that mismatching of (123)I-BMIPP and early (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake can predict improvement in wall motion of stunned myocardium better than the other two imaging combinations.
