Clinical cardiovascular molecular imaging. Molecular imaging holds the promise of becoming a key diagnostic modality in cardiovascular medicine by allowing visualization of specific targets and pathways that precede or underlie changes in morphology, physiology, and function. As such, molecular imaging aims at detecting precursors or early stages of cardiovascular disease and at monitoring and guiding novel, increasingly specific and versatile cardiovascular therapies. Imaging of myocardial metabolism and autonomic innervation are already used in current practice, and a wide variety of other targets and probes is on the horizon. This focused review provides an overview of the opportunities and challenges that molecular imaging faces to fulfill its promises in clinical cardiovascular medicine.
