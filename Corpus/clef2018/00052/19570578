Substitution of 11C-methionine PET by perfusion MRI during the follow-up of treated high-grade gliomas: preliminary results in clinical practice. Our aim was to compare perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) using carbon-11 labelled methionine (MET) in gliomas and their value in differentiating tumour recurrence from necrosis.We retrospectively reviewed 28 patients with a high-grade glioma. A total of 33MR perfusions and MET-PET were ultimately analysable for comparison between the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and MET-PET examinations. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility was assessed and diagnostic value of rCBV compared to MET-PET and histology was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.ROC curve analysis showed that rCBV had at least equal performances in differentiating tumour recurrence and necrosis than MET-PET. Cut-off value of rCBV for differentiating tumour from necrosis was 182% with a sensitivity of 81.5% and a specificity of 100%.In clinical practice, perfusion MRI could replace MET-PET for differentiating necrosis from tumour recurrence.
