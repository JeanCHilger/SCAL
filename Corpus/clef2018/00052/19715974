Increased 18F-FDG uptake of hepatocellular carcinoma on positron emission tomography independently predicts tumor recurrence in liver transplant patients. The aim of this retrospective trial was to analyze the value of preoperative (18)F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) to predict parameters of tumor aggressiveness among liver transplant (OLT) patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Fifty-five patients with HCC underwent (18)F-FDG-PET during evaluation for OLT. Nineteen patients demonstrated increased (18)F-FDG uptake on PET pre-OLT (PET(+)), and 36 patients revealed negative PET findings (PET(-)). PET(+) patients showed a relative risk of 9.5 and 6.4 for poor differentiation and for microvascular invasion (MVI) in the HCC at explant pathology, respectively. Of the 10 patients (18.2%) who developed HCC recurrences, 9 (90%) revealed increased (18)F-FDG uptake pre-OLT only 1 (10%) showed a PET(-) status (P < .001). Apart from poor tumor differentiation, PET(+) status was identified as an independent predictor of tumor recurrence post-OLT (odds ratio, 23.9). Our study demonstrated that (18)F-FDG uptake on PET is a reliable preoperative predictor of tumor recurrence after OLT in patients with HCC, triggered by its high association with poor tumor differentiation and MVI.
