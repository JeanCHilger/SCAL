Photophobia in essential blepharospasm--a positron emission tomographic study. To localize regional alterations in cerebral glucose metabolism in essential blepharospasm (EB) patients with photophobia. We have studied 22 EB patients by performing positron emission tomography and [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose analysis. The patients were classified into two subgroups, namely, EB with photophobia (P group) and EB without photophobia (NP group), and compared with a healthy control group (n = 44). There were no significant differences between the two patient groups with respect to the severity of motor symptoms or the duration for which the condition persisted. The FDG-PET images were analyzed using the statistical parametric mapping software. As compared to the control group, the P group exhibited significant hypermetabolism in the thalamus (P = 0.002), while the NP group exhibited significant hypometabolism in the dorsal midbrain, especially, in the superior colliculus (P = 0.005). The P group exhibited significant hypermetabolism in the thalamus and the dorsal midbrain as compared to the NP group (P < 0.001). These findings suggest that photophobia in EB patients may be associated with abnormal hyperactivity in the thalamus. Either hyperactivity of the thalamus or hypoactivity of the superior colliculus, or both may be associated with excessive blinking in these patients.
