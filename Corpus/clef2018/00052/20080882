An assessment of the impact of incorporating time-of-flight information into clinical PET/CT imaging. The introduction of fast scintillators with good stopping power for 511-keV photons has renewed interest in time-of-flight (TOF) PET. The ability to measure the difference between the arrival times of a pair of photons originating from positron annihilation improves the image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The level of improvement depends upon the extent and distribution of the positron activity and the time resolution of the PET scanner. While specific estimates can be made for phantom imaging, the impact of TOF PET is more difficult to quantify in clinical situations. The results presented here quantify the benefit of TOF in a challenging phantom experiment and then assess both qualitatively and quantitatively the impact of incorporating TOF information into the reconstruction of clinical studies. A clear correlation between patient body mass index and gain in SNR was observed in this study involving 100 oncology patient studies, with a gain due to TOF ranging from 1.1 to 1.8, which is consistent with the 590-ps time resolution of the TOF PET scanner. The visual comparison of TOF and non-TOF images performed by two nuclear medicine physicians confirmed the advantages of incorporating TOF into the reconstruction, advantages that include better definition of small lesions and image details, improved uniformity, and noise reduction.
