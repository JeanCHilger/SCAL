Early detection of Alzheimer's disease with PET imaging. Preclinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the major challenges for the prevention of AD. AD biomarkers are needed not only to reveal preclinical pathologic changes, but also to monitor progression and therapeutics. PET neuroimaging can reliably assess aspects of the molecular biology and neuropathology of AD. The aim of this article is to review the use of FDG-PET and amyloid PET imaging in the early detection of AD.
