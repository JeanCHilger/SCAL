Amyloid imaging in early detection of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid imaging has provided evidence for early detection of amyloid (Abeta) load in prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several amyloid tracers have been developed for studies with positron emission tomography (PET). Early detection of at-risk subjects will be important in the future for a successful treatment of AD. The high Abeta load in the brain measured by PET in patients with mild cognitive impairment that later will convert to AD suggests early, significant, ongoing pathological processes prior to cognitive impairment. PET Abeta imaging will also be used for discrimination of AD from other dementia disorders, as well for the evaluation of anti-Abeta drugs.
