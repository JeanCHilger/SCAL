Clinical and survival impact of FDG PET in patients with suspicion of recurrent cervical carcinoma. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the contribution of (18)F-FDG PET to the clinical management and survival outcome of patients suspected of recurrent cervical carcinoma and in line with the hypothesis that early diagnosis of recurrent cervical cancer may improve overall survival.A total of 40 patients underwent conventional imaging (CI) and FDG PET/CT for suspected cervical cancer. Clinical management decisions were recorded with CI and additional PET/CT. Discordances and concordances between CI and PET/CT results were compared to the final diagnosis as based on histopathology analysis or follow-up considered as the gold standard.The final diagnosis was established pathologically (n = 25) or by median clinical follow-up for 48 months after the PET (n = 15). The PET/CT was positive in 76% (20/26) of patients compared to 19% (6/26) with CI. Globally PET/CT modified the treatment plan in 55% (22/40) of patients and in 75% (18/24) when the CI was negative prior to PET/CT. These changes led to the use of previously unplanned therapeutic procedures in 37.5% (15/40). When FDG PET was positive for recurrence (> 3 foci), the median overall survival was 12 months (2-70) compared to patients with PET findings with < or = 1 focus for which the median survival was not attained (p = 0.007). A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors demonstrated that abnormal FDG uptake (> 3 foci) was the most significant factor (p < 0.03) for death from cervical cancer.FDG PET is a valuable tool in the case of suspected recurrence of cervical cancer on account of its impact on treatment planning and especially in predicting patient outcome.
