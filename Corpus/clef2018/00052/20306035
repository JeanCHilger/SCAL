Guidance on current good radiopharmacy practice (cGRPP) for the small-scale preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. This guidance is meant as a guidance to Part B of the EANM "Guidelines on Good Radiopharmacy Practice (GRPP)" issued by the Radiopharmacy Committee of the EANM (see www.eanm.org ), covering the small-scale "in house" preparation of radiopharmaceuticals which are not kit procedures. The aim is to provide more detailed and practice-oriented guidance to those who are involved in the small-scale preparation of, for example, PET, therapeutic or other radiopharmaceuticals which are not intended for commercial purposes or distribution.
