Scintigraphy with 123I-labelled fatty acids in coronary heart disease. Forty-two patients (6 women, 36 men mean age 55 [39-69] years), with one-, two- or three-vessel disease on coronary angiography, were studied using single-photon emission computer tomography with 15-p-123I-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid (IPPA), in order to evaluate this new method of demonstrating abnormalities of myocardial perfusion. The reference range for fatty acid turnover was determined in eleven controls (4 women, 7 men
