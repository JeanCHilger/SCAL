Importance of 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy/single photon emission computed tomography for diagnosis and differential diagnostics of Parkinson syndromes. The goal of Parkinson syndrome diagnostics is twofold: early diagnosis on the one hand, and accurate differentiation among idiopathic and atypical Parkinson syndromes on the other. (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy is the only method that can distinguish with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity between atypical Parkinson syndromes and Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies. Additional advantages are the method's widespread availability and radioactive exposure dose comparable to that for single photon emission computed tomography imaging with much lower costs. Only a single radiotracer study is necessary. (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy is an indispensable tool for purposes of differentiating among the various Parkinson syndromes.
