L-3,4-Dihydroxy-6-[ Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is associated with a loss of dopamine-containing neurons in striatum of the brain (1, 2). PD is caused by a shortage of dopamine. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter, plays an important role in the mediation of movement, cognition and emotion. Dopamine also plays a role in various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and drug abuse. Dopamine is synthesized within nerve cells (3). L-tyrosine is converted to dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and then to dopamine in a two-step process. The first, rate limiting step is catalyzed by tyrosine 3-monoxygenase (tyrosine hydroxylase or TH). The second step is catalyzed by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (L-DOPA decarboxylase, AAAD). In parts of the nervous system that release dopamine as a neurotransmitter (dopaminergic neurons), no further metabolism occurs and dopamine is stored in vesicles in the presynaptic nerve terminals by virtue of the dopamine reuptake transporter, DAT. 6-[
