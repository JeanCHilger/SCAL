ImPyβImPyβImβ- Polyamides (PAM) constructed from N-methylpyrrole (Py), N-methylimidazole (Im), 3-chlorothiophene (Ct), and N-methylhydroxypyrrole (Hp) amino acids comprise a class of synthetic oligomeric ligands that bind to the minor groove of DNA (1, 2). The aromatic heterocycles in the PAM orientate antiparallel with respect to the Watson-Crick base pair (bp), which leads to a specific recognition of DNA sequences (3). The recognition process follows a series of pairing rules i.e., an ImPy specifies for G·C, a PyPy binds both A·T and T·A, an HpPy discriminates T·A over A·T, and a CtPy prefers T·A over A·T at the N-terminus. These aromatic amino acids can be programmed to a strand with more than two residues to recognize longer DNA sequences
