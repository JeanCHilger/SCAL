 Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2, erbB2, neu) is a 185-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein and is a member of the superfamily of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-type receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (1, 2). HER2 consists of an extracellular domain with four subdomains, a single transmembrane span, a cytoplasmic juxtamembrane linker region, a tyrosine kinase component, and a carboxyl-terminal tail (2). HER2 forms homo-oligomers of itself and heteroligomers with other HER receptors to trigger a complex network of multilayered signal transduction (1), which involves more than 30 ligands and their related adaptor proteins, cascaded enzymes, second messengers, and transcription factors (3). Activation of the network regulates cell growth, cell differentiation, and cell survival. Overexpression of HER2 has been found in a variety of malignant tumors, such as breast cancers (~30% of patients), ovarian cancers, and urinary bladder cancers (4). No ligand that directly binds to HER2 has been clearly identified to date (4). Radionuclide imaging of breast cancers largely relies on radiolabeling of monoclonal antibodies directed against HER2, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab (5). These antibodies are normally large in size (molecular weight ~150 kDa) and have slow blood clearance and slow tumor penetration, which lead to low contrast in images (6). Affibody molecules are scaffold proteins that bind to targets with high affinity and specificity (7). Although Affibody molecules are able to bind to the same targets as immunoglobulins, Affibody molecules have no relation to the molecular structures or amino acid sequences of the immunoglobulin family. For example, Z
