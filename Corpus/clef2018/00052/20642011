 Bisphosphonates (BPs) or nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (NBPs) are often used for the management of pain palliation and disorders related to skeletal tissue, including those arising from cancer metastases, because these compounds have a very high affinity for hydroxyapatite (HA), a component of the bone matrix. These phosphonates or their derivatives tend to accumulate in osteoclasts located at areas of increased bone metabolism by inhibiting the enzyme farnesyl diphosphate (or pyrophosphate) synthase, an important enzyme of the cellular mevalonate pathway, which is involved in protein prenylation (1). The mechanism of action of BPs and the NBPs has been described in detail by Drake et. al. (2). Several BPs and NBPs are commercially available for clinical use to treat different bone disorders, and there are ongoing clinical trials approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to evaluate these compounds for the treatment of various bone ailments. In addition, BPs are often labeled with
