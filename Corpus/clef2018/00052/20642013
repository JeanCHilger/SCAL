 Polyethylenimine (PEI) is an organic polymer with a high density of amino groups that can be protonated. At physiological pH, the positively charged PEI binds to DNA as a gene carrier (1). PEI binds to negatively charged heparin sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface, thus facilitating the transfection of eukaryotic cells (2). Currently, [
