 There are two known sub-types of the G-proteinâ€“coupled cannabinoid receptors, CB1R and CB2R, and they are believed to participate in many physiological processes such as neurotransmission, energy homeostasis, and the control of immune cell function (1). The CB1R are found primarily in the brain, whereas the CB2R are expressed predominantly on immune cells (2). However, the CB2R were shown recently to be expressed on brain neurons as well and were reported to have a role in the development of conditions such as drug abuse and depression (3). The modulation of CB2R expression has been reported in astrocytic tumors, atherosclerotic and amyloid plaques, and demyelination plaques observed in multiple sclerosis (4). A variety of CB2R antagonists and agonists are commercially available, and some agonists have been shown to induce apoptosis in various tumor cell types and are used to treat pain and inflammation observed during neuropathy, cancer, multiple sclerosis, etc (5). In addition, some agonists have been used for the management of depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity, and anxiety disorders (5). A few tritiated ligands have been used to investigate the CB2R under
