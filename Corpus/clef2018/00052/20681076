. The gastrin-releasing peptide (GPR), a bombesin (BBN) analog that targets the GRP receptor (GRP-R) to mediate its activity, is believed to assist in the progression and metastases of a variety of human cancers by acting as a growth factor (1, 2). Also, because the overexpression of GRP-R has been documented for many cancers, this receptor has been targeted with radiopharmaceuticals for the treatment of different malignancies, including that of the prostate (1). For a satisfactory therapeutic response with radiochemicals such as radiolabeled GRP, BBN, or their analogs, an optimal cellular accumulation of the radionuclide is necessary, and the uptake process is mediated by endocytosis, resulting in internalization of the receptor-ligand (RL) complex (3). Because the RL complex internalization is upregulated by the interaction of an agonist with its receptor, investigators in the field developed different radiolabeled BBN analogs that were GRP-R agonists and evaluated their biological characteristics under
