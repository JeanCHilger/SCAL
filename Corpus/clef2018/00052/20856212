Early post transplant (F-18) 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography does not predict outcome for patients undergoing auto-SCT in non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma. Positron emission tomography (PET) in conjunction with computed tomography is a frequently used modality for staging patients with lymphoma. Utility of PET-computed tomography before or early following auto-SCT has not been as rigorously evaluated. We retrospectively analyzed patients who received auto-SCT for treatment of relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkins lymphoma or Hodgkins disease between the years of 1996 and 2007. Patients who had either a PET scan following salvage chemotherapy within 14 weeks of transplantation (pre-PET), and/or a PET scan 6-14 weeks following transplantation (post-PET) were included. A total of 90 patients were identified for analysis. The median follow-up time is 3.3 years, with a range of 0.13-12.0 years. The median PFS was 4.6 years, and median OS was 5.1 years. At the time of this analysis, 34 patients (37%) experienced disease relapse, and 25 (27%) of the patients died from disease progression. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, post-PET did not predict for outcome, pre-PET positivity predicted for decrease in PFS. In conclusion, post-PET scan did not predict for PFS or OS in multivariate analysis. Positive pre-PET scan did predict for PFS as seen in previous studies, and may help identify patients who would benefit from innovative post transplant therapies.
