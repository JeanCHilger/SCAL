Survey and molecular characterization of Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp. in owned companion animal, dogs and cats, in Japan. Compared with other countries, surveys of these parasites have been rarely performed in companion animals of Japan in spite of their significance for public health. Here, we investigated pet dogs and cats in Japan for the first time, and genetically analyzed the isolates to evaluate the risk of zoonotic infections. Seventy-seven fecal samples were collected from privately owned dogs and 55 samples from owned cats in Osaka city, Japan. Cryptosporidium oocysts were identified in 3/77 dogs (3.9%) and 7/55 cats (12.7%), and Giardia infection in 2/77 dogs (2.6%) and 1/55 cats (1.8%). Amplification of the target regions for genotyping was successful, Cryptosporidium isolates in dogs and cats were identified as C. canis and C. felis, respectively, and those of Giardia in dogs and cats were G. intestinalis Assemblages D and F. The discharge period of the oocysts varied within 3-16 weeks and that of the cysts was 12 weeks. To date, zoonotic types of both parasites have been identified in other animals in Japan, and further large-scale studies are needed to determine the distribution of zoonotic genotypes in these animals, especially those closely associated with humans.
