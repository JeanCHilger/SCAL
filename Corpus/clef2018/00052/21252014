A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study of the safety and efficacy of BIOBYPASS (AdGVVEGF121.10NH) gene therapy in patients with refractory advanced coronary artery disease: the NOVA trial. Genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can potentially augment myocardial perfusion in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled gene therapy study with the adenovirus carrying VEGF121 (BIOBYPASS [AdGVVEGF121.10NH]).Seventeen patients with severe CAD were 2:1 randomised to BIOBYPASS (n=12 61 years) or placebo (n=5Direct intramyocardial injection of BIOBYPASS (AdGVVEGF121.10NH) was safe but did not improve exercise capacity, time to ischaemic threshold or myocardial perfusion compared to sham injection in patients with refractory myocardial ischaemia.
