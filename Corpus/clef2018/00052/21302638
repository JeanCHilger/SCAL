Imaging techniques in diagnostic approaches. Despite the considerable technological advances in imaging modalities which have occurred over the last years, EUS remains one of the most reliable and accurate technique for the study of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. More specifically, EUS can detect very small lesions, assess the local extent and lymph node involvement and biopsy the lesion for cytophatological confirmation (EUS-FNA). In addition, nuclear medicine imaging has a relevant role in the evaluation of NET. However, its performance depends on series of patient-specific features (lesion size and uptake, depth and other anatomic features metabolic activity, receptor expression, affinity and vacancy, tissue specificity) and technical features (choice of tracer, administered dose, and physical half-life
