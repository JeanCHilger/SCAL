Excretion of volatile ¹³¹I from rats following administration of Na¹³¹I or MIBG-¹³¹I. Current practice for radiation protection associated with (131)I therapy mainly focuses on external and internal exposure caused by physical contamination of the hospital staff, other patients and family members. However, if volatile (131)I is excreted by the treated patients, these individuals could also be exposed through inhalation of (131)I. This study quantifies the amount of volatile (131)I excreted by rats after intravenous administration of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)-(131)I or Na(131)I, the two most common forms of (131)I therapy. The results indicate that in 4 d following administration, the total excretion of volatile (131)I was 0.036 and 0.17 % of the administered activities of MIBG-(131)I and Na(131)I, respectively. As administered activities for (131)I therapy are typically of the order of 1-10 GBq, the overall excretion of volatile (131)I from a patient can be as high as 20 MBq. As a result, a family member can receive up to 0.07 mSv committed effective dose from inhaling the volatile (131)I excreted by the patient.
