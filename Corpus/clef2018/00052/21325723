Repeated intracoronary infusion of peripheral blood stem cells with G-CSF in patients with refractory ischemic heart failure--a pilot study. Recent investigations have suggested the clinical efficacy of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) infusion alone or in combination with a single dose delivery of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) infusion in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and congestive heart failure (HF). The current study tested the feasibility and effect of repeated intracoronary infusions PBSC and the mobilization of G-CSF in patients with refractory HF after MI.Patients with recent large MI and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were enrolled into one of the following 3 groups: Group R (n=15) received repeated intracoronary infusion of PBSC and one-dose of G-CSF Group S (n=15) received a single infusion of PBSC and a G-CSF doseRepeated intracoronary infusions of PBSC plus mobilization of G-CSF might be an optional effective strategy for treating patients with refractory HF after recent large MI.
