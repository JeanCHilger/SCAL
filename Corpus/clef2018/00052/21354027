The relationship between cord blood immunoglobulin E levels and allergy-related outcomes in young adults. Elevated cord blood IgE may be associated with a higher risk of allergic disease.To determine whether cord blood IgE is associated with allergic biomarkers or allergic disorders in young adults.Data was collected from 670 subjects 18-21 years of age that were among 835 original participants in the Detroit Childhood Allergy Study, a general risk, population-based birth cohort. Cord blood IgE was assessed in relation to biomarkers associated with allergy and asthma including total IgE, allergen-specific IgE, blood eosinophilia, and spirometry. Cord blood IgE was also analyzed for associations to subsequent allergic disease including atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma.Cord blood IgE, analyzed as a continuous measure, was modestly correlated with total IgE (r = 0.18, P < .001) and higher cord IgE was associated with a higher likelihood of sensitization to common allergens in young adults (OR = 1.18, 95% CI, 1.02-1.37 P = .031). The relationship between cord IgE and sensitization was stronger among teens with no pet exposure in the first year of life (OR = 1.43, 95% CI, 1.16-1.77An elevated cord blood IgE level modestly correlates with elevated total IgE and is associated with a slightly higher likelihood of allergic sensitization among young adults. However, cord IgE is not a strong predictor of clinical allergic disorders in this age group.
