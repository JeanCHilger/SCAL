A dynamic disorder-linked reversible phase transition in a new chloroform solvate of cis-dichloridobis(triethylphosphane)platinum(II). The title compound, cis-dichloridobis(triethylphosphane)platinum(II) chloroform monosolvate, [PtCl(2)(C(6)H(15)P)(2)]·CHCl(3), has been obtained from ligand scrambling in the cis-[PtCl(2)(Cyp(2)PCl)(PEt(3))] (Cyp = cyclopentyl) system in CHCl(3) solvent. Unlike the two previously reported unsolvated polymorphs, which are both monoclinic, the compound crystallizes in an orthorhombic setting. Furthermore, the system exhibits a reversible temperature-dependent structural phase transition, coupling a reduction in anisotropic displacement parameters and a reduction in crystallographic symmetry on cooling. The high-temperature phase adopts space group Pnma with the complex and solvent molecules sitting across a crystallographic mirror plane (Z' = 0.5). The low-temperature phase adopts the space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with Z' = 1.
