Leiomyoma mimicking an incarcerated inguinal hernia: A rare complication of laparoscopic hysterectomy. A 52-year-old, obese, female patient was referred for a right inguinal mass, which appeared seven months after a laparoscopic hysterectomy, which was performed because of myomatosis. Despite several examinations, including ultrasound, computed tomography (CT)-Scan, positron emission tomography (PET)-CT, and ultrasound-guided biopsy, the diagnosis remained unclear until surgical exploration, which disclosed a well-encapsulated solid tumour corresponding to a fibrotic leiomyoma. Spilling of leiomyoma cells is a rare and unusual complication of laparoscopic surgery. Tumour development in the inguinal canal after laparoscopic gynaecological surgery should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of inguinal hernia and other uncommon pathologies.
