Imaging prostate cancer lymph node metastases with a multimodality contrast agent. Methods to detect lymph node (LN) metastases in prostate cancer (PCa) are limited. Pelvic LN dissection is commonly performed during prostatectomy, but often followed by morbid complications. More refined methods for detecting LN invasion are needed.We developed a dual-labeled targeting agent having a near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore for intraoperative guidance, and a conventional radiotracer for detection of LN metastasis. Nu/Nu mice were orthotopically implanted with DsRed-expressing human PCa (PC3) cells. Antibody (Ab) specific for epithelial cell adhesion molecule was conjugated to DOTA, IRDye 800CW, and radiolabeled with (64) Cu. Dual-labeled Ab was administered intravenously at 10-12 weeks post-implantation, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and fluorescence imaging were performed within 18-24 hr.Metastasis to lumbar LNs was detected by DsRed fluorescence imaging, as well as pathology, in 75% of mice having pathology-confirmed primary prostate tumors. These metastases were also detected by NIR fluorescence imaging. In some cases, metastases to sciatic, medial, renal, and axillary nodes were also detected. For all LNs examined, no significant differences were found between the percentages of metastases detected by NIR imaging (63%) and µPET/CT (64%) (P = 0.93), or between those detected by DsRed imaging (25%) and pathological examination (19%) (P = 0.12).This study demonstrates that a multimodality contrast agent is useful for early detection of metastatic disease, and has applications for intraoperative PCa treatment. Further agent optimization is necessary to enhance specificity, and provide validation for prostate and other LN metastasizing epithelial cancers.
