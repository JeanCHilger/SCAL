Neuroprotection effects of retained acupuncture in neurotoxin-induced Parkinson's disease mice. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of retained acupuncture (RA) in neurotoxin-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were injected with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to induce the PD model. The mice were divided into four groups, namely, (1) normal (2) MPTP+retained acupuncture (RA)
