PET/CT imaging in infectious conditions. New aggressive pathogens are responsible for the increasing incidence and difficult management of infections. Modern epidemics such as diabetes are frequently complicated by severe infections with subsequent high morbidity. Diagnosis (essentially early detection of infection) and also management decision making pose clinical challenges. Many resources are invested in developing precise, noninvasive diagnostic tests and efficient therapies for infectious processes. Nuclear medicine procedures are part of the evaluation armamentarium of patients with suspected or confirmed infection. Their strength relies on the fact that they are noninvasive tests that provide both functional as well as metabolic information early in the course of disease. Their limitations relate to the need for specific radiotracers and the rather low resolution of images. These limitations have been largely overcome by the hybrid PET/CT and SPECT/CT technology. PET/CT, primarily using FDG, is redefining the diagnostic work up and is currently leading to changes in the management of patients with suspected or known infections. The main indications for FDG PET/CT in infection, as well as updated literature results, are presented in the following review.
