Radioembolization with (90)Y-labeled microspheres: post-therapeutic therapy validation with Bremsstrahlung-SPECT. During the last years angiographic Selective Internal Radiotherapy (SIRT) with (90)Y-labelled microspheres has become a common technique for the local-ablative treatment of cancer patients. SIRT is a palliative therapy concept for the treatment of liver malignancies. As a result of (90)Y-decay as Î²(-)-emitter without a concomitant gamma radiation, Bremsstrahlung imaging is needed to validate the distribution achieved by radioembolisation. This article demonstrates the method of imaging through phantom measurement and shows the advantages of post-therapeutic tomography by means of a patient study. Approaches for further optimization of Bremsstrahlung imaging are discussed.
