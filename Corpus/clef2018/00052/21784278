Positron emission tomography (PET) assessment of renal perfusion. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a radionuclide imaging technique that allows noninvasive mapping of radiopharmaceutical concentrations in three-dimensional space. PET methods have been described for imaging and quantification of renal perfusion using cyclotron-produced (15)O-water and (13)N-ammonia, as well as using generator-produced (82)RbCl and (62)Cu-ETS. Although the majority of clinical PET facilities will lack the in-house biomedical cyclotron needed for (15)O and (13)N production, the generator-produced tracers are available to virtually any clinical site with a PET camera. Studies with these radiopharmaceuticals have largely focused on methodologic issues, and agent validation for renal blood flow measurements. However, the resulting PET methods for quantification of renal perfusion do appear suitable for application to both research and clinical problems in renal pathophysiology.
