Current and emerging imaging in relation to drug discovery in airways disease. Medical imaging has been increasingly used in respiratory research due to the rapid and ongoing development of medical technology. Current imaging is almost entirely 3-dimensional and allows the measurement of structure and function, often both simultaneously. The information complements other measurement methods in airway research because imaging's greatest contributions are those of topographical information, direct visualisation of functional or structural change, sampling of the whole organ (in contrast to for example bronchoscopy) and potential for inÂ vivo imaging in a repeated, prospective nature. Medical imaging modalities of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultra-high resolution imaging, positron emission computed tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are reviewed in relation to research in airways disease.
