 An Affibody molecule is a chain of 58 amino acids (~6.5 kDa) that contains a modified B domain of the staphylococcal protein A and can be obtained through chemical synthesis or produced in bacteria with the use of recombinant technology (1). Because of their small size and high chemical and thermal stability, these molecules are used as radiolabeled probes for the targeted detection and treatment of malignant tumors as discussed elsewhere (1-3). The epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is considered to be an important Affibody target because it is believed to promote the development of the malignant phenotype, it plays a role in the development of resistance to anticancer drugs and radiation therapy, it is overexpressed in several different cancer tumor cells, and it often indicates a poor prognosis for the patient (4). Several radionuclide-labeled Affibodies and their derivatives, such as Z
