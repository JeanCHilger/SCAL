N stage disease in patients with non-small cell lung cancer: efficacy of quantitative and qualitative assessment with STIR turbo spin-echo imaging, diffusion-weighted MR imaging, and fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT. To prospectively compare the diagnostic capability of short inversion time inversion-recovery (STIR) turbo spin-echo (SE) imaging, diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) combined positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) in N stage assessment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. A total of 250 consecutive patients with NSCLC (136 men mean age, 73 yearsWhen feasible, threshold values were used for quantitative assessment sensitivity and accuracy of LSR and LMR (sensitivity, 82.8%Quantitative and qualitative assessments of N stage disease in patients with NSCLC obtained with STIR turbo SE MR imaging are more sensitive and/or more accurate than those obtained with DW MR imaging and FDG PET/CT.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11110281/-/DC1.
