Is ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-based metabolic response superior to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors-based response after two cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy in predicting clinical outcome of untreated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer? This prospective observational study aimed to compare ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-based metabolic response with Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)-based response after two cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy in predicting clinical outcome of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Untreated patients with advanced NSCLC scheduled to receive platinum-based chemotherapy were enrolled for this study. They underwent spiral computed tomography and ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography concurrently before and after two cycles of chemotherapy. An optimal maximum standardized uptake value reduction of primary lesion was investigated retrospectively for a metabolic response.A total of 43 patients were eligible for final analysis from August 2003 to May 2007. Objective response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in RECIST-based responders compared with RECIST-based nonresponders after two cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy [85.0% (17/20) vs. 4.3% (1/23), respectively P=0.000], but median progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) were similar [5.8 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.6-8.0) vs. 5.0 (95% CI: 3.3-6.7) months, respectively, P=0.761Metabolic response could be superior to RECIST-based response after two cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy in predicting PFS of untreated patients with advanced NSCLC. Both of them could be predictive for ORR, but neither of them could predict OS.
