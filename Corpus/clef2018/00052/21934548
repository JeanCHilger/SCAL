Radiolabeled uracil derivative as a novel SPECT probe for thymidine phosphorylase:  suppressed accumulation into tumor cells by target gene knockdown. We have developed a radiolabeled uracil derivative, 5-iodo-6-[(2-iminoimidazolidinyl)methyl]uracil (IIMU) as a novel single photon emission computed tomography probe for thymidine phosphorylase (TP). This radioiodinated IIMU has a high affinity for TP and highly accumulates in the TP-expressing tumor cell line A431 (human epidermoid carcinoma). To evaluate the specificity of the cellular uptake of IIMU to TP expression, we examined the effects of TP knockdown on the uptake of ¹²⁵I-labeled IIMU (¹²⁵I-IIMU) in the tumor cells.TP-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)-specific siRNA (positive control), and negative control siRNA were transfected into A431 cells, respectively. Target-mRNA and protein expression levels of TP and GAPDH were examined 48 and 72 h after transfection, respectively. The cellular uptake level of ¹²⁵I-IIMU was also evaluated 72 h after transfection. The results were compared after normalization with the corresponding negative controls.After TP-specific and GAPDH-specific siRNA transfection, the expression levels of TP and GAPDH mRNA decreased significantly to 41 and 29%, respectively, compared with the negative control (P<0.001 for both). The expression levels of TP and GAPDH protein also significantly decreased to 34 and 30%, respectively (P<0.001 for both). After TP-specific siRNA transfection, the cellular uptake level of ¹²⁵I-IIMU decreased significantly to 66% (P<0.001). In contrast, GAPDH siRNA transfection did not significantly affect the cellular uptake level of ¹²⁵I-IIMU.siRNA-mediated TP knockdown significantly decreased the cellular uptake level of ¹²⁵I-IIMU. This finding indicates that the uptake of IIMU in tumor cells is TP specific and directly corresponds to TP expression levels.
