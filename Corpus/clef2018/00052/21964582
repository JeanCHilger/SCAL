The role of integrated F-18-FDG-PET scanning in the detection of M1 disease in oesophageal adenocarcinoma and impact on clinical management. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning in the staging of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.One hundred four patients with biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma underwent (18)F-FDG-PET scan. FDG avid lesions were further investigated to their diagnostic conclusion.Nineteen patients (18.26%) were found to have non-loco-regional FDG uptake. Of the patients, 3.84% were found to have M1 disease and 7.69% were found to have a second primary tumour. The sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET scanning to detect metastatic disease in our series was 57.14% and 84.53%, respectively. The overall diagnostic accuracy was 82.69%.PET scanning improves staging and prevents unnecessary surgery in patients with M1 disease. It represents a good adjunct to computed tomography scanning and endoscopic ultrasound in the staging of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The detection of asymptomatic coexisting synchronous cancers is an added benefit provided by PET scanning over similar diagnostic modalities.
