Myocardial perfusion abnormality in the area of ventricular septum-free wall junction and cardiovascular events in nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Myocardial perfusion abnormality in the left ventricle is known to be prognostic in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Magnetic resonance imaging and necropsy studies on HCM hearts revealed myocardial lesions predominating in the area of ventricular septum-free wall junction. We assessed perfusion abnormality in this area and correlated it with the prognosis of HCM patients. We performed exercise Tc-99m tetrofosmin myocardial scintigraphy in 55 patients with nonobstructive HCM. Perfusion abnormalities were semiquantified using a 5-point scoring system in small areas of anterior junctions of basal, mid, and apical short axis views in addition to a conventional 17-segment model. All patients were prospectively followed for sudden death, cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure or stroke associated with atrial fibrillation. Cardiovascular events occurred in 10 patients during an average follow-up period of 5.7 years. Stress and rest scores from anterior junction, and conventional summed stress score were significantly higher in patients with cardiovascular events than without (all P < 0.05). Anterior junction stress score of >2 produced a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 98% for cardiovascular events and was an independent predictor (hazard ratio 8.33 95% confidence interval, 1.61-43.5
