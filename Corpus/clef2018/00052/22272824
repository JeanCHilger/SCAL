Development of radiolabeled compounds for myocardial perfusion imaging. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the main cause of death and remains a major health problem worldwide. Myocardial perfusion imaging is a well established noninvasive method for assessing CAD. This review summarizes the development of various radiotracers for myocardial perfusion imaging, including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion imaging agents and positron emission tomography (PET) perfusion imaging agents and introduces novel basic research data related to this area. In addition, the current state of the art in myocardial perfusion imaging agents and the future direction are discussed in this review.
