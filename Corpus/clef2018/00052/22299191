 Increased growth and proliferation are the typical characteristic features of cancer cells, and to maintain these processes the cells have an increased demand for energy. Adenosine triphosphate is the main source of energy in normal cells, and it is produced through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the mitochondria. However, in cells with a malignant phenotype, the TCA is redirected to synthesize metabolic intermediates that can be used to produce fatty acids and amino acids (aa) that are required for the growth and survival of the tumor cells (1). To meet the energy requirements of cancerous tumors, the aerobic glycolytic pathway, which uses glucose to produce energy, is upregulated and serves as the major source of energy in the tumor cells (2). Therefore, [
