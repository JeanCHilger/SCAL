Effect of extra- and intra-cranial vascular anastomosis on regional blood flow, studied by SPECT using 99m-Tc HMPAO. Thirty-two patients suffering from occlusive cerebrovascular disease were investigated by means of 99mTc-HMPAO brain SPECT before and one month after EC-IC bypass operation. The regional cerebral blood flow was unchanged postoperatively in 19 patients, increased in 7 cases, and deteriorated in 6 patients. One patient died in the postoperative period and in another no follow-up SPECT could be performed. It is concluded that the regional cerebral blood flow, even in the absence of a morphological deficit on CT, was not improved by the operation in the majority of cases.
