Current and future radiopharmaceuticals for brain imaging with single photon emission computed tomography. Development of radiopharmaceuticals for functional brain imaging has progressed rapidly in recent years. Measurement of regional cerebral blood flow in humans can be achieved by using [123I]-iodoamphetamine or [99mTc]-HMPAO. Several other lipid-soluble [99mTc]-technetium complexes are currently undergoing clinical trials. New 123I-labeled agents designed to measure central nervous system receptors, including D1 and D2 dopamine, serotonin, muscarinic, and benzodiazepine receptors, have been developed. In conjunction with single photon emission computed tomography, they may provide useful tools to evaluate brain function related to changes in receptor concentration.
