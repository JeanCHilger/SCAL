(18)F-FDG cell labeling may underestimate transplanted cell homing: more accurate, efficient, and stable cell labeling with hexadecyl-4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoate for in vivo tracking of transplanted human progenitor cells by positron emission tomography. Cell therapy is expected to restore perfusion and improve function in the ischemic/infarcted myocardium however, the biological mechanisms and local effects of transplanted cells remain unclear. To assess cell fate in vivo, hexadecyl-4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoate ((18)F-HFB)  cell labeling was evaluated for tracking human circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) with positron emission tomography (PET) and was compared to the commonly used 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ((18)F-FDG) labeling method in a rat myocardial infarction model. CPCs were labeled  with 18F-HFB or (18)F-FDG ex vivo under the same conditions. (18)F-HFB cell-labeling efficiency (23.4 ± 7.5%) and stability (4 h, 88.4 ± 6.0%) were superior to (18)F-FDG (7.6 ± 4.1% and 26.6 ± 6.1%, respectively
