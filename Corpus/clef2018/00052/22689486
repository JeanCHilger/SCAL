The determination and characterisation of 2-naphthyloxycarbonyl chloride derivatised biogenic amines in pet foods. The need to monitor biogenic amines levels is essential for many areas of the food industry for two main reasons: the caustic nature and potential toxicity of these amines, and the potential to use amine levels as markers for freshness and quality in foodstuffs. Optimised analysis conditions used for the determination of biogenic amines derivatised with 2-napthyloxycarbonyl chloride has been applied to different pet food samples to assess the effectiveness of this method for complex sample matrices. Further to this, the use of high-resolution mass spectrometry has enabled the previously unconfirmed derivatised form of seven biogenic amines to be established. The derivatised forms identified include as mono substituted (tryptamine and histamine), bisubstituted (putrescine, cadaverine and tyramine), trisubstituted (spermidine) and tetrasubstituted (spermine). The methodology of biogenic amine determination was performed successfully to a range of pet food products highlighting the applicability to a variety of complex sample matrices.
