Effectivity and clinical impact of (18)F-FDG-PET in the diagnosis of unsuspected second primary tumors. This study has aimed to determine the capacity and clinical impact of the (18)F-FDG-PET to detect previously unsuspected second primary tumors.This is a retrospective cross-sectional study of 1984 consecutive scans performed between March 2004 and March 2005, identifying those studies that had reported the presence of hypermetabolic lesions, that had not been previously suspected or detected and that could be suggestive of second primary tumors. Diagnosis was made histopathologically or by clinical and radiological follow-up for a period exceeding one year.62 findings suggestive of second primary tumors were detected in 58 patients (3.1%). The reasons for the study for this group of patients were diverse, the most common being the differential diagnosis of solitary pulmonary nodules. A total of 43.5% of lesions were not followed-up. We confirmed the existence of 35 lesions, either by pathology study (21 lesions, 13 second primary tumors, the incidence in our population was 0.65%) or clinical and radiological follow-up (14 lesions, none of which corresponded to second primary tumors). The total clinical impact was the discovery of unexpected 14 lesions in 12 patients.The presence of second primary tumors on (18)F-FDG-PET is relatively common. These lesions should be monitored clinically for accurate diagnosis. In a high percentage, they correspond to unexpected second primary tumors in an early stage and therefore amenable to curative treatment or for which tumor treatment planning may be modified.
