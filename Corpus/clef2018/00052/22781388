Additional diagnostic value of hybrid SPECT-CT systems imaging in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. : Nuclear medicine has entered a new era of multimodality imaging. Single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) hybrid cameras are relatively new diagnostic tools that have been widely adopted and are present in most nuclear medicine units. SPECT/CT instruments allow functional and morphologic images to be acquired as superimposed (fusion images) in a single session.The integration of CT enables better characterization of functional abnormalities identified on planar and SPECT scintigraphy by offering structural information. It thus highly improves accuracy compared with conventional scintigraphy.The combination of functional information and anatomic localization has the potential to influence medical practice with newer imaging algorithms. This review presents the current evidence and potential indications of SPECT/CT imaging in the initial staging, treatment, and follow-up of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.
