The role of mediastinoscopy for diagnosis of isolated mediastinal lymphadenopathy. To determine the role of mediastinoscopy (MDS) in the histological diagnosis of isolated mediastinal lymphadenopathy in a centre where more sophisticated investigations, like positron emitting tomography (PET) scan and endobronchial ultrasound guided trans-bronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is not available. This is a retrospective study. From January 2006 to December 2009, 31 patients with isolated mediastinal lymphadenopathy underwent MDS to establish a histological diagnosis. The mean age was 36.3Â years. Among the patients, 19 were males and 12 were females. The most common symptom was dry cough in 18 (58%) patients. The diagnostic yield was 96.8%, with sarcoidosis being the commonest diagnosis. It was concluded that MDS was vital in establishing a histological diagnosis in patients with isolated mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
