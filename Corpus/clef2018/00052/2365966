Abnormal EEG slow activity in left temporal areas in senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. Resting 32-channel topographical measures of EEG slow activity were compared in 12 elderly controls and 12 patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. The patients had higher amplitude delta and theta than controls, especially in the left temporal regions. This greater amount of low frequency EEG activity in the left temporal area is consistent with recent EEG, neuropsychological assessment, and positron emission tomography findings in SDAT patients. Five patients with mild-to-moderate dementia (as determined by the Folstein Mini-Mental State scale) primarily exhibited focal, abnormal slow activity in the left temporal regions. Seven patients with severe dementia exhibited increased slow activity across the head, which was still most abnormal in the left temporal regions.
