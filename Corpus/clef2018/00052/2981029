SPECT image noise power: effects of nonstationary projection noise and attenuation compensation. The effects of nonstationary projection noise and attenuation compensation are included in a theoretic calculation of the radial noise power spectrum (NPS) of single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) images. The nonstationary projection noise is shown to cause a relatively large d.c. component in the NPS, especially for small objects whereas, attenuation compensation increases the total noise variance while only changing the d.c. component slightly. The theoretic calculation agrees well with a radial NPS estimated from 1,250 SPECT images simulated from projections of random Gaussian noise, even though the effects of discrete data collection and reconstruction were not included in the theoretical model.
