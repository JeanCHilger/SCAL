Gallium-transferrin as a macromolecular tracer of vascular permeability. Labeling of plasma transferrin with gallium was investigated to determine whether the gallium-transferrin complex could be effectively used as a macromolecular tracer in studies of capillary permeability using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Three gallium-plasma preparations were tested and 2 h biodistribution studies were performed in rats. The three preparations gave similar blood clearance and tissue distribution data, but the methods used for evaluating gallium-transferrin binding were found to be suboptimal. Gallium clearance from blood was biexpoential with both components faster than that of 125I-albumin. Gallium distribution spaces in all tissues including intracerebral Walker-256 tumors were larger than those of albumin. These results indicate a relative instability of the gallium-transferrin complex in vivo, which appears to preclude its use as an acceptable radiolabeled protein for vascular permeability studies using PET.
