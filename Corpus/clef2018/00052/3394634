Scintigraphic detection of regional disruption of adrenergic neurons in the heart. Experiments were designed to detect regional disruptions of adrenergic neurons in the hearts of living dogs. The neuron disruption was achieved by the application of phenol to the epicardium of the left ventricle. Evidence for denervation was the reduction in endogenous norepinephrine (NE) concentrations in the myocardium beneath the region of phenol treatment and toward the apex. Radiolabeled meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) acts as an analog of NE and as such is concentrated in adrenergic nerve terminals. Following phenol application, MIBG labeled with 125I was found, 20 hours after injection, to be distributed within myocardium in patterns comparable to those of NE. However, left stellectomy did not alter the distributions of NE or 125I-MIBG in the myocardium and apparently did not disrupt adrenergic innervation. MIBG labeled with 123I enabled scintigraphic images of heart neurons in the living dog 3 and 20 hours after injection these images portrayed the regions of adrenergic neuron disruption caused by phenol treatment. Concentrations of thallium-201 depicted on scintigraphic image and of triphenyltetrazolium observed on in vitro staining demonstrated no myocardial injury. Thus scintigraphy with 123I-MIBG will display regional adrenergic denervations in the heart.
