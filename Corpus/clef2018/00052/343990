Small animal reproductive problems. Reproductive problems in the dog and cat are an important segment of the total case load in many veterinary practices. The interest in pet population control, estrus control, artificial insemination and planned pregnancies of pets as well as the advanced knowledge and technology in immunology, microbiology, pathology, physiology and related sciences are expanding the knowledge concerning pet reproduction. The use of radioimmunoassays (RIA) to detect minute amounts of hormones in the serum or plasma of animals has given the physiologist a precise biological measuring stick. As hormone testing laboratories become available, the RIA will become a valuable aide to the veterinary clinician, clients and their pets in diagnosing and possibly preventing or treating reproductive disorders. Knowledge of the normal canine and feline reproductive physiology, pathogenesis of reproductive disorders and a thorough history, genital tract examination, collection and examination of specimens for diagnosis and realistic treatments are all fundamental to a successful management of these disorders.
