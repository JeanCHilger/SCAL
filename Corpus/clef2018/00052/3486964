Preparation of oxygen-15 butanol for positron tomography. Butanol was labeled with 15O using the reaction of tri-n-butyl borane with oxygen gas. The carrier-added synthesis and purification was accomplished in 4 min from the end of bombardment. The efficiency of radiolabel incorporation was 50%. The procedure described will produce [15O]butanol in an amount and quality sufficient for positron tomographic use. This compound is immediately useful for blood flow measurement based upon previous validation of butanol labeled with other radionuclides for that purpose.
