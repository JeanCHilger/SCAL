Brain organization in schizophrenia. Brain metabolism was measured with positron emission tomography and [11C]deoxyglucose during baseline and during a visual task in 12 normal subjects and 18 schizophrenic patients. Global measures of metabolism for 11 brain regions were transformed into relative values by dividing them by the metabolic value for whole brain. Factor analysis was accomplished on the matrix of intercorrelations among the relative regional values for the normal and for the schizophrenic patients under baseline and under the task. Four factors that revealed independently varying metabolism in frontal, occipital, left-versus-right hemisphere, and subcortical structures were obtained. The frontal and subcortical factors discriminated between normal subjects and schizophrenic patients, whereas the occipital factor discriminated between baseline and task. Although activity in these individual regions varied significantly, it was the pattern of differences in regional metabolic activity that best discriminated between diagnostic groups and testing conditions.
