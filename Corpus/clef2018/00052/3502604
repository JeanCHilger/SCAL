Exercise capacity in ischemic heart disease evaluated by continuous wave Doppler echocardiography. To evaluate exercise capacity in ischemic heart disease, we measured the peak aortic flow velocity by continuous wave Doppler (CWD) echo from the suprasternal notch at rest and during multiple load ergometer testing in the supine position. The study subjects consisted of 14 normal controls, 10 patients with effort angina and 21 patients with old myocardial infarction (OMI). In all the patients and in five normal subjects, thallium-201 emission CT (SPECT) was also performed immediately after exercise and four hours subsequently. Change in the peak aortic flow velocity during exercise was compared with the extent of perfusion defects and the presence or absence of redistribution images on SPECT. At rest, the peak aortic flow velocity was not different from that of the other three groups. During exercise, it increased progressively (crescendo type) as the exercise was increased in normal subjects. In patients with angina pectoris it increased at the initial stage of exercise, but was unchanged (crescendo-plateau type) or decreased (crescendo-decrescendo type) at the maximum exercise stage. Redistribution images on SPECT were seen in nine of 10 patients with angina pectoris. In patients with OMI, change in the peak aortic flow velocity was of the crescendo type in 14, crescendo-decrescendo in three and crescendo-plateau in one. In the remaining three it decreased from the beginning of exercise (decrescendo type). Redistribution images were seen in all patients with the crescendo-decrescendo, crescendo-plateau or decrescendo types. Furthermore, myocardial damage was much more extensive in the decrescendo type. We conclude that exercise continuous wave Doppler echocardiography is a useful means of evaluating exercise capacity in ischemic heart disease.
