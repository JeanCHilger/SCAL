Metaiodobenzylguanidine as an index of the adrenergic nervous system integrity and function. The radiopharmaceutical, metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) acts as an analog of norepinephrine (NE). Experiments in rats were carried out to determine how closely the movements of [125I]MIBG in the heart mimicked those of [3H]NE, and if the changes [125I] MIBG concentrations would reflect injury to, and function of, adrenergic neurons in the heart. Injury to adrenergic neurons by 6-hydroxydopamine substantially reduced the uptake of [125I] MIBG into the left ventricle, but the effect was less than that on uptake of [3H]NE uptake and concentration of endogenous NE. Similarly, when desmethylimipramine was given to inhibit the uptake-1 pathway of neurons, the reduction in uptake of [125I]MIBG was statistically significant but less than that of [3H]NE part of this difference may be attributable to partial uptake of [125I]MIBG into neurons by a diffusion pathway. Substantial fractions of [125I]MIBG and [3H]NE were displaced from the heart by the sympathomimetic drug, phenylpropanolamine. When adrenergic neurons of the heart were stimulated by feeding of rats, the disappearance rates of [3H]NE and [125I]MIBG from the heart were significantly increased. Although not a perfect analog of [3H]NE, [125I]MIBG appears to enter and leave the heart in patterns similar to those of [3H]NE. Thus, movements of [125I]MIBG give indices of adrenergic neuron injury and function in the heart.
