Cerebellar glucose metabolism in chronic aphasia. (18F)-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET was used to compare left/right cerebellar hemispheric glucose metabolism in 37 aphasic patients with left hemisphere lesions and 22 age-matched controls. Sixteen aphasic subjects showed cerebellar symmetry. Twenty-one aphasic subjects were found to have cerebellar metabolic asymmetry, which (1) resulted from an absolute reduction in local cerebral metabolic rates of glucose in the right cerebellar hemisphere (2) was associated with left less than right glucose metabolic asymmetry in the frontal, parietal, caudate, and thalamic regions
