Cerebral blood flow, cerebral oxygen metabolism, cerebral glucose metabolism, and tissue pH in human acute cerebral infarction using positron emission tomography. It is necessary for treatment and deciding prognosis to make clear about changes of cerebral blood flow and metabolism in acute cerebral infarction. This preliminary PET study was designed to investigate physiological and biochemical changes in acute cerebral infarction by positron emission tomography (PET). PET studies were performed in six patients with acute cerebral infarction within 48 hours after onset of stroke using continuous inhalation of C15O2 for cerebral blood flow (CBF), 15O2 for cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2), 11CO for cerebral blood volume, the intravenous injection of 11C-dimethyloxazolidinedione for tissue pH and the intravenous injection of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose for cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRGlu). Metabolic coupling index (MCI) image was made from CBF image and CMRGlu image to investigate relation between CBF and CMRGlu. Also oxygen glucose index (OGI) image was made from CMRO2 image and CMRGlu image to investigate relation between CMRO2 and CMRGlu. Preliminary results demonstrate that reduction of CBF, CMRO2, and CMRGlu in the affected cortex except for reperfusion case. Increase of OER was recognized four of six cases. Patterns of MCI and OGI in the cortex which CMRO2 value is less than 65 mumol/100 g/min were different from those in the cortex which CMRO2 value is more than 65. MCI of the affected cortex (CMRO2 less than 65) decreased relative to that of the cortex (CMRO2 greater than or equal to 65). OGI of the affected cortex (CMRO2 less than 65) significantly decreased in comparison with that of the cortex (CMRO2 greater than or equal to 65).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
