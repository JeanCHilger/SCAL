Measurements of regional cerebral blood flow and metabolism in psychopathological states. In different psychopathological states like focal epilepsy, organic dementia, and chronic schizophrenia, rCBF studies have previously demonstrated specific changes of the normal cerebral perfusion landscape. It has been assumed that these abnormalities - the hyperemia in epileptic foci, the regional reduction pattern in dementia as well as the abnormal flow distribution in chronic schizophrenia - represent metabolic alterations. Recent studies with positron emission tomography give solid support to this hypothesis. The glucose uptake in epileptic foci is increased and the uptake in the frontal cortex is reduced in chronic schizophrenia. The metabolic studies show that regional cerebral activity in various psychopathological states is now accessible to a detailed study.
