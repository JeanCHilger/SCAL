The phase of hair growth in hypothyroidism in the dog. The stage of hair growth which predominated in dogs not affected with hypothyroidism appeared to be breed-dependent. For example, in boxers, Labradors and collies, the resting stage (telogen) predominated, whereas in West Highland White terriers and cairn terriers the active stage (anagen) predominated. However, even in pet dogs kept mainly indoors, the proportion of hairs in anagen tended to increase during the winter months. In dogs affected with hypothyroidism, the proportion of hairs in anagen or telogen in members of a particular breed was the same as in the normal dogs of the breed. From this, it appeared that breed was more influential than hypothyroidism in determining the predominant phase of hair growth.
