Imaging in the diagnosis and assessment of prognosis in localized prostate cancer. Consensus Conference on Diagnosis and Prognostic Parameters in Localized Prostate Cancer. Stockholm, Sweden, May 12-13, 1993. As part of a WHO consensus conference on diagnosis and prognostic parameters in localized prostate cancer, a working group of experts discussed the role of various modern imaging techniques. Special attention was focused on transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) in combination with biopsies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using endorectal coil and recent advances in these techniques. Some experimental techniques, especially hormone receptor scintigraphy and positron emission tomography were also discussed and new results were presented. We concluded that MRI seems to be superior to other imaging techniques in the preoperative assessment of local tumor stage. TRUS defends its place in the diagnostic armament it is easily combined with multiple biopsies, the results of which are important in the assessment of the biological aggressiveness of prostate cancer. The present development in the field of nuclear medicine may result in techniques for in vivo characterization of tumors and will most certainly have important implications for diagnosis of prostate cancer in the future.
