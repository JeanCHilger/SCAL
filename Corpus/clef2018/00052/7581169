Synthesis of radioiodinated naltrindole analogues: ligands for studies of delta opioid receptors. Analogues of naltrindole and N1'-methylnaltrindole having radioiodine in the 7'-position of the indole ring have been prepared for evaluation as delta opioid receptor ligands. The no-carrier-added radiosyntheses were conducted by Cu(I) assisted nucleophilic exchange of radioiodide for bromide under reducing conditions at 190 degrees C. A combination of HPLC and solid-phase extraction gave the 125I- or 123I-labeled products in satisfactory yields (47%) with high radiochemical purities (> 98%) and high specific activities (125I: 43-68 GBq/mumol, 1155-1833 mCi/mumol 123I: > 92 GBq/mumol, 2500 mCi/mumol).
