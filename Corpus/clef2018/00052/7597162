Functional magnetic resonance tomography of psychological functions exemplified by experimentally induced emotions. Changes in regional cerebral blood oxygenation during experimentally modified psychological activation can be measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). fMRI is a new imaging technique for perfusion-based signal intensities of the brain without the necessity of radioactivity and with superior anatomical and temporal resolution compared to positron emission tomography (PET). In this study a T2* FLASH sequence (TR 240ms, TE 60ms, slice thickness 4 mm, alpha = 40 degrees, matrix 64 x 128) was used to investigate changes in signal intensity within the temporal lobe and the amygdala during experimentally induced emotions. Visual stimuli of happy [sad] facial portraits were presented to volunteers to induce changes in the subjects' mood while lying in the tomograph. In agreement with a previous PET study, a significant increase in signal intensity in the left amygdala was found during induction of a sad mood, while no comparable effect was visible during induction of a happy mood.
