Detecting hibernated myocardium with SPECT and thallium-glucose-insulin infusion. Because thallium kinetics, like potassium kinetics, may be affected by serum insulin levels, we performed two pilot studies to identify severely ischemic myocardium using different protocols based on the infusion of a thallium, insulin, potassium and glucose solution. Results were compared with those obtained with two currently used protocols based on rest injection or reinjection of 201Tl.In the first study (Protocol 1) of 15 men with a previous large myocardial infarction, perfusion was evaluated by SPECT in 20 segments after a 30-min infusion of 201Tl (111 MBq), insulin (5 U) and potassium (10 mEq) in 10% glucose solution (250 ml). Imaging was repeated 30 min later and the results were compared with those obtained from stress and 3-hr reinjection images. In the second study (Protocol 2), 15 patients were evaluated randomly at rest and 3 hr later (rest-redistribution). On a separate day, the patients were then re-evaluated after infusion of 201Tl (111 MBq), potassium (10 mEq) and insulin (5 U) in 5% glucose (250 ml) images were obtained 90 and 180 min postinjection.In Protocol 1, radiotracer activity in segments with no uptake during stress was detected in 35% with the reinjection technique and 58% with the insulin solution protocol. In Protocol 2, 31% of segments revealed thallium activity after insulin infusion but not at rest or rest-redistribution. Serum measurements showed high insulin levels (444 +/- 138 in Protocol 1, 125 +/- 33 mU/ml in Protocol 2), although glucose levels were not significantly altered (149 +/- 32 versus 71 +/- 20 mg/dl, respectively). Potassemia was not affected and the patients tolerated the tests satisfactorily.These results confirm that continuous infusion of 201Tl with a low dose of insulin in a glucose/potassium chloride solution is safe and may enhance cellular uptake of the radiotracer in severe ischemic regions, thereby improving viable myocardium detection.
