Expression of the beta-subunit isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase in rat embryo tissues, inner ear and choroid plexus. We report evidence of the apical localization of the two Na,K-ATPase beta-subunit isoforms in cells of the inner ear and of the choroid plexus of the rat. To this end, we generated isoform-specific antisera against the human Na,K-ATPase beta 1 and beta 2 subunits. These polyclonal rabbit antisera were raised against truncated beta-isoform proteins that were made in E coli with pET expression vectors. Deglycosylation of the native antigen with N-endoglycosidase F shows four bands in the beta 1 isoform and five bands in the beta 2 isoform immunoblots. In E15 rat embryos, the beta 1 isoform was detected in brain, heart and kidney and the beta 2 isoform only in brain. While beta-subunit mRNA expression (Watts AG, Sanchez-Watts G, Emanuel JR, Levenson R (1991) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 88, 7425-7429), immunoblotting and enzymatic activity have been determined (Zlokovic BV< mackic JB, Wang L, McComb JG, McDonough A (1993) J Biol Chem 268, 8019-8025), very little is known about the specific localization of each beta-isoform in the epithelia of choroid plexus and inner ear. Immunocytochemical preparations of 15-day-old whole rat embryos and adult rat brain showed an enhanced staining for the beta 1 and beta 2 isoforms in the apical membrane of the ampullary crests of the inner ear's semicircular ducts and in the cuboidal cells of the choroid plexus.
