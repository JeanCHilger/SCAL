Developments in tomographic methods for biological trace element research. Neutron-induced gamma-ray emission tomography for quantitative determination of concentration and distribution of elements in a selected plane through a biological specimen is briefly explained and applied by way of illustration to the analysis of gallstones. A system capable of carrying out studies of the binding site of 75Se is different matrices using time differential perturbed angular correlation spectroscopy is also briefly described. Developments in the detector technology of positron emission tomography have allowed small-diameter imaging devices to be built for in vivo preclinical evaluation of new tracers in small animals and are discussed in the context of a proposed experiment combining the techniques mentioned above.
