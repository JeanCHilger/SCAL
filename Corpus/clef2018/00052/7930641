A method for labeling cells for positron emission tomography (PET) studies. Positron emission tomography (PET) may provide an ideal means of monitoring the delivery of cells to normal and pathological tissue owing to its high resolution, specificity and three dimensional imaging capabilities. In order to implement such a technique, it is important to develop a labeling method for cells which provides a rapid and stable incorporation of the positron emitter without altering the viability or functional activity of the cells to be studied. Two approaches have been explored to achieve this end: metabolic incorporation of 2-[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (2-[18F]FDG) or protein labeling with [11C]methyl iodide (MI). IL-2 activated mouse natural killer lymphocytes were expanded in culture for 7 days and used for these studies. Uptake of 2-[18F]FDG by the natural killer cells was found to occur rapidly and to level off after 30 min. The amount of cell-associated label was found to decay at a steady rate immediately following the procedure, with approximately 21% loss of label after 1 h. In contrast, labeling of cells with MI provided a stable association for 60 min which did not alter the viability or the cytotoxic activity of the cells. Injection of the labeled cells into a normal mouse followed by a full body scanning procedure demonstrated the accumulation of the cells in the lungs which corresponded to those seen by microscopy. These findings suggest that labeling lymphocyte populations with MI may provide a rapid and practical means to quantify systemic cell distribution by PET.
