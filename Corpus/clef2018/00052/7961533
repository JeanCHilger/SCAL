Positron emission tomography studies of cerebral glucose metabolism in obsessive compulsive disorder. In the last 7 years, positron emission tomography (PET) scanning studies of obsessive compulsive disorder have given us new insights into misfunctionings of brain systems that may mediate the symptomatic expression of this classical "neurosis." Work by several PET groups indicates that a prefrontal cortex-basal ganglia-thalamic circuit may be the brain pathway leading to the broken record patterns of obsessions and compulsions.
