Cortical control of saccade in normal and schizophrenic subjects: a PET study using a task-evoked rCBF paradigm. In this study, positron emission tomography (PET) was used to evaluate cortical control of saccades. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) patterns demonstrated by 15O water PET during saccadic task performance were tested in 13 normal volunteers and 20 ICD-9 schizo phrenics (10 unmedicated and 10 medicated). The following 3 saccadic tasks, which were controlled for sensory input and oculomotor output, were applied: (1) reflexive saccade = visually guided saccade, (2) volitional saccade = visually guided saccade with distracting stimuli, and (3) memory guided saccade. Schizophrenics lacked the frontal eye field (FEF) activation during every saccadic task. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was activated during volitional saccade only in normal controls. The rCBF of posterior parietal cortex increased in parallel with that in the DLPFC. These findings suggest functional hypofrontality in schizophrenia and the left DLPFC-PPC's crucial role in saccade against distracting stimuli and its dysfunction in the disease.
