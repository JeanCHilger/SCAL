Significance of Tc-99m pyrophosphate accumulation in unstable angina: clinical characteristics and evidence for myocardial stunning. Tc-99m pyrophosphate (PYP) and Tl-201 simultaneous dual energy single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were performed for 33 patients with clinically diagnosed unstable angina. Twenty-two patients (76%) showed PYP accumulation in the myocardium (PYP+group). Clinical features, types of unstable angina, electrocardiographic changes during and after the anginal attack, and serial creatine kinase (CK) sampling data were reviewed and compared in the 2 groups. Selective coronary angiography was performed in all patients, and contrast left ventriculography was carried out in 29 patients both in unstable and stable states. In the study of left ventriculograms, the ejection fraction (EF) was calculated by the area-length method and the wall motion abnormality index was calculated by the centerline method. The PYP(+)group differed significantly from the PYP(-)group in several features as follows: 1) the "new angina at rest" type of unstable angina was more frequent in the PYP(+)group than in the PYP(-)group. The ratios of new angina at rest/effort angina (including new angina of effort and angina of effort with changing pattern) were 16/6 2/9 for the PYP(+) and (-)groups, respectively (p < 0.05). 2) ST elevation during the heart attack was seen more in the PYP(+)group. The ratios of ST elevation/ST depression were 13/22 (59%)
