Noninvasive detection of acute rejection in a new experimental model of heart transplantation. We have shown that positron emission scintigraphy detects changes in the uptake of 18-F 2-deoxyglucose and 13-N ammonia by the acutely rejecting myocardium in a nonworking model of heterotopic heart transplantation in the rat. We developed a new working model of heterotopic heart transplantation to determine the possible relevance of these changes to clinical transplantation. Moderate aortic valvular regurgitation was produced allowing the heterotopic left ventricle to fill and eject. Rejecting allografts and nonrejecting isografts (controls) were studied 4 days after transplantation. Histologically, isografts were normal and all allografts showed mild acute rejection. Decay-corrected uptakes of 18-F 2-deoxyglucose and 13-N ammonia reflect glucose metabolism and blood flow, respectively. Values are presented as percent of injected dose per gram of tissue. Uptake of 18-F 2-deoxyglucose was higher in rejecting allografts compared with nonrejecting isografts (3.0 +/- 1.8 versus 1.1 +/- 0.4 p = 0.024). Ammonia uptake was elevated in allografts compared with isografts (2.2 +/- 0.5 versus 1.3 +/- 0.5
