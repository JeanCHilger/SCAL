Effect of age and sex on the prevalence of intestinal parasitism in dogs. The effects of age, sex, and neutering on the prevalence of canine intestinal parasitism were evaluated by fecal examination of 1,468 pet dogs admitted to the University of Missouri Veterinary Teaching Hospital during 1975. Evidence of hookworm infection was encountered in 35.8% of the dogs examined, whipworms in 18.5%, ascarids in 17.9%, tapeworms in 5.2%, and coccidia in 4.5%. Evidence of intestinal parasitism was not detected in 653 (44.4%) dogs. Whipworm infections were detected less often in young dogs than in older ones, whereas ascarid and coccidial infections were more prevalent in pups that in mature dogs. In dogs more than 6 months old, hookworm infections were the most common parasitism. Tapeworm infections were diagnosed sporadically in all age groups. For most of these parasites, castrated males and spayed females had decreased prevalence of infection, compared with their respective intact counterparts. There were significant (P less than 0.05) differences in the prevalence of both ascarid and hookworm infections between intact and spayed female dogs. Also, there were significant (P less than 0.001) differences between age categories for all parasites observed. Overall, parasitism tended to decrease with age.
