Noninvasive monitoring of tumor metabolism using fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography in colorectal cancer liver metastases: correlation with tumor response to fluorouracil. To investigate and measure the metabolism of colorectal cancer liver metastases using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET), before and during the first month of chemotherapy. The findings were compared with tumor outcome conventionally assessed using changes in tumor size.Patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases were treated with fluorouracil (5FU) as a protracted venous infusion (300 mg/m2/d), with or without interferon-alpha 2b for two 10-week blocks separated by a 2-week break. Before and at 1 to 2 and 4 to 5 weeks on treatment, FDG PET scans were performed. Patients fasted, were injected intravenously with FDG (50 to 100 MBq), and scanned using a large-area positron camera the image data was processed such that regions of interest could be identified. The results were expressed as a ratio of FDG uptake in the tumor and normal liver (T:L) or as a semiquantitative standardized uptake value (SUV). These measures were compared with the tumor dimensions measured on a computed tomographic (CT) scan performed at 12 weeks from commencement of chemotherapy.Twenty patients were studied however, two did not have assessable liver metastases. Objective partial responses were observed in 11 of 18 patients. A total of 27 metastatic lesions were assessable. Pretreatment T:L ratios and SUVs did not correlate with tumor response, although response was associated with lower 1- to 2-week (1.84 v 2.17Positron emission tomography used to evaluate the uptake of FDG in tumors yields data that correlate with the antitumor effect of chemotherapy in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
