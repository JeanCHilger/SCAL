Hypometabolism in olfactory cortical projection areas of male patients with schizophrenia: an initial positron emission tomography study. Several studies have reported olfactory deficits in schizophrenic patients. This study examines local cerebral metabolic rate within two cortical areas in eight normal men and eight schizophrenic men. A significantly greater degree of hypometabolism was observed in the schizophrenic men in the cortical area of the nondominant hemisphere that receives direct uncrossed olfactory projections.
