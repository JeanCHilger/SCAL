Evaluation of sedation in quail induced by use of midazolam and reversed by use of flumazenil. To evaluate the sedative properties of 3 dosages of the benzodiazepine tranquilizer midazolam as a means of chemical restraint in quail (Colinus virginianus) and to evaluate the ability of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil to reverse the sedative effects of midazolam.Prospective randomized controlled trial.Study 1, 30 birds study 2, 10 birds.2 studies were performed. In the first study, 30 birds were randomly assigned to receive midazolam at a dosage of 2, 4, or 6 mg/kg of body weight (10 birds/dosage). Degree of sedation was evaluated by use of a numerical scale, and the peak time of adequate chemical restraint was determined. The dosage in study 1 that produced the highest degree of sedation was administered to 10 birds in study 2. Flumazenil was administered at a dosage of 0.1 mg/ kg at the peak time of sedation that had been determined in study 1.Administration of 6 mg of midazolam/kg induced the highest degree of chemical restraint without causing alterations in cardiopulmonary function. Peak time of sedation was 10 minutes after administration however, administration of 4 mg of midazolam/ kg also induced a high degree of sedation, but for a shorter period. Administration of flumazenil caused complete recovery from sedation induced with midazolam.Administration of midazolam to wild birds induced adequate sedation. Results of the study reported here may be extrapolated to other species of wild birds, including raptors and, possibly, pet birds.
