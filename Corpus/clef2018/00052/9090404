Single-photon emission CT findings in acute Japanese encephalitis. To determine the usefulness of single-photon emission CT (SPECT) in the diagnosis of acute Japanese encephalitis (JE).We examined 10 patients (six men and four women mean age, 69 years) with viral encephalitis. We divided the cases into two groups: the JE group (n = 4) and the non-JE group (n = 6In the acute stage, all patients in the JE group showed a marked increase of HMPAO uptake that matched the hyperintense area observed on MR images in the thalami and putamina bilaterally. Follow-up SPECT studies of two patients with JE revealed a decrease of HMPAO deposition in the areas of high uptake. None of the patients in the non-JE group had an increased accumulation of HMPAO in the thalami or the putamina.SPECT is helpful in differentiating JE from herpes simplex encephalitis and other types of encephalitis. SPECT may be useful as a diagnostic tool in the early stages of JE.
