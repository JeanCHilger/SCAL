Gallium-67 scanning for detection of alveolitis in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and sarcoidosis. To investigate 67Gallium scanning for the detection of alveolitis in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and sarcoidosis.67Ga scintigraphy was performed in 14 patients with IPF (age: mean +/- s = 58.3 +/- 10.3 years), 13 patients with sarcoidosis (age: mean +/- s = 46.9 +/- 9.0 years) and 11 controls (age: mean +/- s = 44.0 +/- 10.5 years).Lung/thigh ratio was respectively 3.18 +/- 0.07 in IPF, 3.12 +/- 0.94 in sarcoidosis and 2.11 +/- 0.26 in controls. IPF and sarcoidosis groups had a significantly higher lung/thigh ratio comparing with the control group (P < 0.05). Three patients received 67Ga scanning examination after corticosteroid therapy and the 67Ga uptake decreased.The 67Ga scintigraphy is useful in monitoring the activity and extent of alveolitis.
