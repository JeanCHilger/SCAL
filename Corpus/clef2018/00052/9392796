Visualization of frontal postural hypoperfusion in patients with Takayasu arteritis with upright 99Tcm-HMPAO brain SPET. Takayasu arteritis is a chronic inflammatory angiopathy involving the cerebral arteries. We performed upright and supine 99Tcm-HMPAO brain single photon emission tomography (SPET) to investigate the cerebral perfusion pattern in eight patients with Takayasu arteritis, and we compared the results with those acquired using 123I-IMP and acetazolamide in six patients. SPET images were evaluated visually and semi-quantitatively. Hypoperfusion was visually detected in all eight patients during the provocative upright test with 99Tcm-HMPAO, and in three of six tested using acetazolamide and 123I-IMP. Semiquantitative analysis revealed that the mean cortical-to-cerebellar ratio in the upright position was significantly changed compared to that in the supine position in the right frontal area (from 0.86 +/- 0.07 to 0.91 +/- 0.09 P < 0.05). Change was also seen in the left frontal area (from 0.85 +/- 0.08 to 0.91 +/- 0.08
