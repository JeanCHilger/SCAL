Imaging techniques in the analysis of brain function and behaviour. Techniques such as positron-emission tomography, single-photon-emission computed tomography, functional magnetic-resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography permit the observation of biological processes in the brain in a noninvasive manner. They have yielded new insights into the biological interrelations of sensory, motor and cognitive functions, as well as into brain diseases. Combined use of these techniques may provide more information than just the sum of its constituents, and this may narrow the gap between the biological data provided by these techniques and the mental models described by clinicians, mathematicians, psychologists and philosophers.
