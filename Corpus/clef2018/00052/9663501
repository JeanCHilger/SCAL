Noninvasive quantification of the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose using positron emission tomography, 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose, the Patlak method, and an image-derived input function. The authors developed and tested a method for the noninvasive quantification of the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRglc) using positron emission tomography (PET), 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose, the Patlak method, and an image-derived input function. Dynamic PET data acquired 12 to 48 seconds after rapid tracer injection were summed to identify carotid artery regions of interest (ROIs). The input function then was generated from the carotid artery ROIs. To correct spillover, the early summed image was superimposed over the last PET frame, a tissue ROI was drawn around the carotid arteries, and a tissue time activity curve (TAC) was generated. Three venous samples were drawn from the tracer injection site at a later time and used for the spillover and partial volume correction by non-negative least squares method. Twenty-six patient data sets were studied. It was found that the image-derived input function was comparable in shape and magnitude to the one obtained by arterial blood sampling. Moreover, no significant difference was found between CMRglc estimated by the Patlak method using either the arterial blood sampling data or the image-derived input function.
