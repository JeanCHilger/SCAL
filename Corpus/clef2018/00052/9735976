The 24-hour Tl-201 image in dual isotope myocardial perfusion scintigraphy: clinical utility and prognostic significance. This study assessed the effect on clinical decision making and the possible prognostic significance of the 24-hour Tl-201 image in patients undergoing Tl-201-MIBI dual-isotope myocardial scintigraphy. The records of all patients who underwent 24-hour Tl-201 imaging as part of their myocardial perfusion study from 1994 to 1996 were reviewed. Follow-up evaluations were obtained from the referring physician or by direct patient contact. Fifty-six patients underwent a total of 57 studies four patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 53 studies evaluated, 29 showed no change between the standard rest images and the 24-hour images
