123I]beta-CIT and SPECT in essential tremor and Parkinson's diseas. Resting and postural tremor may occur in essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of the present study was to investigate the cocaine derivative [123I]beta-CIT, which labels striatal dopamine transporters, and SPECT in differentiating these diseases.30 healthy volunteers, 32 patients with ET and 29 patients with idiopathic PD of Hoehn/Yahr stage I were investigated. Specific over nondisplaceable binding ratios (target/cerebellum-1) were calculated for the striatum, the caudate nucleus and the putamen separately as well as a ratio putamen/caudate and the percent deviation of each patient's ratio from age-expected control values.Striatal [123I]beta-CIT binding ratios in ET were within normal ranges and showed only a discrete elevation to age-expected control values (+14.6%). In PD significantly reduced specific binding was evident not only contralaterally to the clinically affected side (putamen: -62%, caudate nucleus: -35%), but also ipsilaterally (putamen: -45%, caudate nucleus: -22%). All investigated parameters differed significantly between PD and controls and ET respectively.Imaging striatal dopamine transporters with [123I]beta-CIT and SPECT could clearly distinguish between ET and PD in an early stage of the disease. Findings do not suggest a subclinical involvement of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons in ET.
