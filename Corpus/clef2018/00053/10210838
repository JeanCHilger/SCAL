PET study of striatal fluorodopa uptake and dopamine D2 receptor binding in a patient with juvenile parkinsonism. We studied pre-synaptic and post-synaptic function in the striatum of a patient with juvenile parkinsonism (JP) using positron emission tomography (PET). [18F]6-fluorodopa (18FDOPA), 11C-YM-09151-2 and [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (18FDG) were used to measure fluorodopa uptake, dopamine D2 receptor binding and glucose metabolism, respectively. In this patient, 18FDOPA accumulation was decreased markedly in the caudate nucleus and the putamen bilaterally. In the images of 11C-YM-09151-2 and 18FDG, in contrast, no conspicuous changes were observed in the striatum. Thus our PET studies using 18FDOPA, 11C-YM-09151-2 and 18FDG provide a useful approach for assisting the diagnosis of JP, because the present findings are different from the results in patients with dopa-responsive dystonia and hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation. Furthermore, our findings are of particular interest in relation to the pathogenesis of JP.Copyright Lippincott-Raven Publishers
