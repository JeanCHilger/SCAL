Dual-process model in semantic priming: A functional imaging perspective. In this positron emission tomography study, we investigated the neural correlates of semantic priming, where response to a word is facilitated when preceded by a semantically related word. Nine normal subjects were scanned while performing a lexical decision task. Within this condition, the proportion of related prime-target word pairs was varied across scans from 0 to 100%. The control task involved letter decision on consonant letter strings, controlling orthographic processing and response selection. First, lexical decision (relative to letter decision) activated regions previously observed in lexicosemantic tasks, i.e., the left anterior and inferior temporal lobe and left inferior frontal gyrus. Behavioral analysis confirmed significant facilitation of lexical decision to related targets (mean priming effect 68 ms). It also suggested the contribution of both automatic and strategic processes, consistent with theoretical accounts of priming. Automatic priming was indicated by consistent RTs to related targets irrespective of the proportion of related word pairs per scan. Strategic processing was indicated by decreases in RTs to nonwords as the proportion of related targets increased. Nonlinear correlational analysis of cerebral activity during lexical decision revealed a neurophysiological correlate of these behavioral effects in (i) the left anterior temporal lobe (BA 38), a region involved in lexicosemantic processing (ii) the anterior cingulate cortex, right premotor region (BA 6), and right superior parietal lobe (BA 7), regions associated with attentional processes. We conclude that in this experimental context, semantic priming involves both automatic and strategic processing.
