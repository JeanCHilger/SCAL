Language organization in patients with early and late left-hemisphere lesion: a PET study. Functional neuroimaging studies have shown enhanced right-hemisphere language activations in adults with left-hemisphere damage. We hypothesized that this effect would be stronger in patients with lesion occurring early in development. Using [15O]-water PET, we studied eight normal adults and 23 patients with unilateral left lesion during rest, listening to sentences, and sentence repetition. Thirteen patients had lesions with early onset (< 5 years) and ten had lesions with late onset (> 20 years). For listening to sentences, frontotemporal blood flow increases were significantly stronger in the left than in the right hemisphere in normal adults. This normal asymmetry was reduced in patients with late lesion and reversed in those with early lesion. For sentence repetition, analogous group differences were significant for the basal ganglia, but failed to reach significance for the (pre)motor and insular regions. We conclude that left lesion leads to alterations in the asymmetry of language activations (in and beyond the perisylvian areas). In addition, rightward shifts of language activation tend to be stronger as a consequence of early (as compared to late) lesion. Finally, postlesional reorganization appears to reflect a coexistence of 'additive' and 'subtractive' effects, i.e., activation in some regions that are not normally involved in language processing and lack of activation in other (undamaged) regions that are normally activated by language tasks.
