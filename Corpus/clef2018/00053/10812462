The role of F-18FDG PET in thyroid cancer. Hypofunctioning nodules on scintiscan using Tc-99m Pertechnetate or I-123 have a higher probability of malignancy compared to eu- or hyperfunctioning nodules. However, in the preoperative assessment of thyroid nodules, ultrasonography and ultrasonography guided fine needle aspiration biopsy play the most important role, especially for papillary thyroid cancer. The problem of differentiating follicular adenoma from highly differentiated follicular carcinoma however remains. Also the additional use of a multi tracer imaging strategy (Tl-201/Tc-99m subtraction scan, Tc-99m Sestamibi, Tc-99m Tetrofosmin dual phase scintigraphy) has not solved this problem. Although it is unlikely, the question whether FDG PET is able to give a better differentiation between benign and malignant tumours in the preoperative assessment of thyroid nodules is not answered up to now. In contrast to preoperative diagnostics, FDG PET is of great value in the postoperative follow up of differentiated thyroid cancer. In case of elevated serum thyroglobulin but negative I-131 WBS FDG PET is the method of choice to detect I-131 negative recurrences and metastases. FDG uptake in metastases from differentiated thyroid cancer is correlated to low differentiation and maybe bad prognosis. There is also evidence that FDG PET may have a role in the follow up of anaplastic and especially in medullary thyroid cancer in the future.
