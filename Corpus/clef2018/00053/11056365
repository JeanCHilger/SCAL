Radiotracer synthesis from [(11)C]-iodomethane: a remarkably simple captive solvent method. A new method of [(11)C]-methylation is described, which attains the goals of simplicity, high radiochemical yields, speed, versatility, and automation. A standard high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) injection loop on a standard HPLC injection valve is loaded with a solution (80 microL) of precursor (0.3-1.0 mg) in dimethyl formamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (+ base if required). At ambient temperature [(11)C]-iodomethane is passed through the loop for 3-4 min with >90% trapping of activity. After a further 1-5 min, the contents of the loop are quantitatively injected onto the HPLC column for purification. Radiochemical yields are equal to or superior to conventional solution methods in all cases, even though no heat is applied. [(11)C]-labeled radiotracers that have been prepared by this method for human or animal studies include Raclopride, N-methylspiperone, Ro 15-1788, FLB 457, RTI-32, Rolipram, SCH 23390, and SKF 82957. Since no vials, transfer lines, cooling, heating, or sealing valves are required, no transfer losses occur, yields are high, and cleanup is minimal, this "loop method" is ideal for most radiopharmaceuticals prepared from [(11)C]-iodomethane.
