Multidirectional approach to study peritoneal dialysis fluid biocompatibility in a chronic peritoneal dialysis model in the rat. Peritoneal dialysis causes the functional and morphological changes in the peritoneum that result from the bioincompatibility of dialysis solutions. We present a model of chronic peritoneal dialysis in the rat that can be used for testing the biocompatibility of dialysis fluids. Methods and Results. Long-term exposure of the peritoneum to dialysis solutions can be performed in rats with implanted peritoneal catheters. Sampling of the dialysate allows the evaluation of intraperitoneal inflammation by examining cell differential and dialysate cytokine levels. Peritoneal permeability can be evaluated at designed time intervals with the peritoneal equilibration test (PET). At the end of dialysis, peritoneal histology is studied with light and electron microscopy.Such a multidirectional approach is an effective way to test biocompatibility of dialysis solutions.
