Whole-body kinetics and dosimetry of cis-4-[(18)F]fluoro-L-proline. The whole-body distribution of 4-cis[(18)F]fluoro-L-proline (cis-FPro) was studied in six patients with urological tumors by PET. Based on the IMEDOSE and MIRDOSE procedures radiation absorbed doses were estimated from whole-body PET scans acquired at 1 and 3-5 h after i.v. injection of 400 MBq cis-FPro. Cis-FPro showed high retention in the renal cortex and a slight uptake in liver and pancreas. Urinary excretion ranged from 12 to 19% at 5 h p.i. Highest absorbed doses were found for the urinary bladder wall and the kidneys (44.1/44.0 microGy/mbq). The effective dose according to ICRP 60 was 15.1 microSv/mbq for adults. This leads to an effective dose of 6.0 mSv in a PET study using 400 MBq cis-FPro.
