Influence of anesthesia on brain distribution of [(11)C]methamphetamine in monkeys in positron emission tomography (PET) study. We investigated the influence of anesthesia on the brain distribution of [11C]methamphetamine (MAP) obtained by the positron emission tomography (PET) using the normal rhesus monkeys. We clarified that the brain uptake of [11C]MAP under halothane anesthesia was faster and higher than that under pentobarbital. The difference of the effect of anesthesia is an important problem in pharmacokinetic study in PET with experimental animals.
