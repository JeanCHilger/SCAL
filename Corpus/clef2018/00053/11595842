Focal pulmonary uptake during Tc-99m myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging. To evaluate the incidence and origin of abnormal focal pulmonary uptake during myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging (MSPECT).For evaluation of chest pain, 790 men and 581 women (mean age, 56 +/- 13 years) underwent MSPECT. All of them received adenosine for pharmacologic stress and Tc-99m tetrofosmin (TF, n = 817) or Tc-99m sestamibi (MIBI, n = 554) for myocardial perfusion imaging.Review of chest radiography with or without computed tomography revealed 111 (8.1%) focal pulmonary diseases. Among them, 38 (34.2%) showed focal pulmonary uptake (TF, 22 MIBI, 16)Although the incidence of abnormal pulmonary uptake during MSPECT was very low, the incidence of malignant lesions in the patients with nodular pulmonary uptake was relatively high.
