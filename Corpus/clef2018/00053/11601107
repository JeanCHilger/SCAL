Rabbit behavior. Rabbit behavior is complex and closely related to wild rabbit behavior. The rabbit as a prey species, the rabbit's environment and natural social structure, and the rabbit as an herbivore all play significant roles in rabbit behavior. Stress, especially the stress related to predation, crowding, heat, and inappropriate caging, may affect the behavior of the pet rabbit and its success as a medical or surgical patient. The veterinarian treating the pet rabbit will have a higher level of success if these stresses and the rabbit's behaviors and physiologic responses related to them are taken into consideration.
