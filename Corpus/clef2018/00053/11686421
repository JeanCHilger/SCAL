Distribution and removal of cat, dog and mite allergens on smooth surfaces in homes with and without pets. Removing allergen from the indoor environment should be a primary strategy for the management and treatment of allergic disease.The aims of this study were to characterize the distribution of dog, cat, and mite allergen on hard surfaces in homes with and without pets and to evaluate the efficiency of removing allergen from hard surfaces by wiping with a dry dust cloth and by vacuum cleaning using the dustbrush attachment.The amount of allergen collected from adjacent areas of two smooth floors, a wall, and finished furniture by wiping with a Pledge Grab-it dust cloth (S. C. Johnson & Son, Inc, Racine, WI) and by brush-vacuuming were compared for 24 homes with and without pets. In addition, the areas first wiped with the dust cloth were then brush-vacuumed and the amounts of allergen collected by the first and second cleaning were compared.A key finding was that 23 of the 24 homes had Can f 1 allergen on one or more of the sampled areas regardless of whether a dog was present. Most homes with pets and many homes without pets had Can f 1 and Fel d 1 allergens on walls, smooth floors, and finished furniture. Carpets were the major reservoir for pet allergens in homes with pets whereas allergen was more uniformly distributed in homes without pets. Little mite allergen was found on hard surfaces even when it was present in carpets.Dog and cat allergens are prevalent on walls, smooth floors, and finished furniture in homes with and without pets. Dry dusting with a Grab-it dust cloth was an effective cleaning method for removing allergen from hard smooth surfaces.
