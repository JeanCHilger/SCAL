Activation in the ipsilateral posterior parietal cortex during tool use: a PET study. The basis of perceptual assimilation of tool and hand has been considered to be in modification of body schemata, for which integration of multimodal sensory information about our body parts is required. Using positron emission tomography and H(2)(15)O, we aimed to identify brain regions that change their neural activity in association with changes in neural processing of visual and/or somatosensory information when humans use a simple tool. Normal subjects were instructed to manipulate a small graspable object with a pair of tongs or with the fingers of their right or left hand. The only site activated during manipulation with the tool, compared with the fingers, with the right hand was the lateral edge of the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS). During manipulation using the left hand with the tool, compared with using the fingers, an area in the middle part of the left IPS was activated. Areas in the contralateral hemisphere were activated during both the tool-use and the finger-use tasks compared to the control task, but there was no statistically significant difference between the tool-use and the finger-use tasks. Therefore, the results suggest that the ipsilateral posterior parietal cortex was recruited during the tool-use tasks to integrate visuosomatosensory information.
