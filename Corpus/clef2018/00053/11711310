125/123I] 5-Iodo-3-pyridyl ethers. syntheses and binding to neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Three 3-pyridyl ether nicotinic ligands-(S)-5-Iodo-3-[(2-pyrrolidinyl)-methoxy]pyridine (5-iodo-A-85865), (S)-5-Iodo-3-[1-(methyl)-2-pyrrolidinyl-methoxy]pyridine (5-Iodo-A-84543), and (S)-5-iodo-3-[1-methyl-(2-azetidinyl)-methoxy]pyridine (5-iodo-N-Me-A-85380) were labeled with I-125/I-123, and their ability to label high-affinity brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) was evaluated. The most promising ligand, [123/125I] 5-iodo-A-85865, showed approximately 65% inhibition of radioactivity uptake in thalamus in mice pretreated with cytisine. Preliminary SPECT imaging studies with [123I] 5-iodo-A-85865 revealed a distribution profile consistent with nAChRs (thalamus > frontal cortex > cerebellum) and a more rapid pharmacokinetic profile relative to azetidinyl 3-pyridyl ether based ligands.
