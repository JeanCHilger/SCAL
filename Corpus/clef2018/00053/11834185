Asthma and allergy in Turkish university students: Two cross-sectional surveys 5 years apart. prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases is increasing worldwide. We investigated the first-year university students to a) determine prevalence of asthma, and allergic diseases, b) compare prevalence with a similar study conducted in 1994, and c) investigate determinants of asthma, current wheeze and seasonal rhinitis.an ECRHS based questionnaire was distributed to 5,406 students and completed by 4,639 (response: 85.3 %) in september 1999. Information from the students residing in Turkey was used in the analyses (1,800 boys, 2,712 girls).prevalence % of asthma (symptom and/or medicine), current wheeze and seasonal rhinitis were 2.1, 6.9 and 12.7 in boys, and 2.5, 7.2 and 14.5 in girls. Current smoking, pet ownership and family atopy was reported more frecuently in 1999 than 1994. Cough and seasonal rhinitis increased almost twofold. Asthma diagnosis and attack rate was similar in 1999 and 1994. Family atopy, pet in childhood, smoking and passive smoking in childhood increased the risk of asthma, and current wheeze. Family atopy, passive smoking and current pet ownership increased the risk of seasonal rhinitis.increased rate of smoking and pet ownership could contribute to the increased prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases in the last 5 years.
