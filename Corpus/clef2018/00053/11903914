Pharmacological modulation of human gastric volumes demonstrated noninvasively using SPECT imaging. Three-dimensional single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging allows noninvasive measurement of human postprandial gastric accommodation. The aim of this study was to determine whether 99mTCO4-SPECT demonstrates effects on pre- and postprandial gastric volumes of intravenous (i.v.) erythromycin lactobionate and sublingual isosorbide dinitrate, as predicted from previous literature. Twenty volunteers received no medication (controls), while 12 were randomized to either i.v. erythromycin 2 mg kg-1 over 20 min, or 10 mg sublingual isosorbide. After a 10-min preprandial SPECT measurement, a standard 300-mL, 300-kcal liquid meal was ingested, followed by a 20-min postprandial measurement. Gastric images were reconstructed from transaxial images and total volume was measured using the Analyseeth software system. Fasting gastric volume was greater with isosorbide [223 +/- 14 (SE) mL vs. 174 +/- 9 mL, control P < 0.05], and postprandial volume was lower with erythromycin [393 +/- 27 mL vs. 582 +/- 17 mL, control
