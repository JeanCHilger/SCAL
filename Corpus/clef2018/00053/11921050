Verbal memory in left temporal lobe epilepsy: evidence for task-related localization. We explored the hypothesis that components of verbal memory are subserved by separate temporal lobe structures in patients with temporal lobe structures in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy [correction]. Uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) measured by positron emission tomography, hippocampal volume, and memory for arbitrarily and semantically related verbal paired associates were examined in 27 patients with left temporary lobe epilepsy. Scores from memory tests performed outside the scanner were regressed against normalized resting FDG uptake at each voxel. Significant regression was seen in the left perirhinal cortex (Talaraich coordinates x, y, z: -29, 10, -34 p < 0.05) for arbitrarily related word pairs. For semantically related paired associates, significant regression was present in the left inferior temporal gyrus (x, y, z: -48, -18, -24
