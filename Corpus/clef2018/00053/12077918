Positron emission tomography in the investigation of malignant testicular tumors. Thirty-three [18F]-FDG and ten [11C]-methionine (altogether 43) PET studies were performed in 37 (24 non-seminoma and 13 seminoma) patients. All results were assessed on the basis of histology (or cytology) or clinical follow-up. PET scan identified metastatic disease in 13 cases while 30 investigations resulted in a negative medical report. There were 3 false-positive cases and no false-negative results were obtained. The false-positive results were likely to occur due to FDG accumulation in benign lesions. There were no false-positive findings with the use of [11C]-methionine. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 100%, 91% and 93%, respectively, using both tracers.
