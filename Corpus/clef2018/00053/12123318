Myocardial contrast echocardiography for predicting functional recovery after acute myocardial infarction. Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) is a promising diagnostic tool for detecting microvascular integrity. The aim of the study was to investigate the comparative specificity and sensitivity of intravenous MCE, technetium-99m Sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and dipyridamole-dobutamine (DIDO) stress echocardiography for predicting functional recovery after coronary revascularization in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).In a prospective, observational study, 17 consecutive patients short after AMI who received successful treatment with primary percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA) plus stent-implantation were examined with DIDO (dipyridamole with 0.28 mg/kg over 4 min plus dobutamine up to 10 mcg/kg/min), MCE (10 ml 4 g, 400 mg/ml Levovist intravenously second harmonic power imaging) within 12-24 h and resting perfusion SPECT within 48-72 h after PTCA. Functional recovery of regional contractile function after 6-month follow-up was the gold standard to assess viability.The rate of agreement between SPECT and MCE was 69% and between SPECT and a positive response to stress echo was 76% for combined DIDO. MCE showed a higher sensitivity (96%) in the identification of viability than SPECT (77%) and combined DIDO alone (79%). Specificity was lower for viability recognition with MCE (58%) compared with SPECT (93%) and DIDO (87%).The wall motion response during DIDO echocardiography is useful in the prediction of recovery of regional and global ventricular function after revascularization in patients after AMI. Combined intravenous MCE and DIDO is more accurate in the diagnosis of stunned myocardium than Tc-99m-MIBI SPECT alone.
