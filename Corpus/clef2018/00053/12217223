Equine-facilitated group psychotherapy: applications for therapeutic vaulting. In this day of high-tech, managed-care service delivery with an emphasis on medication and brief treatment, it is important for nurses to be aware of nontraditional treatment options that may be uniquely beneficial for some clients. Although it may still be considered a novelty, including animals in the healing milieu is not a new idea. Florence Nightingale herself suggested that "a small pet animal is often an excellent companion for the sick, for long chronic cases especially" (Nightingale, 1969, p. 102). Healing, according to one recent nursing article, can be seen as "a gradual awakening to a deeper sense of the self (and of the self in relation to others) in a way that effects profound change" (Dorsey & Dorsey, 1998, p. 36). Equine-facilitated psychotherapy, while not a new idea, is a little-known experiential intervention that offers the opportunity to achieve this type of awakening. In this article, the reader is introduced to equine-facilitated psychotherapy's theoretical underpinnings, techniques, and outcomes as illustrated by actual clinical vignettes and research findings.
