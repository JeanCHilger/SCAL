High-transport membrane is a risk factor for encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis developing after long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis treatment. Increased peritoneal function has been suggested to be a risk factor for developing encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) however, clinical evidence is scarce. The present study aimed to clarify the specific character of peritoneal function in patients who developed EPS after withdrawal from peritoneal dialysis (PD). We studied 12 patients who developed EPS after PD withdrawal [(EPS group) mean PD duration: 109 months
