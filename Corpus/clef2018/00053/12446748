Interpretation and reporting of myocardial perfusion SPECT: a summary for technologists. Interpretation of cardiac perfusion SPECT images, and the subsequent reporting of results to referring physicians, are sometimes taken to be outside the sphere of the nuclear medicine technologist. However, all personnel involved with nuclear medicine procedures contribute to the timeliness and usefulness of the final report. The goal of this article is to review the principles of scan interpretation and reporting, from the standpoint of what technologists need to understand about these processes. In addition, software tools to aid these processes will be discussed, including quantitative image analysis, telemedicine, computer-aided scan interpretation, databases, computer-aided reporting, and Internet-based reporting. Finally, the accuracy of the scan report will be related to the tasks normally performed by technologists, such as the acquisition and processing of images and the entry, transfer, and networking of data. After reading this article, the reader will be able to describe the principles of scan interpretation and reporting, the software tools for telemedicine and computer-aided interpretation, and the role of the technologist in this process.
