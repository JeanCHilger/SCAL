Cortical activation associated with the experience of auditory hallucinations and perception of human speech in schizophrenia: a PET correlation study. A [H(2)(15)O] PET correlation analysis technique was employed to correlate brain activations associated with self-reports of auditory hallucinations in hallucinating patients (n=8) and perception of transient, random human speech in non-hallucinating (n=7) patients and normal control subjects (n=8). Perception of externally generated human speech amongst the non-hallucinating and normal control participants was associated with a consistent pattern of extensive bilateral auditory cortex activation (Brodmann areas 40/41/42/22). Hallucinating participants demonstrated a network of cortical activations including bilateral auditory cortex, left limbic regions, right medial frontal and right prefrontal regions. The observed pattern of activation is consistent with models of auditory hallucinations as mis-remembered episodic memories of speech.
