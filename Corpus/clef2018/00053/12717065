The reproducibility of independently measuring human regional hepatic arterial, portal and total hepatic blood flow using [15O]water and positron emission tomography. The reproducibility of repeated human regional hepatic blood flow quantification using [15O]water and positron emission tomography (PET) was evaluated as a method of monitoring the effect of drug administration on hepatic blood flow. Nineteen patients underwent two measurements of hepatic blood flow by PET. Fifteen minutes after the first dynamic study using [15O]water, a second dynamic study was performed, and hepatic blood flow was calculated. The correlation between the first and second dynamic study of arterial blood flow was highly significant (P=6.31 x 10(-10), r=0.946). The regression line was y=1.08x. The mean error between studies was 0.158. The correlation between the first and second dynamic study of portal blood flow also was significant (P=1.29 x 10(-7), r=0.897). The regression line was y=1.03x. The mean error between the studies was 0.164. The correlation between total hepatic blood flow in the first and second dynamic study, too, was significant (P=2.68 x 10(-7), r=0.888). The regression line was defined by y=1.06x. The mean error between studies was 0.140. Hepatic blood flow has increased if the second measurement of hepatic arterial, portal, and total blood flow is more than 115%, 111% and 114% of baseline, and has decreased if the second measurement is less than 101%, 95% and 98% of the first measurement.
