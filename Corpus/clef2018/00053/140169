Interactions between segmented polyurethane surfaces and the plasma protein fibrinogen. Surfaces of a segmented polyurethane were varied by casting on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and glass substrates, and were characterized through infrared-attenuated total-reflection spectroscopy (ATR). Surfaces cast on glass substrates showed a higher content of polyether segments, whereas those cast on PET contained a higher relative concentration of aromatic segments. Adsorption, and possible conformational changes of fibrinogen, were found to be more substantial on polymer surfaces having a higher content of polyether segments. It is concluded that the relatively good blood compatibility of segmented polyurethanes is partly due to the presence of peptide-like bonds on aromatic segments.
