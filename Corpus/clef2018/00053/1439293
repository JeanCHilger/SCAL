Clinical value of PMN elastase activity before reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction: comparison with clinical characteristics, reperfusion events and myocardial damage. Many recent studies demonstrate that neutrophils may be involved in the genesis and propagation of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury. Clinical value of PMN elastase activity before reperfusion which is released from activated polymorphonuclear leucocyte were evaluated in 30 patients with acute myocardial infarction. 19 patients with normal or moderately elevated PMN elastase activity (G1: less than 200 micrograms/l) revealed similar clinical characteristics before reperfusion therapy, compared to 11 patients with extremely high PMN elastase activity (Group 1: greater than or equal to 200 micrograms/l). But Group 1 represented fewer incidence of reperfusion events (Group 1 2/19, Group 2 7/11, p less than 0.01) such as arrhythmia, BP down, re-elevation of ST segments, and increased chest pain just after reperfusion, and higher incidence of salvaged myocardium in the risk area (Group 1 5/11, Group 2 4/19 p less than 0.1) evaluated by Tc-99m PYP, T1-201 dual SPECT, than Group 2. Wall motion analysis also showed that both global and regional wall motion were severely depressed in Group 2 compared with Group 1 (Group 1: Global EF 66.6 +/- 13.5, Extent 26.5 +/- 17.4, Severity 63.1 +/- 48.5, Group 2: Global EF 51.2 +/- 10.6, Extent 40.1 +/- 16.3, Severity 112.8 +/- 55.5, p less than 0.01 for Global EF, Extent, and p less than 0.05 for Severity). These data suggest that leucocyte activation before reperfusion may play important role in the genesis of reperfusion injury.
