Quantitative assessment of myocardial ischemia by electrocardiographic and scintigraphic imaging. We calculated distributions of epicardial potentials from body-surface electrocardiograms (ECGs) recorded during controlled myocardial ischemia and compared them with scintigraphic estimates of ischemia's extent/severity. The study population consisted of patients suffering from single-vessel coronary artery disease, referred for elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of either the left anterior descending (n=7), the right coronary (n=9), or the left circumflex (n=2) artery. After the target vessel had been dilated, a 1960s "study" inflation was performed with a non-perfusion-type balloon catheter at its commencement, technetium-99m sestamibi was injected via a femoral-vein catheter, and ECGs were recorded throughout the inflation from 120 leads. Single photon emission computed tomographic imaging was performed one hour after the injection of radionuclide to obtain an "occlusion image", and again one hour after a repeat injection 24 hours later to obtain a "control image"
