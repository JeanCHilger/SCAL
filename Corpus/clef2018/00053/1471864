Decrease of D2 receptors indicated by 123I-iodobenzamide single-photon emission computed tomography relates to neurological deficit in treated Wilson's disease. Single-photon emission computed tomography with 123I-iodobenzamide, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, was employed to study dopamine D2 receptor densities in 17 patients with biochemically proved Wilson's disease and stable neurological status with therapy and in 5 age-matched control subjects. Of the 17 patients with Wilson's disease, 5 were neurologically asymptomatic, 3 had cerebellar signs, 1 exhibited a mild parkinsonian syndrome, 7 showed a parkinsonian syndrome and cerebellar signs, and 1 had generalized dystonia and a parkinsonian syndrome. In 5 age-matched control subjects specific isotope binding as calculated by the basal ganglia to frontal cortex ratio was 1.57 +/- 0.04 (mean +/- standard deviation). The ratio in patients with Wilson's disease ranged from 1.56 +/- 0.05 (n = 5, asymptomatic patients) to 1.17 +/- 0.02 (n = 4, marked neurological impairment). We observed an almost linear correlation between the reduction of 123I-iodobenzamide (IBZM) binding and the severity of neurological signs at the time of IBZM-SPECT (correlation coefficient, -0.84 p < 0.01). We suggest that the reduction of postsynaptic striatal dopamine D2 receptors as detected by IBZM-SPECT reflects striatal neuronal damage in Wilson's disease.
