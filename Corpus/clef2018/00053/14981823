The value of serum endothelin for differential diagnosis of the decreased cerebral blood flow perfusion foci of epilepsy patients. To observe the level of serum endothelin (ET) of interictal epilepsy patients with regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) decreased foci in SPECT brain perfusion imaging and to investigate its value for diagnosis and differential diagnosis of epilepsy.Seventy-six interictal epilepsy patients were enrolled and SPECT brain perfusion imaging, EEG, X-CT or MRI were performed, with 25 healthy volunteers as controls whose serum ET levels were measured by radioimmunoassay.The serum ET levels of 49 idiopathic epilepsy patients were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than that of healthy controls. The ET levels of 21 symptomatic epilepsy patients were not significantly different from that of the healthy controls (P > 0.05). The ET levels of 6 non-epilepsy patients were significantly higher than that of the healthy controls (P < 0.05).The level of serum ET is of value to the differential diagnosis for interictal epilepsy cases, and can contribute to the qualitative diagnosis of idiopathic epilepsy.
