Sensitivity and specificity of 99mTc-TRODAT-1 SPECT imaging in differentiating patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease from healthy subjects. The imaging of dopamine transporter (DAT) with (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 ([2-[[2-[[[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3,2,1]oct-2-yl]methyl](2-mercaptoethyl)amino]ethyl]amino]ethanethiolato(3-)-N2,N2',S2,S2']oxo-[1R-(exo-exo)]-(99m)Tc-technetium) and SPECT has been recently proposed to be a valuable and feasible means of assessment of the integrity of dopamine neurons. The purpose of this study was to further investigate the clinical correlations and the age-specific sensitivity and specificity of this new approach in the diagnosis of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) that manifests in patients >50 y of age.SPECT imaging with (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 was conducted in 78 consecutive PD patients and in 40 age-matched healthy subjects. The images were obtained 4 h after the intravenous injection of the tracer. The ratios of specific striatal binding to nonspecific occipital binding were calculated. S/O represents the ratio for whole striatal binding, whereas P/O and C/O represent the putamen and caudate nucleus, respectively. Statistical analyses of the sensitivity and specificity of these ratios in different age-specific subgroups were performed. The correlations between these ratios and clinical assessments were also analyzed. The age-related declines in the striatal binding in both patients and controls were given particular focus.The S/O, C/O, and P/O ratios decreased significantly both contralaterally and ipsilaterally to the dominant symptomatic side in the PD group (P < 0.0001). The mean reduction of binding was found in the order of putamen (contralateral side, -81% ipsilateral side, -67%) and caudate nucleus (contralateral side, -46%We have demonstrated that (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 SPECT has a high sensitivity and specificity for measuring the decrement of DAT in PD patients. In addition to its wide availability, we suggest that this new approach may serve as a diagnostic marker for PD.
