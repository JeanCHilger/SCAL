The Ets transcription factor Fev is specifically expressed in the human central serotonergic neurons. In the mouse and the rat brain, the Ets transcription factor pet-1 is exclusively expressed in the central serotonin (5-hydroxytryptaminergic: 5-HT) system. In pet-1 null mice, the defect of this factor induces early disruption of the 5-HT function, resulting in an increase in anxiety and aggression thus indicating its pivotal role in this system. Here, we studied the expression of fev, the homologue of pet-1, in the human brain. We showed that this transcription factor is exclusively expressed in the midline part of the human brainstem containing raphe nuclei, which also specifically expressed 5-HT transporter (sert) and tryptophan hydroxylase (tph), two markers of the 5-HT neurotransmitter system. This clearly suggests that fev is expressed in human serotonergic neurons. While the deficiency of the central serotonergic signaling is a major factor involved in the development of some psychiatric disorders, Fev could be a good diagnosis marker as well as a good target for pharmacological treatments of these patients.
