Reverse redistribution on Tl-201 SPECT images after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction: possible mechanism and prognostic implications. So-called reverse redistribution on stress Tl-201 imaging has been reported previously, but its significance and clinical implications are not well understood. In patients who received reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction, we frequently observed reverse redistribution on stress Tl-201 images. To investigate the significance of reverse redistribution, 61 patients who underwent reperfusion within 4 h of the onset of chest pain underwent submaximal exercise Tl-201 imaging 3 weeks later. We performed simultaneous coronary arteriography and left ventriculography. We divided these 61 patients into three groups based on the pattern of Tl-201 images. Reverse redistribution was found in 19 patients (Group A), 12 patients had redistribution (Group B), and 30 patients had nonreversible defects (Group C). All patients in Group A had less residual stenosis than those in the other groups, and showed significant improvement of left ventricular function. Furthermore, 12 patients (Group A) demonstrated reverse redistribution or a normal pattern in a follow-up study performed 12 months later. However, in the delayed images the defect was smaller than that shown in the previous study. None of the patients had any symptoms and all returned to their previous occupations. In conclusion, reverse redistribution was common in patients undergoing reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction, especially those with little residual stenosis. Reverse redistribution appears to indicate improved regional wall function in such patients.
