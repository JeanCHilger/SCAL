Systemic inhibition of nitric oxide synthase unmasks neural constraint of maximal myocardial blood flow in humans. Nitric oxide (NO) is an endothelial mediator that regulates vascular smooth muscle tone, but it may exert its cardiovascular action also by modulating the autonomic control of vasomotor tone. We assessed the effect of simultaneous inhibition of both endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal (nNOS) NO synthase isoforms on myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR) in volunteers and in (denervated) transplant recipients.MBF (mL x min(-1) x g(-1)) was measured at rest and during adenosine-induced hyperemia with positron emission tomography and 15O-labeled water. CFR was calculated as adenosine/resting MBF. Measurements were repeated during one of the following intravenous infusions: group 1 (n=12), saline group 2 (n=9), 3 mg/kg N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), which crosses the blood-brain barrier and inhibits both eNOS and nNOSThe results of the present study suggest that maximal adenosine-induced hyperemia and CFR in humans are constrained by neurally mediated vasoconstriction, which can be relieved by systemic NOS inhibition with L-NMMA.
