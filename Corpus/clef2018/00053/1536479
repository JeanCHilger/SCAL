Immunoscintigraphy of infections using 123I and 99mTc-labeled monoclonal antibodies. Advanced experiences in 230 patients. Advanced experiences show an extremely high diagnostic potential in immunoscintigraphy of infections using monoclonal antigranulocytes antibodies (Mab). There was no hampering of the biological properties of the granulocytes after in vivo labeling with 123I or 99mTc-tagged Mabs. There were mostly identical findings and an equal functional behavior of the granulocytes observed with the use of different agents. Diagnosis of infections was made mostly within four to six hours p.i. 99mTc labeling is more advantageous than 123I because of better image quality, constant availability, and lower costs. 123I Mab 47 seems to be recommended in some cases of chronic osteomyelitis and spondylitis. No relevant antigenicity was observed in follow-up studies of testing HAMA serum levels. Only a few short-time reactions were seen after repeated administration of 99mTc Mab. There were no side effects and no allergic or adverse reactions. Despite these methodical advantages of the immunoscintigraphic detection of infectious and inflammatory lesions, this method should be further restricted to severe cases or patients in whom other methods would not be practicable or have failed. HAMA controls are continued in all our patients undergoing immunoscintigraphy.
