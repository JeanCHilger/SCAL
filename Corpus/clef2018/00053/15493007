2-deoxy-fluorglucose-positron emission tomography imaging of the brain: current clinical applications with emphasis on the dementias. A number of very significant advances in the field of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging are now beginning to have an impact on clinical PET brain imaging. Among the most significant advances are further improvements in PET scanner detectors and computers. Increasingly, more sophisticated methods of image analysis and quantitation are also beginning to emerge. In addition, there has been a very rapid introduction of newer PET radiotracers that will ultimately work their way into the clinical environment. Finally, there is an expanding interest in the potential of PET brain imaging in the evaluation of a wide variety of clinical neuropsychiatric conditions.
