Using imaging biomarkers to accelerate drug development and clinical trials. There is increasing evidence that human medical imaging can help answer key questions that arise during the drug development process. Imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and positron emission tomography can offer significant insights into the bioactivity, pharmacokinetics and dosing of drugs, in addition to supporting registration applications. In this review, examples from oncology, neurology, psychiatry, infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases are used to illustrate the role imaging can play. We conclude with some remarks concerning new developments that will be required to significantly advance the field of pharmaco-imaging.
