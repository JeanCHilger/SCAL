Migration of a UV stabilizer from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into food simulants. The migration characteristics of the UV stabilizer Tinuvin 234 (2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-bis (1-methyl-1-phenylethyl)phenol) into food simulants has been measured from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) using HPLC with UV detection. Ethanol/ water, isooctane and a fractionated coconut oil simulant (Miglyol) were used as food simulating solvents. The migration characteristics were measured at temperatures in the range of 40-70 degrees C. Diffusion coefficients were determined to be in the range of 1 x 10(-14) cm2 s(-1) to 1 x 10(-18) cm2 s(-1). At 40 degrees C, the amount of migration into 95% ethanol after 10 days was 2 microg dm(-2). Isooctane is determined to be a good fatty food simulant that provides similar results for PET to those of fatty foods.
