Voxel-wise analysis of [123I]beta-CIT SPECT differentiates the Parkinson variant of multiple system atrophy from idiopathic Parkinson's disease. To investigate the cerebral dopamine transporter status in the early stages of the parkinson-variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P), 15 patients with MSA-P and a disease duration up to 3 years were studied with [123I]beta-CIT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Data were compared with 13 age-matched healthy control subjects and 15 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), matched for age and disease duration. Parametric SPECT images of the specific-to-nondisplaceable equilibrium partition coefficient (V3''), which is proportional to the receptor density (Bmax) have been generated. To objectively localize focal changes in dopaminergic function throughout the entire brain volume without having to make an a priori hypothesis as to their location, statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was applied to our [123I]beta-CIT SPECT study. Both MSA-P and IPD patients showed significant decreases in striatal [123I]beta-CIT SPECT uptake. However, in MSA-P patients an additional reduction in midbrain [123I]beta-CIT signal was localized with SPM compared with control subjects (MSA-P, V3'': 0.89 +/- 0.37 versus controls V3'': 1.81 +/- 0.38 P < 0.001) and patients with IPD (V3'': 1.84 +/- 0.26
