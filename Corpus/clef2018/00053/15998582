Comparison of voxel-based 3-D MRI analysis and subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI in focal epilepsy. While voxel-based 3-D MRI analysis methods as well as assessment of subtracted ictal versus interictal perfusion studies (SISCOM) have proven their potential in the detection of lesions in focal epilepsy, a combined approach has not yet been reported. The present study investigates if individual automated voxel-based 3-D MRI analyses combined with SISCOM studies contribute to an enhanced detection of mesiotemporal epileptogenic foci. Seven consecutive patients with refractory complex partial epilepsy were prospectively evaluated by SISCOM and voxel-based 3-D MRI analysis. The functional perfusion maps and voxel-based statistical maps were coregistered in 3-D space. In five patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the area of ictal hyperperfusion and corresponding structural abnormalities detected by 3-D MRI analysis were identified within the same temporal lobe. In two patients, additional structural and functional abnormalities were detected beyond the mesial temporal lobe. Five patients with TLE underwent epileptic surgery with favourable postoperative outcome (Engel class Ia and Ib) after 3-5 years of follow-up, while two patients remained on conservative treatment. In summary, multimodal assessment of structural abnormalities by voxel-based analysis and SISCOM may contribute to advanced observer-independent preoperative assessment of seizure origin.
