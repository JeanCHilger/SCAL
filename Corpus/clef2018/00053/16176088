Plasmid construction, expression, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of recombinant protein candidate vaccine of respiratory syncytial virus. To construct plasmid of recombinant protein candidate vaccine of respiratory syncytial virus, express it in E. coli, and to investigate its immunogenicity and protective efficacy. A CD8+ T cell epitope from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) M2 protein F/M2:81 - 95 and the G:125-225 (G1) gene fragments from RSV-G protein containing B cell epitopes were amplified by PCR method and then inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-DsbA after bonding to a linker. The fusion protein DsbA-G1-Linker-F/M2:81-95 (D-G1LF/M2) was expressed successfully in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The product was proved to be RSV-specific by Western-blot. After purified by affinity chromatography on Ni+ Sepharose and renatured by gradient dialysis. D-G1LF/M2 was used to immune BALB/c mice. D-G1LF/M2 induced high anti-D-G1LF/M2 IgG, anti-RSV IgG and neutralizing antibody titers in serum and lung of BALB/c mice, and elicied RSV-specific CTL responses. The IgG subclass distribution revealed that IgG1/IgG2a ratio was 2.66. Viral titration indicated that D-G1LF/M2 could protect BALB/c mice against RSV challenge in lung.
