Comparisons of the peritoneal equilibration test and ultrafiltration in patients with and without diabetes mellitus on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. To compare dialysance and ultrafiltration (UF) of peritoneum in diabetes mellitus (DM) and non-DM patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.A total of 162 adult patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (40 DM and 122 non-DM patients) were studied with the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) using 2.5% glucose dialysis solution retained for 4 h. Patients using 2,000 or 1,500 ml of infusion volume were classified into groups A (23 DM and 63 non-DM patients) and B (16 DM and 41 non-DM patients), respectively. PET results were compared between DM and non-DM patients by unpaired t test. Using Pearson's correlation and least-square multiple regression, the most powerful predictors of UF rate were also evaluated in DM and non-DM patients.There were no differences between PET parameters and UF rate between DM and non-DM patients in the whole group (WG) and group A. The only significant difference (p < 0.05) was an increased D4/D0 value in DM patients in group B. The most simple but powerful method to predict UF rate was (100 - GAP)/(D4/D0), where GAP corresponds to the glucose absorption percentage and D4/D0 is the PET 4-hour dialysate glucose level/PET 0-hour dialysate glucose level. GAP and D4/D0 were two major determinants of UF rate in the DM group, non-DM group and WG.Peritoneal permeability did not differ between DM and non-DM patients, and GAP and D4/D0 were two major factors predicting UF rate.
