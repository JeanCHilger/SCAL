Synthesis and evaluation of 4-[(18)F]fluorothalidomide for the in vivo studies of angiogenesis. In this study, we prepared 2-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)-4-[(18)F]fluoroisoindole-1,3-dione (4-[(18)F]fluorothalidomide [(18)F]1) for the in vivo studies of angiogenesis. Radiochemical synthesis of [(18)F]1 was carried out by labeling 4-trimethylammoniumthalidomide trifluoromethanesulfonate with nBu(4)N[(18)F]F in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), followed by reverse-phase HPLC purification. Decay-corrected radiochemical yield of [(18)F]1 was 50-60%, with an effective specific activity of 42-120 GBq/micromol (end of synthesis).
