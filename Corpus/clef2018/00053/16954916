Association, commissural, and projection pathways and their functional deficit reported in literature. This study demonstrates normal white matter structures of the supratentorial system revealed by diffusion tensor imaging. Their anatomic connections and functional significance are discussed in the context of the lesion-induced deficits reported in the literature, which may not fully represent the lesion-induced effects on the white matter function and may not be entirely specific to the tract discussed. Nevertheless, understanding the most common effects of lesions on the functional connectivity provides a framework that we can use in advanced neuroimaging studies, like diffusion tensor imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography, and in our daily clinical practice.
