Correlation of PET/CT standardized uptake value measurements between dedicated workstations and a PACS-integrated workstation system. This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical utility of a Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) analysis module of a picture archiving communication system (PACS) workstation in comparison to a dedicated PET/CT interpretation workstation.The study included 32 consecutive patients referred for an [(18)F] Fluro-2-Deoxy-D: -Glucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT at our institution. Images were reviewed at dedicated PET/CT and at PACS-integrated workstations. Mean standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated for the liver and the lung. Maximum SUVs were recorded for the bladder and an index lesion with the highest FDG uptake. The time spent for SUV measurements was recorded. Correlation of the SUV measurements was calculated with the Pearson coefficient.Pearson coefficients between the workstations ranged from 0.96 to 0.99 for bladder and lesion maximum SUVs. For liver and lung average SUVs, the coefficients varied from 0.53 to 0.98. The mean time spent to perform the four SUV measurements was 122.6 s for the dedicated workstations and 134.6 s for the PACS-integrated system.The correlation of SUV measurements between dedicated PET/CT and PACS-integrated workstations is very good, especially for maximum SUVs. For routine reading of PET/CT scans, a PACS workstation with a PET/CT analysis module offers an excellent alternative to the use of a dedicated PET/CT workstation.
