Rabbit allergens: a significant risk for allergic sensitization in subjects without occupational exposure. Although rabbits are becoming popular as pets, data about the characteristics of allergic sensitization to rabbit allergens in patients without professional exposure are scarce.To determine the characteristics of allergic sensitization to pet rabbits, and the role of direct and indirect exposure to rabbits and rabbit allergens in non-professionally exposed patients.From among 1124 consecutive outpatients, we selected all subjects with an immediate skin reaction to rabbit dander. A clinical history including a careful evaluation of the modality of rabbit exposure, the results of skin-prick tests (SPTs) and total/specific IgE antibodies were recorded. The prevalence of rabbit ownership in the Naples area was also calculated.Among 753 SPT-positive patients, 20 (2.65%) were sensitized to rabbit dander (5 patients were mono-sensitized). Fifteen patients reported direct rabbit contact (7 were rabbit owners and 8 had occasional contact outside the home) 3 patients had indirect exposure through contact with rabbit owners and 2 patients denied any direct or indirect exposure. Rabbit mono-sensitized owners of pet rabbits had persistent (moderate-severe) symptoms. The prevalence of rabbit ownership is 1.56%.In susceptible not professionally exposed individuals, direct rabbit contact and, in some cases, indirect or no apparent exposure, may induce allergic sensitization to rabbit allergens. A progressive increase in rabbit sensitization (also by indirect exposure) may be expected as a consequence of the increase in rabbit ownership.
