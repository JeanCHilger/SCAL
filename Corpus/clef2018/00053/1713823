EEG and neuroimaging localization in partial epilepsy. We have studied cortical localization provided by surface and sphenoidal electroencephalograms (EEGs) and that of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MR) and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) in 58 patients with partial epilepsy. Each patient had EEG, MR and SPECT during a hospitalization period of 1-2 weeks. CT scans were obtained either during the same period or had been performed in the preceding year. EEG evaluation consisted of 3-5 days of continuous monitoring including video-telemetry and ambulatory recording as well as conventional EEGs with special electrode placements. Additionally 33 of 58 patients (55%) who were potential surgical candidates had sphenoidal recordings. All patients had an abnormal EEG which showed evidence of epileptic hyperexcitability. EEG abnormality was localized in 43 patients (74%). Neuroimaging studies were focally abnormal in 38 patients (66%) 12 CT (21%), 29 MR (50%) and 24 SPECT (41%). Thirty four of 43 patients with localized EEG had at least 1 focally abnormal neuroimaging study (79%), whereas 4 of 15 (27%) patients with non-localized EEG did so. Twenty-eight of 29 patients with focal MR (97%), 11 of 12 patients with focal CT (92%) and 20 of 24 patients with focal SPECT (83%) had a concordant focal EEG. EEG and neuroimaging localization agreed in all 15 patients in whom both MR and SPECT disclosed a concordant focal abnormality. This study demonstrates a significant (P less than 0.005) correlation between surface/sphenoid EEG and neuroimaging localization in partial epilepsy.
