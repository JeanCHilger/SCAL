Lung deposition of mannitol powder aerosol in healthy subjects. Mannitol as a dry powder aerosol is used for bronchoprovocation testing and to enhance mucus clearance in people with excessive airway secretions. The dose and distribution of the deposited aerosol in the lung was investigated using fast single photon emission tomography (SPECT) imaging. Mannitol powder (3 microm particle size) was produced by spray drying and radiolabeled with (99m)Tc-DTPA. Approximately 60 mg of radiolabeled mannitol (containing 52-68 MBq of (99m)Tc-DTPA) was administered to 10 healthy subjects using the Inhalator dry powder inhaler (DPI), and SPECT images (1 min each) were collected. Thirteen percent to 31% of the dose of mannitol loaded in the inhaler deposited in the lungs and the deposited dose correlated positively with the peak inhalation air flow. The regional aerosol lung distribution, as expressed by the penetration index (i.e., ratio of peripheral to central deposition in the lung) varied from 0.31 to 0.88, which however showed no dependency on any flow parameters. The variation in response to the same dose of mannitol within the asthmatic population may in part be explained by these findings.
