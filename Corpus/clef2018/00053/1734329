Decreased cerebral glucose utilization in myotonic dystrophy. To test the hypothesis that cerebral metabolism is altered in myotonic dystrophy (MyD), we investigated cerebral glucose kinetics and utilization in 11 adult patients with MyD and 14 healthy controls, using 18F-labeled 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and dynamic positron emission tomography. Estimation of rate constants in MyD revealed a reduction of FDG delivery to the brain. Cortical glucose utilization rate was reduced by about 20% in MyD. These findings may be related to the presence of neurologic impairment in MyD and prompt further investigations on the metabolic and clinical features of brain dysfunction in this disease.
