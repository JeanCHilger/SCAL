Coronary artery disease investigated using 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT. Coronary artery disease can be diagnosed from stress and delayed images of myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using technetium-99 m-tetrofosmin (TcTF). However, the negative predictive value of stress SPECT images after a single injection of a low tracer dose remains unknown. Thus, the present study investigates whether normal stress SPECT results predict event-free survival.We screened 302 consecutive patients who were randomly assigned to two groups for myocardial ischaemia using either stress SPECT with a low dose of TcTF (296 MBq, TcTF group, n = 150) or stress together with rest SPECT using thallium(201) chloride (TlCl, 111 MBq TlCl group, n = 152) as the tracer. A total of 80 patients with abnormal SPECT findings were excluded and the remaining 222 with normal results (age, 66.5 +/- 0.7 yearsThe incidence of cardiac events did not differ between the two groups (0.9% and 0.0% in TcTF and TlCl groups, respectively). The cost and duration of TcTF and TlCl SPECT examinations were about 425 and 603 Euros and 50 and 280 min, respectively.The negative predictive values of stress SPECT using a low dose of TcTF and of combined stress and rest SPECT using TlCl did not differ and both were clinically acceptable. Thus, stress SPECT using low dose TcTF is useful in screening patients for myocardial ischaemia.
