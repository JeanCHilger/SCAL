Plasma interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha can predict coronary endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients. Coronary endothelial function is impaired in hypertension however, the severity of this impairment varies among patients. We aimed to identify the predictors of coronary endothelial dysfunction among clinical variables related to hypertension and atherosclerosis. Twenty-seven untreated, uncomplicated essential hypertensive patients and 10 age-matched healthy controls were studied prospectively. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was measured by using (15)O-water positron emission tomography (PET) at rest and during a cold pressor test (CPT). Coronary vascular resistance (CVR) during CPT was used as a marker of coronary endothelial function. Serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, malondialdehyde-LDL, homeostasis model assessment, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were also measured. CVR during CPT was significantly higher in hypertensive patients than in healthy controls (114+/-26 vs. 94+/-12 mmHg/[mL/g/min]
