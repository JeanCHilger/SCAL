Surgical target selection in cerebral glioma surgery: linking methionine (MET) PET image fusion and neuronavigation. The objective of this study was to investigate the histological correlate of (11)C-methionine (MET) PET uptake of brain gliomas by image fusion for navigated surgery.Twenty-seven patients (18 male, 9 female mean age 42 yearsMET PET tumor uptake was detected in 26 of 27 patients (96.3%). The quantitative MET tumor standardized uptake value (SUV) ratio was significantly higher in malignant gliomas and oligodendrogliomas than in low-grade gliomas (2.76/2.62 vs. 1.67, p=0.03). Generally, qualitative visual grading of MET uptake revealed 2 main patterns: focal MET uptake in 12 and uniform global MET uptake in 11 patients. Focal uptake corresponded to malignant glioma histology in 66.7%, and uniform global uptake to oligodendroglial histology in 72.7%. In oligodendrogliomas, global MET uptake constituted 81.5% (range 53.8-135%) of the MRI T(1) tumor volume on average and was limited to the MRI FLAIR tumor volume in 86% (7/8) of patients. Tissue samples of focal MET uptake areas correlated with histological anaplasia in 66.6% (8/12 glioma patients), although 62.5% (5/8 patients) lacked MRI contrast enhancement.MET PET image fusion may facilitate the targeting of anaplastic foci in homogeneous MRI non-enhancing gliomas for biopsy, may identify oligodendroglial histology preoperatively as well as characterize biologically active tumor volumes within MRI T(1)/FLAIR tumor areas of candidate patients for resection.
