2D and 3D imaging of small animals and the human radial artery with a high resolution detector for PET. The performance of a pair of multicrystal, high-resolution, bismuth germanate (BGO) block detectors for positron emission tomography (PET) has been investigated. Utilizing the detectors at a separation of 100 mm, the spatial resolutions and count rate response of the block have been measured. These measurements indicate maximum spatial resolutions of 3.6 and 4.5 mm (FWHM) in the two axes of the block and a maximum coincidence rate of 3400 cps. The system has been used to observe the regional kinetics of positron-emitting radionuclides in the rat brain and the human radial artery. Designs for a small diameter, no-septa tomograph incorporating these detectors have been considered. Simulations demonstrate the possibilities of following tracer uptake within the rat brain and radial artery. Three-dimensional tomographic data-sets of a 20-mm uniform cylinder, obtained from rotating the two blocks, indicate good uniformity in the field of view (FOV) of 25 mm.
