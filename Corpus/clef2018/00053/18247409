The stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope variation of water stored in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. A set of bottled waters from a single natural spring distributed worldwide in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles has been used to examine the effects of storage in plastic polymer material on the isotopic composition (delta18O and delta2H values) of the water. All samples analyzed were subjected to the same packaging procedure but experienced different conditions of temperature and humidity during storage. Water sorption and the diffusive transfer of water and water vapor through the wall of the PET bottle may cause isotopic exchange between water within the bottle and water vapor in air near the PET-water interface. Changes of about +4 per thousand for delta2H and +0.7 per thousand for delta18O have been measured for water after 253 days of storage within the PET bottle. The results of this study clearly indicate the need to use glass bottles for storing water samples for isotopic studies. It is imperative to transfer PET-bottled natural waters to glass bottles for their use as calibration material or potential international working standards.
