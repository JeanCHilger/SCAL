Renal medullary ETB receptors produce diuresis and natriuresis via NOS1. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) plays an important role in the regulation of salt and water excretion in the kidney. Considerable in vitro evidence suggests that the renal medullary ET(B) receptor mediates ET-1-induced inhibition of electrolyte reabsorption by stimulating nitric oxide (NO) production. The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that NO synthase 1 (NOS1) and protein kinase G (PKG) mediate the diuretic and natriuretic effects of ET(B) receptor stimulation in vivo. Infusion of the ET(B) receptor agonist sarafotoxin S6c (S6c: 0.45 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) in the renal medulla of anesthetized, male Sprague-Dawley rats markedly increased the urine flow (UV) and urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) by 67 and 120%, respectively. This was associated with an increase in medullary cGMP content but did not affect blood pressure. In addition, S6c-induced diuretic and natriuretic responses were absent in ET(B) receptor-deficient rats. Coinfusion of N(G)-propyl-l-arginine (10 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)), a selective NOS1 inhibitor, suppressed S6c-induced increases in UV, UNaV, and medullary cGMP concentrations. Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS (10 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) or RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK-LRK(5)H-amide (18 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)), a PKG inhibitor, also inhibited S6c-induced increases in UV and UNaV. These results demonstrate that renal medullary ET(B) receptor activation induces diuretic and natriuretic responses through a NOS1, cGMP, and PKG pathway.
