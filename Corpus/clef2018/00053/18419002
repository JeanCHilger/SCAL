Thoracic and abdominal organ uptake of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG) with positron emission tomography in the normal dog. Positron emission tomography (PET) has found widespread application for staging and monitoring neoplastic diseases in humans. PET is becoming more available in veterinary medicine, therefore biodistribution of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG) in normal dogs is needed for lesion interpretation in disease states. A large field-of-view (FOV) PET scanner with a 70 cm bore diameter and a 53-cm FOV was used in this study to acquire dynamic 18FDG uptake data from parenchymal organs in seven normal dogs. A 2-h, dynamic list-mode acquisition was initiated simultaneously with intravenous 18FDG injection. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn over liver, spleen, left and right renal cortices, left ventricular free wall, and thymus. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) of these organs were calculated for 24 5-min frames over the 2-h acquisition. This SUV data from parenchymal organs of normal dogs compares favorably with those of normal humans and will be used in ongoing canine studies using PET to evaluate various diseases.
