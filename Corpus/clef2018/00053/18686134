Imaging of 186Re-liposome therapy in ovarian cancer xenograft model of peritoneal carcinomatosis. This study determined the biodistribution of rhenium-186 ((186)Re) encapsulated in biotin-liposomes containing patent blue dye, injected intraperitoneally (IP) with avidin in an OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer xenograft model and evaluated tumor response of this therapy with fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) microPET imaging. Treated rats (n = 8) received an IP injection of (186)Re-blue-biotin-liposomes (1000 MBq/kg) 30 min before an IP injection of avidin (5 mg), whereas control rats (n = 4) received a sham IP injection of saline. Scintigraphic images showed that (186)Re-blue-biotin liposomes/avidin were retained in the peritoneal cavity with 18% of the original activity remaining after 5 days. From 1 to 4 weeks post-treatment, peritoneal (18)F-FDG standard uptake values decreased 30% in treatment group, yet increased 44% in control group. Total number of cells in ascites was significantly higher in control versus treatment group. Omental fat in control rats had numerous tumor cells compared with treated rats. Results show the potential for (186)Re-blue-biotin-liposome/avidin system in treating advanced ovarian cancer involving peritoneal carcinomatosis.
