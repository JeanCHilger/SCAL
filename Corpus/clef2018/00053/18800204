Investigation of the metabolites of (S,S)-[(11)C]MeNER in humans, monkeys and rats. (S,S)-[(11)C]MeNER ((S,S)-2-(alpha-(2-[(11)C]methoxyphenoxy)benzyl)morpholine) is a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand recently applied in clinical studies of norepinephrine transporters (NETs) in the human brain in vivo. In view of further assessment of the suitability of (S,S)-[(11)C]MeNER as a NET radioligand, its metabolism and the identity of the in vivo radiometabolites of (S,S)-[(11)C]MeNER are of great interest.Thus, PET studies were used to measure brain dynamics of (S,S)-[(11)C]MeNER, and plasma reverse-phase radiochromatographic analysis was performed to monitor and quantify its rate of metabolism. Eighteen healthy human volunteers, five cynomolgus monkeys, and five rats were studied.In human subjects, the plasma radioactivity representing (S,S)-[(11)C]MeNER decreased from 88 +/- 5% at 4 min after injection to 82 +/- 7% at 40 min, while a polar radiometabolite increased from 3 +/- 3% to 16 +/- 7% at the same time-points, respectively. A more lipophilic radiometabolite than (S,S)-[(11)C]MeNER decreased from 9 +/- 5% at 4 min to 1 +/- 2% at 40 min. In monkeys, plasma radioactivity representing (S,S)-[(11)C]MeNER decreased from 97 +/- 2% at 4 min to 74 +/- 7% at 45 min, with a polar fraction as the major radiometabolite. A more lipophilic radiometabolite than (S,S)-[(11)C]MeNER, constituted 3 +/- 2% of radioactivity at 4 min and was not detectable later on. In rats, 17 +/- 4% of plasma radioactivity was parent radioligand at 30 min with the remainder comprising mainly a polar radiometabolite. (S,S)-[(11)C]MeNER in rat brain and urine at 30 min after injection were 90% and 4%, respectively. On a brain regional level, parent radioligand ranged from 87.5 +/- 3.9% (57.2 +/- 14.2% SUV [standard uptake values, %injected radioactivity per mL multiplied with animal weight (in g)] cerebellum) to 92.9 +/- 1.8% (36.1 +/- 4.7% SUVIt can be concluded that radiometabolites of (S,S)-[(11)C]MeNER are of minor importance in rat and monkey brain imaging. The presence of a transient lipophilic radiometabolite in peripheral human plasma may induce complications with brain imaging, but its kinetics appear favorable in relation to the slow kinetics of (S,S)-[(11)C]MeNER in humans.
