Usefulness of ventricular function values obtained using post-stress gated-SPECT in a diabetic population with clinical suspicion of ischaemic heart disease. To assess the clinical usefulness of left ventricular function values obtained using post-stress myocardial perfusion gated-SPECT in diabetic patients with suspected ischaemic heart disease (IHD).Sixty-one patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), with clinical suspicion of IHD and no previous history of heart disease were studied. Ergometric or pharmacological post-stress myocardial perfusion gated-SPECT was performed on all patients. The relationship between the ejection fraction values and ventricular volumes, and the perfusion study results, final diagnosis, severity of the perfusion defects and the clinical evolution was studied. The mean follow-up time was 14 months. RESULTS All the ventricular function values independently showed significant differences between the groups with a normal and pathological perfusion study, and between groups with a final diagnosis of IHD and non-IHD. After multivariate logistic regression, the end-diastolic volume (EDV) was the only value which showed a statistical association with the pathological perfusion study, its severity and the final diagnosis of IHD. No statistical association was observed between the ventricular function values and the occurrence of cardiac events.All the ventricular function values obtained by gated-SPECT added diagnostic information to the post-stress myocardial perfusion study in the diabetic population with suspected IHD however, only EDV showed a statistical association with the pathological perfusion study, severity of defects and the final diagnosis of IHD.
