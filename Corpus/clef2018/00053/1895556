Cerebral perfusion scintigraphy in patients with cerebrovascular disease by using 99mTc-ECD: comparative study with 123I-IMP SPECT. 99mTc-ECD SPECT was performed in 19 patients with cerebrovascular disease, and location, extent, and severity of the lesions on 99mTc-ECD SPECT were compared with those on 123I-IMP SPECT. The initial brain uptake was 5.5 +/- 0.7% of the injected dose at 10 minutes after injection, 5.3 +/- 1.3% at 90 minutes, and clearance from the brain is slow. The distribution in the brain was changed, especially washout from the thalamus was slower than that from other regions. The count ratio of perfusion defect to normal area (D/N) on 99mTc-ECD SPECT was unchanged over the time, and had no significant differences from that on 123I-IMP SPECT. 99mTc-ECD SPECT was superior in detection of the lesion in the basal ganglia, and showed the images with superior spatial resolution due to physical characteristics of 99mTc. However, mild ischemic lesion and peri-infarct area was not clearly visualized, while 123I-IMP SPECT could demonstrate these lesions with better contrast.
