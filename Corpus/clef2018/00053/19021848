Pallidal deep brain stimulation and L-dopa effect on PET motor activation in advanced Parkinson's disease. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The antiakinetic effect of internal Globus pallidus deep brain stimulation (Gpi-DBS) in Parkinson's disease is not clear and not either how this effect is modulated by L-dopa. METHODS Left Gpi-DBS and/or L-dopa effect was studied with auditory paced right-handed sequential movements on (15)O-butanol positron emission tomography (PET) in five patients. Rest and for conditions during movements (DBS off/L-dopa off DBS on/L-dopa off
