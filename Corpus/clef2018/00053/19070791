The imaging aspects of metastases from urological malignancies. Metastases from cancers in urology do not exhibit specific radiological patterns that would allow identification of the primary site. Their detection relies upon usual imaging techniques, and mainly contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) that allows the study of the thorax, the abdomen and the pelvis. Ultrasound imaging, and the up-to-date contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging, as well as Magnetic Resonance Imaging are used in addition to CT in case of contra indication of iodinated contrast agents or for targeted indications (focal liver lesion characterization, MR lymphography for lymph node metastases...). PET CT is playing an increasing role but its performances remain limited for the detection of urological metastases. New anti-angiogenic drugs are questioning the traditional evaluation of the therapeutic response based on RECIST criteria. They require more and more the use of functional imaging techniques, such as MRI or CT dynamic studies as well as contrast-enhanced ultrasound.
