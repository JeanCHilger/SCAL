Molecular imaging of cancer: evaluating characters of individual cancer by PET/SPECT imaging. The present status of cancer molecular imaging (MI) with nuclear medicine techniques is reviewed, highlighting the Japanese activities in this field. With the progress in MI research, including significant contributions from Japanese studies, it has become possible to noninvasively evaluate various important characters of cancer in clinical patients, such as metabolism, cellular proliferation, tumor hypoxia, and receptor expression. Tumor metabolic information is used for tumor characterization, treatment response evaluation, and prognosis prediction. Hypoxia imaging is used for treatment planning and predicting treatment response. Receptor imaging can be used for the selection of the candidate for receptor-targeted treatment. Various novel probes that can target cancer-associated antigens, various cellular growth factor receptors, tumor angiogenesis, and so on, are under development, aiming for clinical evaluation. Application of radiolabeled ligands for treatment (targeted internal radiation therapy) is another important field in which MI technique can play a critical role. MI, which can deliver the outcome of basic oncological research to the bedside, is essential translational research for improved individualized patient management, and further advances in MI studies are eagerly awaited.
