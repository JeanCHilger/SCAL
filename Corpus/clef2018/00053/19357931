Surgery for gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the stomach. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the main mesenchymal neoplasms in the gastrointestinal tract. Tumor size, mitotic rate, and location correlate with potential malignancy and recurrence rate. Results of surgical treatment of gastric GIST are analyzed with emphasis on recurrence of disease after intermediate follow-up.From 1998 to 2006, a total of 63 patients (median age 62.1 +/- 14.1) underwent gastric resection for GIST. Fifty-five patients (93.6%) returned for follow-up investigations, which included computed tomography in 45, gastroscopy in 32, and endosonography in 29. Positron emission tomography was done in five patients.Mean tumor size was 5.3 +/- 3.8 cm. Open atypical gastric resection was done in 32, distal gastric resection in five, and remnant gastrectomy in four patients. Laparoscopic gastric resection was initiated in 22 patients the conversion rate was four of 22 (18.2%). Overall, R0 resection was reached in 61/63 patients (96.8%). According to the Fletcher criteria, 33 tumors (52.4%) were classified as intermediate or high risk GIST. Six patients (9.5%) died of unrelated causes before follow-up. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, overall recurrence rate was 7.0% after R0 resection.Histologically proven complete resection is an effective treatment for gastric GIST. Laparoscopic procedures were carried out successfully in selected patients.
