Experimental feasibility studies on a SPECT tomograph for BNCT dosimetry. This article reports on the development of a prototype of a SPECT tomograph system for online dosimetry in BNCT based on LaBr(3)(Ce) scintillation detectors. The setup shielding was optimized to be used in the accelerator based BNCT facility of the University of Birmingham. The system was designed and built. An image of a (241)Am point source was reconstructed. A projection of a phantom with two tumors with 400 microg/g of (10)B was measured at the BNCT facility.
