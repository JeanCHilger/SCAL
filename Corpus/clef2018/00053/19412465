CSF tau protein and FDG PET in patients with aging-associated cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), accelerated neurofibrillary tangle formation occurs which is associated with increased tau protein release into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Recent studies found significantly increased CSF tau already in patients at risk of developing AD, indicating its potential as a biochemical marker of AD. Cerebral glucose metabolism is reduced in frontotemporoparietal and cingulate cortices in patients with mild AD. However, few studies have investigated CSF tau protein and cerebral glucose metabolism changes in patients at risk to develop AD.48 patients with AD, 88 patients with aging-associated cognitive decline (AACD), and 39 healthy controls were included. In all participants, CSF levels of tau were determined by ELISA at baseline and compared between the diagnostic groups. 14 AACD patients and 14 controls underwent (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET).AD patients showed the highest CSF tau levels compared with AACD patients and controls. AACD patients had significantly higher tau levels than the controls but lower than the AD patients. AACD patients were characterized by reduced glucose metabolism in bilateral middle temporal cortex, left posterior cingulate cortex, right angular gyrus, and right precuneus compared with controls.In conclusion, our findings reflect and confirm the clinical judgment of an incipient neurodegenerative disorder in a considerable portion of AACD patients. In patients with AACD, CSF tau levels and cerebral glucose metabolism show an altered pattern comparable with that found in AD and thus may facilitate early diagnosis.
