Imaging features of Takayasu's arteritis. Takayasu's arteritis is the most frequent inflammatory arteritis in young patients. It is characterized by the presence of giant cells and typically involves specific vascular sites: aorta and its main branches and pulmonary arteries. Inflammatory arterial involvements leads to stenosis, aneurysm, occlusion and arterial wall thickening. Diagnosis relies mainly on imaging, namely Doppler US, CT, and MRI. The imaging features of this disease are reviewed based on a retrospective review of 36 patients imaged over a 13 year period.
