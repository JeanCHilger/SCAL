Evaluation of a positron emission tomography (PET)-compatible field-cycled MRI (FCMRI) scanner. Field-cycled MRI (FCMRI) uses two independent, actively controlled resistive magnets to polarize a sample and to provide the magnetic field environment during data acquisition. This separation of tasks allows for novel forms of contrast, reduction of susceptibility artifacts, and a versatility in design that facilitates the integration of a second imaging modality. A 0.3T/4-MHz FCMRI scanner was constructed with a 9-cm-wide opening through the side for the inclusion of a photomultiplier-tube-based positron emission tomography (PET) system. The performance of the FCMRI scanner was evaluated prior to integrating PET detectors. Quantitative measurements of the system's signal, phase, and temperature were recorded. The polarizing and readout magnets could be operated continuously at 100 A without risk of damage to the system. Transient instabilities in the readout magnet, caused by the pulsing of the polarizing magnet, dissipated in 50 ms this resulted in a steady-state homogeneity of 32 Hz over a 7-cm-diameter volume. The short- and long-term phase behaviors of the readout field were sufficiently stable to prevent visible readout or phase-encode artifacts during imaging. Preliminary MR images demonstrated the potential of the FCMRI scanner and the efficacy of integrating a PET system.
