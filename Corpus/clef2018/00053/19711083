Volumetric quantification of myocardial perfusion using analysis of multi-detector computed tomography 3D datasets: comparison with nuclear perfusion imaging. Although the ability of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) to detect perfusion abnormalities associated with acute and chronic myocardial infarction (MI) has been demonstrated, this methodology is based on visual interpretation of selected 2D slices.We sought to develop a new technique for quantitative volumetric analysis of myocardial perfusion from 3D datasets and test it against resting nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (NMPI) reference.We studied 44 patients undergoing CTCA: a control group of 15 patients and a study group of 29 patients. MDCT datasets acquired for CTCA were analyzed using custom software designed to: (1) generate bull's eye display of myocardial perfusion and (2) calculate a quantitative index of extent and severity of perfusion abnormality, Q(H), for 16 volumetric myocardial segments. Visual interpretation of MDCT-derived bull's eyes was compared with rest NMPI scores using kappa statistics of agreement on a coronary territory and patient basis. Quantitative MDCT perfusion data were correlated with rest NMPI summed scores and used for objective detection of perfusion defects.Visual analysis of MDCT-derived bull's eyes accurately detected perfusion defects in agreement with NMPI (kappa = 0.70 by territory 0.79 by patient). Quantitative data were in good agreement with NMPI, as reflected by: (1) correlation of 0.87 (territory) and 0.84 (patient) between summed Q(H) and NMPI scores, (2) area under ROC curve 0.87 with sensitivity of 0.79-0.92, specificity 0.83-0.91, and accuracy 0.83-0.89 for objective detection of abnormalities.Our new technique for volumetric analysis of 3D MDCT images allows accurate objective detection of perfusion defects. This perfusion information can be obtained without additional radiation or contrast load, and may aid in elucidating the significance of coronary lesions.
