Imaging techniques in the evaluation of primary large vessel vasculitides: Part 2: duplex ultrasound, positron emission tomography, computed tomography, and ophthalmological methods. This article focuses on the clinical application and technical aspects of imaging methods which are used alternatively or additionally to angiography or magnetic resonance imaging in patients with Takayasu's arteritis or giant cell arteritis. Providing a high spatial resolution, duplex ultrasound is particularly suitable for the evaluation of peripheral arteries. With the exception of cranial arteries, positron emission tomography as a whole body examination is the best imaging modality for the assessment of inflammatory activity. Computed tomography is used for angiographic examinations and enables evaluation of wall thickening in large arteries. It is the method of choice in the case of emergencies due to aortic aneurysm or dissection. In addition to angiographic and ultrasound techniques, ophthalmological methods comprise biomicroscopy, including funduscopy and optical coherence tomography.
