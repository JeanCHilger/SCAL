Comparison of thyroid volume and goiter measured by means of ultrasonography and SPECT with use of 131I and 99m)c in smokers and non-smokers. The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of nicotine on thyroid volume according to patients' sex.A group of 160 patients with thyroid disorders in their past medical history was examined. Patients were divided into two groups: Group A contained 50 patients with goiter, where the volume of the thyroid was evaluated with use of US and (131)I-SPECT group B contained 50 patients with goiter, where the volume of the thyroid was evaluated with use of US and (99m)Tc-SPECT. There were two control groups: Group A' contained 30 patients with normal volume of the thyroid gland shown by US and (131)I-SPECT, and group B' contained 30 patients with normal volume of the thyroid gland shown by US and (99m)Tc-SPECT. The patients from the examined and control groups were divided into two subgroups - smokers and non-smokers. US of the thyroid gland was made by means of an ALOKA SSD 500 device. SPECT was performed by means of a singke-headed gamma camera by Diacam.The average volume of thyroid gland measured by (131)I-SPECT and (99m)Tc-SPECT was significantly larger according to US in the examined and control groups in smokers and non-smokers. We did not show statistically significant correlations between levels of iodine uptake and volumes of goiter evaluated by US examination together with (131)I scintigraphy.Significant differences in average values of thyroid volume between smokers and non-smokers were not observed, which might suggest a lack of goitrogenic activity of tobacco smoke or indicates a potential goitrogenic influence not significant enough in the examined group.
