Radiation therapy for cancer--challenges and opportunities. Radiotherapy for cancer previously employed large treatment fields whereby cures were obtained. However, long-term follow-up documented serious long-term complications due to irradiation of normal tissues. Modern technology makes it possible to very accurately shape the high-dose volume. However, new problems emerge. Organ movement must be managed and the precise definition of the extent of the tumour tissue is crucial. Positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are increasingly used. Biological imaging may enable us to image tumour biology more accurately and modify radiation doses accordingly.
