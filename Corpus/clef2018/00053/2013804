Hurdles to technology diffusion: what are expectations for PET? Regulatory and economic hurdles to the introduction and the diffusion of expensive new medical instrumentation have changed substantially over the past decade. The process of diffusion has been slowed by the introduction of new hurdles and by the gradual shift in their relative importance. FDA approval, affirmative coverage decisions, and the setting of appropriate levels of reimbursement greatly influence the diffusion and utilization of major new technologies. Positron emission tomography (PET) is not an exception. This paper examines the mechanics of these hurdles and their impact on the availability of PET.
