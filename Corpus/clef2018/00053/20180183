Radioembolization for the treatment of unresectable liver cancer: initial experience at a single center. Radioembolization with yttrium-90 microsphere (Y-90) therapy with SIR-Spheres (Sirtex Medical, Lane Cove, Australia) was approved by the Turkish Ministry of Health in April 2008. In this study, we present the preliminary experience at a tertiary care center with early follow-up results of Y-90 therapy, as well as a review of the related literature.Complete evaluation for radioembolization was performed in 10 patients (8 males, 2 females mean age, 52.3 years) during an 8-month period at a single center, of which 9 were actually treated with SIR-Spheres(R). All patients underwent meticulous pre- and post-procedural imaging studies to document the therapy response. RESULTSIn comparison to chemoembolization, radioembolization has less systemic toxicity and can be performed as an outpatient procedure, which makes it more attractive to both patients and physicians. From our limited experience, the radioembolization procedure is a promising first-line treatment in unresectable liver cancer randomized controlled multi-center studies, however, are needed.
