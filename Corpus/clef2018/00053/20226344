Sentinel node mapping in lung cancer: the Japanese experience. The reduction in lymph node dissection using sentinel node (SN) identification in patients with lung cancer is associated with several difficulties, compared with similar procedures in patients with breast cancer or melanoma. To overcome the difficulties of SN identification in lung cancer, several topics have been reported in Japan. In this study, the following topics regarding SN identification in lung cancer patients will be introduced: (1) devices for SN identification using a radioisotope tracer (2) movement of Tc-99 tin colloid after injection
