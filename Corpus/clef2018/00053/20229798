NeuroAIDS. The incidence of neurological complications including AIDS dementia(NeuroAIDS) in patients with HIV infection has been dramatically decreased since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However, the incidence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, optimistic infections with drug resistance, drug induced peripheral neuropathy, and cerebrovascular disorders has been increased. According to the studies in Western countries, neural injury continues in some patients regardless of the success of HAART and milder cognitive and motor disorder (MCMD) is developed even after introduction of HAART. Moreover longer duration of infection and older age at seroconversion are at increased risk of the cognitive disorders in HIV. Our study reveals the reduction of cerebral blood flow by SPECT in HIV patients without neurological symptoms. Therefore HIV patients should be closely monitored for NeuroAIDS under collaboration with neurologists, immunologists and clinical psychologists. In this article, we review the recent advance of NeuroAIDS research including neuropathological study of macaque AIDS dementia model.
