Bradycardia in serotonin-deficient Pet-1-/- mice: influence of respiratory dysfunction and hyperthermia over the first 2 postnatal weeks. Neonatal rodents deficient in medullary serotonin neurons have respiratory instability and enhanced spontaneous bradycardias. This study asks if, in Pet-1(-/-) mice over development: 1) the respiratory instability leads to hypoxia 2) greater bradycardia is related to the degree of hypoxia or concomitant hypopnea
