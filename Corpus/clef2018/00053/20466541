Cloning and characterization of a gene cluster involved in the catabolism of p-nitrophenol from Pseudomonas putida DLL-E4. A 9.2-kb DNA fragment encoding the enzymes of a p-nitrophenol (PNP) catabolic pathway from Pseudomonas putida DLL-E4 was cloned and sequenced. Ten open reading frames (ORFs) were found and five ORFs were functionally verified. The pnpA and pnpC gene products were purified to homogeneity by Ni-NTA chromatography. PnpA is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent single-component PNP 4-monooxygenase which converts p-nitrophenol to para-benzoquinone in the presence of NADH and FAD. PnpC is a 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene (BT) 1,2-dioxygenase which converts BT to maleylacetate. The hydroquinone (HQ) dioxygenase (PnpC1C2) multi-component protein complex was expressed in Escherichia coli via plasmid pET-pnpC1C2 containing pnpC1 and pnpC2. This complex converts HQ to gamma-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. pnpR is a lysR-type regulator gene. PnpR is a positive regulator involved in HQ degradation in pnp gene cluster. These results demonstrate that a pathway encoded by the pnp gene cluster is involved in degradation of HQ and BT in P. putida DLL-E4.
