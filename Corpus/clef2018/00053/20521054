Comparison of F-18 FET-PET with F-18 FDG-PET for biopsy planning of non-contrast-enhancing gliomas. The management of non-contrast-enhancing brain tumours largely depends on biopsy, which allows a differentiation of low-grade gliomas (LGG) from high-grade gliomas (HGG). The aim of this study was to compare positron emission tomography using 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG-PET) and O-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)-L: -tyrosine (FET-PET) in terms of providing target regions for biopsies.Fifteen consecutive patients with newly diagnosed brain tumours (n = 11) or suspected recurrence of a known LGG (n = 4), in whom MRI demonstrated no contrast enhancement, were studied by both FET-PET and FDG-PET. FET-PET, FDG-PET and MRI data were fused, and then transferred to the neurosurgical navigation system, prior to neurosurgical interventions.Histology showed HGG (WHO grade III) in 6/15 and LGG (WHO grade II) in 9/15 patients. FET-PET revealed an increased intratumoural tracer uptake in 8/9 LGG and in 5/6 HGG. FDG-PET depicted hypermetabolic spots in 2/9 LGG and in 4/6 HGG. In 6 patients we observed an increased intratumoural uptake of both tracers. In 4 of them, the area of highest FET accumulation in the tumour corresponded to the focus of increased FDG uptake.FET-PET appears to be superior to FDG-PET for biopsy planning in non-contrast-enhancing brain tumours. FDG-PET does not provide any additional information in this issue.
