Ethyl 8-fluoro-5-[ The development of epilepsy has been associated with the impairment of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission in the central nervous system because a reduced GABA release has been observed in the mesial temporal lobe during epilepsy episodes in animals and a GABA-mediated inhibition loss was reported in human epileptic hippocampal sclerosis (1, 2). The GABA receptors (GABAR) comprise several different pharmacological subtypes depending on the type of subunits constituting the receptor complex, and GABA mediates its effects primarily through the GABA
