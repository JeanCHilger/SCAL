Towards detecting the HER-2 receptor and metabolic changes induced by HER-2-targeted therapies using medical imaging. HER-2/neu (a receptor for human epidermal growth factor) is involved in cell survival, proliferation, angiogenesis and invasiveness. It is overexpressed in about 25% of breast cancers. Overexpression of HER-2 is associated with response to the anti-HER-2 antibody trastuzumab (herceptin). However, HER-2 expression can be heterogeneous within the primary tumour and can also exhibit discordant expression between a primary tumour and its metastases, bringing into question the practice of HER-2 screening to determine whether a patient is a candidate for trastuzumab using material obtained only from the primary tumour. Medical imaging modalities using HER-2-targeted tracers (or contrast agents) facilitate a global approach to the determination of HER-2 expression across all detectable tumour lesions, and could provide a more reliable indication of the patient's likely response to trastuzumab treatment. Here, I review the development and pre-clinical (and occasional clinical) assessment of HER-2-targeted tracers. I discuss studies in which established imaging tracers, such as (11)C-choline, have been used to determine response to trastuzumab in a range of medical imaging modalities, including positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission tomography (SPECT), MRI and optical imaging.
