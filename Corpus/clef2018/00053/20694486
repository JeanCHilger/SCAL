Confirmation rate of blinded (99m)Tc-SPECT compared to neurochemical dementia biomarkers in CSF in patients with Alzheimer disease. In Alzheimer disease, CSF biomarkers and nuclear imaging are of particular interest. Many studies investigated only one technique, limiting comparison. Here, in 76 patients blinded 99mTc-SPECT was compared to CSF. Sensitivity of CSF was 92% and 51% for SPECT. Specificity favored SPECT (90 vs. 80%). Both techniques showed no coherence (p = 0.17-0.47). Our results confirm that CSF biomarkers show higher sensitivity. SPECT has higher specificity and can also be used for other dementias without established CSF biomarkers.
