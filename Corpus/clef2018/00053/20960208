Neoadjuvant chemotherapy affects staging of colorectal liver metastasis--a comparison of PET, CT and intraoperative ultrasound. Surgery for colorectal liver metastasis facilitates long-term survival, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves resectability but may also alter staging accuracy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the efficacy of positron emission tomography (PET), PET-computed tomography (CT), CT and intraoperative ultrasound (IUS) in the detection of liver metastasis.Between January 2007 and January 2010, 34 patients with resectable colorectal liver metastasis were included in this retrospective analysis. Seventeen patients had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. PET or PET-CT, CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and IUS were performed in all patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were analysed. Histopathological examination of the resected specimens served as standard reference.A total of 109 liver segments were resected, of which 50 showed no metastatic involvement (45.9%). For patients without systemic chemotherapy, sensitivities for PET, CT/MRI and IUS were 92%, 64% and 100% respectively as compared with 63%, 65% and 94% for patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a segment-based analysis. For PET, standardised uptake values were decreased by 3.9 in 10 patients after chemotherapy whereas lesion diameters were similar (3.0 vs. 3.2 cm). Additional metastases were detected by IUS in seven patients resulting in a change of operative procedure in 20.6%.Staging accuracy of colorectal liver metastasis is influenced by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. For PET, decreased tumour metabolism rather than downsizing may account for a drop in sensitivity after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. IUS is critical to avoid incomplete resections.
