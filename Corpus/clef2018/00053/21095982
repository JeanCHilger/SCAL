Three-fold cross-validation of parkinsonian brain patterns. Abnormal physiological networks of brain areas in disease can be identified by applying specialized multivariate computational algorithms based on principal component analysis to functional image data. Here we demonstrate the reproducibility of network patterns derived using positron emission tomography (PET) data in independent populations of parkinsonian patients for a large, clinically validated data set comprised of subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Correlation of voxel values of network patterns derived for the same condition in different data sets was high. To further illustrate the validity of these networks, we performed single subject differential diagnosis of prospective test subjects to determine the most probable case based on a subject's network scores expressed for each of these distinct parkinsonian syndromes. Three-fold cross-validation was performed to determine accuracy and positive predictive rates based on networks derived in separate folds of the composite data set. A logistic regression based classification algorithm was used to train in each fold and test in the remaining two folds. Combined accuracy for each of the three folds ranged from 82% to 93% in the training set and was approximately 81% for prospective test subjects.
