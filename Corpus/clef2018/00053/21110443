Exotic pets as a potential source of Salmonella. To clarify the source of infection with the exotic serovar Salmonella Urbana and the route of transmission in a 2-year-old child.To identify the source of infection and the route of transmission, we used epidemiological investigation of the case of salmonellosis and microbiological methods for the detection of Salmonella from biological specimens, epidemiologically suspected food, turtle tank water and feed, and serotyping of isolated strains of Salmonella.Salmonella Urbana was confirmed in a rectal swab of the infected child and in a sample of turtle tank water. Laboratory analyses of farm eggs eaten by the investigated family, of rectal swabs of the other family members and of a turtle feed sample did not reveal the presence of salmonellae.The confirmed source of Salmonella infection caused by the exotic serovar Salmonella Urbana in a two-year-old child were pet water turtles. In the case of the isolation of exotic serovars of Salmonella, the epidemiological and laboratory investigation needs to be aimed at the contact with pet animals, especially reptiles. It is desirable to raise the awareness of both the public and health professionals of this issue.
