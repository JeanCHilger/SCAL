Imaging of benign solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura: a pictorial essay. Solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura (SFTP) is a mesenchymal tumor that tends to involve the pleura, and is also described in other thoracic and extrathoracic sites. SFTP usually presents as a peripheral mass abutting the pleural surface, to which it is attached by a broad base or by a pedicle that allows it to be mobile. SFTPs exist in benign and malignant forms. A precise pre-operative diagnosis can be arrived at with a cutting-needle biopsy, although most cases are diagnosed with postoperative histology and immunohistochemical analysis. In this pictorial essay, we review a large series of cases, with emphasis on the radiographic appearance of these lesions and their findings from computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography and positron emission tomography.
