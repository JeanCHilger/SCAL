The diastolic stress test: a new approach to an old problem. The evaluation of ischemic heart disease is the cornerstone of clinical Cardiology. Although there are many means of ischemic evaluation, all are with their own limitations. While perfusion-based studies are highly sensitive, they lack specificity. Conversely, systolic wall motion analysis with echocardiography tends to have high specificity however, the sensitivity may be limited by short duration of systolic abnormalities when present. With the advent of Doppler echocardiography, and more specifically tissue Doppler imaging, and strain and strain rate imaging, a more comprehensive evaluation of the left ventricular function is available, including diastole. Diastolic abnormalities in the setting of ischemia are now being studied using these new parameters and have been suggested as a reliable marker of ischemia. Exercise-induced abnormalities in diastolic parameters have improved sensitivities and specificities over traditional stress testing and persist longer than systolic abnormalities. A review of the medical literature regarding the subject will be discussed here.
