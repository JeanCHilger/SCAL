Significance of smoking history and FDG uptake for pathological N2 staging in clinical N2-negative non-small-cell lung cancer. This study was conducted to evaluate whether smoking history and the standardized uptake value (SUV) of 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake are associated with unexpected pathological N2 status (pN2) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).We analyzed the data of 220 patients who underwent surgical resection with clinical N2-negative status on computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT. The maximum SUV of primary tumor was chosen for logistic analysis.Seventy-two patients (33%) had never smoked. The SUV ranged from 1.0 to 29.0 (median 9.1). In univariate analysis, adenocarcinomas (P = 0.019), female gender (P = 0.010), N1 on CT (P = 0.025), and N1 PET-CT (P = 0.001) were associated with a high probability of pN2. The proportion of pN2 in never smokers was higher than in ever smokers (26% versus 10% respectively P = 0.002). The SUV remained on a multivariate logistic model (odds ratio 1.1This study indicates an association between smoking history and pN2 in clinically negative N2 NSCLC. The different roles of FDG uptake were also suggested based on smoking history.
