Recurrent pancreatic carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Although the current literature is limited, available data suggest that (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging improves the evaluation of patients with recurrent pancreatic carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. There is evidence that PET/CT is particularly useful in the setting of elevated tumor markers and negative or equivocal CT findings. This article reviews the nature of these carcinomas in the post-therapy setting and describes the strengths and limitations of PET/CT when used for monitoring recurrence.
