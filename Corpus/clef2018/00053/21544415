Axillary lymph node metastases detection with nuclear medicine approaches in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Three different tracers, Tc-99m-Sesta MIBI, In-111-Pentetreotide and F-18-FDG, were evaluated in a preliminary study in three different groups of 10 breast cancer patients programmed for breast cancer resection and axillary dissection. Planar scintigraphy and single photon emission tomography (SPET) technique were used for imaging with Tc-99m-Sesta-MIBI and In-111-Pentetreotide, positron emission tomography (PET) was used for imaging with F-18-FDG. We studied 30 breast cancer patients their clinical stage according to the TNM classification was 30 T1-T2, 1 T4 and 1 Tx (one patient had bilateral cancer and one had bifocal cancer). The lymph nodal status ranged from NO to N2 (14 NO, 16 N1, 1 N2). Tc-99m-Sesta MIBI, In-111 Pentetreotide SPET and F-18-FDG PET were randomly performed before surgery to visualize the primary tumors and to detect axillary lymph node invasion. Tc-99m-Sesta MIBI correctly visualized 10 out of 11 primary cancers in 10 patients. In-111-Pentetreotide detected 9 out of 10 primary cancers. F-18-FDG imaged all the tumors (10). As regards the axillary nodes, Tc-99m-MIBI excluded axilla involvement in 7 out of 7 negative axillae (N-), while it was positive in 2 out of 3 positive cases (N+)
