Radiosynthesis of [11C]Vandetanib and [11C]chloro-Vandetanib as new potential PET agents for imaging of VEGFR in cancer. Vandetanib (ZD6474) and its chlorine analogue chloro-Vandetanib are potent and selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors with low nanomolar IC(50) values. [(11)C]Vandetanib and [(11)C]chloro-Vandetanib, new potential PET agents for imaging of VEGFR in cancer, were first designed, synthesized and labeled at nitrogen and oxygen positions from their corresponding N- and O-des-methylated precursors, in 40-50% decay corrected radiochemical yield and 370-555GBq/Î¼mol specific activity at end of bombardment (EOB).
