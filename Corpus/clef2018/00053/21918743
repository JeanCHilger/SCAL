18F-FDG PET/CT in lymphomas: assessment difficulties due to illness characteristics, and comparison with literature data. Fluor-18-deoxy-glucose (18F-FDG or FDG) positron emission tomography - computer tomography (PET/CT) has recently become integrated into the clinical routine of patients with lymphoma in Hungary. The basic condition of risk-adapted treatment of these patients is the exact staging and early objective evaluation of the effectiveness of therapy. Between 1 May 2007 and 31 October 2010, 1862 18F-FDG PET/CT examinations were conducted for lymphoma patients at the PET/CT Center in Debrecen. This is more than 15% of the total examined patient population, and this rate shows a slight increase with each year. Based on the experience obtained from lymphoma patients by routine metabolic PET/CT scans we analyzed the difficulties of the evaluation in different time frames of patients' management. It is well known that FDG uptake of lymphomas depends on multiple factors. Although most histological subtypes are associated with uptake of FDG, the intensity of the tracer uptake is different. Different intensity of FDG uptake of the same type of lymphoma following therapeutic procedures might cause difficulties in the evaluation of the scans ensuring that primary staging by PET/CT is highly required for precise measurement and reliable comparison of data. Extranodal involvement was detected in ~40% of the patients with variable rate of prevalence. Extranodal involvement is associated with great diversity and in most cases it is not characteristic of the illness and might appear in different forms and in any organs. Additionally, because accompanying disease may produce false positive results, detailed clinical data and precise case history is highly required.
