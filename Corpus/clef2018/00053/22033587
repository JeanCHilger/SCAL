Functional and topographical considerations in the surgical management of cerebral vascular malformations. Cerebral vascular malformations with potential surgical consequences mainly consist of arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and cavernous malformations. The standard preoperative workup of these lesions includes basic neuroradiological investigation, such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance angiography, and conventional angiography, to assess the exact neurotopographical relationships of the nidus, arterial feeding pedicles, and venous drainage. In cases where lesions are located near or within eloquent areas, precise documentation of the anatomy can be obtained using various functional tests including functional MRI, activated positron emission tomoqraphy, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), which may then be integrated into a neuronavigational system allowing for selective, image-guided surgery, thus potentially reducing surgical morbidity. Preoperative embolization may in certain cases improve the surqical excision by reducinq blood flow throuqh the AVM. Cavernous malformations may also be removed with minimally invasive and highly selective techniques.
