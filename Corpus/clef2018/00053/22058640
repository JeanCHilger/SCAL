Combined single photon emission computerized tomography and conventional computerized tomography: Clinical value for the shoulder surgeons? With the cases described, we strive to introduce single photon emission computerized tomography in combination with conventional computer tomography (SPECT/CT) to shoulder surgeons, illustrate the possible clinical value it may offer as new diagnostic radiologic modality, and discuss its limitations. SPECT/CT may facilitate the establishment of diagnosis, process of decision making, and further treatment for complex shoulder pathologies. Some of these advantages were highlighted in cases that are frequently seen in most shoulder clinics.
