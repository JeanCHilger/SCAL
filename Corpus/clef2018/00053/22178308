Synthesis, radiometal labeling and in vitro evaluation of a targeted PPIX derivative. In pursuit of a single molecule with potential applications for both in vitro fluorescence microscopy and in vivo PET imaging, novel targeted (69/71)Ga/(68)Ga-protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) probes were developed. Optical analysis, fluorescence microscopy and radiolabeling with gallium-68 were performed to confirm potential applications. The use of a targeted-PPIX ring, in conjunction with (69/71)Ga or (68)Ga, eliminates the need for the attachment of multiple imaging tags, allowing for either in vitro fluorescent-based evaluation or in vivo nuclear-based imaging.
