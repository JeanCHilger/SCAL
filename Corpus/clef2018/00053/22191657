Relative hypermetabolism of vermis cerebelli in traumatic brain injured patients studied with 18FDG PET: a descriptor of brain damage and a possible predictor of outcome. The almost constant presence of apparent metabolic hypermetabolism of cerebellar vermis seen on 18FDG PET in a population of injured brains has been reported in a previous paper. Aim of this paper is to determine a) whether there is a correlation between the entity of this sign, semi quantitatively determined, and the severity of the trauma at its onset, and b) whether the entity of the relative enhancement correlates with the medium and long term clinical outcome.A group of 45 consecutive patients admitted to the Acquired Brain Injury Unit of our Hospital for recent, major head trauma, underwent a basal 18FDG PET/CT scan of the brain the presence of relative hypermetabolism of the vermis cerebelli was visually assessed and semi quantitatively determined (vermis/cerebellum ratio: V/C)At one month after trauma, overall LCF (LCF1) values ranged from 2 to 8, avg. 3.77, SD ± 2.10 the average value in group A was 5.21, SD ± 2.09, in B group 2.47, SD ± 0.98 (F=17.5, P = 0). At this time, overall average DRS (DRS1) was 6.7, SD ± 2.05, ranging from 2 to 9A) there is a strong correlation between the semi quantitatively determined values of vermian relative hypermetabolism and the severity of trauma as determined by standard cognitive and performance testings the V/C ratio may therefore be considered a reliable, although non-specific, index of brain suffering. B) there is a good statistical correlation between the semi quantitative vermian/cerebellar ratio determined shortly after the trauma, and the clinical outcome of the patients, evaluated by standard clinical performance tests and relative risk estimates.
