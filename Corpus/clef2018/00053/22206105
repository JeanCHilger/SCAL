 The ephrin (Eph) receptors constitute the largest member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family (1, 2). The Eph receptors and their ligands (ephrins) mediate numerous biological processes in normal development, particularly in the nervous and cardiovascular systems (3-5). Based on their structures and sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A class, which are anchored to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, and the ephrin-B class, which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family of receptors is divided into two groups, EphA and EphB, on the basis of the similarity of their extracellular domain sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands. The Eph receptors transmit forward signals
