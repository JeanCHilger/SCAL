Detection of 18fluoride sodium accumulation by positron emission tomography in calcified stenotic aortic valves. Aortic valve stenosis progression rate is highly variable among patients and to date remains unpredictable. Evaluation of osteoblastic activity inside aortic valves may help identify patients with fast aortic stenosis progression rates and worse prognoses. Fluoride-18 sodium (FNa) is a clinically approved positron emission tomographic (PET) radiotracer with high and rapid bone uptake. The aim of this study was to test whether FNa accumulates in degenerative aortic valves and can be detected with PET imaging. Five patients with severe aortic stenosis and 10 patients free of aortic valvular calcium on computed tomography underwent PET imaging 40 minutes after the injection of 4 MBq/kg of FNa for oncologic or rheumatologic purposes. Maximal standard uptake values (SUVs) were measured retrospectively in aortic valves using PET imaging. Tissue-to-background ratios were calculated for each patient by dividing the maximal SUV measured in aortic valves by the mean SUV of blood. In patients with severe aortic stenosis, an intense accumulation of FNa was detected in aortic valve region on PET imaging, whereas only low activity was found in patients free of valvular calcification (median maximal SUV 2.6 g/ml/kg [interquartile range (IQR) 2.3 to 3.6] vs 2.0 g/ml/kg [IQR 1.7 to 2.2] and median tissue-to-background ratio 2.2 [IQR 2.0 to 2.7] vs 1.5 [IQR 1.5 to 1.7], respectively, p = 0.008 for both). Intraobserver variability for maximal SUV and tissue-to-background ratio in aortic valves was measured at 0.99 and interobserver variability at 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. In conclusion, in this pilot study, FNa accumulated in patients with severe aortic stenosis and could be quantified on PET imaging with good reproducibility. FNa PET imaging represents a promising imaging modality to evaluate osteoblastic activity inside calcified aortic valves.
