Dual-phase 99mTc sestamibi scintigraphy with neck and thorax SPECT/CT in primary hyperparathyroidism: a single-institution experience. To assess the diagnostic value of dual-phase (99m)Tc sestamibi scintigraphy with neck and thorax single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, and to analyze the relationships between SPECT/CT data and serum calcium or parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations.(99m)Tc sestamibi scintigraphy was performed in 94 consecutive patients. Images included early and delayed planar neck images and delayed neck and thorax SPECT/CT. Scintigraphy was scored positive or negative.Fifty-nine sestamibi studies (63%) were positive. SPECT/CT demonstrated a single focus in 56 patients, in usual parathyroid sites in 80% of cases and in unusual sites in the remaining 20% (retrotracheal area, 7% intrathyroidal, 9%Dual-phase (99m)Tc sestamibi scintigraphy with SPECT/CT enables to identify a parathyroid adenoma in about two-thirds of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and allows the surgeon to plan appropriate surgery. The likelihood of scintigraphy to be positive is affected by calcium or PTH concentrations.
