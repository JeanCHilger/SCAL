Automatic left ventricle segmentation in volumetric SPECT data set by variational level set. Left ventricle (LV) quantification in nuclear medicine images is a challenging task for myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. A hybrid method for left ventricle myocardial border extraction in SPECT datasets was developed and tested to automate LV ventriculography.Automatic segmentation of the LV in volumetric SPECT data was implemented using a variational level set algorithm. The method consists of two steps: (1) initialization and (2) segmentation. Initially, we estimate the initial closed curves in SPECT images using adaptive thresholding and morphological operations. Next, we employ the initial closed curves to estimate the final contour by variational level set. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated by comparing manually obtained boundaries with automated segmentation contours in 10 SPECT data sets obtained from adult patients. Segmented images by proposed methods were visually compared with manually outlined contours and the performance was evaluated using ROC analysis.The proposed method and a traditional level set method were compared by computing the sensitivity and specificity of ventricular outlines as well as ROC analysis. The results show that the proposed method can effectively segment LV regions with a sensitivity and specificity of 88.9 and 96.8%, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and reasonable robustness of the automatic method.A new variational level set technique was able to automatically trace the LV contour in cardiac SPECT data sets, based on the characteristics of the overall region of LV images. Smooth and accurate LV contours were extracted using this new method, reducing the influence of nearby interfering structures including a hypertrophied right ventricle, hepatic or intestinal activity, and pulmonary or intramammary activity.
