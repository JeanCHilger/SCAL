Distinct patterns of antiamyloid-β antibodies in typical and atypical Alzheimer disease. To compare serum antiamyloid-β (Aβ) antibodies in typical and atypical Alzheimer disease (AD).Preliminary observations.Thirteen patients with AD, 8 patients with posterior cortical atrophy with evidence of AD (PCA-AD) pathophysiological process by both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and amyloid imaging, and 12 age-matched control individuals.The class and subclass levels of serum anti-Aβ antibodies were measured using an oligomer-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This method allowed measuring both free antibodies and, after acidic treatment, the total fraction that includes all antibodies complexed with circulating Aβ40/42 and any cross-reacting antigen.Anti-Aβ IgG were restricted to the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. Their total levels were strikingly lower and more homogeneous in patients with PCA compared with both typical AD and controls, while biomarkers of amyloid deposition (CSF Aβ42 and positron emission tomography amyloid imaging) were similar in patients with AD and patients with PCA.Serum anti-Aβ IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies differ between distinct forms of AD. Its significance is discussed for possible implications as immune effectors in the specific pathophysiology of AD variants.
