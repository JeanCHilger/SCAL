SPECT/CT diagnostics for skeletal infections. Skeletal infections are often a diagnostic and clinical challenge.Nuclear imaging modalities used in the diagnostic workup of acute and chronic skeletal infections include three-phase bone scintigraphy and scintigraphy with labelled leucocytes.The introduction of hybrid technologies, such as single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) has dramatically changed nuclear medical imaging of infections.In general SPECT/CT leads to a considerably more accurate diagnosis than planar or SPECT imaging.Given the integrated acquisition of metabolic, functional and morphological information, SPECT/CT has increased in particular the specificity of three-phase skeletal scanning and scintigraphy with labeled leucocytes.
