Single photon emission computed tomography in pulmonary embolism - estimation of selected, scintigraphic regions of interests. Pulmonary embolism is considered dangerous form of thrombo-embolic venous disease contracted by 25000 people annually with around 30% deaths. Accurate diagnosis of the disease and treatment could reduce mortality rate by several per cent. Discernment of ailment is obstructed by variety of clinical picture. Suspicion of pulmonary embolism is verified by diagnostic patterns, among which SPECT is used as well. Aim of this study was to prove perfusion scintigraphy with use of SPECT evaluated together with radiological examinations of chest could be efficient method of pulmonary embolism diagnosis.SPECT of lungs was performed in 92 patients, examinations were compared to X-ray scans of chest and in 13 cases to computer tomography. Regions of interest in symmetric zones of chest were also traced in order to evaluate differences radiotracer accumulation.Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed by means of SPECT in 59 patients (64.1%). Radiological examinations allowed to exclude other causes of decreased pulmonary perfusion.Difference over 10% in radiotracer accumulation in symmetric zones among patients with pulmonary embolism was stated in 42 patients, 5-10% - in 15,under 5% - in 2. Drawing symmetric regions of interest all over lungs indicates essential points of decreased perfusion whereas difference in radiotracer accumulation is greater than 10%.
