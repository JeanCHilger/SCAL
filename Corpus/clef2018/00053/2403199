Redistribution of cerebral activity during childhood. Data on the functional development of brain structures in early childhood are scarce. Cognition changes markedly from pre-school age to school age, and we thought it of interest to examine the level of functional activity of selected brain regions. Nine preschool children were studied and compared with eight school children and eighteen adults. Xe133 emission tomography was used for determination of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). It was demonstrated that activity in the striatal regions is low in early childhood. In school age the proportion of flow to these regions is increased by about 11-14 per cent (difference between medians). Perfusion of the occipital lobes decreased with age when studied with open eyes and closed eyes, possibly reflecting loss of synapses and decreased plasticity.
