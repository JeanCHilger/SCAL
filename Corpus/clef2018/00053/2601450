Improved photomultiplier tube for positron emission tomography. The paper describes an investigation in which it is shown that small positive voltage pulses applied to an external conductor placed against the photocathode of a photomultiplier tube can be used to switch the photocathode completely off for the duration of the pulses. This suggests that a photomultiplier tube with a multisegment photocathode can be constructed, the individual cathode segments of which can be switched off independently by means of such pulses. A theoretical explanation for the effect is provided with the aid of a simple circuit model for the photocathode. Analysis of the model also shows that it is possible to identify the particular cathode segment in which a photon is detected when a pulse is recorded at the phototube's anode. A phototube with these characteristics can have important implications for positron emission tomography, as it can provide improved spatial resolution, simultaneous multislice capability and the ability to eliminate distortion due to dead-time effects at high count rates.
