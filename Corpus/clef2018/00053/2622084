Assessment of cerebral blood flow in intracerebral hematoma using IMP-SPECT. To evaluate cerebral blood flow in intracerebral hemorrhage, we performed single photon emission computed tomography using N-isopropyl [I-123] p-iodoamphetamine (IMP-SPECT) in 20 patients. IMP-SPECT was carried out using rotating gamma camera at 30 min, and 4 hrs after injection. The results were compared with those by computed tomography (CT). In all cases, the extent of hematoma by IMP-SPECT was larger than that of CT. All cases were divided into 3 groups according to the extent of peripheral area zone of hematoma by IMP-SPECT. There were 10 cases with initial hypoperfusion and complete redistribution (Group I), 6 with initial perfusion defect and complete redistribution (Group II), 4 with initial perfusion defect and incomplete redistribution (Group III). Group III had extensive hematoma compared to Group I. The extent of peripheral area zone of hematoma could be considered as the decreased blood flow area by increased intracerebral pressure and the amplitude of redistribution may be correlated with celler damage. In conclusion, IMP-SPECT was useful to asses the viability of peripheral zone of hematoma.
