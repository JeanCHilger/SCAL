Positron emission tomography (PET): a unique approach for the imaging of in vivo metabolism. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a new diagnostic imaging modality which will be available for the study of patients in the greater Nebraska area beginning mid year 1989. This technology will provide unique information on regional function and blood flow in a variety of body organs. Our emphasis will be placed on the identification of the viability of heart muscle in patients suffering a myocardial infarction or following thrombolysis who are being considered for a bypass procedure or angioplasty. We will also use PET to identify epileptic foci and to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and for the assessment of the efficacy of various treatments of brain and other organ tumors. Despite the relatively high fixed costs of PET, we are confident that the unique information provided by this technology will prove not only to be effacacious but cost effective as well. Thus reimbursement through medical insurance programs, including Medicare, is expected to occur for those studies identified above. Likely coverage for additional PET procedures, particularly in the evaluation of psychiatric disorders, will occur after efficacy and cost effectiveness of these studies have been demonstrated.
