Clinical experience with Tc-99m HM-PAO high resolution SPECT of the brain in patients with cerebrovascular accidents. In order to evaluate the diagnostic contribution of brain SPECT imaging with 99mTc-HMPAO in cerebrovascular disease, we examined 92 stroke cases (144 lesions), 2 hematoma cases and 30 cases with transient neurologic symptoms. Abnormal tracer distribution is visible as zones of either hypoactivity or hyperactivity (border zone hyperemia or luxury perfusion). Remote vascularization changes could also be found (crossed cerebellar diaschisis or ipsilateral cortical perfusion reduction in thalamic or capsula interna lesions). Both X-ray CT and blood flow SPECT have comparable sensitivity in the exploration of cerebral infarction, with detection in, respectively, 89.5% and 87.5% of the lesions. False negative scintitomographic images are frequently recorded in small lacunar infarcts within the basal ganglia and white matter (capsula interna). Some early infarcts and asymmetry of brain perfusion in patients with transient neurologic symptoms are frequently not detected by CT. An additional advantage of blood flow SPECT is its ability to visualize remote blood flow changes and the changing pattern of vascularization of ischemic lesions and their surrounding areas including hyperemia.
