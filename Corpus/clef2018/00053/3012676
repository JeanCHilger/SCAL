Experience with the inhalation of a 33% xenon-(stable-)oxygen mixture in relation to a new method of measuring local cerebral circulation. We describe a new non-invasive method for measuring local blood flow in the brain. Xenon (stable)-nl CBF-CT-method has been used in our clinic for the first time in Europe. It is superior to all other methods, such as 133Xenon, SPECT and PET in terms of anatomical accuracy and its resolution. We describe the method and its side effects. Inhalation of Xenon in sub-narcotic doses (33% for five minutes) produced no significant complications. Of 95 examinations, 74 were free of any incidents. The most common side effect was euphoria. The method appears to be suitable for general clinical use.
