Surgical treatment of convexity focal epilepsy--based on diagnosis of PET and subdural EEG. The most important premise for a successful surgical treatment of epilepsy lies in an accurate diagnosis of the focus location. The hitherto employed methods for this purpose are meticulous analysis of seizure contents and scalp EEGs, but spatial localization of the focus sites is far beyond the capacity of these diagnostic measures. With the advent of positron emission tomography (PET), in vivo observation of human brain metabolism has become possible. The indices of brain metabolism such as cerebral blood flow (rCBF), cerebral metabolic rate of glucose or oxygen (CMRG, CMRO2) are noninvasively measured by PET offering priceless information for diagnosing brain dysfunction such as ischemia, degeneration, psychosis, or epilepsy. Kuhl et al. first employed PET in assessment of epileptic foci, in which interictal foci were beautifully detected as discrete "hypometabolic zones". Many researchers have confirmed this invaluable finding, and nowadays PET seems to have acquired the citizenship as one of the most capable diagnostic measures in focus localization. We have hitherto applied PET study in 72 epileptic patients. The main contents of their seizures consists of complex partial in 32, elementary partial in 32, generalized in 6, and others in 3 cases. We administered perorally 10 mCi glucose labeled with C11 produced in the JSW Baby Cyclotron for the study of CMRG. The continuous inhalation method of CO2 and O2 labeled with O15 produced in the same cyclotron was also employed for measurement of rCBF and CMRO2. In both studies, epileptic foci were shown as well demarcated hypometabolic zones with decreased CMRG, rCBF or CMRO2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
