Regional blood flow and oxygen consumption in the leg muscles of normal subjects and in those with arterial insufficiency. Study of the distribution of C15O2 and of 15O2 using positron emission tomography. We first studied the distribution of radioactivity during continuous inhalation of C15O2 and 15O2 in traverse tomograms of the greatest diameter of legs, at rest and immediately after exercise (ankle flexions). C15O2 and 15O2 were distributed homogeneously and symmetrically in both legs of normal subjects at rest. The activity accumulated in the anterolateral region after exercise. In patients, this pattern of distribution was similar but asymmetrical, depending on the arterial pathology. No systematic distribution of either C15O2 or 15O2 was observed. In a second step, we studied quantitatively blood flow (F), oxygen uptake (R) and oxygen extraction (E) in 11 subjects: 5 normals (23 +/- 1 years) and 6 patients (60 +/- 11 years) suffering from unilateral intermittent claudication. We used the bolus inhalation technique of C15O2 and 15O2. In the normal leg at rest, ranges were 2.5 to 8.0 ml/min.hg for F, 0.9 to 21.3 mumol/min.hg for R and 3.6 to 33.4% for E. In the pathological leg at rest, ranges were 3.7 to 11.3 ml/min.hg for F, 3.8 to 10.6 mumol/min.hg for R and 7.1 to 24.5% for E. After exercise, ranges were 6.4 to 62.8 ml/min.hg for F, 66.0 to 386.3 mumol/min.hg for R and 29.2 to 89.5% for E in both legs. There was no straight difference between normal and pathological legs soon after exercise. This study allows us to expect that the demonstration of such a difference implies a longer delay of data acquisition following the slow post-ischemia recovery.
