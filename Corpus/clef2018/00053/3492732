SPECT images using a multislice fan beam collimator. Several methods to improve the image resolution of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) occur to us. It is one method to use multislice fan beam collimators which have the parallel collimation along the cephalic-caudul axis of a patient and the conversing collimation within planes parpendicular to that axis. It is impossible to obtain corrective image when we used the algorithm which is commonly used for reconstruction of SPECT images. We proposed a reconstruction algorithm for multislice fan beam collimator in this paper. An interpolation method developed for fan beam type X-ray CT was modified to reconstruct images from SPECT with multislice fan beam collimator. This algorithm was confirmed by means of computer simulation studies. Beside improving the system resolution by effectively reducing the intrinsic resolution of the cameras, this collimator also increases the system sensitivity by utilizing a large fraction of the crystal area. We have thought that to use multislice fan beam collimator is beneficial for SPECT images.
