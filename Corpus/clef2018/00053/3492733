A simulation study to evaluate the statistical noise and spatial resolution in image reconstruction of emission computed tomography--with respect to the optimization of the filter function in the convolution integral. Filtered backprojection method has been commonly used to reconstruct images in the field of the computed tomography (CT). However, in the emission CT such as positron and single photon CT, poor counting static which are caused by limited dosage to patients, limited counting rate capacity and limited efficiency of the imaging device, produce a statistical noise in the reconstructed image. The magnitude of the statistical noise and the spatial resolution were evaluated for various shapes of the filter used in the convolution integrals of the filtered back-projection procedure. The statistical noise was proportional to the inverse of the root of the total number of counts for any filters. The high-frequency-cut characteristic of the filter reduced the statistical noise, but increased the spatial resolution in the images. It was possible to optimize the shape of the filter for given total number of counts and required statistical noise and spatial resolution.
