Quality controls for the gamma camera with single photon emission tomography. Some tests and quality controls to assess the initial conditions and the working performance of a SPET system (Single Photon Emission Tomography), are described. Suitable tomographic phantoms were designed and built. We outline the methods to check MTF, stability of the photoelectric peak, centre of rotation, spatial uniformity, spatial resolution, sensitivity. NEMA tests should first be carried out to check the planar scintigraphic performance of the gamma-camera. This study allows to comprehensively evaluate the qualitative and quantitative performance of the SPET system and the correct check frequency of investigated parameters.
