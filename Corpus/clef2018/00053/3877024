Prevalence of Campylobacter jejuni in felidae in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A prevalence study revealed Campylobacter jejuni in rectal swabs of 1% of a sample of 430 domestic cats and from one species of 15 zoo felines which were examined. There was no correlation between age, presence of diarrhea, source of sample (animal shelter, veterinary clinic, domestic pet) and the isolation of C. jejuni. A controlled exposure trial confirmed that fecal shedders can transmit infection to susceptible contacts which subsequently demonstrate transient diarrhea. Infected cats show a variable pattern of excretion of the organism which could result in failure to determine C. jejuni status based on a single examination.
