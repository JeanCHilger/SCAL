Striatal dopamine metabolism in living monkeys examined by positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography, using the dopa analogue [18F]6-fluoro-L-dopa, has been used to depict the neostriatum in living monkeys. The amount of 18F that accumulated preferentially in the striatum could be augmented by a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor. Striatal 18F could also be discharged with reserpine. This is the first time that the regional distribution of a neurotransmitter has been demonstrated in monkeys.
