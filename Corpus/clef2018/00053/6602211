L-[1-11C]leucine: routine synthesis by enzymatic resolution. L-[1-11C]leucine, suitable for the determination of cerebral protein synthesis rates in man using positron emission tomography, has been synthesized using a modified Bucherer-Strecker reaction sequence. The isolation of the pure L-amino acid isomer from the enantiomeric mixture, initially obtained using either an open or closed reaction vessel, was achieved using a D-amino acid oxidase/catalase enzyme complex immobilized on a Sepharose support. The O2 required by the D-amino acid oxidase as the hydrogen acceptor was supplied by catalase. The L-[1-11C]leucine was obtained with a radiochemical purity of greater than 99% and with a radiochemical yield of 25%. Using a remote, semiautomated synthesis system, typical production time was 30-40 min after preparation of H11CN. The use of immobilized enzymes for rapid and effective resolution of amino acid enantiomers eliminates the possibility of protein contamination and assures the production of a sterile, pyrogen-free product.
