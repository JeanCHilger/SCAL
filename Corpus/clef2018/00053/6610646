Preparation of human serum [methyl-11C]methylalbumin microspheres and human serum [methyl-11C]methylalbumin for clinical use. Safely-injectable suspensions of human serum [methyl-11 C] methylalbumin microspheres have been prepared via the reaction of human serum albumin microspheres with [11C]methyl iodide, itself prepared in a novel one-pot synthesis from cyclotron-produced [11C]carbon dioxide. The preparation takes only 30 min from the end of radionuclide production and proceeds in 22% radiochemical yield based on the activity of [11C]carbon dioxide used and decay-corrected. It has been shown that such microspheres are highly stable in vivo and may be used as reference blood flow markers in positron emission tomography (PET). Similarly, safely-injectable and radiochemically pure solutions of human serum [methyl-11C] methylalbumin have been prepared in 31% radiochemical yield and in 40 min from the end of [11C]carbon dioxide production via the reaction of [11C]methyl iodide with human serum albumin. This radiopharmaceutical is intended for studies of lung permeability and blood-brain barrier permeability by PET.
