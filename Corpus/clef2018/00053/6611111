Emission tomographic measurement of local cerebral blood flow in humans by an in vivo autoradiographic strategy. An in vivo autoradiographic strategy is described for the measurement of local cerebral blood flow in humans by positron emission tomography, based on an application of the single-compartment model originally proposed by Kety. A variety of factors are considered upon which the successful quantitation of local blood flow depends. These factors include the mode of tracer administration and the definition of the arterial input function the choice of scan parameters to assure unique and sensitive values of flow throughout the physiological range of interest
