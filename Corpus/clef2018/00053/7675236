Positron emission tomography study of human narcolepsy: no increase in striatal dopamine D2 receptors. We investigated dopamine D2 receptors in the caudate nucleus and putamen with positron emission tomography in seven patients with narcolepsy and seven healthy controls by using [11C]raclopride as a ligand. We applied an equilibrium method and Scatchard principle to give a quantitative estimation of the number (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) of the receptors. Both the Bmax and Kd were within the normal range in the caudate nucleus and putamen in narcoleptic patients. We found no evidence for increased D2 receptor binding in narcolepsy.
