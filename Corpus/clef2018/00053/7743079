Single photon emission computed tomography in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Alzheimer's disease and other dementia syndromes can be characterized by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). SPECT can be used to measure cerebral blood flow or neurotransmitter activity in these disorders. SPECT can help distinguish various neurologic disorders and also help elucidate their pathophysiologic processes. This article focuses on the use of SPECT in the study of Alzheimer's disease and related neurologic disorders.
