Evaluation of response to radiotherapy in head and neck cancer by positron emission tomography and [11C]methionine. To evaluate the usefulness of positron emission tomography (PET) and L-[methyl-11C]methionine in assessing treatment response to radiotherapy in head and neck cancer.Fifteen patients with head and neck cancer (13 with squamous cell carcinoma, 1 with adenocystic carcinoma, and 1 with paranasal plasmocytoma) underwent a PET study with [11C]-methionine both before and after preoperative radiotherapy to the total tumor dose of 61-73 Gy. Twelve primary and 12 metastatic tumor sites were within the field of view. Nineteen of the 24 tumor sites were surgically explored after radiotherapy, and the tumor standardized uptake values (SUVs) of [11C]methionine were compared with histological findings.All 24 malignant lesions were detectable in the pretreatment study. In all but one case, the tumor SUV decreased after radiotherapy. The median SUV of the tumor site was smaller (1.9, range, 1.3-3.1, n = 7) in cases with histologically verified complete response than in cases with persistent cancer (median 4.1, range, 2.8-7.6, n = 12, p = 0.0008). A complete histological response was verified in none of the 9 cases with a postirradiation SUV larger than the median (3.1), whereas 7 of the 10 cases with a SUV of 3.1 or smaller had complete response (p = 0.003). The preirradiation uptake of [11C]methionine in tumors did not have significant association with histological response (p = 0.45). The PET findings correlated well with follow-up data in five cases with unoperated tumor sites. The [11C]methionine uptake of the submandibular salivary glands decreased after radiotherapy (p = 0.04).PET with [11C]methionine as a tracer may be useful in assessing response to radiotherapy in head and neck cancer. High uptake of [11C]methionine in the postirradiation scan suggests the presence of persistent disease.
