Fluorine-18-labeled progestin 16 alpha, 17 alpha-dioxolanes: development of high-affinity ligands for the progesterone receptor with high in vivo target site selectivity. We describe the synthesis and tissue biodistribution of two 21-[fluoro-18F]progestin 16 alpha, 17 alpha-furanyl ketals, potential agents for imaging progesterone receptor (PR)-positive breast tumors in humans, using positron emission tomography. 21-Fluro-16 alpha, 17 alpha-[(R)-(1'-alpha-furylmethylidene)dioxy]-19- norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione (endo-10a) and 21-fluoro-16 alpha, 17 alpha-[(R)-(1'-alpha-furylethylidene)dioxy]-19- norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione (endo-10b) were chosen for radiochemical synthesis from a series of seven novel progestin 16 alpha, 17 alpha-(furanyldioxolanes) on the basis of their high relative binding affinity to PR (190% and 173%, respectively, relative to R5020 = 100%), their low nonspecific binding (NSB) (log P o/w = 3.87 and 4.13, respectively), and their resulting high binding selectivity indices (BSI i.e., the ratio of their PR binding affinity to nonspecific binding). Radiochemical synthesis of these two species in high radiochemical purity and at high effective specific activity was accomplished by treatment of the corresponding diastereomerically pure 21-trifluoromethanesulfonates with fluorine-18 anion. In tissue biodistribution studies in estrogen-primed immature female Sprague-Dawley rats, both [18F]-endo-10a and [18F]endo-10b demonstrated high PR-selective uptake in the principal target tissues, the uterus and the ovaries, and relatively low uptake in fat and bone. The metabolism at the 21-position in these progestins (as monitored by in vivo defluorination) appears to be less than that in other 21-fluoroprogestins
