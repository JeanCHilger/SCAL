A pilot study of schizophrenia-like psychosis in epilepsy using single-photon emission computerised tomography. In a pilot study, SPECT was used to explore differences in rCBF between a group of patients with schizophrenia-like psychoses of epilepsy (SLPE) and a matched group of epileptic controls. Five patients in each group were investigated and those with SLPE showed significant reductions in the index of rCBF in the left medial temporal region. These differences are being investigated further.
