New directions in myocardial perfusion imaging. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in the field of nuclear cardiology. Pharmacologic stress perfusion imaging with intravenous administration of dipyridamole or adenosine provides comparable sensitivity and specificity values for detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) as exercise imaging and has been employed successfully for risk stratification prior to peripheral vascular or aortic surgery and after myocardial infarction. Detection of myocardial viability can be enhanced utilizing reinjection of a second dose of thallium-201 (Tl-201) at rest after acquisition of redistribution images with the single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) technique. Imaging solely in the resting state with Tl-201 can also provide information concerning presence of viable myocardium in asynergic regions that are stunned or hibernating. New technetium-99m (Tc-99m) perfusion agents have emerged in the clinical setting and have provided excellent predictive value for detection of CAD in patients with chest pain and permit simultaneous assessment of function and regional blood flow. Tc-99m Sestamibi, one of these agents, is also a valid marker of viability when assessing myocardial salvage after coronary reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction.
