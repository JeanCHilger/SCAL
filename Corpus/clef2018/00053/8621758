Color duplex measurement of cerebral blood flow volume: intra- and interobserver reproducibility and habituation to serial measurements in normal subjects. Color duplex flowmetry of internal carotid and vertebral arteries permits estimation of intravascular flow volumes and global cerebral blood flow volume (CBFV) by summing the flow volumes measured in each of the four extracranial vessels. Intravascular flow volumes were calculated as the product of angle-corrected time-averaged flow velocity and the cross-sectional area of the vessel. The reliability of this new method was tested in a prospective, intra- and interdiane, intra- and interobserver reproducibility study of 32 healthy subjects aged 7-57 years. In each subject, CBFV was tested by each observer twice on day 1 and once on day 2 in consecutive recordings. In each artery, both examiners found closely similar mean intravascular flow volumes. Intradiane interobserver reproducibility of CBFV was high on both days (correlation coefficient, CC, 0.90 and 0.85, p < or = 0.0001 coefficient of variance, CV, 10.0 and 10.4%, respectively), as was the interdiane comparison (CC = 0.81, p < or = 0.0001
