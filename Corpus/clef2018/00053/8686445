Comparison of Xe-CT/CBF and quantitative ECD-SPECT. We compared stable xenon enhanced X-ray computed tomography (Xe-CT) with Technetium-99m ethylsteinate dimer single-photon emission computed tomography (ECD-SPECT) in 12 patients. We evaluated the cerebral blood flow (CBF) values in the territory of the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral artery, and in the thalamus. The CBF values were higher in ECD-SPECT than in Xe-CT except for the values of the thalamus. The posterior cerebral artery territory showed a lower correlation and the thalamus had no correlation between two methods. We discussed causes of these differences.
