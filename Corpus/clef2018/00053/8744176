A geometric method of measuring the left ventricular ejection fraction on gated Tc-99m sestamibi myocardial imaging. Geometric measurements of the left ventricular diameters as used in biplane angiocardiography and echocardiography were applied to gated SPECT Tc-99m sestamibi myocardial scintigrams in order to calculate the left ventricular ejection fraction. These measurements take no longer than 5 minutes and require no additional computer software. In a review of 79 examinations, the left ventricular ejection fraction calculated using these measurements correlated well with the echocardiographically estimated ejection fraction (r = 0.78, P < 0.0001). The technique is highly reproducible with an intraobserver correlation of r = 0.94 and interobserver correlation of r = 0.93.
