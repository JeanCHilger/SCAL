beta-CIT SPECT demonstrates blockade of 5HT-uptake sites by citalopram in the human brain in vivo. The cocaine analogue 2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-iodophenyl)-tropane (beta-CIT) is a potent ligand for both dopamine- and serotonin uptake sites which in its 123I labeled form can be used for single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). It was demonstrated previously by SPECT-studies in non-human primates that 123I-beta-CIT binds to dopamine transporters in the striatum and to serotonin transporters in hypothalamus and midbrain. The aim of the present study was to compare 123I-beta-CIT binding in the brain stem of normal controls and a group of subjects under treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram. 123I-beta-CIT-SPECT was performed in 12 depressed patients under 20 mg (n = 5), 40 mg (n = 6) and 60 mg (n = 1) citalopram daily, in one untreated depressed patient and in 11 controls at regular time intervals up till 24 hours p.inj. A highly significant reduction of beta-CIT binding was found in an area including mesial thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain and pons in patients under citalopram compared to controls (44.1 +/- 14.4 vs. 82.3 +/- 18.6cpm's/mCi x kg body weight specific binding 4 hrs p.inj.
