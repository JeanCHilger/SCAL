Tc-99m sestamibi myocardial SPECT in syndrome X. The authors reviewed the stress Tc-99m MIBI SPECT results and clinical data of 15 patients with syndrome X. The results of exercise EKG and resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were compared with the results of Tc-99m MIBI SPECT. Of the 15 patients, 9 (60%) had a normal Tc-99m MIBI SPECT study and 6 (40%) had an abnormal Tc-99m MIBI SPECT. The authors found that 1) an abnormal Tc-99m MIBI SPECT was common in syndrome X, 2) the results of the exercise EKG were not related to perfusion defects on Tc-99m MIBI SPECT, and 3) for patients with an abnormal Tc-99m MIBI SPECT, the incidence of an abnormal resting LVEF and cardiac abnormalities were not higher than in patients with normal Tc-99m MIBI SPECT studies.
