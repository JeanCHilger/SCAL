Radiolabeled somatostatin analog scintigraphy in medullary thyroid carcinoma and carcinoid tumor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a recently developed radiolabelled somatostatin analog (111In-pentetreotide) for the detection and localization of both medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and carcinoid tumors, and to compare the results obtained with the results of 99mTc(V)-DMSA, and radioiodinated MIBG imaging. 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy was performed in 9 patients with MTC and in 9 patients with carcinoid tumor. Whole body and SPECT studies were performed at 4 and 24 hours post-injection. SMS scintigraphy gave a positive result in 5 out of 7 patients with proven MTC lesions, and in 7 out of 9 patients with known lesions of carcinoid tumor. It gave a negative result in 2 MTC patients with high levels of calcitonin but with no evidence of disease at conventional diagnostic modalities. The scintigraphic results were comparable with those obtained with 99mTc(V)-DMSA in MTC and were superior to those of radioiodinated MIBG in both MTC and carcinoid tumors. When compared with the modifications of calcitonin levels brought about by the acute administration of octreotide ("Octeotride test"), these correlated well in 8 out of 9 patients studied.
