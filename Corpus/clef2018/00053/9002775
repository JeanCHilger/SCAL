Comparison of labeled MIBG and somatostatin analogs in imaging neuroendocrine tumors. In 10 patients with histologically proven neuroendocrine tumors (4 carcinoids, 4 pheochromocytomas, 1 medullary thyroid cancer and 1 Merkel tumor) the results of radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and somatostatin analogs were compared. A total of 24 tumor lesions was detected on standard imaging studies. MIBG scintigraphy correctly localized 12 (50%) of these lesions which were observed in 5 patients (4 with pheochromocytoma and 1 with carcinoid tumor). Scintigraphy using labeled somatostatin analogs correctly localized 21 (87%) lesions which occurred in 8 patients (4 with carcinoid, 2 with pheochromocytoma, 1 with medullary thyroid cancer and 1 with Merkel tumor). Concordant scintigraphic results were obtained in 1 patient with carcinoid and 2 with pheochromocytoma. In conclusion, although this series was limited, our results suggest that MIBG is more accurate than somatostatin analogs in imaging pheochromocytoma. Conversely, somatostatin analogs are more accurate than MIBG in detecting other neuroendocrine tumors such as carcinoids.
