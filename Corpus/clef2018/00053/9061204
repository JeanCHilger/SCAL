Synthesis of [11C]RPR-72840A and its evaluation as a radioligand for the serotonin reuptake site in positron emission tomography. RPR-72840A, an inhibitor of serotonin reuptake, was labelled with carbon-11. The synthesis of the nonradioactive precursor, which exhibited some unexpected chemistry, and its reaction with [11C]phosgene affording [11C]RPR-72840A are described. Biodistribution studies in rats and PET studies in baboons were conducted to evaluate [11C]RPR-72840A as a tracer for PET imaging of the serotonin reuptake system.
