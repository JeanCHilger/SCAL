Correction of the stereochemical assignment of the benzilic acid center in (R)-(-)-3-quinuclidinyl (S)-(+)-4-iodobenzilate [(R,S)-4-IQNB]. Radioiodinated (R)-quinuclidinyl-4-iodobenzilate (4IQNB) is a high affinity muscarinic antagonist which has been utilized for in vitro and in vivo assays, and for SPECT imaging in humans. 4IQNB exists in four different diastereomeric forms, since there are two asymmetric centers at the quinuclidinyl and benzilic acid centers. Based upon our in vivo studies, we have determined that the absolute stereochemistry previously assigned to the benzilic center was incorrect for the diastereomer that had been previously referred to as '(R)-quinuclidinyl-(R)-4-iodobenzilate' [(R,R)-4IQNB]. The correct designation for this diastereomer is '(R)-quinuclidinyl-(S)-4-iodobenzilate' [(R,S)-4IQNB].
