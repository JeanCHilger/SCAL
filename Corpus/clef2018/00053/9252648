Effect of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) on human carcinoid tumor cell aggregates. The induction of glutamine starvation has been suggested as a potential target for antitumoral treatment using inhibitors of amidotransferase, an enzyme which mediates the conversion of glutamate to glutamine. Using multicellular aggregates from tumor cell lines, the effect of treatment with a suggested glutamine antagonist, 6-diazo-5-axo-L-norleucine (DON), was investigated. As indicators of treatment response, three different parameters were measured: aggregate size, uptake of 14C-methionine and secretion of Chromogranin A. Of six cell types evaluated (carcinoid, glioma, neuroblastoma pancreas and bladder cancer), the largest inhibition of 14Cmethionine uptake, amounting to 60%, was found in the carcinoid cell line BON. In this cell line the maximum effect was reached already at 10 microM concentration. DON induced marked growth inhibition in the BON aggregates which lasted 3-4 weeks after which regrowth started. During this period the secretion of chromogranin and methionine uptake was also inhibited. These studies suggest that the neuroendocrine cell line BON is especially vulnerable to treatment by DON and show that strong inhibitory effects are found at concentrations lower than that achieved in patient blood in previous clinical trials.
