Brain glucose metabolism in borderline personality disorder. We searched for regional cerebral metabolic disturbances in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Ten inpatients with BPD, no current DSM-IIIR Axis I diagnosis and free of any psychotropic substances, were compared with 15 age-matched control subjects using positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose and semiquantitative analysis of regional glucose metabolic activity. We found relative hypometabolism in patients with borderline personality disorder at the level of the premotor and prefrontal cortical areas, the anterior part of the cingulate cortex and the thalamic, caudate and lenticular nuclei. This study shows significant cerebral metabolic disturbances in patients with borderline personality disorder. These metabolic disturbances, which are similar to some of those described in other psychiatric entities, may help to understand the characteristic clinical aspects of this disorder.
