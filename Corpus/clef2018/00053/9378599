Olivopontocerebellar atrophy and Friedreich's ataxia: neuropsychological consequences of bilateral versus unilateral cerebellar lesions. This chapter deals with neuropsychological disturbances in patients with bilateral cerebellar damage (BCD), i.e., epileptic patients chronically receiving phenytoin, patients with olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA), and Friedreich's ataxia (FA) versus those with unilateral cerebellar damage (UCD), i.e., patients with cerebellar strokes. BCD patients showed: (i) impaired executive functions in planning and programming of daily activities, elaborating and using structures, and difficulty in abstract thinking, functions that are related to cerebello-frontal loops (ii) deficits in visuospatial organization for a concrete task and deficient visual-spatial working memory, functions related to cerebello-parietal loops
