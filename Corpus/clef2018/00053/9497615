Diagnosis of epilepsy by PET scan. Neuroimaging techniques have a great impact on the evaluation and treatment of patients with epilepsy. Positron emission tomographic studies with 18F-FDG can provide valuable data for presurgical localization of epileptogenic zones. There are also a number of receptor ligands for PET studies available, including benzodiazepine, opiate and cholinergic tracers. Ligands for monoamine oxidase B and glutamate receptors are being developed.
