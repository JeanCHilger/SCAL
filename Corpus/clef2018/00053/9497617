PET scan in neuro-intensive care and research. The main objective of neurointensive care is to counteract the development of secondary brain ischemia. The management is focused on preventing, detecting and correcting secondary insults that are likely to produce ischemic brain damage. This requires intensive multimodality monitoring of the brain. There is no reliable technique available for continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow and therefore intermittent methods have to be used in some cases for objective measurement of cerebral perfusion. PET allows measurements of both cerebral blood flow and metabolism, which is essential for the assessment of the energy metabolic state of the brain tissue. PET may be used to guide therapeutic intervention, to evaluate the effect of treatment, to validate new techniques for monitoring of the brain and to determine the efficacy of potential neuroprotective drugs. The possibilities that PET offers in neurointensive care and research are illustrated. The experiences from the application of PET in the evaluation of pharmacological treatment of increased intracranial pressure in head injured patients and the use of PET in combination with intracerebral microdialys, in an MCA-occlusion-reperfusion primate model and in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, to validate intracerebral microdialysis as an instrument for chemical monitoring of the brain during neurointensive care, are reported.
