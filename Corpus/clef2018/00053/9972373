201Tl SPECT as an indicator for early prediction of therapeutic effects in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. This study retrospectively investigated the good parameters on thallium-201 chloride (201Tl) SPECT for early assessment of the therapeutic effects in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Based on tumor response as determined by chest CT scan about 9 weeks after the end of irradiation with adjuvant chemotherapy, the subjects were divided to the responder group (tumor regression > 50%, n = 13) and non-responder group (tumor regression < 50%, n = 13). 201Tl SPECT was performed before and at the halfway through the course of therapy (average tumor dose, 27.4 Gy +/- 4.5) in all the patients. SPECT was conducted twice 15 min (early scan) and 120 min (delayed scan) after intravenous injection of 148 MBq (4 mCi) of 201Tl. Tumor-to-contralateral normal lung tissue count ratios on both scans were calculated as early and delayed uptake ratios (EUR and DUR), and a retention index (RI) was also derived from these ratios. In the responder group, a significant decrease in DUR and RI halfway through the therapy was observed compared to pretreatment (2.6 +/- 0.6 vs. 3.5 +/- 1.0 p < 0.01, and -2.3% +/- 25.5 vs. 37.4% +/- 17.8
