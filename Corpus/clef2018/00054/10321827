Consensus on renal cortical scintigraphy in children with urinary tract infection. Scientific Committee of Radionuclides in Nephrourology. A questionnaire related to cortical scintigraphy in children with urinary tract infection was submitted to 30 experts. A wide consensus was reached on several issues related to planar images: 99mTc dimercapto succinic acid (DMSA) appears as the most appropriate tracer for renal imaging dynamic tracers are considered to be inferior, in particular 99mTc diethylenetriaminepentaacetate, which is not recommended. The general opinion is that DMSA scintigraphy is not feasible with a minimal dose below 15 MBq, whereas the maximum dose should not be higher than 110 MBq. The dose schedule generally is based on body surface area, and sedation is only exceptionally given to children. Images are obtained 2 to 3 hours after injection, preferably with high resolution collimators
