Increased striatal dopamine transporter in adult patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: effects of methylphenidate as measured by single photon emission computed tomography. Ten previously untreated adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were investigated before and after 4 weeks of treatment with a dose of 3x5 mg methylphenidate/d by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [Tc-99m]TRODAT-1, the first Tc-99m labelled SPECT ligand specifically binding to the dopamine transporter (DAT). For semiquantitative evaluation of the DAT, specific binding ([STR-BKG]/BKG) was calculated in the striatum (STR) with the cerebellum used as background (BKG). The patients with ADHD presented with increased specific binding of Tc-99m-TRODAT-1 to the DAT as compared with age and sex matched controls ([STR-BKG]/BKG 1.43+/-0.18 vs. 1.22+/-0.05, P<0.001). After treatment with methylphenidate specific binding decreased in all patients ([STR-BKG]/BKG 1.02+/-0.23, P<0.001). Thus, for the first time it could be demonstrated using SPECT that methylphenidate lowers increased striatal DAT availability in adults suffering from ADHD.
