Utility of positron emission tomography in predicting improved left ventricular ejection fraction after coronary artery bypass grafting among patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The objective of this study was to determine whether preoperative estimates of regional myocardial uptake of (18)-F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) could predict postoperative improvement in ejection fraction in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for ischemic cardiomyopathy. 20 consecutive patients [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) </=27%] were referred for preoperative positron emission tomography (PET) to measure regional myocardial FDG uptake and were deemed candidates for CABG. All individuals had technically adequate vessels and significant viability. The left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was severely diseased in all patients. Because of the importance of the anterior wall to overall ventricular performance, FDG uptake was semiquantitated in those regions and related to postoperative LVEF. 17 patients underwent CABG with an uneventful recovery. LVEF increased from 22 +/- 4 to 26 +/- 7% 2 weeks postsurgery (p < 0.05), with >/=5% change noted in 7 patients (group 1) and <5% noted in 10 patients (group 2). No preoperative or perioperative clinical variable could predict those with improved ventricular function. The relative amount of FDG uptake in the anterior wall was higher in group 1 compared with group 2 (93 +/- 9 vs. 81 +/- 13% p < 0.05) and correlated with the change in LVEF post-CABG (r = 0.50
