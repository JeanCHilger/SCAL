The use of SPECT in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. This article looks briefly at the latest efforts to develop an objective diagnostic marker for Parkinson's disease on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Traditionally, the diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease has been based on clinical criteria. However, these predict the pathologic diagnosis in only 80% of patients suspected of having the disease. Since a correct diagnosis is essential for prognosis, effective treatment and research, the search has continued for objective markers. The latest developments in nuclear medicine have come the closest in making such a marker clinically available. These developments are based on SPECT and positron-emission tomographic imaging of the basal ganglia using specific radio-labelled dopaminergic-receptor tracers. SPECT radiotracers target either the pre- or postsynaptic component of the dopaminergic system in the basal ganglia. These techniques show great promise in the early diagnosis of PD as well as in measuring its progression.
