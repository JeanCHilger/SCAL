Robotic synthesis of 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa. The aim of this study was to develop a method of semi-automated 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa (6-[18F]FDOPA) synthesis using a robotic system (Scanditronix Anatech RB III, Uppsala, Sweden). [18F]Fluorine was produced via 20Ne(d,alpha)18F using a Scanditronix MC17F cyclotron (Uppsala). The radiosynthesis was performed by the Scanditronix Anatech RB III robotic system. On average, a typical run produced 16-19 mCi of 6-[18F]FDOPA at end of synthesis (EOS) after 2 h irradiation of the F2/neon gas target. The total synthesis time was 110 min. The retention time of 6-[18F]FDOPA (the radio peak) was 8.2 min, which was consistent with the 6-[19F]FDOPA ultraviolet peak. The radiochemical purity was greater than 97%. A robotic, semi-automated method for 6-[18F]FDOPA radiosynthesis is therefore feasible. The radiation burden for the operator can be reduced as much as possible. Sufficient activity of 6-[18F]FDOPA could be obtained for positron emission tomography studies of dopaminergic function.
