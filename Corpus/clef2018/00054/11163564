Comparison of myocardial oxygen consumption using 11C acetate positron emission tomography scanning in a working and non-working heart transplant model. In acute cardiac rejection, changes in myocardial oxygen consumption occur non-invasive detection of these metabolic changes would have obvious clinical utility. In the classic cervical, heterotopic, canine, transplant model, the heart is non-working. It has a low myocardial oxygen consumption. Creation of a working model with normal myocardial oxygen consumption would enhance validity of non-human studies.Clearance of 11C acetate was determined by positron emission tomography (PET) scanning and compared with myocardial oxygen consumption in normal and transplanted canine hearts. Donor hearts from mongrel dogs (2.5-3 kg n=4) were transplanted into the neck of adult beagles (12-15 kgMyocardial oxygen consumption was correlated with the rate constant of 11C acetate rapid phase clearance (r=0.91) in normal and transplanted hearts. The working hearts had increased myocardial oxygen consumption compared to non-working hearts.This study (1) introduces a model of a working heterotopic cardiac transplantation with near-normal oxygen consumption and (2) demonstrates that regional myocardial oxygen consumption in transplanted hearts can be detected by 11C acetate PET.
