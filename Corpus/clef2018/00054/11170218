Detection of response to COMT inhibition in FDOPA PET in advanced Parkinson's disease requires prolonged imaging. The aim was to investigate whether the improved 6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-dopa (FDOPA) availability induced by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibition can be more clearly seen during late than during standard (early) imaging in FDOPA uptake in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with severe dopaminergic hypofunction. Six PD patients and six healthy controls were investigated up to 3.5 h after FDOPA injection with and without a single 400-mg dose of a peripheral COMT inhibitor, entacapone. Prolonged (late) imaging showed a significantly higher increase in FDOPA uptake than standard 1.5 h (early) imaging after entacapone both in controls and in PD patients. The increase in the (putamen-occipital):occipital ratios was 37.4% during early and 70.4% during late imaging in controls. In PD patients, there was no significant change in the ratios during early imaging, but the late imaging showed a significant increase in the putamen-to-occipital ratio of 54.2% after COMT inhibition. Late imaging reveals more clearly the prolonged FDOPA availability induced by COMT inhibition leading to higher cumulated striatal activity compared with early imaging. This might be worth considering in FDOPA studies, especially if investigations are planned to do without blood sampling. Late imaging shows the storing potential of FDA better than is seen during early FDOPA PET imaging after entacapone administration. In patients with severe presynaptic dopaminergic hypofunction, its detection requires prolonged imaging.
