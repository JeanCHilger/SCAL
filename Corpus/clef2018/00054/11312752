Preparation and X-ray structures of Cu(I), Ni(II), and Pd(II) (N,S) complexes of the monoanion [(tBuN)(S)P(mu-N(t)Bu)2P(S)(NH(t)Bu)]- and a Pt(II) (S,S') complex of the dianion [((t)BuN)(S)P(mu-N(t)Bu)2P(S)(N(t)Bu)]2-. The metathetical reactions of the lithium derivative of the monoanion [((t)BuN)(S)P(mu-N(t)Bu)(2)P(S)(NH(t)Bu)](-) (L) with CuCl/PPh(3), NiCl(2)(PEt(3))(2), PdCl(2)L'(2) (L' = PhCN, PPh(3)), and PtCl(2)(PEt(3))(2) produced the complexes (PPh(3))CuL (5), NiL(2) (6), PdCl(L)(PPh(3)) (7), PdL(2) (8), and Pt(PEt(3))(2)[((t)BuN)(S)P(mu-N(t)Bu)(2)P(S)(N(t)Bu)] (9). The X-ray structures of 5, 6, and 8 reveal a N,S-coordination for the chelating monoanion L with the metal centers in trigonal planar, tetrahedral, and square planar environments, respectively. By contrast, the dianionic ligand in the square planar Pt(II) complex 9 is S,S'-chelated to the metal center. (31)P NMR spectra readily distinguish between the N,S and S,S' bonding modes, and, on that basis, N,S chelation is inferred for the Pd(II) complex 7.
