Restitution of alpha-topography by piracetam in post-stroke aphasia. Electroencephalographic and clinical effects of piracetam in post-stroke aphasia were evaluated in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.In 24 patients with mild to moderate aphasia after ischemic stroke, quantitative topographic EEG at rest was studied before and after a 6-week treatment period.In the active treatment group, a significant shift in the alpha-rhythm from frontal to occipital regions was observed which may be due to a restitution of corticothalamic circuits involved in the generation of alpha-activity.Neuropsychological scores improved significantly and markedly in various domains of speech during piracetam treatment, whereas improvements were less marked and restricted to a few categories in the placebo group.
