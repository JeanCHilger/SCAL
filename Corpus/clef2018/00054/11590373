Dog exposure in infancy decreases the subsequent risk of frequent wheeze but not of atopy. Influence of household pets in the development of childhood asthma or atopy has been controversial.The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pet exposure in early life decreases the subsequent risk of frequent wheezing and/or allergic sensitization.This was a prospective observational birth cohort study. The setting was a large health maintenance organization in Tucson, Ariz the subjects were a population sample of 1246 newborns enrolled at birth and followed prospectively to age 13 years. The main outcome measures were as follows: time to first report of frequent wheezing (>3 episodes in the past year), skin prick test reactivity at 6 years and 11 years of age, and total serum IgE at 9 months, 6 years, and 11 years of age.Children living in households with > or =1 indoor dogs at birth were less likely to develop frequent wheeze than those not having indoor dogs (P =.004). This inverse association was confined to children without parental asthma (hazard ratio = 0.47 P <.001 [Cox regression]) and was not evident for children with parental asthma (hazard ratio = 0.96Dog exposure in early life might prevent the development of asthma-like symptoms, at least in low-risk children with no family history of asthma. Nevertheless, early pet exposure does not seem to significantly influence the development of allergic sensitization.
