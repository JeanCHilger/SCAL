Neonatal jaundice, animal-induced injuries, and immunizations. The authors describe recent developments in three areas of pediatrics commonly encountered by the office practitioner. First, clinical assessment of jaundice remains critically important as "early discharge" of newborns continues. Practitioners constantly balance clinical realities with an evidence-based approach in the management and follow-up of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Second, given the frequent exposure of children to animals, a thorough understanding of animal bites, pet-borne infections, and rabies prophylaxis is essential for every pediatrician. Finally, immunization status remains one of our leading health indicators. Recent changes in the routine immunization schedule and a renewed emphasis on vaccine safety provide insight into the future direction of vaccinology.
