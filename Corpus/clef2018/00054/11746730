NMDA antagonist effects on striatal dopamine release: positron emission tomography studies in humans. Previous brain imaging studies with [(11)C]raclopride have suggested that the psychotogenic effects of the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine in humans might be mediated by increased dopamine (DA) release and increased stimulation of DA D(2) receptors in the striatum. The goal of the present study was to assess the effect of ketamine on D(2) receptor availability in subregions of the striatum (dorsal caudate, DCA dorsal putamen, DPU
