Hypotheses from functional neuroimaging studies. Functional neuroimaging, especially positron emission tomography (PET) using various tracers, provided new insights into the pathophysiology of West syndrome in the past decade. Glucose PET studies revealed a unique corticosubcortical circuitry assumed to be involved in the age-dependent generalization of seizure activity leading to symmetric spasms. The findings strongly suggested that cortical abnormalities, mostly consistent with dysplastic lesions or diffuse cortical dysfunction due to an underlying systemic disorder, trigger brain stem nuclei and activate basal ganglia bilaterally. PET is also able to investigate developmental abnormalities of serotonergic and GABAergic neurotransmitter systems in vivo. Involvement of these systems in the pathophysiology of infantile spasms is strongly supported by animal data and can be further elucidated by future PET studies. In addition, the development of new PET tracers (such as neurotracers for imaging NMDA receptors) could help further clarify the role of altered neurotransmission in generation of spasms. This review of the most important functional neuroimaging findings illustrates how human PET and single photon emission computed tomography data help answer basic questions regarding the pathomechanisms involved in this often devastating condition and how these findings might facilitate development of a useful animal model of West syndrome.
