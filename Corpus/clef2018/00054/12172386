Assessment of acetazolamide reactivity in cerebral blood flow using spectral analysis and technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) can be quantified noninvasively using the brain perfusion index (BPI), determined from radionuclide angiographic data generated with technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO). Previously, the BPI has been calculated using graphical analysis (GA) however, the GA method is greatly affected by the first-pass extraction fraction and retention fraction, which are not only variable, but lower in cases with an increased CBF, such as after the administration of acetazolamide. Thus, GA-calculated BPI values (BPIG) may not reflect the absolute CBF. The objective of this study was to use the spectral analysis of radionuclide angiographic data collected using 99mTc-HMPAO to examine changes in the BPI after the administration of acetazolamide. We studied the CBF of both cerebral hemispheres in six healthy male volunteers
