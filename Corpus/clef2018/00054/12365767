A dog and a "happy person" visit nursing home residents. Recent recognition of the importance of the human-animal bond has led to the proliferation of programs designed to improve the lives of nursing home residents through the use of animals. Because human-human interaction in the nursing home setting is often of an obligatory nature, we wondered if a visit from a nonjudgmental, outgoing, enthusiastic young adult ("a happy person") could elicit the same positive influence as a visit from a nonjudgmental dog. The purpose of this study was to determine if elderly residents of a midwestern nursing home had a preference for the type of visitor (dog vs. person) when both visits were nonobligatory and nonjudgmental. Behaviors were evaluated to determine if one visitor was more likely to influence prosocial behaviors (moving closer, patting, smiling). Six residents were visited by both the dog and the happy person: 5 of 6 completed the final interview. Residents were equally likely to smile at and move closer to both visitors. Residents were more likely to pat the dog. Three residents liked both visits equally: 1 preferred the dog, and 1 preferred the happy person. These data suggest that nonobligatory visits to nursing home residents from a happy person may be as beneficial to the resident as visits from a dog.
