Effect of seizures and antiepileptic drugs on prolactin secretions. To study the effect of seizures and antiepileptic drugs on prolactin (PRL) secretions.Serum PRL level was measured by radioimmunoassay in 110 epileptic patients who received different treatment protocols with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and the test was also performed in 64 of these patients before and after seizures. Another 21 untreated epileptic patients and 42 healthy subjects served as the control groups.Serum PRL level was significantly increased after seizures, which peaked at 15 min postictal and attained the levels more than 5-fold the baseline in 59 patients. At 90-minute postictal, PRL levels decreased in 57 patients and dropped within normal range in 38 patients. The changes of hormone levels correlated significantly with the types of seizures. The basal PRL levels in patients with exclusive phenytion (PHT) or valproate (VPA), and in those with combined ministration of carbamazpine (CBZ+VPA+PHT), were significantly lower than the control levels (P<0.05). Patients receiving treatment with traditional Chinese medicine had comparable serum PRL levels with the normal control group (P>0.05).Seizures of epilepsy and medication with AEDs given as either monotherapy or polytherapy affect the secretion of PRL in the pituitary, but traditional Chinese medicine therapies does not.
