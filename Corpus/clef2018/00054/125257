Automated method for the determination of niacin and niacinamide in cereal products: collaborative study. In a collaborative study, an automated method for the determination of niacin and niacinamide in cereal products was compared with the official final action microbiological (43.121-43.125) and chemical (43.044-43.046) methods. Ten samples of cereal products, including enriched flour, yeast-leavened baked products, fortified breakfast cereals, and baked pet food products, were submitted to 14 laboratories. Nine laboratories reported values by the automated method, 6 reported values by the microbiological method, and 7 reported values by the chemical method. The results from the microbiological method were not subjected to analysis of variance because of the unusually large between-laboratory variation. The between-laboratory coefficients of variation for the automated and chemical methods were 10.90 and 10.18%, on the basis of results from 7 and 4 laboratories, respectively. There was no significant (p greater than 0.05) difference between methods when results from the 4 laboratories who used both methods were compared. The automated chemical method has been adopted as official first action.
