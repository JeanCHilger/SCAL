Photosynthetic electron transport inhibition by 2-substituted 4-alkyl-6-benzylamino-1,3,5-triazines with thylakoids from wild-type and atrazine-resistant Chenopodium album. The effect of 2-benzylamino-1,3,5-triazines on photosynthetic electron transport (PET) was measured with thylakoids isolated from atrazine-resistant, wild-type Chenopodium album, and spinach to find novel 1,3,5-triazine herbicides bearing a strong PET inhibition. The PET inhibition assay with Chenopodium (wild-type and resistant), yielded a resistance ratio (R/W = I50 (resistant)/I50 (wild-type)) of 324 for atrazine while for benzylamino-1,3,5-triazine derivatives of diamino-1,3,5-triazines a R/W of 11 to 160 was found. The compounds having a benzylamino group at one of the amino groups in the diamino-1,3,5-triazines have a resistant ratio down to one half to 1/30 of the atrazine value. The average resistance ratio of 21 benzylamino derivatives of monoamino-1,3,5-triazines was found to be about 4.0. The inhibition of 21 benzylamino-1,3,5-triazines assayed with atrazine-resistant Chenopodium thylakoids, indicated by pI50 (R)-values, correlated well with the PET inhibition pI50 (W) of wild-type thylakoids from Chenopodium.
