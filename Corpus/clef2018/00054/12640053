Occipital hypoperfusion in Parkinson's disease without dementia: correlation to impaired cortical visual processing. The purpose of this study was to analyse changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in Parkinson's disease (PD) without dementia.Twenty eight non-demented patients with PD and 17 age matched normal subjects underwent single photon emission computed tomography with N-isopropyl-p-[(123)I]iodoamphetamine to measure rCBF. The statistical parametric mapping 96 programme was used for statistical analysis.The PD patients showed significantly reduced rCBF in the bilateral occipital and posterior parietal cortices (p<0.01, corrected for multiple comparison p<0.05), when compared with the control subjects. There was a strong positive correlation between the score of Raven's coloured progressive matrices (RCPM) and the rCBF in the right visual association area (p<0.01, corrected for multiple comparison p<0.05) among the PD patients.This study showed occipital and posterior parietal hypoperfusion in PD patients without dementia. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that occipital hypoperfusion is likely to underlie impairment of visual cognition according to the RCPM test, which is not related to motor impairment.
