Onset age and severity of motor impairment are associated with reduction of myocardial 123I-MIBG uptake in Parkinson's disease. To elucidate the factors associated with severity of cardiac sympathetic nerve involvement in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD).(123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake was examined in 88 patients with PD. The ratio of the uptake in the heart (H) to that in the mediastinum (M) (the H/M ratio) was calculated and correlated with age at onset, age at examination, and disease severity and duration. Twenty five healthy people were also examined as a control.There was a mild but significant negative correlation between H/M ratio and age at onset (early, r = -0.33, p = 0.002 delayed, r = -0.34, p = 0.001) and between Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) stage (early, r = -0.30, p = 0.006This study suggests that late onset, high severity PD is associated with myocardial sympathetic dysfunction.
