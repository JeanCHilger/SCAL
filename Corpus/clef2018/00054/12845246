Electrocardiographic gated (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT immediately after primary percutaneous coronary intervention characterizes reperfusion success. Following an acute myocardial infarction, the size of the infarct and the resulting left ventricular volume and function are important predictors of mortality. Identifying patients with impaired tissue level perfusion after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for myocardial infarction therefore could have prognostic implications. To obtain combined measures of left ventricular perfusion, volumes and function we applied a gated myocardial perfusion imaging by (99m)Tc-sestamibi single photon emission computerized tomography to 19 patients immediately after revascularization by PCI and repeated this after 3 months. The results of the acute myocardial perfusion imaging significantly correlated to final infarct size, left ventricular volumes and function 3 months later. It is concluded that the method holds the potential for risk stratifying patients immediately after revascularization for acute myocardial infarction.
