Testing cross-calibration between positron emission tomographs and their peripheral devices. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cross-calibration of positron emission tomographs and their peripheral devices prior to a multicenter study. The instrumentation of 22 sites (including 24 dedicated PET scanners), including 21 that could be operated in 2D mode and 20 in 3D mode, was investigated according to standardized acquisition and reconstruction protocols, and the cross-calibration was checked against the dose calibrators (22 instruments) and the sample changer (20 instruments). The deviation of the cross-calibration to the dose calibrators was below 5% for 10 of 21 PET scanners (2D mode) and 6 of 20 (3D mode). For 6 (2D mode) and 6 (3D mode) scanners, the corresponding error was up to 10%. In turn, the deviation between dose calibrator and standard was less than 8% for 19 devices, and even less than 5% for 14 devices. In most of the well counters evaluated, the cross-calibration error was less than 10%. Although required in general, the cross-calibration between positron emission tomographs and their peripheral devices becomes even more critical when pooling data in the framework of quantitative clinical multicenter studies.
