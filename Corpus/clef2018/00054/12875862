Evaluation of F18-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) to assess the nature of neurogenic tumours. Benign neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST) commonly develop in patients with neurofibromatosis. Differentiation of benign from malignant tumours by conventional preoperative imaging is unreliable. FDG-PET is a non-invasive technique for biological tumour evaluation. The aim of this study was to assess the value of FDG-PET in patients with neurogenic tumours suspicious for MPNST.Benign and malignant neurogenic soft tissue tumours were prospectively evaluated by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Three-dimensional qualitative and quantitative FDG-PET was performed. Standard uptake value (SUV) was analyzed with respect to histological diagnosis and follow-up data.Twenty-five neurogenic soft tissue tumours were included. FDG-PET identified all primary (n=6) and recurrent MPNST (n=7). Benign lesions (n=12) did not demonstrate high FDG uptake. The SUV was significantly higher in MPNST (median 2.9 range 1.8-12.3), than in benign tumours (median 1.1FDG-PET allows discrimination of benign from malignant neurogenic tumours. This should be particularly useful in patients with neurofibromatosis as FDG-PET may help to avoid multiple surgical procedures for benign tumours.
