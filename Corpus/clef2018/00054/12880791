Influence of the normalization template on the outcome of statistical parametric mapping of PET scans. Spatial normalization is an essential preprocessing step in statistical parametric mapping (SPM)-based analysis of PET scans. The standard template provided with the SPM99 software package was originally constructed using (15)O-H(2)O PET scans and is commonly applied regardless of the tracer actually used in the scans being analyzed. This work studies the effect of using three different normalization templates in the outcome of the statistical analysis of PET scans: (1) the standard SPM99 PET template (2) an (18)F-FDG PET template, constructed by averaging PET scans previously normalized to the standard template
