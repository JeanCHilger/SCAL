Drosophila Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase gene confers resistance to paraquat in Escherichia coli. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is known to protect organisms from reactive oxygen metabolites. We tested the hypothesis that the Drosophila Cu,Zn SOD is capable of protecting Escherichia coli from oxidative damage caused by the herbicide paraquat. The Cu,Zn Sod gene of Drosophila sechellia was subcloned into pET-20b(+) expression vector. Transformation of E. coli with the constructed vector resulted in an overexpression of this eukaryotic superoxide dismutase, as evidenced by dramatically increased levels of the Cu,Zn SOD polypeptide in bacterial cytosolic extracts. As well, the E. coli transformants showed resistance to paraquat-mediated inhibition of growth and survival. Paraquat is known to promote formation of the superoxide radical anion inside cells and thus the data have been interpreted as indicating that the cloned superoxide dismutase provides protection in E. coli against damage attributable to free radicals.
