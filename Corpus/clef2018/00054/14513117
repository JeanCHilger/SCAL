Neuropsychological tests, MRI and SPECT in the evaluation of CNS involvement in SLE. To assess the agreement between presence and location of central nervous system (CNS) structural damage and neuropsychological performance.21 unselected SLE patients underwent a 3 hours-long battery of neuropsychological tests sampling 15 cognitive functions. A neuropsychologist hypothesized for each SLE patient the most likely site of possible involvement, according to the neuropsychological performance. Patients underwent MRI scans within 6 months (3 months before or after) from neuropsychological tests and SPECT.14 of the 21 SLE patients (66.6%) were impaired in at least 1 function among these, 7 patients (33.3%) were mildly impaired and 7 (33.3%) had more than 3 functions impaired. 10 patients (48%) had abnormal MRI scan. Negative and positive agreements between neuropsychological performance and MRI scan were detected in 15 patients (71%A detailed neuropsychological evaluation along with MRI arose as a valid method to exclude or to identify, localize and clinically interpret CNS involvement in SLE. Disagreement between MRI and neuropsychological tests was detected mainly for mild cognitive impairment that might be the expression of functional (inflammatory or ischemic) processes.
