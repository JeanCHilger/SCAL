The putative pheromone androstadienone activates cortical fields in the human brain related to social cognition. Using 15O-butanol positron emission tomography (PET), we measured regional cerebral blood flow changes in five healthy young women during exposure to androstadienone, a putative human pheromone, as well as pleasant (gamma-methyl-ionone), unpleasant (methyl-thio-butanoate), and neutral (dipropylene glycol vehicle compound) odours. Compared with the odorous substances, androstadienone activated a widely distributed neuronal network. Two large cortical fields exhibited consistent activation in each contrast: the anterior part of the inferior lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the posterior part of the superior temporal cortex (STP). Intriguingly, these areas were deactivated by gamma-methyl-ionone and methyl-thio-butanoate. These brain regions can be identified as cortical fields underlying other than olfactory functions, including various aspects of social cognition and attention.
