Application of the OS-EM method to the 123I-IMP ARG method: comparison between FBP and OS-EM methods. We investigated application of the OS-EM method to the (123)I-IMP ARG method to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). First, scan time and subsets were fixed at 20 min and 16, respectively, and the influence of iteration on the CCF and quantitative rCBF values obtained by the ARG method was investigated when the iteration number was set at 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 90. Next, with the number of iterations set at 4, we compared the scanning times of OS-EM and FBP. We determined that the CCF values remained at the same level irrespective of iteration number. Quantitative rCBF values had no association with iteration number, either. Using the quantitative rCBF values obtained by 20-min. scanning with FBP as a standard, the time period for collecting SPECT data was 10 min, without sacrificing image quality or quantification. Quantitative rCBF obtained by OS-EM was estimated to be higher than that by FBP.
