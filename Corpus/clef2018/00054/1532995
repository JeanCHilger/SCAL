Characteristics of the myocardial SPECT images of 99mTc-MIBI and 99mTc-teboroxime. Characteristics of the myocardial distribution of 99mTc-MIBI and 99mTc-Teboroxime was compared with the myocardial distribution of 201Tl. We made summed myocardial images, in which central three short-axis SPECT slices were added. Rectangular region of interest (ROI) was set on each myocardial segment, and mean counts of each myocardial region was obtained using summed short-axis images. The ratio of inferior-to-anterior mean counts (I/A) was 0.69 +/- 0.20 in 99mTc-MIBI and 0.62 +/- 0.16 in 201Tl. The ratio of inferior-to-lateral mean counts was 0.70 +/- 0.18 and 0.65 +/- 0.13, respectively. Both ratios in 99mTc-MIBI were significantly higher than those in 201Tl (p less than 0.05). 201Tl to 99mTc-MIBI ratios of these two values were 1.11 +/- 0.17 (I/A) and 1.08 +/- 0.16 (I/L). The ratios of I/A and I/L of 99mTc-MIBI were about 10 percent higher than those of 201Tl. 99mTc-Teboroxime dynamic short-axis SPECT images of every three-minute were obtained. The ratios of counts in each wall were calculated similarly. After about 8 minutes, gradual increase in hepatic activity can be a cause of quantitative error in the assessment of SPECT images. We obtained the data with a human cardiac phantom. The myocardial phantom filled with 99mTc or 201Tl was placed in the mediastinal portion that is surrounded by the lung (saw dust) and vertebra (plastic bar). The ratio of I/A was 0.79 and I/L was 0.85 in 201Tl. The I/A ratio was 0.93 and I/L was 0.97 in 99mTc. Both ratios in 99mTc were about 15 percent higher than those in 201Tl.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
