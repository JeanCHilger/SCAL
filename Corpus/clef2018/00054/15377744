SPECT imaging of body dysmorphic disorder. [99mTc]Hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain scans were undertaken in six subjects with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). The scans showed a broad range of discrepant findings that do not immediately support a view of BDD as resting on either an obsessive-compulsive or affective disorder spectrum. Nevertheless, involvement of parietal regions is consistent with the characteristic altered body perception of BDD. These preliminary data highlight the need for further systematic functional imaging studies of this condition.
