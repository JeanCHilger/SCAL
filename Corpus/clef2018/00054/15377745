Cerebral perfusion response to successful treatment of depression with different serotoninergic agents. In 19 patients with major depressive disorder, effective treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or amesergide (AMSG) was associated with increased cerebral perfusion in anterior cingulate cortex (SSRI and AMSG) and in medial prefrontal cortex (AMSG). Both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and AMSG exert antidepressant action through the serotonin (5-HT) system as reuptake inhibitors. Amesergide differs from SSRIs in that it is also a highly selective 5-HT antagonist, which may in part account for differences in cerebral blood flow response to treatment.
