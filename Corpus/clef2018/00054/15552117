Quantitative brain FDG/PET studies using dynamic aortic imaging. Positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of cerebral glucose utilization using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) are a useful tool in the investigation of localized brain function in normal and disease states. A major impediment to the application of FDG/PET in clinical investigation has been the need for arterial blood sampling to quantify cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRGlc). Qualitative studies, though informative in a variety of clinical settings, are of limited value for research applications and do not utilize the inherent quantitative nature of PET. We present a novel PET technique employing a whole-body PET tomograph with abdominal aortic imaging from 0 to 30 min as an alternative to arterial blood sampling to obtain the input function for cerebral metabolic rate calculations. Two or three arterial samples taken during the 10-45 min period were used to scale and extend the blood curve and the brain was imaged from 35-55 min post-injection. We performed 12 studies in which both arterial blood sampling and aortic scans were obtained. We found the correlation of global metabolic rates (GMR) when comparing the two techniques to be extremely high (R2 = 0.99). This suggests that the use of dynamic aortic imaging is less invasive and a viable alternative to arterial blood sampling in quantitative FDG/PET imaging.
