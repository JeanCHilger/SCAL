Construction of prokaryotic expression plasmid of fusion protein including porin A and porin B of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and its expression in E. coli. In order to provide a rational research basis for clinical detection and genetic engineering vaccine, plasmid pET-28a (+) encoding both Porin gene PIA and PIB of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was constructed and a fusion protein in E. coli DE3 expressed. The fragments of PIA and PIB gene of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were amplified and cloned into prokaryotic expression plasmid pET-28a (+) with double restriction endonuclease cut to construct recombinant pET-PIB-PIA. The recombinant was verified with restriction endonuclease and sequenced and transformed into E. coli DE3 to express the fusion protein PIB-PIA after induced with IPTG. The results showed PIA-PIB fusion DNA fragment was proved correct through sequencing. A 67 kD (1 kD= 0.992 1 ku) fusion protein had been detected by SDS-PAGE. It was concluded that the fusion protein was successively expressed.
