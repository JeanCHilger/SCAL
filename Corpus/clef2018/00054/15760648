Non-human primate SPECT model for determining cerebral perfusion effects of cerebrovasoactive drugs acting via multiple modes of pharmacological action. Increasing clinical and experimental evidence implicate cerebral hypoperfusion during increased ageing and points to chronic cerebrovascular ischemia as a vital component of the neuropathological progression of dementia. In vivo cerebral perfusion animal models can greatly contribute to the evaluation of drugs and to the screening of drug interactions. This study describes a baboon Papio ursinus model under anaesthesia, for in vivo cerebral blood flow (CBF) determinations, using Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) following the split-dose method with 99mTc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO). Perfusion studies with acetazolamide as intervention clearly showed that the non-human primate model under aneasthesia is sufficiently sensitive to serve in the evaluation of other cerebrovasoactive drugs for induced perfusion changes with significant increases of the R-value (+40%) for comparative measurement when compared to the control value (2.53+/-0.15 vs. 1.79+/-0.13). These findings stimulated investigations of several drugs, i.e. pentifylline (phosphodiesterase inhibitor) nimodipine (calcium channel blocker)
