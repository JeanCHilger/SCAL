Serial change of iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial concentration in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Serial change of the metaiodobenzylguanidine iodine-123 (123I-MIBG) myocardial concentration was investigated in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Eight DCM patients and 6 control subjects were examined. After the injection of thallium-201 and 123I-MIBG, planar chest images were obtained simultaneously for both tracers in every 30-60 min over 5 h. Serial changes of myocardial uptake ratio (MUR) were compared for both tracers. In DCM, the initial MUR of 123I-MIBG did not differ significantly from that of the controls. The washout of 123I-MIBG from the myocardium, however, was significantly increased in DCM. In particular, the decrease in the early phase (15-45 min) was significantly larger in DCM than in the controls (21.2% +/- 7.5% vs. 5.3% +/- 4.0%, P less than 0.01), showing a significant negative correlation with the left ventricular ejection fraction (r = -0.72 P less than 0.05). For 201Tl, neither the initial MUR nor the washout rate different significantly between the two. Thus, an early rapid decrease of the 123I-MIBG myocardial concentration might characterize DCM and reflect the severity of this disease.
