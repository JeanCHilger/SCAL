Optimizing radiolabeled engineered anti-p185HER2 antibody fragments for in vivo imaging. We have recently described the in vivo properties of an iodinated anti-p185HER2 engineered antibody fragment [minibody (scFv-C(H)3)2 80 kDa], made from the internalizing 10H8 monoclonal antibody. Although the 10H8 minibody showed excellent binding to the target in vitro, only modest tumor uptake [5.6 +/- 1.7% injected dose per gram (ID/g) of tissue] was achieved in nude mice bearing MCF7/HER2 breast cancer tumors. Here, in an attempt to improve targeting, the 10H8 minibody was conjugated to 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N, N', N'', N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), radiometal labeled, and evaluated in vivo. The tumor uptake of 111In-DOTA 10H8 minibody was 5.7 +/- 0.1% ID/g, similar to the radioiodinated 10H8 minibody. However, in addition to the expected liver clearance, the kidneys had unexpectedly high activity (34.0 +/- 4.0% ID/g). A minibody derived from a second anti-p185(HER2) antibody (trastuzumab
