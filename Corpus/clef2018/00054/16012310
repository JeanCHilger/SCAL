Value of 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose imaging with dual-head gamma camera in coincidence mode: comparison with computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging in patients with suspected recurrent head and neck cancers. The aim of the present study was to assess the value of dual-head gamma-camera (DHGC) imaging in the coincidence mode using 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose in differentiating recurrent tumor from posttreatment changes in previously treated head and neck cancer.This was a single-center prospective study performed with the approval of our Institutional Review Board. Twenty-nine patients with suspected recurrent head and neck cancers were prospectively enrolled in this study. Dual-head gamma-camera imaging in the coincidence mode followed computed tomography (CT n = 24)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRIThe sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of CT/MRI in the detection of recurrent cancer were 76.5%, 58.3%, 72.2%, 63.6%, and 69%, respectively. In contrast, the sensitivity (100%), NPV (100%), and accuracy (82.8%) of DHGC imaging in the coincidence mode were superior to that of CT/MRI. Dual-head gamma-camera imaging in the coincidence mode had a specificity (58.3%) and PPV (77.3%) comparable to those of CT/MRI.Our data suggest that modified positron emission tomography with DHGC imaging in the coincidence mode is a useful tool in the assessment of recurrent head and neck cancer.
