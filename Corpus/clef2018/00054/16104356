Imaging of thymoma. Thymomas are the most common mediastinal tumors, usually diagnosed initially by CT. CT scanning can aid in characterization of thymoma and can successfully distinguish thymomas from other benign mediastinal tumors and from lymphoma. However, many of the primary mediastinal masses demonstrate overlap between imaging features and frequently resection is advisable for definitive characterization.
