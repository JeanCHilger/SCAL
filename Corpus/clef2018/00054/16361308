Positron emission tomography scanning is not superior to whole body multidetector helical computed tomography in the preoperative staging of colorectal cancer. The role of positron emission tomography with the glucose analogue [18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) in the initial staging of disease in patients with primary colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been adequately assessed.To evaluate the additional value of FDG-PET as a staging modality, complementary to routine multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) in patients with CRC.Forty four patients with CRC underwent preoperative MDCT and FDG-PET. The accuracy of intraoperative macroscopic staging was also investigated compared with histopathological diagnosis. All FDG-PET images were evaluated with respect to detectability of the primary tumour, lymph node involvement, and distant metastases. Both MDCT and FDG-PET diagnoses and treatment plan were compared with surgical and histopathological results.Thirty seven patients underwent surgery. Tumour detection rate was 95% (42/44) for MDCT, 100% (44/44) for FDG-PET, and 100% (37/37) for intraoperative macroscopic diagnosis. Pathological diagnosis of T factor was T1 in five, T2 in four, T3 in 24, and T4 in four cases. Concordance rate with pathological findings of T factor was 57% (21/37) for MDCT and 62% (23/37) for macroscopic diagnosis. Lymph node involvement was pathologically positive in 19 cases. Regarding N factor, overall accuracy was 62% (23/37) for MDCT, 59% (22/37) for FDG-PET, and 70% (26/37) for macroscopic diagnosis. For all 44 patients, FDG-PET findings resulted in treatment changes in only one (2%) patient.FDG-PET is not superior to routine MDCT in the initial staging of primary CRC.
