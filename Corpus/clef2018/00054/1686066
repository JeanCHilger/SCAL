Approaches to the design of biochemical probes for positron emission tomography. Since the development of the 2-deoxy-D-glucose procedure by L. Sokoloff considerable advances have been made in the design of radiotracers for estimation of in-vivo biochemical parameters. Many of these advances are due to the development of positron emission tomography. As a result key biochemical processes can now be evaluated with newly developed positron-emitting labeled enzyme probes in man, in-vivo, allowing the study of a wide range of specific cellular processes in health and disease states.
