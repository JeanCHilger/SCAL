Pancreatic surgery. According to epidemiologic studies, the incidence of acute and chronic pancreatitis and carcinoma of the pancreas are increasing worldwide. This is the result not only of improved diagnostic methods introduced in the last decades (eg, contrast-enhanced computed tomography, "all-in-one" magnetic resonance imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) but also of changes in the environment and nutritional behavior. Once a specific diagnosis has been made, the first-choice interventions in acute and chronic inflammatory pancreatic diseases are predominantly organ-and organ function-preserving surgical procedures. In pancreatic cancer, extended radical surgery and multimodal therapies seem to offer the most benefit. This article provides an overview of recently published articles focusing on surgical treatment options in acute and chronic pancreatitis and carcinoma of the pancreas.
