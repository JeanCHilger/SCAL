Development of SPECT imaging agents for the norepinephrine transporters: [123I]INER. A series of reboxetine analogs was synthesized and evaluated for in vitro binding as racemic mixtures. The best candidate (INER) was synthesized as the optically pure (S,S) enantiomer, labeled with iodine-123 and its in vivo binding determined by SPECT imaging in baboons. The in vivo specificity, selectivity, and kinetics of [123I]INER make it a promising agent for imaging NET in vivo by noninvasive SPECT imaging.
