Anxiety and regional cortical glucose metabolism in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In this study, the authors investigated the relationship between anxiety and regional cortical metabolism in Alzheimer's disease. Using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the authors evaluated anxiety in 41 patients with Alzheimer's disease. Regional cortical glucose metabolism was measured using [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the resting state. Relationships were assessed using voxel-based (SPM2) and anatomic region-based analyses. Higher NPI anxiety score (frequency x severity) was associated with lower metabolism in bilateral entorhinal cortex, anterior parahippocampal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus and insula. Functional activity changes in distinct regions of the cortex contribute to the expression of anxiety in Alzheimer's disease.
