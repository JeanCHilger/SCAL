Alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor status in Alzheimer's disease using 123I-5IA-85380 single-photon-emission computed tomography. Loss of the alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor subtype is found at autopsy in Alzheimer's disease.To investigate in vivo changes in this receptor using single-photon-emission CT (SPECT) with 123I-5-iodo-3-[2(S)-2-azetidinylmethoxy] pyridine (5IA-85380), a novel nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligand which binds predominantly to the alpha4beta2 receptor.32 non-smoking subjects (16 with Alzheimer's disease and 16 normal elderly controls) underwent 123I-5IA-85380 and perfusion (99mTc-hexamethylenepropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO)) SPECT scanning. Region of interest analysis was performed with cerebellar normalisation.Significant bilateral reductions in nicotinic receptor binding were identified in frontal (left, p = 0.004 right, p = 0.002), striatal (left, p = 0.004Using 123I-5IA-85380 SPECT we found changes consistent with significant reductions in the nicotinic alpha4beta2 receptor in cortical and striatal brain regions. This method could facilitate diagnosis and may be useful for monitoring progression of the disease and response to treatment in patients with AD and related diseases.
