The effects of clozapine on cognitive function and regional cerebral blood flow in the negative symptom profile schizophrenia. Cognitive function and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were studied in negative symptom profile schizophrenic patients by using WCST and SPECT.Twenty-one schizophrenic patients who matched the criteria of Andreason's negative symptom profile received SPECT and WCST, and then were treated with clozapine for 8 consecutive weeks. There were 28 and 12 normal subjects as the control groups of WCST and SPECT, respectively.Compared with controls, significantly poorer performance on total trials of category (TT), persevering errors (PE), and non-persevering errors (NPE) of WCST were found in schizophrenia (p < 0.05). The total score of the scale for assessment negative symptoms (SANS) was significantly related with poor TT (r = 0.45, p < 0.01) and PE performance (r = 0.45, p < 0.01). The poor TT, PE, and NPE tasks of WCST and SANS scores in the negative schizophrenic patients were significantly improved through clozapine treatment (p < 0.05). The schizophrenic patients had a significantly lower rCBF in bilateral frontal and temporal lobes and lower change rate of rCBF in bilateral frontal lobes during WCST compared to normal controls (p < 0.05).Negative symptom profile schizophrenia has cognitive deficits and lower rCBF in bilateral frontal and temporal lobes, which suggests that negative symptom profile schizophrenic patients have hypofrontality. Clozapine can improve negative symptoms and improve cognitive dysfunction, although it cannot improve reduced rCBF in the frontal lobes.
