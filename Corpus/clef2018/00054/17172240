Clinical and radiological (PET, MRI) correlations depending on disease progression in patients with multiple sclerosis. The aim of the study was to investigate the structural-functional changes in the cerebral gray matter (cortical and subcortical areas) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) depending on the disease severity. One hundred and seven patients (107) with definite diagnosis of MS (Mc Donald's criteria), aged 16-60 years, illness duration 1-30 years, and 21 healthy age-matched controls have been studied. Neurological assessment including Kurtzke and EDSS scales (range 0-8) was performed in all the patients. The patients and controls underwent MRI with a 1,5 imager and PET using 18F-flurodeoxyglucose (FDG). A type of the disease course was determined as remitting in 63 patients, primarily-progressive in 8, remitting progressive in 6 and secondary-progressive in 30. To analyze pathogenesis of the disease progression, the patients were divided into 3 clinical groups: (1) remitting (RRMS, n=63) (2) progressive (PRMS) with EDSS < or =6 (n=34)
