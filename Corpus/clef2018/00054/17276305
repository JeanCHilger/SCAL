Combined quantitative supine-prone myocardial perfusion SPECT improves detection of coronary artery disease and normalcy rates in women. We sought to determine the diagnostic performance of a recently developed combined supine-prone quantification algorithm for myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (MPS) for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) in women.Consecutive MPS scans of women without known CAD and coronary angiography within 3 months of MPS (n = 168) and with a low likelihood of CAD (n = 291) were considered. Total perfusion deficit (TPD) was automatically derived for supine (S-TPD), prone (P-TPD), and combined prone-supine (C-TPD) data sets. The low-likelihood patients were grouped by bra cup size (A/B, n = 102 C, n = 101Combined supine-prone quantitative MPS in women yields significantly increased specificity and normalcy rates without compromising sensitivity for the detection of CAD compared with standard analysis.
