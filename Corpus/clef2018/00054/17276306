Prognostic value of SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with elevated cardiac troponin I levels and atypical clinical presentation. We determined the prognostic value of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in patients with atypical clinical presentations and unexpected elevation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels.In 156 consecutive patients with atypical presentations for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and elevated cTnI levels undergoing MPI within 30 days, rates of all-cause mortality (100% follow-up median follow-up, 611 days) and 6-month cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (96% follow-upIn patients with cTnI elevation and a low to intermediate risk for ACS, a normal MPI result portends a good prognosis. Patients with abnormal MPI results have a higher 6-month cardiac event rate and a worse survival rate.
