Quantitation of infarct size in patients with chronic coronary artery disease using rest-redistribution Tl-201 myocardial perfusion SPECT: correlation with contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance. Rest and rest-redistribution thallium 201 myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (MPS) has been incompletely validated in patients for determination of the total amount of scarred myocardium. We sought to determine whether rest or redistribution Tl-201 MPS provides an accurate determination of infarct size as defined by delayed contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR).We studied patients (n = 44) with chronic coronary artery disease referred for rest-redistribution Tl-201 MPS, who were also studied by contrast-enhanced CMR within 3 +/- 4 days. Patients were considered retrospectively based on a series of patients referred for clinically indicated MPS. Defect size, as a percent of left ventricular mass (% LV), was determined by quantitative perfusion SPECT (QPS) and compared with the volume of delayed hyperenhancement on contrast-enhanced CMR, normalized to LV mass. Infarct size varied from 0% to 43% LV. Rest QPS defect size correlated with the amount of nonviable myocardium assessed by contrast-enhanced CMR (r = 0.76 mean difference, 4.3% +/- 8.0% LV). When delayed thallium data were considered, redistribution QPS was superior to rest QPS for determination of infarct size (redistribution r = 0.90Rest-redistribution Tl-201 MPS provides a more accurate measurement of total infarct size than rest-only Tl-201 MPS and correlates with contrast-enhanced CMR.
