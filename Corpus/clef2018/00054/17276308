Diagnostic value of left ventricular function after stress and at rest in the detection of multivessel coronary artery disease as assessed by electrocardiogram-gated SPECT. Although transient left ventricular (LV) dilation is a well-known marker for extensive coronary artery disease (CAD), few studies have performed quantitative analysis of LV function after stress and at rest to detect extensive CAD.Poststress and resting gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed in 175 patients with suspected CAD. All of the patients underwent coronary angiography within 3 months of gated SPECT. In the 83 patients with multivessel CAD, the summed difference score was greater (9.2 +/- 7.0 vs 3.3 +/- 4.0, P < .0001), the poststress increase in end-systolic volume (ESV) was larger (7.0 +/- 8.0 mL vs -0.8 +/- 4.7 mL, P < .0001), and the poststress increase in ejection fraction (EF) was less (-4.7% +/- 5.4% vs -0.4% +/- 4.5%, P < .0001) than in the 92 patients with insignificant or single-vessel CAD. In the detection of multivessel CAD, a summed difference score of 9 or greater showed a sensitivity of 46% and specificity of 90%, whereas an increase in ESV of 5 mL or greater and a decrease in EF of 5% or greater after exercise had a sensitivity of 66% and 52%, respectively, and specificity of 87% and 83%, respectively. The multivariate discriminant analysis revealed that the combination of poststress increase in ESV, summed difference score, and diabetes mellitus best identified multivessel CAD, with a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 84% (chi(2), 81.7).The addition of poststress and at-rest LV functional analysis by use of gated SPECT to conventional perfusion analysis helps to better identify patients with multivessel CAD.
