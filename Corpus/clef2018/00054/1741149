The role of combined SPECT studies of regional cerebral blood flow and volume in the detection of intracranial vascular malformations. Brain perfusion (rCBF) (99mTc--HMPAO) and blood volume (rCBV) (99mTc--RBC) investigations were performed by SPECT on 13 patients with intracranial AVM. In each cases the rCBF revealed a decreased tracer uptake at the site of the AVM. In the rCBV SPECT, abnormal AVM structures with increased radioactivity were detected in 92% of cases. In all of the patients surgical resection of the AVM was also carried out. In the cases where the rCBF disturbance was equal or larger than the rCBV abnormality the surgical complications were more frequent it was concluded that combined rCBF--rCBV method is suitable to detect the AVM-s, and to clarify their haemodynamic effects. It is helpful in planning the surgical intervention, and in the follow-up.
