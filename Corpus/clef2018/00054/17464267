Somatostatin receptor PET imaging with Gallium-68 labeled peptides. Imaging somatostatin receptor status with 68Ga labeled peptides has progressed rapidly over the last several years. It has generated great interest, and stimulated further research into the development of DOTA-derivative peptides. It has expanded our knowledge of receptor imaging and enhanced our appreciation of the difference between receptor-based and metabolic imaging, as well as more in-depth evaluation of tumor biology. The availability of the 68Ge/68Ga generator provides an attractive alternative to cyclotron-based positron-emitters, especially if kit-based radiopharmaceutical formulations based upon 68Ga are developed in the future.
