Surface modification of poly(ethylene terephthalate) by plasma polymerization of poly(ethylene glycol). Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) was 'polymerized' onto poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) surface by radio frequency (RF) plasma polymerization of PEG (average molecular weight 200 Da) at a monomer vapour partial pressure of 10 Pa. Thin films strongly adherent onto PET could be produced by this method. The modified surface was characterized by infra red (IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), cross-cut test, contact angle measurements and static platelet adhesion studies. The modified surface, believed to be extensively cross-linked, however showed all the chemical characteristics of PEG. The surface was found to be highly hydrophilic as evidenced by an interfacial free energy of about 0.7 dynes/cm. AFM studies showed that the surface of the modified PET became smooth by the plasma polymerized deposition. Static platelet adhesion studies using platelet rich plasma (PRP) showed considerably reduced adhesion of platelets onto the modified surface by SEM. Plasma 'polymerization' of a polymer such as PEG onto substrates may be a novel and interesting strategy to prepare PEG-like surfaces on a variety of substrates since the technique allows the formation of thin, pin-hole free, strongly adherent films on a variety of substrates.
