Identification and characterization of a novel prespheroid 3-dimensional hepatocyte monolayer on galactosylated substratum. Three-dimensional (3D) hepatocyte spheroids mimicking the structural and functional characteristics of hepatocytes in vivo were self-assembled onto a galactosylated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substratum, and the dynamic process of spheroid formation was investigated using time-lapse confocal microscopy. Hepatocytes cultured on this galactosylated substratum formed small cell-aggregates within 12 h, which gradually merged into "island-like" clusters at approximately 1 day and spread to form prespheroid monolayer within 2 days the prespheroid monolayer was stretched to fold into compact and larger 3D spheroids after 3 days. We compared the expressions of F-actin (cytoskeleton), phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK, cell-substratum interactions) and E-cadherin (cell-cell interactions) during the dynamic process of 3D hepatocyte spheroid formation with the dynamic process of 2D hepatocyte monolayer formation on collagen substratum. Hepatocytes in the prespheroid monolayer stage exhibited the strongest cell-substratum interactions of all 4 stages during spheroid formation with cell-cell interactions and F-actin distribution comparable with those of the 3D hepatocyte spheroids. The prespheroid monolayer also exhibited better hepatocyte polarity (multidrug resistance protein 2) and tight junction (zonula occludens-1) formation, more-differentiated hepatocyte functions (albumin production and cytochrome P450 1 A activity), and higher sensitivity to hepatotoxicity than the conventional 2D hepatocyte monolayer. The transient prespheroid 3D monolayer could be stabilized on a hybrid glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine (GRGDS)/galactose-PET substratum for up to 1 week and destabilized to form 3D spheroids in excess soluble GRGDS peptide.
