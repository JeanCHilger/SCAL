A method of calculating left ventricular functional parameter using gated SPECT myocardial imaging. Based on the half sphere-cylinder myocardial model, a quantitative calculating method of gated SPECT myocardial infraction of the left ventricular functional parameters is proposed. To overcome the shortage of the ellipse model and other normal methods, this method uses the half sphere-cylinder myocardial model and its subarea. The experiment result shows that the data from normal men accord very well with those reported in domestic and international literature. The result from use in the case of left ventricular myocardial infarction is also satisfactory. Therefore, this method is of high value clinically.
