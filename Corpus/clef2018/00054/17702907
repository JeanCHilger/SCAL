Lead pig for use with screw cap vials. A lead pig specifically designed for use with solid screw cap vials is described.The salient features of this design include a compressible polyethylene sleeve, which is housed in the lower section of the pig, and a partially recessed O-ring, which is housed in the upper section of the pig. These features permit both the vial and the cap to be secured independently without the risk of overtightening. Fingertip radiation exposure associated with repetitively opening and closing a screw cap vial containing a sample of (18)F was monitored by use of a fingertip dosimeter.The cumulative fingertip radiation exposure resulting from opening and closing a screw cap vial containing 200 MBq of (18)F-FDG 3 times was 307 muSv without the aid of this lead pig, as compared with 6 muSv when using this device.Use of this lead pig with screw cap vials can significantly reduce fingertip radiation exposure and decrease the likelihood of accidental radioactive contamination of research personnel.
