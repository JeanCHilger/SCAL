The role of the veterinarian in the education and health of pre-school children. Two surveys conducted in pre-schools (n = 156) located in advantaged areas and disadvantaged areas in Pretoria, indicated that animals had social and psychological as well as educational value for pre-school children. All schools (n = 156) utilised animals in some way for the education of pre-school children. Nineteen of the pre-schools in advantaged areas kept animals permanently at the school. All of these schools utilised the zoo. Only 3 of the schools in disadvantaged areas (n = 106) were able to keep animals permanently on the premises although 69 would have liked to keep animals and 77 of the schools visited the zoo at least once a year. Limiting factors included lack of finances and facilities, lack of knowledge on animal management and anxiety about zoonoses. No cases of zoonotic disease in children were recorded. The species of animals utilised at the pre-schools differed from those found most commonly as household pets. Pre-schools favoured rodents, fish and birds rather than carnivores. The role of the veterinarian may include clinical treatment of the animals from the pre-school, advice on management and zoonosis prevention, pet-care counselling, communication with children and their parents in the consulting room, public health aspects and promotion of environmental education.
