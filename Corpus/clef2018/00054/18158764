Role of FDG-PET in the assessment of survival prognosis in melanoma. Positron-emission tomography (PET) employing fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has proven to be a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic method in the staging and restaging of various neoplasms, including melanoma, complementing morphologic imaging. FDG uptake has been correlated with proliferation rate, and thus, the degree of malignancy of a given tumor (i.e., grading). Consecutively, a relationship of survival prognosis and the extent of tumor burden as well as degree of FDG accumulation--determined by FDG-PET--has been suggested in various tumors. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of fluor-18-FDG-PET in order to evaluate the survival prognosis in melanoma. Patient data (n=95) were retrospectively analyzed, and the results of functional FDG-PET staging was correlated with survival data. Time of staging (diagnosis of primary versus recurrence) had no statistically significant effect on survival prognosis when patients were matched for pertaining node metastasis (NM) stages. Differences in survival were owing to the presence of metastatic disease rather than time of staging. Tumor (T)-stage (T1-T4) alone had no effect on survival prognosis when patients were matched for NM stages. Differences in survival were also due to higher rates of lymph node (LN) and organ metastases in higher T-stages. Detection of LN metastases (N1M0) had a statistically significant and predominant impact on 5-year survival (N0M0 80% versus N1M0 45% p<0.01). Additional presence of distant metastases in LN-positive patients (N1M1) had only a statistically insignificant further impact on survival (5-year survival in N1M0 45% versus N1M1 29%
