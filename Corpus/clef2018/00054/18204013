Utility of sonographically guided biopsy in metabolically suspected recurrent lymphoma. The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of sonographically guided biopsy of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid foci on positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in patients with lymphoma.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 56 patients with lymphoma (25 male and 31 female mean age, 48.5 yearsSixty-six sonographically guided biopsies were performed in the 56 patients. Histopathologic results were conclusive in 53 (80%) of 66. No complications occurred during or after the procedure. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy for diagnosis of lymphoma were 100%, 95%, 97%, and 98%, respectively.Sonographically guided biopsy is a safe and effective means for investigating metabolically active lesions on FDG-PET/CT in patients with known lymphoma.
