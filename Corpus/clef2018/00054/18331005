Effects of ionic liquid [bmim][PF6] on absorption spectra and reaction kinetics of the duroquinone triplet state in acetonitrile. The transient absorption spectra and photoinduced electron-transfer process of duroquinone (DQ) in mixed binary solutions of ionic liquid (IL) [bmim][PF6] and acetonitrile (MeCN) have been investigated by laser photolysis at an excitation wavelength of 355 nm. A spectral blue shift of 3DQ* was observed in the IL/MeCN mixtures compared to MeCN. At lower VIL(volume fraction of IL), the interaction between DQ and the solvent is dominant, and the decay rate constant (kobs) of 3DQ* increases steadily with the increasing of VIL to the contrary, at higher VIL, the network structures due to the hydrogen bond and viscosity are dominant, and the decay rate constant decreases obviously with increasing VIL. A critical point (turnover) was observed at VIL = approximately 0.30. The dependence of the observed growth rate (kgr) of the photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) products on VIL is complex and shows a special change
