18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose uptake predicts clinical outcome in patients with gefitinib-treated non-small cell lung cancer. To evaluate response and survival according to (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose uptake at presentation in patients with gefitinib-treated non-small cell lung cancer.We retrospectively analyzed 84 positron emission tomography/computed tomography findings. Patient characteristics, response rates, and survivals were evaluated according to the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of primary tumor. The cutoff value of SUVs was obtained from receiver operating characteristic analysis.The response rate (RR) was higher for never-smokers (41%) than ever-smokers (9% P=0.001). Patients with adenocarcinoma showed higher RR than those with other tumor histopathology (35% versus 9%These results suggest that low SUVs at presentation can predict favorable response and survival in gefitinib-treated non-small cell lung cancer patients.
