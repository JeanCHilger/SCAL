Thoracic radiography of pet macaques in Sulawesi, Indonesia. This report describes the results from a study of thoracic radiographs taken on a sample (n = 20) of pet macaque monkeys (Macaca) on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. We present findings relating to general thoracic health, as well as describe our field methods and outline some of the challenges of conducting thoracic radiography in remote areas of the developing world. Examination of the radiographic images identified six possible cases of cardiac enlargement, and one case of minor lung consolidation possibly consistent with tuberculosis. The study did not identify major radiographic evidence of significant respiratory illness in the monkeys as might be expected based on the intense exposure to human respiratory diseases. These largely negative findings may be in part a consequence of image quality which seems to be influenced by power output and incomplete inspiration during film exposure.
