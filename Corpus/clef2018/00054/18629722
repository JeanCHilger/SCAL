Nicotine does not compromise resting myocardial blood flow autoregulation in smokers at high cardiovascular risk. Nicotine has been recognized for years as being pharmacologically responsible for the sympathoexcitatory effects of smoking. The effects of nicotine supplementation on myocardial blood flow as assessed by positron emission tomography are, however, unknown. We tested the hypothesis that nicotine substitution could interfere with myocardial blood flow autoregulation at rest in habitual smokers at risk of coronary artery disease. The short-term effect of a 4-mg nicotine tablet on myocardial blood flow was quantified with 13N ammonia positron emission tomography in 12 smokers with high cardiovascular risk (10 males and 2 females mean age = 58+/-8 years
