Cortical glucose metabolism positively correlates with gamma-oscillations in nonlesional focal epilepsy. Why do the epileptogenic foci appear hypometabolic on interictal glucose metabolism positron emission tomography (PET) in a substantial proportion of patients with focal epilepsy but appear normo- or even hyper-metabolic in others? Such observations on interictal PET have not been fully explained by the frequency of interictal spike discharges alone. In the present study using digital electrocorticography monitoring system with high-frequency sampling, we determined how well regression models using spectral ECoG measures and spike frequency derived from 651 intracranial electrode sites explained cortical glucose metabolic patterns in six children with nonlesional focal epilepsy. Univariate regression analysis demonstrated that spectral amplitudes at gamma ranges (32-64, 64-100, and 100-200 Hz) were tightly correlated with interictal glucose uptake in the given electrode site in all children. Spike frequency was negatively correlated with interictal glucose uptake in three patients, whose epileptogenic focus appeared hypometabolic and interictal epileptiform discharge often consisted of a spike followed by a subsequent delta-wave. Conversely, spike frequency was positively correlated with interictal glucose uptake in the other three patients, whose epileptogenic foci appeared more hypermetabolic compared to the surrounding regions and associated with frequent interictal spike bursts. The spatial pattern of interictal glucose metabolism in nonlesional focal epilepsy may be better explained by gamma-oscillations derived from epileptiform and physiological neuronal activities rather than the frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges alone.
