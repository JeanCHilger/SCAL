Preoperative evaluation of liver function using 99mTc-diethyl iminodiacetic acid based on single photon emission computed tomography. To establish a three-dimentional liver function evaluation system using 99mTc-diethyl iminodiacetic acid (99mTc-EHIDA) scintigraphy based on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Totally 16 patients with liver lesions were divided into cirrhosis group and non-cirrhosis group. SPECT was performed 2 days before operation and 5 days after operation. Serum liver functions were examined on the same day of scintigraphy. SPECT images of areas of interest of heart and liver were aquired. Time of the peak of EHIDA density in liver (Tpeak), five-minutes heart liver index (HLI5), blood clearance index (HH15), receptor index (LHL15), and the predictive values were calculated.Tpeak was not significantly different between two groups, while HLI5, HH15, and LHL15 were significantly different (P = 0.033, P = 0.001, and P = 0.005). HLI, and LHL15 were significantly correlated with preoperative total protein and prealbumin levels (P = 0.003, P = 0.015, P = 0.022, P = 0.038) and post-operative prealbumin (P = 0.037, P = 0.042). The predictive values of HLI5 and LHL15 correlated well with postoperative HLI5 and LHL15 (r = 0.675, P = 0.016 r = 0.629, P = 0.028).The three-dimentional liver function evaluation system using 99mTc-EHIDA based on liver SPECT may facilitate the further studies of risks of liver surgery.
