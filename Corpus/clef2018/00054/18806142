Pulmonary nodules: detection, assessment, and CAD. The imaging of pulmonary nodules is an evolving and dynamic field. In this review, we discuss the detection and multitechnique characterization of pulmonary nodules, emphasizing the impact of technological advances on both noninvasive and invasive evaluation and surveillance. The potential contribution of MRI, evolving imaging-guided techniques, and computer applications are also discussed.Advances in MDCT and PET and the potential contribution of fast-imaging MRI sequences and computer applications should continue to improve our evaluation of the solitary pulmonary nodule.
