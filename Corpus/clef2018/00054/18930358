Clinical significance of postradiotherapy [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging in management of head-and-neck cancer-a long-term outcome report. To determine the accuracy and prognostic significance of post-treatment [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma after radiotherapy (RT).This was a retrospective study of 188 patients with head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma who had undergone FDG-PET within 12 months after completing RT. All living patients had >/=1 year of follow-up after FDG-PET. All patients had undergone intensity-modulated RT, 128 with definitive and 60 with postoperative intensity-modulated RT.For all patients, the median follow-up after RT completion was 32.6 months and after FDG-PET was 29.2 months. For the neck, 171 patients had negative FDG-PET findings. Of these results, two were falsely negative. Seventeen patients had positive FDG-PET findings, of which 12 were true-positive findings. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for FDG-PET in the assessment of the treatment response in the neck was 86%, 97%, 71%, and 99%, respectively. For the primary site, 151 patients had negative FDG-PET findings, of which two were falsely negative. Thirty-seven patients had positive FDG-PET findings, of which 12 were true-positive findings. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for FDG-PET in the assessment of the treatment response in the primary site was 86%, 86%, 32.4%, and 98.7%, respectively. Patients with positive post-RT PET findings had significantly worse 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival.The results of our study have shown that the findings of post-RT FDG-PET have a high negative predictive value and are a significant prognostic factor. It can provide guidance for the management of head-and-neck cancer after definitive treatment.
