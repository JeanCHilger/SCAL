Left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony as assessed by phase analysis of ECG-gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has shown benefits in patients with severe heart failure. The traditional criteria to select patients for CRT (NYHA class III or IV, depressed left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, and prolonged QRS duration) result in at least 30% of the selected patients with no response to CRT. Recent studies with tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) have shown that the presence of LV dyssynchrony is an important predictor for response to CRT. Phase analysis has been developed to assess LV dyssynchrony from electrocardiography-gated single photon emission computed tomography (GSPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). This technique uses Fourier harmonic functions to approximate regional wall thickening over the cardiac cycle and to calculate phases of regional onset of mechanical contraction (OMC). These OMC phases are obtained three-dimensionally over the left ventricle to generate an OMC phase distribution. Quantitative indices are calculated from the phase distribution to assess degree of LV dyssynchrony. This technique has been compared to other methods of measuring LV dyssynchrony and shown promising results in clinical evaluations. In this review, the phase analysis methodology is described and its up-to-date validations are summarized.
