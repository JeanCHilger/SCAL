Serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphisms modify the association between paroxetine serotonin transporter occupancy and clinical response in major depressive disorder. In major depressive disorder, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors target the serotonin transporter (SERT). Their response rates (30-50%) are modified by SERT promotor polymorphisms (5-HTTLPR).To quantify the relationship between SERT occupancy and response, and whether 5-HTTLPR is a modifier.Drug-free depressed outpatients (n=49 both sexespercentage decrease in 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and response (> or =50% decrease of 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale).A significant positive relationship between SERT occupancy and clinical response existed only in the L(A)/L(A) genotype (P<0.002). Relative to paroxetine serum concentrations maximal midbrain SERT occupancy was numerically higher for L(A)/L(A) compared with other genotypes, but this difference was nonsignificant (P=0.188).Higher SERT occupancy is only associated with more clinical improvement in the L(A)/L(A) genotype. We hypothesize that the L(A)/L(A) carriers have a more dynamic serotonergic system, which seems more responsive to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
