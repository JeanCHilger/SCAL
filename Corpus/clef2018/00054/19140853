Prognostic study of cardiac events in Japanese high risk hemodialysis patients using I-BMIPP-SPECT: B-SAFE study design. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Such patients frequently develop complications such as asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). Accordingly, CAD must ideally be diagnosed at an early stage to improve prognosis. Although myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is valuable for diagnosing CAD, the stress test is not always applicable to patients on hemodialysis. Thus, we proposed a multicenter, prospective cohort study called "B-SAFE" to investigate the applicability of resting (123)I-labeled beta-methyl-iodophenylpentadecanoic acid ((123)I-BMIPP)-SPECT will be used to diagnose cardiac disease and evaluate the prognosis of hemodialysis patients by imaging myocardial fatty acid metabolism. B-SAFE began enrolling patients from June 2006 at 48 facilities. We performed (123)I-BMIPP-SPECT on 702 hemodialysis patients with risk factors for CAD until 30 November 2007 and plan to follow up for three years. The primary endpoints will be cardiac death and sudden death. This study should end in 2010.
