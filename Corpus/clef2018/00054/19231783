No signs of metabolic hyperactivity in patients with unilateral condylar hyperactivity: an in vivo positron emission tomography study. The purpose of this study was to assess bone growth and blood flow in the condylar region in patients with unilateral condylar hyperactivity (UCH) by use of positron emission tomography (PET).This prospective study included 7 patients with UCH and a control group of 6 volunteers. In addition to normal clinical investigations, labeled fluoride ((18)F(-)) and oxygen 15-labeled water (H(2)(15)O) PET scans were performed.In control subjects the net rate of fluoride influx, representing bone metabolism, was similar for left and right condylar sides. Interestingly, this was not significantly different from the affected condyles in UCH patients. Rather, the net rate of fluoride influx on the contralateral side of UCH patients was reduced significantly compared with the affected side (P= .02) and control subjects (P= .004). The mean blood flow on the left and right condylar sides in control subjects was not significantly different. The same was true for the hyperactive and contralateral condyles of UCH patients. Blood flow in the condylar region in UCH patients was similar to that in the control group.There was no evidence of an abnormally high rate of bone growth in the affected condylar region in UCH patients. Instead, the rate of bone growth appeared to be reduced in the contralateral condylar region. These PET results are in contrast to the characteristic clinical picture of UCH patients and suggest the possibility of subgroups in patients with a mandibular asymmetry caused by UCH. Furthermore, no evidence of hypervascularization of the condylar region in UCH patients was found.
