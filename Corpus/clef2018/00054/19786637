Predictors of improvement of unrepaired moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation in patients undergoing elective isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The persistence of moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) after isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery is an important independent predictor of long-term mortality. The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of postoperative improvement in moderate IMR in patients with ischemic heart disease undergoing elective isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery.The study population consisted of 135 patients with ischemic heart disease (age, 65+/-9 years 81% male) and moderate IMR undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Fourteen patients died before the 12-month follow-up echocardiography and were excluded. At the 12-month follow-up, 57 patients showed no or mild IMR (improvement group), whereas 64 patients failed to improve (failure group). Before coronary artery bypass graft surgery, the improvement group had significantly more viable myocardium and less dyssynchrony between papillary muscles than the failure group (P<0.001). All other preoperative parameters were similar in both groups. Large extent (> or =5 segments) of viable myocardium (odds ratio, 1.45Reliable improvement in moderate IMR by isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery was observed only in patients with concomitant presence of viable myocardium and absence of dyssynchrony between papillary muscles.
