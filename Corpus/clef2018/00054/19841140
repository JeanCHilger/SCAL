Knee-to-ankle mosaicplasty for the treatment of osteochondral lesions of the ankle joint. Osteochondral lesions are frequently seen in athletes after ankle injuries. At this time, osteochondral autologous transplantation (OATS, mosaicplasty) is the only surgical treatment that replaces the entire osteochondral unit in symptomatic lesions.To evaluate the clinical and radiological midterm to long-term outcome of ankles treated with knee-to-ankle mosaicplasty.Case series Level of evidence, 4.Clinical evaluation consisted of patient satisfaction, pain evaluation (visual analog scale [VAS]), American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle score, sports activity score, range of motion, the radiological evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT) analysis of both the ankle and the knee joint.Twelve of 21 patients (mean age, 43 years male, 8Indications for mosaicplasty with a plug transfer from the knee to the talus must be considered carefully, as at midterm, moderate outcome and considerable donor-site morbidity may be found.
