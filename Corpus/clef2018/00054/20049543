Acquisition parameters for oncologic imaging with a new SPECT/multislice CT scanner. Single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) delivers in a single imaging modality the functional-metabolic information from the SPECT image, combined with the detailed anatomical information from a diagnostic quality CT scanner.In this review, we provide the details for the acquisition, processing, and display of the SPECT, as well as the CT, and the fused SPECT/CT images, with one of the newest devices that combines a dual-headed gamma camera with a multislice CT scanner. Also, we go over the performance characteristics, including the planning and installation requirements for this type of scanners. In addition, we describe what are the current and feasible near-future applications of this new and exciting hybrid imaging modality.The ability to combine an optimized state-of-the-art SPECT image, with resolutions down to 5 mm, with a diagnostic quality CT image-using slices as thin as 1.25 mm-provides a diagnostic advantage that potentially can deliver a more convenient and faster diagnosis, with clinical implications in a significant percentage of patients. This imaging technique has been investigated in a wide range of studies for the oncologic patient, including but not limited to bone scintigraphy, (111)In-pentetreotide scintigraphy, lymphoscintigraphy, (67)Ga and labeled leukocyte infection imaging, (131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine, parathyroid scintigraphy, (131)I diagnostic scintigraphy, and (111)In ProstaScint, and for planning of radionuclide therapy.Therefore, this evolving and exciting imaging modality will continue to grow and define its place as an integral part of the evaluation of the cancer patient.
