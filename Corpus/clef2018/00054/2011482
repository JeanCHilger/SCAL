Developmental changes in normal images of 123I-IMP brain SPECT in young children. In an attempt to determine the normal evolution of N-isopropyl p-I-123-iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), we selected 12 children (an age range of 1 month-3 year) who were diagnosed as normal in follow-up between 6 month-3 year by neurological examination, X-ray computed tomography, electroencephalography and 123I-IMP SPECT in our 78 cases. SPECT of the brain was performed 30 minutes after intravenous administration of 74 MBq (2 mCi) 123I-IMP using a rotating gamma camera equipped with a 30-degree slant-hole collimator. In neonates, a predominant activity was observed in the basal ganglia and thalamus, with only slight parietal and occipital activity. Frontal cortex was barely recognizable. Under 1 year, cortical activity was gradually increased and clearly visible. After 1 year, SPECT images were similar to those of adult. In conclusion there was an important modification of the regional perfusion pattern in relation to brain maturation.
