A bilateral foot drop due to neuroschistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease, uncommon in Europe and the USA. We present an unusual case of intracerebral schistosomiasis, presenting with a bilateral foot drop. We describe unique magnetic resonance spectroscopy characteristics that can contribute to diagnosis and follow up of a neuroschistosomiasis infection.
