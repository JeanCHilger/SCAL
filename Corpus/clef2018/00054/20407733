18F-FDG-PET and MRI in patients with malignancies of the liver and pancreas. Accuracy of retrospective multimodality image registration by using the CT-component of PET/CT. To evaluate the accuracy of retrospective rigid image registration and fusion between F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the upper abdomen.Image fusion of PET and MRI was performed in 30 patients with suspected malignancy of the liver or pancreas. Using a commercially available image fusion tool capable of rigid manual point-based registration, PET-Images were retrospectively registered and fused by matching eight homologous points in the 3D spoiled gradient echo (GRE) MRI sequences acquired in portal venous phase and in the CT-component of PET/CT. Two separate observers (R1, R2) assessed accuracy of image registration by determining the distances in the x-, y- and z-axis as well as the absolute distance between anatomical landmarks which differed from the landmarks chosen for registration. Quality of fusion was graded using a three point grading scale (1 poorly fused 2 satisfactory fusedMean time of registration per patient was less than 2 minutes. Objective registration assessment showed errors between 2.4-6.3 mm in x-axis: mean 3.6 mm (R1) 4.6 mm (R2), 2.3-9.3 mm in y-axis (mean 5.1 mmRetrospective rigid image fusion of FDG-PET and MRI of the upper abdomen using the CT-component of PET/CT for registration is feasible without adaptation in image acquisition protocols and shows sub-centimeter registration errors in most cases.
