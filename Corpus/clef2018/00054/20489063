Role of PET/CT in ovarian cancer. The purpose of this article is to review the role of FDG PET/CT in ovarian cancer, which is the leading cause of death among gynecologic cancers.FDG PET/CT can significantly modify the assessment of the extent of primary and recurrent ovarian cancer and, hence, often alters patient management substantially. FDG PET/CT has thus become a critical tool for the preoperative evaluation of women with primary ovarian cancer and for postoperative follow-up assessment for evidence of recurrence in these patients.
