Single photon emission computed tomography demonstrated efficacy of 17β-estradiol therapy in male rats after trauma-hemorrhage and extended hypotension. This study evaluated the effect of 17β-estradiol (E2) administration on cardiovascular parameters in male rats after trauma-hemorrhage and for an extended period (3 hours) of severe hypotension, based on blood-pool single photon emission computed tomography imaging.After a 5-cm midline laparotomy, male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intravenously with Tc-bovine serum albumin the animals were then bled for >45 minutes to reach maximum bleedout (MBOThe percentages of injected dose of Tc-bovine serum albumin in heart, kidney, and liver after E2 administration were significantly higher than those after CD administration (p = 0.036, 0.025, and 0.028 for heart, kidney, and liver, respectively), whereas those in brain were not different between E2 and CD administration (p = 0.343).The significantly larger blood volume maintained in heart, kidney, and liver of rats after E2 therapy compared with control supports the notion that E2 produces salutary effects on the cardiovascular system after trauma-hemorrhage and even extended periods of severe hypotension.
