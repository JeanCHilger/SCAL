 Antimicrobial peptides are small, cationic, amphiphilic peptides of 12–50 amino acids with microbicidal activity against both bacteria and fungi (1). The mammalian defensins can be subdivided into three main classes according to their structural differences: α-defensins, β-defensins, and theta-defensins. Mammalian α-defensins are predominantly found in neutrophils and in small intestinal epithelial cells, whereas mammalian β-defensins have been isolated from both leukocytes and epithelial cells. Recently, two novel human β-defensins (human β-defensin-3 (HBD-3) and human β-defensin-4 (HBD-4)) have been identified. Similar to HBD-1 and HBD-2, HBD-3 has microbicidal activity toward the Gram-negative bacteria (e.g.,
