 Adenoviruses (Ads) comprise a non-enveloped icosahedral protein shell (capsid) 70–100 nm in diameter surrounding an inner vial genome core (1). Human Ads consist of 51 distinct serotypes that are classified into six subgroups (species) designated A–F (2). Some serotypes such as serotypes 2 (Ad2) and 5 (Ad5) of species C only induce a mild, non-oncogenic respiratory infection, making them suitable for development of Ad-based vaccines and gene delivery vehicles for systematic administrations (1). Their core genome, a linear, double-stranded DNA of ~36 kb, contains five early transcription units (E1A, E1B, E2, E3, and E4), four intermediate units (IVA2, IX, VAI, and VAII), and one later transcription unit (2). The functions in the early transcription regions have been well identified: E1A activates cell cycles and initiates DNA replication E1B blocks apoptosis induced by E1A activity
