The Clinical Application of Video Mediastinoscopy and CT in the N Staging of Preoperative Lung Cancer.. Preoperative lung cancer with mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis can be diagnosed by vedio mediastinoscopy (VM) and CT. This study was to explore the value of VM and CT in the diagnosis of N staging of preoperative lung cancer, and to discuss the difference between the two methods.Forty-eight cases diagnosed of lung cancer by CT or PET-CT were examined by VM. The sensitivity, specificity, validity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of VM and CT were speculated according to the postoperative pathological reports, and the difference between VM and CT in the diagnosis of lung cancer with mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis was discussed.(1)Under the examination of VM, 31 patients with the negative outcome received the direct operation 14 patients with N2 received 2 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy before operationVM is superior to CT in the diagnosis of N staging of preoperative lung cancer Due to its safety and effectiveness, VM will be wildly used in the field of thoracic surgery.
