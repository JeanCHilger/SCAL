New protocol of myocardial SPECT imaging with technetium-99m sestamibi for reducing the time interval between rest and adenosine stress phases. We have developed a new protocol of myocardial perfusion-gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), by use of technetium-99m sestamibi (MIBI), in which SPECT imaging at rest followed by SPECT imaging after adenosine with low level ergometer stress can be conducted by use of the Monzen position within a shortened total testing time of 1 h or less. The study group consisted of 137 patients who underwent this new imaging protocol. The diagnostic quality of the images was as good as that of images obtained with the conventional method (30-60 min after the injection of MIBI). The SPECT image quality for the 137 patients was evaluated, and the percentages of images rated as excellent, good, fair, and poor were 65.3, 27.4, 5.8, and 1.5% for the rest image, and 68.2, 21.9, 8.4, and 1.5% for the stress image, respectively. The shortened total testing time reduced the physical and mental burden on the patient compared with that of conventional myocardial perfusion imaging. Because this technique allows us to perform rest and stress myocardial imaging within a short period, it is expected to be very useful in the clinical setting.
