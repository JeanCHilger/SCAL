Soft microelectrode linear array for scanning electrochemical microscopy. A linear array of eight individual addressable microelectrodes has been developed in order to perform high-throughput scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) imaging of large sample areas in contact regime. Similar to previous reports, the soft microelectrode array was fabricated by ablating microchannels on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film and filling them with carbon ink. Improvements have been achieved by using a 5 Î¼m thick Parylene coating that allows for smaller working distances, as the probe was mounted with the Parylene coating facing the sample surface. Additionally, the application of a SECM holder allows scanning in contact regime with a tilted probe, reducing the topographic effects and assuring the probe bending direction. The main advantage of the soft microelectrode array is the considerable decrease in the experimental time needed for imaging large sample areas. Additionally, soft microelectrode arrays are very stable and can be used several times, since the electrode surface can be regenerated by blade cutting. Cyclic voltammograms and approach curves were recorded in order to assess the electrochemical properties of the device. An SECM image of a gold on glass chip was obtained with high resolution and sensitivity, proving the feasibility of soft microelectrode arrays to detect localized surface activity. Finite element method (FEM) simulations were performed in order to establish the effect of diffusion layer overlapping between neighboring electrodes on the respective approach curves.
