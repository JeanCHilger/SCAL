Closed-form kinetic parameter estimation solution to the truncated data problem. In a dedicated cardiac single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) system, the detectors are focused on the heart and the background is truncated in the projections. Reconstruction using truncated data results in biased images, leading to inaccurate kinetic parameter estimates. This paper has developed a closed-form kinetic parameter estimation solution to the dynamic emission imaging problem. This solution is insensitive to the bias in the reconstructed images that is caused by the projection data truncation. This paper introduces two new ideas: (1) it includes background bias as an additional parameter to estimate, and (2) it presents a closed-form solution for compartment models. The method is based on the following two assumptions: (i) the amount of the bias is directly proportional to the truncated activities in the projection data, and (ii) the background concentration is directly proportional to the concentration in the myocardium. In other words, the method assumes that the image slice contains only the heart and the background, without other organs, that the heart is not truncated, and that the background radioactivity is directly proportional to the radioactivity in the blood pool. As long as the background activity can be modeled, the proposed method is applicable regardless of the number of compartments in the model. For simplicity, the proposed method is presented and verified using a single compartment model with computer simulations using both noiseless and noisy projections.
