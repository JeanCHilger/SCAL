Walking the dog and moving the cat: rabies serology in the context of international pet travel schemes. Data of 13'469 blood samples from 10'999 dogs and 2'470 cats tested for rabies neutralizing antibodies within the framework of pet travel schemes were analysed for single and combined factors influencing antibody titres and failures. The time span between vaccination and drawing the blood sample was confirmed as a major source of failure in dogs with a proportion of 23 % at 4 months after primary vaccination (single dose). Failures in dogs and cats (titre < 0.5 IU) were significantly reduced after double primary vaccination (2 doses within 7 - 10 days), although failures reached comparable levels in dogs as early as 6 months after vaccination. In contrast, failure after vaccination was generally below 5 % in dogs and absent in cats after a booster applied at earliest 12 months after single primary vaccination. Statistically significant differences between the failures of the vaccine brands «Rabisin» (1.5 %), «Defensor» (6.7 %), «Nobivac Rabies» (11.0 %) and «Rabdomun» (18.2 %) were found in dogs but also between the titres induced in cats. Significant differences were found between different dog breeds with some small breeds showing a significantly higher responsiveness. Taken together, a new regimen for rabies vaccination consisting of double primary vaccination with a short interval of 7 - 10 days and a one-year booster appears to be highly recommended for dogs and cats.
