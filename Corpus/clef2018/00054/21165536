FDG PET/CT in cancer therapy monitoring: computer-assisted analysis of baseline together with up to two follow-ups. We developed and tested a software tool for computer-assisted analysis of FDG-PET/CT in cancer therapy monitoring. The tool provides automatic semi-quantitative analysis of a baseline scan together with up to two follow-up scans (standardized uptake values, glycolytic volume). The tool also supports visual analysis by local spatial registration which allows display of tumor lesions with the same orientation in all scans. The tool's stability and accuracy was tested at typical everyday image quality.Ten unselected cancer patients in whom three FDG PET/CT scans had been performed were included. A total of 18 lesions were analyzed.Automatic lesion tracking worked properly in all lesions but one. In this lesion local coregistration had to be adjusted manually which, however, is easily performed with the tool. Semi-automatic lesion segmentation and fully automatic semi-quantitative analysis worked properly in all cases. Computer-assisted analysis was significantly less time consuming than manual analysis.The novel software tool appears useful for analysis of FDG-PET/CT in cancer therapy monitoring in clinical routine patient care.
