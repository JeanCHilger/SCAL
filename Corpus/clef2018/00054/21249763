2-[ Osteosarcoma typically affects adolescents and represents the most common primary bone tumor in childhood (1). Approximately 25% of osteosarcomas metastasize to the lung (2). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are glycoproteins that are glycosylated with two or three heparan sulfate polysaccharide chains. HSPGs are associated with the cell surface of cells (3). HSPGs play an important role in cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix adhesion. Heparan sulfate binds to a variety of protein ligands (e.g., growth factors and interleukins) and regulates a wide variety of biological activities, including developmental processes, angiogenesis, blood coagulation, and tumor metastasis. HSPGs are overexpressed on a variety of tumor cells including osteosarcoma cells (4, 5). Sun et al. (6) identified a new 12-mer peptide (OSP-1, ASGALSPSRLDT) with the use of phage display screening against human osteosarcoma 143B cells with a high homology to the 17-28 amino acid residues of heparinase II/III. Heparinases bind and cleave cell-surface HSPGs. OSP-1 was radiolabeled with 4-nitrophenyl-2-[
