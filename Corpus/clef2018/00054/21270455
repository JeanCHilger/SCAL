Improved outcome prediction by SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging after CT attenuation correction. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of attenuation correction with CT (CT-AC) on the prognostic value of SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT MPI).The summed stress score (SSS 20-segment model) was obtained from filtered backprojection (FBP) and iterative reconstruction with CT-AC in 876 consecutive patients undergoing a 1-d stress-rest (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin SPECT MPI study for the evaluation of known or suspected coronary artery disease. Survival free of major adverse cardiac events (MACEsAt a mean follow-up of 2.3 Â± 0.6 y, a total of 184 adverse events occurred in 145 patients, including 35 MACEs (16 cardiac deaths [rate, 1.8%] and 19 nonfatal myocardial infarctions [rate, 2.2%]). With FBP, an SSS of 0-3 best distinguished patients with a low MACE rate (0.6%), followed by an SSS of 4-8 (4.3%), with increased MACE rate, and an SSS of 9-13 (3.8%), which was comparable. By contrast, with CT-AC the discrimination of low from intermediate MACE rate was best observed between an SSS of 0 (0%) and an SSS of 1-3 (3.7%), with a plateau at an SSS of 4-8 (3.2%).CT-AC for SPECT MPI allows improved risk stratification. The prognostically relevant SSS cutoff is shifted toward lower values.
