18F-fluromisonidazole PET imaging as a biomarker for the response to 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid in colorectal xenograft tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate (18)F-fluromisonidazole ((18)F-FMISO) PET for monitoring the tumor response to the antivascular compound 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA vadimezan).(18)F-FMISO PET was performed 3 h before and 24 h after treatment with DMXAA (20 mg/kg) in mice bearing HT29 xenograft tumors. Pimonidazole was coadministered with the first (18)F-FMISO injection, and 2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl)acetamide (EF5) was coadministered with the second one. Hoechst 33342 was administered 5 min before sacrifice. Digital autoradiograms of tumor sections were acquired this acquisition was followed by immunofluorescence microscopic visualization of pimonidazole, EF5, the Hoechst 33342, CD31, and Î±-smooth muscle actin.DMXAA treatment resulted in a marked reduction in the (18)F-FMISO mean standardized uptake value (SUV(mean)) in approximately half of the treated tumors. The reduction in SUV(mean) correlated with a decrease in the fraction of tumor area staining positive for both EF5 and pimonidazole. Compared with untreated controls, tumors with decreasing SUV(mean) had significantly fewer perfused microvessels.(18)F-FMISO PET could distinguish between different tumor responses to DMXAA treatment. However, a reduction in (18)F-FMISO SUV(mean) after DMXAA treatment was indicative of reduced perfusion and therefore delivery of (18)F-FMISO, rather than a reduction in tumor hypoxia.
