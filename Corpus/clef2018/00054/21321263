Shortened acquisition protocols for the quantitative assessment of the 2-tissue-compartment model using dynamic PET/CT 18F-FDG studies. (18)F-FDG kinetics are quantified by a 2-tissue-compartment model. The routine use of dynamic PET is limited because of this modality's 1-h acquisition time. We evaluated shortened acquisition protocols up to 0-30 min regarding the accuracy for data analysis with the 2-tissue-compartment model.Full dynamic series for 0-60 min were analyzed using a 2-tissue-compartment model. The time-activity curves and the resulting parameters for the model were stored in a database. Shortened acquisition data were generated from the database using the following time intervals: 0-10, 0-16, 0-20, 0-25, and 0-30 min. Furthermore, the impact of adding a 60-min uptake value to the dynamic series was evaluated. The datasets were analyzed using dedicated software to predict the results of the full dynamic series. The software is based on a modified support vector machines (SVM) algorithm and predicts the compartment parameters of the full dynamic series.The SVM-based software provides user-independent results and was accurate at predicting the compartment parameters of the full dynamic series. If a squared correlation coefficient of 0.8 (corresponding to 80% explained variance of the data) was used as a limit, a shortened acquisition of 0-16 min was accurate at predicting the 60-min 2-tissue-compartment parameters. If a limit of 0.9 (90% explained variance) was used, a dynamic series of at least 0-20 min together with the 60-min uptake values is required.Shortened acquisition protocols can be used to predict the parameters of the 2-tissue-compartment model. Either a dynamic PET series of 0-16 min or a combination of a dynamic PET/CT series of 0-20 min and a 60-min uptake value is accurate for analysis with a 2-tissue-compartment model.
