Multimetallic complexes of group 10 and 11 metals based on polydentate dithiocarbamate ligands. The ligands KS(2)CN(Bz)CH(2)CH(2)N(Bz)CS(2)K (K(2)L(1)), N(CH(2)CH(2)N(Me)CS(2)Na)(3) (Na(3)L(2)), and the new chelates {(CH(2)CH(2))NCS(2)Na}(3) (Na(3)L(3)) and {CH(2)CH(2)N(CS(2)Na)CH(2)CH(2)CH(2)NCS(2)Na}(2) (Na(4)L(4)), react with the gold(I) complexes [ClAu(PR(3))] (R = Me, Ph, Cy) and [ClAu(IDip)] to yield di-, tri-and tetragold compounds. Larger metal units can also be coordinated by the longer, flexible linker, K(2)L(1). Thus two equivalents of cis-[PtCl(2)(PEt(3))(2)] react with K(2)L(1) in the presence of NH(4)PF(6) to yield the bimetallic complex [L(1){Pt(PEt(3))(2)}(2)](PF(6))(2). The compounds [NiCl(2)(dppp)] and [MCl(2)(dppf)] (M = Ni, Pd, Pt dppp = 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane, dppf = 1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) also yield the dications, [L(1){Ni(dppp)}(2)](2+) and [L(1){Ni(dppf)}(2)](2+) in an analogous fashion. In the same manner, reaction between [(L'(2))(AuCl)(2)] (L'(2) = dppm, dppf
