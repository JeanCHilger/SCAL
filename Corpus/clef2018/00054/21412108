Dual-time-point fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for diagnosis of cervical lymph node metastases in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether dual-time-point fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography image can improve nodal diagnosis in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).One hundred six HNSCC patients were enrolled. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography images were obtained twice: 1 and 2 hours after fluorodeoxyglucose injection. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and SUVmax increasing rate (SUV-IR) were compared with the histopathologic findings to determine the optimal cutoff for nodal diagnosis.Using early-phase image, SUVmax ≧ 2.75 was considered as optimal criterion. When using delayed-phase, SUVmax ≧ 3.5 was optimal. There was no significant difference between these criteria. Maximum standardized uptake value IR ≧ 8.0 (10/s) was considered as optimal, although it provided relatively low sensitivity (66%) and specificity (82%). However, combined criterion of SUVmax ≧ 3.5 in delayed-phase or SUV-IR ≧ 8.0 (10/s) significantly improved the specificity (90%) and accuracy (89%) without decreasing the sensitivity (84%).Using delayed-phase image combined with SUV-IR can improve the nodal diagnosis in HNSCC patients.
