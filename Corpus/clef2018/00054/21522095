Human rabies among the paediatric population in Bangladesh. This cross sectional study in the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH), Mohakhali, Dhaka on rabies affected paediatric population was carried out to see the patterns of presentation, age group at risk, state of vaccination following animal exposure and the interval between animal exposure and the development of the disease. This one year study included the patients aged less than 15 years with clinically diagnosed rabies referred to the IDH between July 2008 and June 2009. Data was collected from the case sheets of rabies patients given by the relatives and attendants of the victims. A total of 70 cases were included in the study. In the present study most common age group were 5 to 10 years of age with 31(44.3%) patients followed by less than 5 years 23(32.9%) and the rest 16(22.9%) were more than 10 years of age. The male female ratio was 3:1. Among the 70 patients 59(84.3%) were from rural areas and only 11(15.7%) were from urban areas. Sixty six (94.3%) patients presented with bleeding from the site of injury and 4(5.7%) were without bleeding. Among the patients 53(75.7%) presented with bite on the limbs followed by bite on the face 8(11.4%), body 5(7.1%) and head 4(5.7%) cases.

Fifty two (74.3%) gave the history of bite by stray animal, 10(14.3%) by known rabid animal whereas 8(11.4%) had the history of bite by pet animal. Sixty eight patients (97.1%) had the history of bite by dog whereas 2(2.9%) reported cat bite. The mean±SD incubation period 45.38±26.91 days and range was 11-150 days.
