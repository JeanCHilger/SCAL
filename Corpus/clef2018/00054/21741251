Biodistribution and human dosimetry of enantiomer-1 of the synthetic leucine analog anti-1-amino-2-fluorocyclopentyl-1-carboxylic acid. The enantiomerically enriched (ee=90%, enantiomer 1) synthetic amino acid (R,S)-anti-1-amino-2-fluorocyclopentyl-1-carboxylic acid (anti-2-[(18)F]FACPC-1) accumulates in malignant cells by elevated transport through the sodium-independent system-L (leucine preferring) amino acid transporter. The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vivo uptake and single-dose toxicity of anti-2-[(18)F]FACPC-1 in animals as well as the individual organ and whole-body dose in humans.A DU145 xenograft rodent model was used to measure anti-2-[(18)F]FACPC-1 uptake at 15, 30 and 60 min post-injection. Animals were sacrificed and organs harvested to measure the percent injected activity per organ and to calculate residence time. Anti-2-[(18)F]FACPC-1 toxicity was assessed using a single microdose (37-74 MBq/kg) in nonhuman primates. Their vital signs were monitored for 2 h post-injection for drug-related effects. Human biodistribution studies were collected by sequential whole-body PET/CT scans on six healthy volunteers (three male and three female) for 120 min following a single 247Â±61 MBq bolus injection of anti-2-[(18)F]FACPC-1. Estimates of radiation dose from anti-2-[(18)F]FACPC-1 to the human body were calculated using recommendations of the MIRD committee and MIRDOSE 3.0 software.High anti-2-[(18)F]FACPC-1 residence time was observed in the pancreas of the rodent model compared to the human data. No abnormal treatment-related observations were made in the nonhuman primate toxicity studies. Human venous blood showed no metabolites of anti-2-[(18)F]FACPC-1 in the first 60 min post-injection. All volunteers showed initially high uptake in the kidneys followed by a rapid washout phase. The estimated effective dose equivalent was 0.0196 mSv/MBq.Anti-2-[(18)F]FACPC-1 showed low background uptake in the brain, thoracic and abdominal cavities of humans, suggesting a possible use for detecting malignant tissues in these regions.
