Radial artery grafts for symptomatic cavernous carotid aneurysms in elderly patients. Radial artery grafts (RAG) have been used in the treatment of complex vascular lesions, but not for symptomatic cavernous carotid aneurysms in elderly patients.To investigate the safety, usefulness, and perioperative complications of RAGs for symptomatic cavernous carotid aneurysms in elderly patients.Of the 74 consecutive patients, in whom RAGs were used, we retrospectively investigated the postoperative outcomes and complications in eight elderly patients aged over 70 years with symptomatic internal carotid artery aneurysms in cavernous sinus.Postoperative complications included one case of cerebral infarction, one case of symptomatic seizures, and one case of delayed cranial nerve palsy.Seven patients had an mRS score of 0, and one patient had a score of 2. Postoperatively there was improvement in cranial nerve palsy in seven patients and the patients who had symptoms for one year and eight months had residual deficits. Although it cannot be stated that the frequency of perioperative complications was low, the final outcomes were favorable.Even in carotid disease that is difficult to treat among the elderly, RAG would appear to be a useful and safe treatment.
