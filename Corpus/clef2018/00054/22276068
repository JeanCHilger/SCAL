Muscle metastases from gallbladder cancer. Gallbladder cancer is a highly fatal disease with poor prognosis indeed, a high proportion of tumours are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Metastases are commonly detected in regional lymph nodes, liver and peritoneum, but unusual sites of spread such as thyroid and breast have also been described in the literature.We report a case of unsuspected muscle metastases, associated to pulmonary metastases, detected by FDG-PET/CT in a patient with previously removed gallbladder cancer and persistent episodes of haemoptysis.
