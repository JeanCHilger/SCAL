Selenium-72 formation via nat Br(p,x) induced by 100 MeV protons: steps towards a novel 72Se/72As generator system. Selenium-72 production by the proton bombardment of a natural NaBr target has been successfully demonstrated at the Los Alamos National Laboratory Isotope Production Facility (LANL-IPF). Arsenic-72 (half life 26 h) is a medium-lived positron emitting radionuclide with the major advantage of being formed as the daughter of another "generator" radioisotope (Se-72, 8.5 d). A (72)Se/(72)As generator would be the preferred mechanism for clinical utilization of (72)As for positron emission tomography (PET). No portable (72)Se/(72)As generator system has been demonstrated for convenient, repeated (72)As elution ("milking"). In this work, we describe (72)Se production and recovery from irradiated NaBr targets using a 100 MeV proton beam. We also introduce an (72)As generator principle based on (72)Se chelation followed by liquid-liquid extraction, which will be transferred to a solid-phase sorption/elution system.
