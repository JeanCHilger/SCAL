Detection rate of recurrent medullary thyroid carcinoma using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography: a meta-analysis. Several studies evaluated the diagnostic performance of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in detecting recurrent medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with conflicting results. Aim of our study is to meta-analyze published data about this topic. A comprehensive computer literature search of studies published in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase databases through December 2011 and regarding FDG PET or PET/CT in patients with suspected recurrent MTC was carried out. Pooled detection rate (DR) on a per patient-based analysis was calculated to measure the diagnostic performance of FDG PET and PET/CT in this setting. A sub-analysis considering PET device used, serum calcitonin, carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), calcitonin doubling time (CTDT), and CEA doubling time (CEADT) values was also performed. Twenty-four studies comprising 538 patients with suspected recurrent MTC were included. DR of FDG PET or PET/CT in suspected recurrent MTC on a per patient-based analysis was 59 % (95 % confidence interval: 54-63 %). Heterogeneity between the studies was revealed. DR increased in patients with serum calcitonin ≥ 1,000 ng/L (75 %), CEA ≥ 5 ng/ml (69 %), CTDT <12 months (76 %), and CEADT <24 months (91 %). In patients with suspected recurrent MTC FDG PET and PET/CT are associated with a non-optimal DR since about 40 % of suspected recurrent MTC remain usually unidentified. However, FDG PET and PET/CT could modify the patient management in a certain number of recurrent MTC because these methods are often performed after negative conventional imaging studies. DR of FDG PET and PET/CT increases in patients with higher calcitonin and CEA values and lower CTDT and CEADT values, suggesting that these imaging methods could be very helpful in patients with more aggressive disease.
