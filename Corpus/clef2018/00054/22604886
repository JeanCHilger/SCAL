Imaging regional PAO2 and gas exchange. Several methods allow regional gas exchange to be inferred from imaging of regional ventilation and perfusion (V/Q) ratios. Each method measures slightly different aspects of gas exchange and has inherent advantages and drawbacks that are reviewed. Single photon emission computed tomography can provide regional measure of ventilation and perfusion from which regional V/Q ratios can be derived. PET methods using inhaled or intravenously administered nitrogen-13 provide imaging of both regional blood flow, shunt, and ventilation. Electric impedance tomography has recently been refined to allow simultaneous measurements of both regional ventilation and blood flow. MRI methods utilizing hyperpolarized helium-3 or xenon-129 are currently being refined and have been used to estimate local PaO(2) in both humans and animals. Microsphere methods are included in this review as they provide measurements of regional ventilation and perfusion in animals. One of their advantages is their greater spatial resolution than most imaging methods and the ability to use them as gold standards against which new imaging methods can be tested. In general, the reviewed methods differ in characteristics such as spatial resolution, possibility of repeated measurements, radiation exposure, availability, expensiveness, and their current stage of development.
