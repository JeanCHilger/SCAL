Effects of coverage extent and slice skipping on mean and maximum arterial 18F-FDG uptake ratios in patients with carotid plaque. To investigate the effects of variable measurement methods on mean and maximum SUV ratios of 18F-FDG uptake in carotid arteries.18F-FDG PET/CT images of 74 subjects with carotid plaque were analyzed for mean and maximum target-to-background ratio (TBR) of uptake. Agreement was analyzed between TBR scores obtained using different vessel coverage and slice skipping.Mean TBR was increased by extending coverage from common carotid artery (CCA 1.25) to carotid artery (CAAnalysis of mean and maximum arterial 18F-FDG uptake in patients with carotid plaque is likely to benefit from extending coverage to segments above and below the CCA. The extra burden of measurement, in turn, can be lightened by skipping up to every 2 of 3 slices without compromising accuracy of results.
