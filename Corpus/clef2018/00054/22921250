Imaging non motor signs in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is mainly considered as a motor disorder defined by a motor triad. However, various non-motor manifestations may be encountered in Parkinson's disease, including hyposmia, pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, cognitive and behavioral disorders. The pathophysiology of these signs is complex, not univocal and remains poorly understood. Functional imaging techniques either by positron emission tomography, single photon emission tomography or functional magnetic resonance imaging provide an invaluable opportunity to better understand the pathophysiology of these signs. In this paper, we present a review of the recent advances provided by functional imaging in this area.
