Neuropsychological and neuroimaging markers in early versus late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) has been overshadowed by the more common late-onset AD (LOAD). Yet, the literature indicates EOAD may have less hippocampal-memory presentations and more focal neocortical localization early in the disease.To evaluate these proposed differences between these 2 forms of AD and to explore what they inform about differences in AD pathophysiology.In all, 21 patients with EOAD and 24 patients with LOAD matched for disease progression and severity were compared on neurocognitive measures and resting state fluorodeoxy-glucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET).Patients with EOAD had worse executive functions with greater hypometabolism in the parietal regions whereas patients with LOAD had worse confrontation naming and verbal recognition memory with greater hypometabolism in inferior frontotemporal regions.In addition to highlighting significant differences between EOAD and LOAD, these results reveal dissociation between executive deficits in AD and frontal hypometabolism, suggesting early disturbances of the parietal-frontal network in EOAD.
