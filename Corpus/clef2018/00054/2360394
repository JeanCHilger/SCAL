Tc99m HM-PAO single photon emission computed tomography in temporal lobe epilepsy. We present the results of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 40 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and normal computed transmission tomography (CT). Abnormalities of regional cerebral blood flow were found in 26 patients. There was focal hypoperfusion alone in 14, focal hyperperfusion alone in 6, and both types of abnormality in 6. In 4 patients there were bilateral abnormalities. Repeat SPECT showed persistence of interictal hyperperfusion in 5/12 patients. There were no significant correlations between SPECT findings and clinical parameters, and no relation between the persistence of interictal hyperperfusion and time since last seizure or seizure frequency. Where SPECT and multiple surface EEG recordings were both lateralising, agreement between them was good. The results of this study support the usefulness of HMPAO SPECT in detecting lateralising abnormalities in temporal lobe epilepsy. Interictal hyperperfusion may be commoner than previous publications suggest, and may be persistent in some cases.
