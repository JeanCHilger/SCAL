Estimation of scatter component in SPECT planar image using a Monte Carlo method. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to estimate quantitatively the scattered photons in planar images of SPECT. As a phantom we used a water-filled cylinder with a line source and calculated the energy spectra of primary and multiple scattered photons separately at each pixel of the planar images. The energy spectra of primary and scattered photons were studied on following parameters: the size of the phantom the location of the source
