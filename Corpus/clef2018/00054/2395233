A three-headed SPECT system with high resolution and high sensitivity: application to myocardial imaging. A three-headed single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) system was developed, and the fundamental SPECT performance and clinical applications were investigated. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the SPECT system is 10.8 mm at the center of rotation with a radius of 20 cm. In clinical applications, 201Tl myocardial images with the three-headed system demonstrated a distincter and thinner myocardium compared to those with the dual-headed system. The right ventricular wall was observed even in patients without right ventricular overload. Owing to both the increased sensitivity and resolution, the three-headed system has high performance capability in clinical use such as ECG-gating and dynamic studies.
