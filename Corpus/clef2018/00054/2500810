Hygiene problems with ornamental birds in the household. Approximately 8 million pet birds are kept in the Federal Republic of Germany. The number of households where these birds are living is insignificantly lower, and the birds are usually kept as singles. Hygienic problems can arise due to the close contact between humans and birds. In view of the different pet birds species originating from different biotopes, specific knowledge is often lacking regarding adequate housing, nutrition and general management. This can result in a decrease of natural resistance and therefore can lead to diseases of those birds. Therapy, performed by a nonveterinarian, usually does not only affect the birds, but also endangers the owners themselves. Especially, the carrier state of newly purchased birds with pathogens hazardous for human health has to be considered. Psittacosis has to be mentioned as one of the major zooanthroponoses deriving from birds. This requires to reconsider governmental measures to cope with this disease including policies of bird import as one of the major reasons for spreading the disease. Better management conditions can extend the life expectation of birds. This might also lower the fluctuation within the pet bird population and therefore biohazards for humans. Therefore, instruction and advice of pet bird-owners are necessary.
