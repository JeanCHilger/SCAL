Concomitant secretion of big endothelin and its C-terminal fragment from human and bovine endothelial cells. A specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTF) of big porcine endothelin (pET), an intermediate form of pET, was established to characterize big ET-like and its CTF-like immunoreactivity (LI) secreted from cultured bovine and human endothelial cells (EC). The antibody used crossreacted equally with big pET(1-39) and its CTF(22-39), but not with pET(1-21). Serial dilution curves of the culture media from bovine and human EC were parallel to that of standard CTF. Reverse-phase HPLC coupled with RIAs for big ET and ET of the culture media from bovine and human EC revealed essentially the same elution profiles: two major CTF-LI components, one corresponding to big pET(1-39) and the other to its CTF(22-39), in addition to one major ET-LI component corresponding to pET(1-21). The amounts of CTF-LI were almost equal to that of ET-LI on a molar basis. These data suggest that big ET is processed by a putative ET converting enzyme to yield its CTF and the mature ET(1-21) in EC.
