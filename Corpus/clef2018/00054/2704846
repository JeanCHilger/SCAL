Double tracer whole body autoradiography using a short-lived positron emitter and a long-lived beta emitter. We investigated glucose and amino acid metabolism in tumors and other organs using whole body autoradiography with a short-lived positron emitter and a long-lived beta emitter. The radioactive compounds used were 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) with a half life of 109.8 min and L-[methyl-14C]-methionine (14C-MET) with a half life of 5,730 years. A Donryu rat weighing about 150 g was subcutaneously inoculated at the back with experimental tumors of AH109A and AH272. 74 MBq (2 mCi) of 18F-FDG and 740 kBq (20 microCi) of 14C-MET was administered and after 30 min, the rat was sacrificed. Whole body frozen sections were obtained using autocryotome. For the 18F-FDG autoradiogram, the frozen sections were exposed to an X-ray film for 6 h. After seven days, these frozen sections were again exposed to 14C-MET for a week. Cross-contamination was minimized by adjusting the exposure time, the interval of exposures and the administered dose. The accumulation of the tracers was represented as the optical density ratio of the tissue of interest to the muscle. The tumor ratios were 12.5 for 18F-FDG and 8.6 for 14C-MET showing the highest accumulation in the whole body autoradiogram. In contrast the inflammatory tissue ratios were 1.27 for 18F-FDG and 0.77 for 14C-MET showing very low amino acid metabolism. With the present double tracer whole body autoradiogram, 18F-FDG accumulation was seen in the brain and the heart but not to the liver as against 14C-MET accumulation which was seen to the liver but not to the brain and the heart.
