Uptake and release of iodine-labelled m-iodobenzylguanidine in a neuroblastoma cell culture system and its importance in neuroblastoma therapy. A neuroblastoma cell line was established from bone marrow of a patient in stage IV of the disease and used as a model system in order to elaborate experimental data of importance in neuroblastoma therapy, such as cell-drug interactions, the mode of uptake and conditions for storage and release. m-Iodo benzylguanidine (MIBG) is rapidly taken up from culture medium, giving high concentrations of cell-bound radioactivity reaching a maximum level 4 h after the addition of the compound. A removal of the radiopharmacon from the culture medium causes a dramatic loss of cell-associated radioactivity, suggesting that neuroblastoma cells are not able to retain MIBG in a drug-free environment. Replacement of labelled by unlabelled MIBG prevents a similar release and maintains high levels of cellular radioactivity. Variations of cell culture conditions only result in minor changes of uptake rates, whereas a pretreatment with drugs used in neuroblastoma chemotherapy harms the cells extensively: even after a short-term exposure the cells lose the capacity for MIGB uptake and fail to recover within a long period of incubation in growth medium. The importance of our results is discussed, leading to the following suggestions: 1. The performance of radiotherapy with labelled MIBG is recommended prior to the chemotherapy protocols. 2. Therapeutically effective radioactivity in tumor tissues may be maintained by the additional infusion of unlabelled MIGB.
