Regional cerebral blood flow patterns in visual imagery. Regional cerebral blood flow patterns were investigated by means of single photon emission computerized tomography in subjects who solved cognitive tasks which either did or did not require the use of visual imagery. In a first experiment judging the correctness of visual imagery sentences like "a grapefruit is bigger than an orange" led to increases of regional activity in inferior temporal and in the left inferior-occipital region when compared to blood flow patterns elicited by judgements about low imagery sentences or by responding differentially to "yes" and "no". Motor imagery sentences did not cause such an increase. In a second experiment a condition in which visual images were used for counting the corners of letters was compared to a condition in which subjects internally rehearsed the alphabet. The only difference concerned the inferior frontal regions which showed higher activity in rehearsing the alphabet. However, activity in inferior temporal and inferior occipital regions showed a positive correlation to the self-rated vividness of the visual images in the corner counting condition. The results of both experiments yield converging evidence that visual imagery is selectively related to activity of inferior-temporal and occipital regions. They thus support the hypothesis that the cerebral correlate of visual imagery is different from that of non-imaginal thinking.
