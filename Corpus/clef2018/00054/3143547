Initial experience with 99m Tc-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime (HM-PAO) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with focal epilepsy. Brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed in 16 patients with focal epilepsy, as well as EEG, using 99m Tc-HM-PAO SPECT and a rotating gamma camera system. Pathological Tc-HM-PAO SPECT findings were registered in 75%. CT was positive in 25%. MRI was positive in 76%. The results of Tc-HM-PAO SPECT findings were compared with those of CT and MRI. 61% of the MRI findings correlated with the pathological SPECT findings with respect to the side of the hemisphere, and in 75% of the patients the focal EEG abnormality and the pathological Tc-HM-PAO-SPECT findings were localized in the same hemisphere.
