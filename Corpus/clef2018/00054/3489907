Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain imaging using N,N,N'-trimethyl-N'-(2 hydroxy-3-methyl-5-123I-iodobenzyl)-1,3-propanediamine 2 HCl (HIPDM): intractable complex partial seizures. HIPDM-SPECT brain imaging was performed in four patients with intractable complex partial seizures (CPS). Three patients had an epileptogenic focus in one temporal lobe and underwent anterior temporal lobectomy. Interictal HIPDM-SPECT demonstrated decreased regional cerebral perfusion (rCP) in the epileptogenic area in only one patient, but ictal studies showed increased rCP in the epileptic foci of all three patients. In the fourth patient, interictal HIPDM-SPECT showed increased rCP in the area of epileptogenic focus when antiepileptic medication was taken, rCP decreased. HIPDM-SPECT brain imaging is useful for localizing epileptogenic foci in CPS.
