Positron emission tomography in oncology--the Massachusetts General Hospital experience. Positron tomography has been used to measure blood flow, oxygen utilization, and glucose metabolism in soft-tissue tumors in rabbits and in human tumors in extremities. Both blood flow and oxygen utilization were increased in tumor in contrast to normal muscle tissue. Oxygen extraction fraction was, however, decreased in tumor. The most sensitive indicator of tumor growth was the glucose metabolic rate. The effect of irradiation was observed by blood flow measurements in human tumors and by blood flow and oxygen utilization in tumors in rabbits. Blood flow increased both in tumor and normal muscle tissue during irradiation and decreased afterwards. Oxygen utilization decreased in tumor and increased in normal tissue during irradiation.
