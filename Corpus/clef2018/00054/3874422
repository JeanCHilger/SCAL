Experience with single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in follow-up of sternotomy healing. Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) was performed thrice in ten patients undergoing open-heart surgery--preoperatively and 2 and 12 weeks postoperatively. The operations were done for ischemic heart disease (5), aortic valvular stenosis (2), aortic valvular insufficiency (1), leaking mitral prosthetic valve (1) and combined aortic and mitral valvular stenosis and insufficiency (1). The healing process in the longitudinally divided sternum was evaluated from the SPECT study. Four conventional static images in two dimensions were registered in anteroposterior, posteroanterior and left and right lateral projections. A tomographic study was done. Quantitative analyses were performed. The ratio of the sternal counts to the counts from a thoracic vertebra was calculated for use as a reference. The activity ratios showed a similar pattern in six cases, with initial increases and at 12 weeks slight decrease compared with the preoperative values. In two cases the activity was still increasing after 12 postoperative weeks. One patient, with sternotomy also one year previously, showed only slightly increased activity. The activity at the areas of the sternal wires was increased in six cases. The study thus revealed differing patterns of isotope uptake, although recovery was uneventful in all patients. The differences may reflect the possibility that the operative course and the preoperative clinical status can influence the healing mechanisms.
