Quantification of glucose utilization in an experimental brain tumor model by the deoxyglucose method. Reevaluation of lumped and rate constants is necessary when Sokoloff's 2-deoxyglucose (DG) method is used to measure glucose utilization in pathological tissue. We describe here a modification of Sokoloff's lumped constant measurement that permits simultaneous estimation of both lumped and rate constants from a single animal experiment. A subcutaneous tumor model (AA ascites tumor) was used for measurement of these constants with a procedure similar to Sokoloff's that kept the plasma tracer concentration constant. Measured constants were as follows: lumped constant, 0.654 +/- 0.081 k1, 0.196 +/- 0.038 min-1
