Imaging of canine cancers with 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) suggests further applications for cancer imaging in man. 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is a novel radiopharmaceutical that has gained much interest as a cancer-seeking agent. In this paper two cases of histologically verified canine cancer, an osteosarcoma and a mammary carcinoma, are presented. After an intravenous bolus injection of FDG, accumulation of radioactivity over the neoplastic lesion was followed with a computer-guided specially collimated gamma camera. Ratios of radioactivity between tumour and control areas at 30 min were 2.8 and 2.2 for the osteosarcoma and the mammary carcinoma, respectively. In the osteosarcoma, which was imaged for 3 h, this ratio remained essentially stable. It is reasonable to assume that FDG will be suitable for cancer imaging in man.
