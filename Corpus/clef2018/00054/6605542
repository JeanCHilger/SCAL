A comparison of attenuation correction methods for quantitative single photon emission computed tomography. Transverse section tomograms of experimental phantoms and patients have been obtained using a GE 400T camera and a filtered back-projection reconstruction technique. These tomograms have been compared with the corresponding sections reconstructed from the same tomographic projection data, but using iterative algorithms with correction for photon attenuation. The comparison assesses the importance of including a correction for attenuation as well as demonstrating how closely a simple geometric attenuation correction, applied to the filtered back-projection reconstruction method, approximates to a more accurate correction incorporated in the computation of line integrals during iterative reconstruction. A comparison is also made between the behaviour of reconstruction algorithms with simulated projection data and real data in terms of convergence properties, and some shortcomings arising from simulation are noted.
