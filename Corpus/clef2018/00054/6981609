Synthesis and in vivo characteristics of [2-11 C]5,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione (DMO). No-carrier-added [2-11 C]5,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione (DMO) has been prepared rapidly and in good radiochemical yield. The synthesis involves in situ conversion of phosgene to diethyl carbonate which reacts with 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionamide to yield labeled DMO. HPLC purification provided up to 1.85 GBq (50 mCi) of pure [11C]-DMO for injection. The product's in vivo distribution was examined in mice and rabbits. The results are encouraging for further application to in vivo measurement of intracellular pH using positron tomography.
