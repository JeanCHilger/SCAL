Principal component analysis and the scaled subprofile model compared to intersubject averaging and statistical parametric mapping: I. "Functional connectivity" of the human motor system studied with [15O]water PET. Using [15O]water PET and a previously well studied motor activation task, repetitive finger-to-thumb opposition, we compared the spatial activation patterns produced by (1) global normalization and intersubject averaging of paired-image subtractions, (2) the mean differences of ANCOVA-adjusted voxels in Statistical Parametric Mapping, (3) ANCOVA-adjusted voxels followed by principal component analysis (PCA), (4) ANCOVA-adjustment of mean image volumes (mean over subjects at each time point) followed by F-masking and PCA, and (5) PCA with Scaled Subprofile Model pre- and postprocessing. All data analysis techniques identified large positive focal activations in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex and ipsilateral cerebellar cortex, with varying levels of activation in other parts of the motor system, e.g., supplementary motor area, thalamus, putamen techniques 1-4 also produced extensive negative areas. The activation signal of interest constitutes a very small fraction of the total nonrandom signal in the original dataset, and the exact choice of data preprocessing steps together with a particular analysis procedure have a significant impact on the identification and relative levels of activated regions. The challenge for the future is to identify those preprocessing algorithms and data analysis models that reproducibly optimize the identification and quantification of higher-order sensorimotor and cognitive responses.
