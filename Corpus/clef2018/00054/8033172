Technetium-labeled myocardial perfusion agents. Since its approval for clinical use in 1975, thallium-201 has been the mainstay for myocardial perfusion imaging to diagnose and manage patients with coronary artery disease. In 1992, 80% of 2.6 million myocardial perfusion imaging studies were done with thallium-201. Thallium-201 has important limitations, however, related to photon energy, half life, and availability. In December 1990, two Tc-99m-labeled agents (sestamibi and teboroxime) were approved for clinical use. There are ongoing clinical trials with other classes of Tc-99m agents. This article describes kinetics and imaging experience with Tc-99m-labeled perfusion agents.
