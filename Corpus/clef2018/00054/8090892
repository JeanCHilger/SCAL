Coronary artery disease: findings with GRE MR imaging and Tc-99m-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile SPECT during simultaneous dobutamine stress. This study compared gradient-recalled echo (GRE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with technetium-99m-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) during the same dobutamine stress for the localization of coronary artery stenoses.In 35 consecutive patients (28 men and seven women, aged 41-79 years) with angiographically documented coronary artery disease, corresponding GRE MR images and SPECT tomograms were acquired at rest and during dobutamine infusion and were evaluated for regional wall motion or perfusion abnormalities.Images in both examinations could be analyzed in 32 of 35 (91%) patients. Wall motion or perfusion abnormalities were observed in 27 of 32 (84%) GRE MR imaging and in 28 of 32 (87%) SPECT examinations. Sensitivity and specificity of dobutamine GRE MR imaging and dobutamine SPECT for the localization of left anterior descending coronary artery stenoses were 74% and 100% versus 70% and 100% for the combined left circumflex and right coronary artery perfusion territories.GRE MR imaging and SPECT have a high concordance with respect to the detection of a dobutamine-induced ischemic response.
