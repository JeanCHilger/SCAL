Increased blood flow in Broca's area during auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. Verbal auditory hallucinations are common in schizophrenia but little is known about how they arise. We have used single photon emission tomography (SPET) to measure regional cerebral blood flow with the aim of identifying brain areas that are especially active during auditory hallucinations. We scanned twelve men with schizophrenia while they were experiencing hallucinations. The subjects were rescanned under identical conditions when their hallucinations had resolved (mean 19 weeks later). Blood flow was significantly greater during hallucinations than in the non-hallucinating state in Broca's area (mean count density on SPET 1.18 [SD 0.04] vs 1.13 [0.06] p < 0.001)
