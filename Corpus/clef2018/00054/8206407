Experience with positron emission tomography (PET) scans in patients with ovarian cancer. Our first year of experience in the use of PET scanning in the management of nine patients with ovarian cancer leads us to conclude that this promising new technique may be more sensitive than either serum CA-125 determinations or computed tomography for the detection and demonstration of residual or recurrent abdominal and pelvic tumor. Seven of these patients underwent second-look laparotomy which confirmed our impressions from preoperative PET scans in six patients, and the one other scan showed a focus of metabolic uptake coinciding with residual tumor in our retrospective review. The clinical courses of two other patients who did not undergo laparotomy confirmed the impressions gained from PET scans.
