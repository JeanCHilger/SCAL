The influence of image resolution on the positron emission tomographic measurement of caudate glucose consumption. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of image resolution on (a) relative and absolute values of caudate glucose consumption (rCMRGlc) determined by positron emission tomography (PET), and (b) the detection of significant differences in these metabolic values between groups of subjects. For this purpose, raw data of cerebral accumulation of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) obtained in 11 normal subjects and in nine patients with unilateral thalamic infarction were reconstructed using filtered backprojection with four different cut-off frequencies (CFs), yielding images with a transaxial resolution of 5.7, 7.1, 8.9 and 11 mm (full-width at half-maximum FWHM). Absolute values of caudate rCMRGlc decreased significantly by more than 30% over the range of image resolutions studied. Bilateral ratios of caudate rCMRGlc were insensitive to variations in image resolution. Levels of significance assessing the differences in mean metabolic values between patients and controls were all below 0.01. They were, however, slightly better at image resolutions of 7.1 and 8.9 mm than at a resolution of 5.7 mm. These data indicate (a) that relative values of rCMRGlc are better suited to compare quantitative results from different PET cameras than are absolute values, and (b) that the CF used for the filtered back-projection exerts a small but not negligible influence on levels of significance assessing differences in metabolic values between groups of subjects.
