Pharmacokinetics of 18F-labeled fluconazole in healthy human subjects by positron emission tomography. The distribution of fluconazole in tissue of human volunteers was determined by positron emission tomographic scanning over a 2-h period following the infusion of a tracer dose of 18F-fluconazole (5 to 7 mCi) plus 400 mg of unlabeled drug (the standard daily dose of fluconazole). Previous studies have validated this approach for animals. From serial positron emission tomographic imaging and blood sampling, pharmacokinetics of fluconazole in tissue were determined. There was significant distribution of the radiolabeled drug in all organs studied, with nearly constant levels achieved by 1 h. Plateau concentrations of fluconazole in key organs (micrograms per gram) included the following: whole brain, 4.92 +/- 0.17 heart, 6.98 +/- 0.20
