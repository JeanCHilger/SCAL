Improved synthesis of 1-[11C]D-glucose. An improved synthesis of 1-[11C]D-glucose is described. The major improvement is achieved when a 0.033 M borate buffer at pH 8.1 is used to effect the condensation of d-arabinose with NH4(11)CN. Subsequent reduction of the 1-[11C]D-aldonitriles gives the epimeric sugars 1-[11C]D-glucose and 1-[11C]D-mannose in a ratio of 1.8 +/- 0.57 as the major products. The decay corrected radiochemical yield is about 30% for the mixture of sugars. The overall synthesis, starting with the production of NH4(11)CN, is conducted in a dedicated remote system. The remote gantry was easy to build with commercially available valves and glassware, and has been practically trouble-free after more than 2 years of use. Improved purification and quality control of the final product uses ion chromatography and a more efficient resin, and is also described. A preliminary PET study on a macaque has been conducted using 1-[11C]D-glucose obtained with this new improved synthesis.
