Nuclear imaging of solid hepatic masses. This review has focused on the unique role of radionuclide scintigraphy in characterization of hepatic mass lesions. Radionuclide scintigraphy, unlike most other imaging modalities, is based on specific physiological and biochemical properties of each pathological entity that affects the liver. Hepatic scintigraphy, with its widespread availability, noninvasive nature, and relatively low cost is a powerful adjunct to other imaging techniques in the investigation of hepatic mass lesions. We have reviewed clinical presentation and characteristic findings of most hepatic lesions and have described reported findings with all available imaging modalities with particular emphasis on hepatic scintigraphy (Table 1) as well as a suggested algorithm for workup of solid hepatic masses (Fig 6). Additionally, the role of newer, more specialized techniques including PET scanning, 123I-labeled VIP, and 111In-labeled DTPA-D-Phe-octreotide scanning are reviewed. Hepatic nuclear scintigraphy continues to play an important role in the management of patients with solid hepatic masses.
