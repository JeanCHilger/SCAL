PET scans of abdominal malignancy. Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18-2-d-deoxyglucose (FDG) currently is being integrated into clinical oncology because it provides unique functional information that can be applied to the management of cancer. In particular, it is useful for assessing tumor activity and growth, evaluating efficacy of therapy, and detecting tumor recurrence. Studies have demonstrated the value of whole-body PET-FDG imaging when staging and managing abdominal malignancy.
