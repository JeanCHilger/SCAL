Biological evaluation of 5-methyl-branched-chain omega-[18F]fluorofatty acid: a potential myocardial imaging tracer for positron emission tomography. 5-Methyl-17-[18F]fluoroheptadecanoic acid (5-MFHA) has been proposed as a new myocardial imaging tracer for positron emission tomography (PET), containing methyl-branching at the odd-numbered position, except the 3-position. To compare the site of methyl-branching of fatty acids on the contribution to myocardial imaging, the biological evaluation of 5-MFHA-using accumulation studies, metabolic studies, and PET studies of the heart muscle-was investigated. In the comparative biodistribution studies for 16-[18F]fluoropalmitic acid (FPA), 3-methyl-17-[18F]fluoroheptadecanoic acid (3-MFHA) and 5-MFHA, the initial myocardial uptake of 5-MFHA (2.64 [%dose/g tissue]) was relatively high between those of FPA and 3-MFHA (3.45 and 1.58, respectively), and the washout from myocardium of 5-MFHA was midway between those of FPA and 3-MFHA. In the lipid analysis studies, 5-MFHA was mainly metabolized to triglycerides in the myocardium, and its metabolic pattern was similar to that of straight-chain fatty acids (FPA). In the PET studies using 5-MFHA in canines, good myocardial images were obtained for up to 30 min after injection.
