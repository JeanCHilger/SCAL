Iodine-123 labelled radiopharmaceuticals and single-photon emission tomography: a natural liaison. Most nuclear medicine departments possess one or more imaging apparatuses for single-photon emission tomography (SPET). Molecules of biological interest to assess metabolism and receptor function are often labelled with 123I, which allows proper SPET imaging. The various methods for radiolabelling are reviewed. As the biological integrity of these agents has been demonstrated for numerous radiopharmaceuticals, the purpose of this review is to summarize the efficacy in various fields of medicine, including the imaging of tumours, infection, myocardium and cerebrum.
