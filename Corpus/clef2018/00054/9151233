In vivo diagnosis of human malignant melanoma with positron emission tomography using specific melanoma-seeking 18F-DOPA analogue. Detection and diagnosis of human malignant melanoma by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using 18F-10B-L-BPA, a specific melanogenesis-seeking compound synthesized for use in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy for malignant melanoma (NCT), has been developed. This resulted in a novel, highly effective methodology for the selective three dimensional imaging of metastatic malignant melanomas, and for accurate determination of 10B concentration in the tumor and surrounding tissue, providing almost all diagnostic information necessary for complete non-invasive radiation dose planning in the treatment of malignant melanoma both for NCT as well as other therapeutic modalities.
