The diagnostic value of planar and SPET scintimammography in different age groups. Planar scintimammography (SMM) with 99Tcm-sestamibi (99Tcm-MIBI) has proved to be a useful method in the evaluation of breast lesions. The aim of our study was to determine the diagnostic value of planar and single photon emission tomograpic (SPET) SMM in different age group. We investigated women with breast lesions for which the surgeon recommended biopsy or careful follow-up. Seventy consecutive patients underwent supine planar SMM, while supine SPET was performed in 68 of the patients. Twenty-seven carcinomas in 23 patients and 35 benign lesions in 31 patients were confirmed histologically. In the remaining 16 patients, the findings were classified as benign at follow-up. The carcinomas and benign lesions had a mean (+/- S.D.) diameter of 25 +/- 17 and 17 +/- 11 mm respectively (P < 0.05). A sensitivity/specificity of 67/96% and 88/91% was obtained with the planar and SPET techniques respectively. The accuracy of both techniques was 90%. In patients aged 40 years or less, SPET increased the sensitivity from 50 to 100% (P < 0.01), whereas it decreased the specificity and accuracy from 94 to 81% and 91 to 81% respectively (N.S.). In patients aged 41-50 years, the sensitivity increased from 63 to 100% (P < 0.01), whereas there was a small decrease in specificity and an increase in accuracy (from 91 to 89% and 86 to 91% respectively, N.S.) We conclude that, in younger patients, a negative SPET SMM study indicates the need for careful follow-up rather than biopsy. However, the addition of SPET in supine scintimammography does-not change the overall accuracy significantly.
