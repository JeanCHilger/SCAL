Diagnostic accuracy and predictive value of 201T1 SPET for the differential diagnosis of cerebral lesions in AIDS patients. The use of 201T1 has been proposed for the differential diagnosis of lymphomas and non-neoplastic brain masses in AIDS patients. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of three different semi-quantitative methods for the analysis of 201T1 SPET brain images in individuals with AIDS and brain lesions. Thirty-seven AIDS patients with contrast-enhancing brain lesions underwent 201T1 SPET. Three different lesion-to-background uptake indices were calculated: (1) small lesion/large background (SL/LB i.e. counts in a 3 x 3 pixel ROI in the lesion/counts in a 7 x 7 pixel ROI in the contralateral healthy hemisphere)
