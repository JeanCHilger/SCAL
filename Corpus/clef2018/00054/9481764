Impaired left ventricular myocardial metabolism in patients with pulmonary hypertension detected by radionuclide imaging. To assess whether left ventricular myocardial metabolism is affected by the presence of right ventricular pressure overload, we performed 123I-beta-methyl-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (123I-BMIPP) and 99Tc(m)-sestamibi (99Tc(m)-MIBI) single photon emission tomography in 24 patients with pulmonary hypertension and in 10 control subjects. The left ventricle was divided into six regions using a short-axis tomogram at the mid-ventricular level. The relative regional uptake (RRU, %) was determined for each region as the ratio of the regional uptake per pixel to the maximum uptake in the six regions. Right heart catheterization was performed to obtain mean pulmonary arterial pressure. 123I-BMIPP uptake in the septum and the adjacent myocardium of the left ventricle was lower in patients with pulmonary hypertension than in control subjects (septal RRU, 75 +/- 6 vs 85 +/- 4% anteroseptal RRU, 76 +/- 6 vs 86 +/- 3%
