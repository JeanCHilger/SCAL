Clinical applicability of functional magnetic resonance imaging and activation study with single photon emission computerized tomography for functional mapping. The purpose of this study is to estimate the clinical applicability of functional magnetic resonance imaging (f-MRI) combined with the activation study using single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) with special reference to identification of primary sensorimotor area. Five healthy volunteers and 5 patients with brain tumors located around the sensorimotor cortex were studied by both f-MRI with gradient echo and SPECT with 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer using split-dose and subtraction method. In f-MRI study, the significant activation of the sensorimotor area was observed in all subjects. Various concurrent activation regions such as supplementary motor (2 volunteers vs. 4 patients), premotor (1 vs. 2) and ipsilateral sensorimotor area (1 vs. 2) were also observed. In the cases with the activation of neighboring regions of sensorimotor area, it was difficult to identify the area in f-MRI. In SPECT study, the sensorimotor area was depicted as the most increased area in regional cerebral blood flow in eight cases, the characteristics of which were helpful to diagnose the area, while significant activation of the area with edema could not be detected in two patients. Consequently, the sensorimotor area was cross-validated with both the modalities. This study demonstrated that it would be valuable to use both techniques for the clinical assessment of the sensorimotor area.
