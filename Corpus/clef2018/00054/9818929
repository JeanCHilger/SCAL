Seizure outcome after epilepsy surgery in children and adolescents. Few epilepsy surgery outcome data are available from series of pediatric patients. We studied seizure outcome in 136 pediatric patients who had surgery for intractable epilepsy at The Cleveland Clinic between January 1990 and June 1996, with a postoperative follow-up of 1 to 7.5 years (mean, 3.6 years). Sixty-two children (3 months to 12 years old at time of surgery) were compared with 74 adolescents (13-20 years old). Extratemporal or multilobar resections and hemispherectomies were similarly frequent among children (50%) and adolescents (44%), but these procedures strongly predominated in infancy (90% of patients 0-2 years of age). The remaining patients had temporal resection. Cortical dysplasia and low-grade tumor were the most common causes and hippocampal sclerosis was rare. Seizure-free outcome was achieved for 69% of adolescents, 68% of children, and 60% of the infant subgroup, overall for 23 (74%) of 31 children and 33 (80%) of 41 adolescents after temporal resection
