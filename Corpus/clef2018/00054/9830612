F-qi-FDG PET of the thyroid gland in Graves' disease. This study evaluates F-18-FDG PET of the thyroid in Graves' disease.Thirty patients were investigated the day before radioiodine therapy, 15 patients 3-10 days after radioiodine therapy. Twenty patients with cancer of the head or neck and normal thyroid function served as controls.F-18-FDG uptake was higher in Graves' disease patients than in controls. Negative correlations of F-18-FDG uptake with half-life of radioiodine and absorbed radiation dose due to radioiodine therapy were found along with a positive correlation to autoantibody levels.Thus F-18-FDG PET is likely to give information on the biological activity of Graves' disease as well as on early radiation effects.
