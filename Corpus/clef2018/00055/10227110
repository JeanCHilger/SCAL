Differences in cerebellar blood volume in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Brain morphometry has been studied extensively in schizophrenic patients, and among the cortical differences identified two consistent findings are decreased cerebellar vermal volume and increased volume of the fourth ventricle although contradictory findings are reported as well. Recent cognitive activation studies utilizing PET, SPECT and fMRI have identified both decreased and increased activation in the cerebellum of schizophrenic patients compared with healthy controls. This study used DSC fMRI to map cerebellar blood volume in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and healthy controls. For all cerebellar regions analyzed, schizophrenic patients had the highest cerebellar blood volume, while bipolars had the lowest blood volume. Morphometric measurements were completed and indicated that the ratio of vermis to whole CBL tissue volume was 24% less for the schizophrenic population than controls, whereas the subjects with bipolar disorder had a ratio that was non-significantly smaller than controls by 19%. Comparison of morphometric data with blood volume data did not reveal any statistically significant correlations among the study groups.
