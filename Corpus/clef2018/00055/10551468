Registration of three-dimensional magnetic resonance and radionuclide skeletal images. To apply postprocessing techniques to register three-dimensional TI-201 bone SPECT datasets with MRI. This may provide more accurate anatomic-functional correlation when localizing active tumors.Three-dimensional datasets were constructed from previously acquired MRIs using routine imaging protocols. Registration software was used to coregister the TI-201 SPECT studies and the MRIs in three dimensions.Adequate TI-201 uptake in muscles and soft tissues along with relatively low accumulation in tendons and joint spaces provided adequate landmarks for visually aligning SPECT and MRI datasets. MR abnormalities were more extensive because of surrounding reactive tissue, and more focal TI-201 uptake could be demonstrated within the region of MR signal abnormality, allowing the focal metabolically active tissue to be distinguished from adjacent edema.Image registration of SPECT and anatomic imaging (CT or MRI) is used routinely to evaluate functional abnormalities within the brain. This technique has now been applied to the combination of TI-201 SPECT and MR data for evaluating bone lesions and may provide additional anatomic information for localizing functional abnormalities. This may be valuable for defining targets for biopsy, planning surgical treatment, and using minimally invasive therapies.
