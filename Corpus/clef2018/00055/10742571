Functional neuroimaging of the olfactory system in humans. Positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have begun to provide unique information regarding the neural underpinnings of olfactory functioning in humans. We review the relative strengths and weaknesses of PET and fMRI techniques for studying olfaction. We then review PET and fMRI studies relating to the olfactory functions of the pyriform cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala and the entorhinal/hippocampal region. A pixelwise correlational analysis of PET data is also presented in order to clarify the relationship between blood flow in the medial temporal lobes and psychoperceptual variables.
