Poststress measurements of left ventricular function with gated perfusion SPECT: comparison with resting measurements by using a same-day perfusion-function protocol. To investigate the relationship between the development of ischemia during stress testing and the changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements obtained after stress and at rest with a same-day perfusion-function imaging protocol.One hundred twenty-six patients underwent a same-day rest-stress (61%) or stress-rest (39%) protocol and gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Perfusion analysis was performed with a 12-segment model. Defects were scored (0 = no defect, 1 = mild defect, 2 = moderate defect, and 3 = severe defect) differences between the summed stress and resting scores of greater than three indicated substantial ischemia.Resting and poststress LVEFs correlated significantly (r = 0.97, P <.001) however, patients with and patients without ischemia had significant differences in poststress versus resting LVEFs (-4.0 vs 1.0, respectivelyIn patients with clinically important stress-induced perfusion abnormalities, the LVEF after stress was significantly lower than the LVEF at rest with same-day rest-stress and stress-rest imaging protocols. In the clinical setting, poststress LVEFs may be lower than true resting measurements, particularly in patients with moderate to severe stress-induced ischemia.
