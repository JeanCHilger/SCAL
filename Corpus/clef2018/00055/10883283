Construction and expression of anticolonic cancer scFv fragment. Anticolonic cancer scFv fragment with a VH-linker-VL structure was constructed and expressed in E. coli. SDS-PAGE analysis showed the fragment cloned in pComb3 was not expressed efficiently in JM83, while cloned in pET-22b(+) highly expressed in BL21(DE3) up to 35.5% of the total bacterial protein obtained, if the culture was incubated under 30 degrees C.
