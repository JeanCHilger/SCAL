Regional myocardial oxygen consumption estimated by carbon-11 acetate and positron emission tomography before and after repetitive ischemia. Preserved myocardial oxygen consumption estimated by carbon 11-acetate and positron emission tomography (PET) in myocardial regions with chronic but reversibly depressed contractile function in patients with ischemic heart disease have been suggested to be caused by repeated short episodes of acute myocardial ischemia. To evaluate this hypothesis myocardial 11C-acetate PET imaging was performed before and after acute repetitive myocardial ischemia.In open chest dogs (n = 8), the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded 4 times for 5 minutes alternating with 5 minutes of reperfusion. Before and after repetitive coronary occlusions, oxygen 15 water/oxygen 15 carbon monoxide (blood flow), and 11C-acetate (oxygen consumption) PET imaging were performed. Left ventricular regional systolic wall thickening was measured with sonomicrometry. Forty-five minutes after the ischemic episodes, systolic ventricular wall thickening was decreased by 90%, whereas myocardial blood flow was reduced by 21% compared with baseline values (P < .05). Ninety minutes after the ischemic episodes, estimated oxygen consumption was unaltered compared with the baseline level despite a sustained 70% decrease in the regional contractile function (P < .05).Oxygen consumption estimated by 11C-acetate PET imaging is preserved after repeated episodes of acute myocardial ischemia despite a severe impairment of contractile function.
