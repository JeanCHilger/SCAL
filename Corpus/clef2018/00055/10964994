Hematologic malignancies: selected abstracts and commentary. ASCO 2000 did not offer revolutionary new advances in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. However, reports at the meeting built incrementally on gains established over the past several years. The meeting continued to highlight advances in the targeted therapy of hematologic malignancies. Excitement abounds regarding the clinical development of STI 571, a rationally designed tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Studies further defined the role monoclonal antibody treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and more mature data were presented on both unconjugated antibody therapy and radioimmunoconjugates. In disease detection, important data were presented to clarify the role of positron emission tomography scans in the staging and follow-up of lymphoid malignancies. The following review summarizes key abstracts presented at the 2000 ASCO meeting and will elaborate on the implications of these findings for disease management.
