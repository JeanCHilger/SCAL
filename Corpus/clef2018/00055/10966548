Enhanced prognostic stratification of patients with left ventricular hypertrophy with the use of single-photon emission computed tomography. Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are at increased risk of future cardiovascular events. Little is known about risk stratification of these patients with the use of myocardial perfusion imaging. This study sought to assess the prognostic stratification of patients with LVH by using myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).We studied 633 consecutive patients with electrocardiographic evidence of LVH who underwent dual isotope myocardial perfusion SPECT (rest thallium 201/stress technetium 99m sestamibi) and were followed up for a mean period of 22 +/- 7 months. During the follow-up period, 67 events (35 cardiac deaths and 32 nonfatal myocardial infarctions) occurred (6% annual event rate). The results of the perfusion scan significantly risk-stratified the population patients with normal scans had a low rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiac death (<1% per year of follow-up). The rates of cardiac events increased significantly as a function of the scan result: 4.9% in patients with mildly abnormal scans and 10. 3% in moderately to severely abnormal scans. Cox proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that after adjusting for pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease (the most predictive clinical variableIn patients with LVH with an overall high cardiac event rate, SPECT provided enhanced stratification by adding significant incremental prognostic information over clinical and historic variables.
