Altered hemispheric functional dominance during word generation in negative schizophrenia. Functional brain imaging studies have reported decreased frontal activations in schizophrenia, but hemispheric dominance for language has rarely been assessed. To investigate regional activation and lateralization during word production, we determined normalized regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) variations with positron emission tomography (PET) and H2(15)O (water labeled with the isotope oxygen 15) in 14 negative schizophrenia patients and 14 volunteers. Subjects were scanned during two trials of three conditions: rest, vocalized verbal fluency, and spontaneous word production. Images were analyzed using an anatomical volumes of interest method, and the two groups' changes were compared, using rest as a baseline. Differences in the lateralization of changes were detected in homologous frontal and inferior parietal regions. The lateralization effects in patients arose from lower activations in the left frontal regions, abnormal right inferior frontal activations, and weaker right inferior parietal deactivation, during the word production tasks. The right hemisphere changes correlated negatively with the performance in verbal fluency. Thus in negative schizophrenia patients, while the activations were less focused on the left hemisphere regions usually engaged in word generation, rCBF changes in the right hemisphere might reflect a compensatory functional pattern.
