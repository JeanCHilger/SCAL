Comparison of methods for quantification of transient ischaemic dilation in myocardial perfusion SPET. The purpose of this study was to compare six methods of measuring the left ventricular (LV) transient ischaemic dilation (TID) ratio during stress-rest myocardial perfusion single-photon emission tomography (SPET). The TID ratio was defined as the mean LV short-axis area at stress divided by the mean LV area of similar slices at rest. The centre of the LV wall was defined as either the maximum, mean or median of the radial short-axis count profiles. The area within the endocardial wall was also calculated for each definition of the LV wall centre. We identified 50 consecutive patients undergoing dipyridamole technetium-99m-tetrofosmin SPET imaging and angiography. Continuous receiver operating characteristic (CROC) analysis showed no significant difference between the six methods in terms of identifying severe coronary artery disease (P >0.47). Algorithms using the mean or the median value in the profile were significantly more robust than those using the maximum (P <0.0005). TID measured by all the algorithms is an indicator of severe coronary disease (P < 0.05). The algorithms compared provide a repeatable, quantitative and specific measure of the TID ratio.
