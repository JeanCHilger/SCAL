Abnormality of N30 somatosensory evoked potentials in Parkinson's disease: a multidisciplinary approach. Assess the N30 component of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and correlate its parameters with the severity of the disease, general cognitive ability and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF).Twenty-three non-demented, non-depressed PD patients (at stage II and III of the disease) and 23 age- and education-matched normal controls were enrolled in the study. SEPs were elicited by median nerve stimulation. PD patients' cognitive ability was assessed by means of: 1) Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM) 2) the Test of Non-Verbal Intelligence (TONI-2)There was no difference between SEP N30 latency in PD patients and controls (P > 0.05). The P20-N30 peak-to-peak amplitude was lower in PD patients bilaterally (P < 0.05), and the amplitude of N30-P40 was lower on the right side only (P < 0.05). A significant increase in the amplitude ratio P14-N20/P20-N30 was observed in PD patients (P < 0.05). The correlation of these findings with the clinical parameters of the disease, and notably motor signs, was not significant. Of the three neuropsychological tests only the RCPM showed a positive relation to right P20-N30 amplitude. Regression analysis between SEP parameters and rCBF showed a correlation of N30 amplitude with blood flow in parietal cortical areas, but not in frontal regions.
