Peripheral flow response to transient arterial forearm occlusion does not reflect myocardial perfusion reserve. Ultrasonographic evaluation of systemic arterial function is widely available, and a close relation of endothelial function in the coronary and brachial arteries has been documented. It is unknown, however, whether a similar correlation exists for their 2 microcirculatory territories and thus whether assessment of the systemic microcirculation can be used similarly as a surrogate marker of myocardial perfusion.Twenty-three patients with documented coronary artery disease (CAD 66+/-9 years old, 18 men), 16 patients with syndrome X (SXThe peripheral perfusion responses to transient forearm ischemia do not correlate with dipyridamole-induced myocardial hyperemia. The lack of correlation indicates different mechanisms of microvascular activation or regulation and confirms that extrapolations between findings in the 2 vascular beds are not suitable.
