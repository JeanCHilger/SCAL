Effect of long-term intermittent periodontal care on canine periodontal disease. The periodontal health status was assessed in two groups of dogs which had received different levels of periodontal care over a two-year period. The dental group received regular dental scaling and polishing, and intermittent daily tooth brushing, while the control group received no periodontal care. All dogs developed gingivitis, and two (one from each group) showed evidence of incipient periodontitis. The dental group had a reduced gingivitis index (GI) compared with the control group only when they had received daily tooth brushing before the GI assessment. When the dogs had not had their teeth brushed for four weeks before the assessment, the GI was not significantly different to that in the control dogs. This suggests that continual periodontal care throughout life is of great importance and questions the benefits of intermittent oral care. The GI of the palatal and lingual surfaces in all dogs was significantly higher than the GI of the buccal surfaces. Thus, all tooth surfaces may need to be cleaned to achieve optimal periodontal health.
