Post-stress end-systolic left ventricular dilation: a marker of endocardial post-ischemic stunning. Several studies have shown the accuracy of gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using thallium-201 and technetium tracers in the assessment of myocardial perfusion and function. Gated SPECT has been successfully utilized to detect post-stress left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reduction resulting from post-ischemic stunning in patients with coronary obstruction. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the post-stress LVEF impairment could be related to the post-stress end-systolic ventricular dilation resulting from post-ischemic endocardial stunning. Two hundred and eighty-two consecutive patients were studied by conventional diagnostic 2 day stress/rest gated SPECT following injection of 925 MBq of 99mTc-tetrofosmin using a dual-headed SPECT camera. One hundred and forty-seven of these patients (52%) showed reversible perfusion defects, 69 (24%) permanent defects and the remaining 66 (24%) had normal perfusion. One hundred and thirty-eight of these patients had a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and 19% underwent coronary angiography without an intervening cardiac event. Perfusion was analysed on ungated images using 20 segments scored on a five-point scale (0, normal 4, no uptake), while wall thickening (WT) was assessed visually on stress/rest end-systolic images using a four-point score (0, normal
