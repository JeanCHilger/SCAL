Effect of GLP-1 on gastric volume, emptying, maximum volume ingested, and postprandial symptoms in humans. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) relaxes the stomach during fasting but decreases hunger and food consumption and retards gastric emptying. The interrelationships between volume, emptying, and postprandial symptoms in response to GLP-1 are unclear. We performed, in healthy human volunteers, a placebo-controlled study of the effects of intravenous GLP-1 on gastric volume using (99m)Tc-single photon emission computed tomography imaging, gastric emptying of a nutrient liquid meal (Ensure) using scintigraphy, maximum tolerated volume (MTV) of Ensure, and postprandial symptoms 30 min after MTV. The role of vagal cholinergic function in the effects of GLP-1 was assessed by human pancreatic polypeptide (HPP) response to the Ensure meal. GLP-1 increased fasting and postprandial gastric volumes and retarded gastric emptying MTV and postprandial symptoms were not different compared with controls. Effects on postprandial gastric function were associated with reduced postprandial HPP levels. GLP-1 does not induce postprandial symptoms despite significant inhibition of gastric emptying and vagal function
