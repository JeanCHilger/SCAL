Clinical outcome of radiosynoviorthesis: a meta-analysis including 2190 treated joints. A variety of indications for radiosynoviorthesis have been reported in literature, but the clinical outcome differs and depends on the primary disease and the pre-existing degenerative changes. This metaanalysis was carried out to establish groups for radiosynoviorthesis based on clinical outcome with respect to primary disease, clinical stage and the pre-existing degenerative changes. The literature search was carried out using the MEDLINE search term 'radionuclide synovectomy'. Based on reports in the literature we determined groups for radiosynoviorthesis for clinical use. Our literature list comprised 2190 joints that were treated with radiosynoviorthesis. The overall response rate for all treated joints was 72.5+/-17%. The mean improvement rate for the treated joints in rheumatoid arthritis was 66.7+/-15.4%. For osteoarthritis the success rate was 56+/-11%, with better results in case of minimal radiological changes. Radiosynoviorthesis in patients with changes according to Steinbrocker I and II was successful in 72.8+/-12.3%, and in 64+/-17.3%, respectively. Steinbrocker III and IV had a mean success rate of 52.4+/-23.6%. In the case of haemophilia and Willebrand's disease a reduction of joint bleedings and factor usages after radiosynoviorthesis was evident in 91+/-4.3%. In patients with pigmented villonodular synovitis radiosynoviorthesis was successful in 77.3+/-25.3%. It is concluded that radiosynoviorthesis provides better results in rheumatoid arthritis than in osteoarthritis. Minimal or moderate changes according to Steinbrocker stages I and II respond better to radionuclide therapy than do stages III and IV. Deformed or unstable joints might fail treatment and therefore surgical interventions should be considered. Close cooperation with orthopaedists and rheumatologists is necessary to consider radiosynoviorthesis in each patient to ensure optimal medical care.
