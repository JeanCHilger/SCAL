Scatter correction for positron emission mammography. In this paper we present a scatter correction method for a regularized list mode maximum likelihood reconstruction algorithm for the positron emission mammograph (PEM) that is being developed at our laboratory. The scatter events inside the object are modelled as additive Poisson random variables in the forward model of the reconstruction algorithm. The mean scatter sinogram is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation program. With the assumption that the background activity is nearly uniform, the Monte Carlo scatter simulation only needs to run once for each PEM configuration. This saves computation time. The crystal scatters are modelled as a shift-invariant blurring in image domain because they are more localized. Thus, the useful information in the crystal scatters can be deconvolved in high-resolution reconstructions. The propagation of the noise from the estimated scatter sinogram into the reconstruction is analysed theoretically. The results provide an easy way to calculate the required number of events in the Monte Carlo scatter simulation for a given noise level in the image. The analysis is also applicable to other scatter estimation methods, provided that the covariance of the estimated scatter sinogram is available.
