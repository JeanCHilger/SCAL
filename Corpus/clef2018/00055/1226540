Canine ehrlichiosis (tropical canine pancytopenia) in Thailand. An epizootic of canine ehrlichiosis has occurred in military working dogs in Thailand. During the epizootic, 161 cases of ehrlichiosis were identified serologically in a population of 316 dogs, and 54 dogs exhibited clinical signs of disease. The epizootic is being controlled by elimination of ticks, by serologic identification and treatment of carriers with 30 mg/lb body weight/day of tetracycline for 14 days, and by continuous daily prophylactic administration of 3 mg/lb body weight/day of tetracycline. Clinical and serologic recognition of ehrlichiosis among pet dogs in widely separated regions of Thailand suggest that the disease has been endemic in Thailand for an extended time. Under such circumstances it is possible that pet and stray dogs have served as a source of infection for the epizootic in military working dogs.
