Biological correlates of clinical subgroups of Alzheimer's disease. We considered it possible that the differences in clinical symptoms between two suggested subgroups of Alzheimer's disease (AD), AD type I and AD type II, have biological correlates, for instance different metabolic profiles. Therefore, we performed regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements and investigated the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the monoamine metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-HIAA, and HMPG in 15 patients with AD type I, in 36 patients with AD type II, in a control group and in a contrast group consisting of 16 patients with frontotemporal dementia. The results suggest that there are underlying biological correlates of the phenomenological discrepancies between AD type I and AD type II. For instance, a decreased CSF level of HVA (p < 0.001) was specific to AD type I and decreased rCBF (p < 0.05 to <0.001) in three particular regions was specific to AD type II.
