Measurement of brain concentration of FK960 for development of a novel antidementia drug: a PET study in conscious rhesus monkeys. This study used PET to measure the time course of the brain concentration of (18)F-labeled N-(4-acetyl-1-piperazinyl)-p-fluorobenzamide monohydrate (FK960), a novel antidementia drug, after oral administration to conscious rhesus monkeys.Three young-adult male rhesus monkeys were tested. FK960 (0.1 mg/kg) containing about 370 MBq of (18)F-FK960 was administered orally to each monkey. Dynamic PET images were acquired for 4 h from 5 min after the administration. Arterial blood samples were withdrawn during PET scanning and were analyzed by an automatic well gamma-counter and thin-layer chromatography to determine the time course of authentic (18)F-FK960 activity concentration in plasma. FK960 concentrations in brain and plasma were calculated in units of mol/L using the specific activity of FK960 preparations.(18)F-FK960 penetrated the blood-brain barrier and underwent perfusion-dependent distribution in the entire brain. Maximal concentrations in the brain and plasma were 1.11 +/- 0.30 x 10(-7) mol/L (at 3.0 +/- 0.6 h after administration) and 4.04 +/- 1.29 x 10(-7) mol/L (at 2.0 +/- 1.1 h after administration), respectively.We succeeded in measuring the FK960 concentration in the brains of conscious monkeys and in plasma after oral administration at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. The results suggested that this method can measure the FK960 concentration in the human brain, and a potential use of the PET technique in drug development was demonstrated.
