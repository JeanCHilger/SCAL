Surgery of low-grade gliomas near speech-eloquent regions: brainmapping versus preoperative functional imaging. The identification of eloquent areas is of utmost importance in the surgery of tumors located near speech-eloquent brain areas, since the classical concept of a constant localization was proven to be untrue and the spatial localization of these areas may show large interindividual differences. Some neurosurgical centers apply intraoperative electrophysiological methods that, however, necessitate the performance of surgery in the awake patient. This might be a severe burden both for the patient and the operating team in a procedure that lasts several hours in addition, electrical stimulation may generate epileptic seizures. Alternatively, methods of functional brain imaging (e.g., PET, fMRI, MEG) may be applied, which allow individual localization of speech-eloquent areas. Matching of these image data with a conventional 3D-CT or MRI now allows the exact transfer of this information into the surgical field by neuronavigation. Whereas standards concerning electrophysiological stimulation techniques that could prevent a permanent postoperative worsening of language are available, until now it remains unclear whether the resection of regions shown to be active in functional brain imaging will cause a permanent postoperative deficit.
