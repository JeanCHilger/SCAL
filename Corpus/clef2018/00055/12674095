Voxeldoes: a computer program for 3-D dose calculation in therapeutic nuclear medicine. A computer program, VoxelDose, was developed to calculate patient specific 3-D-dose maps at the voxel level. The 3-D dose map is derived in three steps: (i) The SPECT acquisitions are reconstructed using a filtered back projection method, with correction for attenuation and scatter (ii) the 3-D cumulated activity map is generated by integrating the SPECT data
