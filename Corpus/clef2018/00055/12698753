Risk factors of contamination of pig farms in the Netherlands with pig diseases and agents thereof: a review of the literature. Part of the project 'Clean pigs' an extensive study of literature was made of the risk factors related to the introduction of pathogenic micro-organisms in pigfarms in the Netherlands. On the basis of this study of literature and in close cooperation with the experts of the steering group of the project 'Clean pigs' a number of risk factors relevant for the Dutch pig farming were estimated. The impact of these risk factors on the introduction of the most important pig diseases/-agents in Dutch pig farming was quantified for three different levels of preventive measures. It is shown that many risks can be reduced or even be neglected by the biosecurity measures already applied on pig farms. For most diseases, including list A and B diseases of the OIE list, introduction of new animals is regarded as the main risk factor, but this risk can be reduced in several ways. Besides this, aerogenic transmission and introduction by rodents and pet animals need the most attention. Through specific actions and measures several important risk factors can be diminished or even eliminated.
