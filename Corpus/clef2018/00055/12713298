First fluorescent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) reagent for hydroperoxides. A novel fluorescent reagent for hydroperoxides, 4-(2-diphenylphosphinoethylamino)-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (1), was developed on the basis of the method for designing photoinduced electron transfer (PET) reagents having a benzofurazan skeleton. Compound 1 was quantitatively reacted with hydroperoxides to give its fluorescent derivative, 2. In acetonitrile, the Phi value (0.44) of 2 was 31 times greater than that of 1. The long excitation (458 nm) and emission (520 nm) wavelengths of 2 are suitable for the determination of hydroperoxides, especially in biosamples. [structure: see text]
