Cerebellopontine angle surgery. Part 2: Specific remarks. Cerebellopontine angle tumors are uncommon lesions that can potentially be cured by microsurgical removal. The primary objective of the surgical treatment differs between vestibular schwannoma and meningioma. This feature may be influenced by the site of tumor origin and displacement of neurovascular structures as well as by their different tumor biology.A review of the current literature was conducted.Relevant cranial nerves and vascular involvement as well as anatomical location with respect to the cerebellopontine angle are discussed for vestibular schwannoma and meningioma. The main factors influencing the surgical outcome are outlined with special reference to facial and cochlear nerve function and cerebrospinal fluid leakage. The retrosigmoid approach offers a comparable success rate for hearing conservation and probably a superior outcome in terms of facial nerve function when compared with the middle fossa approach. The intrameatal limitations of the retrosigmoid approach can be excluded by the intraoperative assistance of an endoscope. The advantages of endoscope-assisted surgery may include improved visualization of relevant structures, more complete tumor removal, and a lowered risk of cerebrospinal fluid leakage.
