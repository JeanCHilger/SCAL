In vivo and in vitro evaluation of [18F]FETO with respect to the adrenocortical and GABAergic system in rats. 11beta-Hydroxylase (CYP11B1, P45011beta) plays an important role in the biosynthesis of cortisol and aldosterone and has been shown to be a good target for the in vivo imaging of adrenocortical incidentalomas in nuclear medicine. [11C]Metomidate (MTO), a potent inhibitor of this enzyme, is used for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of adrenocortical pathology. The synthesis of (R)-1-(1-phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylic acid 2-[18F]fluoroethylester (FETO), a close analogue to MTO and etomidate (ETO), has been presented recently, and the present investigation aimed to characterise the in vivo distribution of FETO. Since ETO is a well-known anaesthetic drug acting via the GABAergic system, the interaction of FETO with GABAA receptors was also evaluated. Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with 1.73-3.06 MBq of FETO into a tail vein after venodilatation in a 40 degrees C water bath. Rats were sacrificed by exsanguination from the abdominal aorta under deep ether anaesthesia after 10 (n=6), 30 (n=6) or 60 min (n=6) organs were removed, weighed and counted. For binding experiments, rat cerebellar membranes were incubated for 90 min at 4 degrees C in TC-50 buffer, 150 mM NaCl and 2 nM of [3H]flunitrazepam in the absence or presence of 10 microM diazepam or various concentrations of ETO, MTO and FETO. In vivo evaluation evinced very high uptake in the adrenal glands (7.52%+/-1.19% ID/g at 30 min), followed by lung (1.18%+/-0.19% ID/g, 10 min), liver (0.59%+/-0.13% ID/g, 10 min) and duodenum (0.7%+/-0.29% ID/g, 60 min). No defluorination nor fluoroethyl-ester cleavage was observed. When brain regions were compared with the thalamus (the reference region), highest relative uptake was seen in the cortex (2.34), followed by "rest brain" (2.13) and cerebellum (1.96). FETO and ETO were able to increase the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam with similar potencies and to a comparable extent. It is concluded that FETO shows characteristics suitable for the imaging of adrenocortical pathology with PET. Binding experiments on GABA receptors demonstrate a comparable effect of FETO and ETO. Hence, FETO possibly could also be used to elucidate the function, dynamics and kinetics of narcotic drugs with PET.
