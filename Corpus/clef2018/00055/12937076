11C]DTBZ-PET correlates of levodopa responses in asymmetric Parkinson's diseas. Levodopa effectively improves motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, the beneficial effects of levodopa often erode over time with the emergence of response fluctuations. Although these response changes have been recognized from the early levodopa era, their mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated the role of dopamine (DA) terminal loss in the development of motor fluctuations by employing PET with [11C](+/-)dihydrotetrabenazine ([11C]DTBZ) as an in vivo marker for DA nerve terminals. Levodopa response was characterized by analysing the time-response curve to a single dose of levodopa with a finger-tapping test. PET scans were performed in 11 patients with asymmetric Parkinson's disease (age: 61.12 +/- 7.97 years duration of Parkinson's disease: 10.55 +/- 4.53 years
