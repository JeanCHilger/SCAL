Correction for attenuation in technetium-99m-HMPAO SPECT brain imaging. We present a correction technique that uses the effective bone and tissue attenuation coefficients to compensate 99mTc-HMPAO brain SPECT projections for attenuation. Transverse images of a human skull filled with a uniform mixture of 99mTc and gelatin have a greater count density at the center with respect to the periphery when corrected for attenuation with the effective water/tissue coefficient of 0.12 cm-1. An attenuation coefficient of 0.09 cm-1 produces uniform images at the expense of a reduced count density. Additional experiments with phantoms wrapped with aluminum (to simulate bone) indicate that the greater count density at the image center is a result of increased attenuation at the edges of the projections where there is a greater path length through the aluminum (or bone). SPECT projections explicitly corrected for both bone and soft-tissue attenuation result in images of improved uniformity and increased count density.
