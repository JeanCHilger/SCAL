Description of a prototype emission-transmission computed tomography imaging system. We have developed a prototype imaging system that can perform simultaneous x-ray transmission CT and SPECT phantom studies. This system employs a 23-element high-purity-germanium detector array. The detector array is coupled to a collimator with septa angled toward the focal spot of an x-ray tube. During image acquisition, the x-ray fan beam and the detector array move synchronously along an arc pivoted at the x-ray source. Multiple projections are obtained by rotating the object, which is mounted at the center of rotation of the system. The detector array and electronics can count up to 10(6) cps/element with sufficient energy-resolution to discriminate between x-rays at 100-120 kVp and gamma rays from 99mTc. We have used this device to acquire x-ray CT and SPECT images of a three-dimensional Hoffman brain phantom. The emission and transmission images may be superimposed in order to localize the emission image on the transmission map.
