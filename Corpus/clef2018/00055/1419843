Neuroimaging for investigation of seizures in children. In patients with structural abnormalities of the brain with poor seizure control by medication, epilepsy surgery becomes a very important tool for seizure control. Numerous radiological imaging studies are being used for studying the abnormality in order to aid in the planning of surgery. Included in the radiological imaging modalities are CT, MR, and Xenon CT, SPECT and PET. In future, perfusion and diffusion MR as well as MEG mapping will become part of the investigative tool. The following paper is a summary and discussion of the usefulness of different modalities in different disease entities with a proposal for the method of investigation.
