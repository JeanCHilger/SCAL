The importance of learning young: the use of nesting material in laboratory rats. Unlike mice, adult laboratory rats do not spontaneously build nests when nesting material is offered. As a result, nesting material is often regarded as unsuitable environmental enrichment for laboratory rats. Wild rats and pet rats, however, have been observed to build complex nests from nesting material at hand. It was hypothesized that nest building in rats is an acquired behaviour, rather than genetically predisposed. To test this hypothesis, the progeny of three Wistar rats provided with nesting material (Kleenex tissues) during pregnancy and three standard-housed rats were divided in 34 same-sex couples with access to nesting material: (1) from the age of 8 weeks (n=7) (2) from weaning (n=8)
