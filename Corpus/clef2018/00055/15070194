Blind identification of the kinetic parameters in three-compartment models. Quantified knowledge of tissue kinetic parameters in the regions of the brain and other organs can offer information useful in clinical and research applications. Dynamic medical imaging with injection of radioactive or paramagnetic tracer can be used for this measurement. The kinetics of some widely used tracers such as [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose can be described by a three-compartment physiological model. The kinetic parameters of the tissue can be estimated from dynamically acquired images. Feasibility of estimation by blind identification, which does not require knowledge of the blood input, is considered analytically and numerically in this work for the three-compartment type of tissue response. The non-uniqueness of the two-region case for blind identification of kinetic parameters in three-compartment model is shown at least three regions are needed for the blind identification to be unique. Numerical results for the accuracy of these blind identification methods in different conditions were considered. Both a separable variables least-squares (SLS) approach and an eigenvector-based algorithm for multichannel blind deconvolution approach were used. The latter showed poor accuracy. Modifications for non-uniform time sampling were also developed. Also, another method which uses a model for the blood input was compared. Results for the macroparameter K, which reflects the metabolic rate of glucose usage, using three regions with noise showed comparable accuracy for the separable variables least squares method and for the input model-based method, and slightly worse accuracy for SLS with the non-uniform sampling modification.
