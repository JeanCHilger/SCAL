Influence of early life exposures on incidence and remission of asthma throughout life. Knowledge of the effects of early environmental and congenital factors on the natural history of asthma may provide important clues to the pathogenesis of asthma.We assessed associations between potential, early determinants and the incidence and remission of asthma throughout life, and tested whether the strength and direction of these associations varied in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.The data pertaining to the individual asthma history of 18,156 subjects, age 0 to 44 years, who attended the clinical stage of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey were analyzed retrospectively by life-event methods. Onset of asthma was defined as age at the first attack, and asthmatic patients were considered to be in remission if they had not been under treatment or had an attack of asthma in the past 24 months. Onset and remission were evaluated in 3 time windows: <10, 10 to 20, and > or =20 years of age. The associations of asthma with early determinants were estimated by hazard ratios (HRs).A family history of asthma or allergy was associated with a higher risk of developing asthma (HR, 1.89 95% CI, 1.67-2.13) and a lower chance of remission (HR, 0.79Genetic predisposition and exposure to infectious agents are major early determinants that influence a subsequent history of asthma. The length and type of exposure to infectious agents seem able either to promote or to suppress an anti-inflammatory process, unrelated to IgE, which can partially interfere with an acquired predisposition for asthma.
