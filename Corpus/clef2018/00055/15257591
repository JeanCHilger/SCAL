Attachment of an electron-withdrawing fluorophore to a cryptand for modulation of fluorescence signaling. The laterally nonsymmetric aza cryptand synthesized by condensing tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (tren) with tris[2-[(3-(oxomethyl)phenyl)oxy]ethyl]mine readily forms mononuclear inclusion complexes with both transition- and main-group-metal ions. The fluorophore 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole is attached to one of the secondary amines, to give an integrated fluorophore-receptor configuration. The fluorophoric system does not show any appreciable emission when excited due to an efficient photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer (PET) from the nitrogen lone pair. When a metal ion enters the cavity, the PET is blocked, causing recovery of fluorescence Cd(II) gives the highest quantum yield. The fluorophore, with pi-accepting ability, drastically alters the binding property of the cryptand. With perchlorate or tetrafluoroborate salts of Cd(II), the metal ion enters the cavity, causing recovery of fluorescence. However, in the presence of coordinating ions such as Cl-, N3-, and SCN-, the metal ion comes out of the cavity, causing PET to take place once again, and the fluorescence is lost. Thus, translocation of Cd(II) between the inside and outside of the cryptand cavity can lead to a reversible fluorescence on/off situation.
