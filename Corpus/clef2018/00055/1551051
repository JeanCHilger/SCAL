Indium-111 monoclonal antibody B72.3 scintigraphy in colorectal cancer. Correlation with computed tomography, surgery, histopathology, immunohistology, and human immune response. As part of an open-labeled nonrandomized multi-institutional Phase III study, the authors compared the results of In-111 (In-111) B72.3 glycyl-tyrosyl-n-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid lysine (GYK-DTPA) monoclonal antibody scintigraphy with computed tomography (CT), surgery, histopathology, immunohistology, and human antibody response in 23 patients with primary colorectal carcinoma. There were no significant adverse reactions to 1 mg of In-111-labeled antibody. Planar imaging identified 16 of 23 primary colon lesions, whereas single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) imaging identified 21. SPECT also correctly identified lymphatic involvement in four patients. (There were two false-positive results.) Liver metastases were identified with SPECT imaging. Twenty-six percent of patients developed human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA). These preliminary results demonstrate that In-111 B72.3 GYK-DTPA is a safe monoclonal antibody conjugate that has a high sensitivity for identifying primary colorectal cancer. Regional lymphatic and distant liver metastases also can be imaged, but false-positive results can occur.
