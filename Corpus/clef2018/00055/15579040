Targeting cells with MR imaging probes based on paramagnetic Gd(III) chelates. The low sensitivity is the major disadvantage of MRI as compared to PET. Therefore, amplification strategies are necessary for specific pathway labeling. This survey is aimed at exploring different routes to the entrapment of Gd(III) chelates in various type of cells at amounts sufficiently large to allow MRI visualization. Namely, the obtained results have been summarized in terms of internalization via i) pinocytosis ii) phagocytosis
