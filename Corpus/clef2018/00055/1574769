Therapy monitoring of presacral recurrences after high-dose irradiation: value of PET, CT, CEA and pain score. 21 patients were followed by positron-emission-tomography (PET) FDG (18Flourdeoxyglucose) uptake, physical examination, CT and CEA levels after combined photon-neutron irradiation for inoperable recurrent rectal carcinoma. In order to evaluate the response to radiotherapy symptomatic relief, CEA levels, decrease of tumor volume measured by CT analysis were correlated with the FDG-uptake. The objective of this study was also to investigate if the level of FDG-uptake prior to radiotherapy or the early decrease after therapy can be used as a prognostic factor. Prior to radiotherapy sacral pain was the predominant symptom. All malignancies showed measurable tumor masses, evaluation of CEA levels and enhanced tracer accumulation of FDG in the PET cross section. The mean FDG-uptake before radiotherapy was 2.3 +/- 1.1 (range 1.1 to 5.0) in 21 patients in contrast to 1.9 +/- 0.7 (range 0.8 bis 4.0) three months after radiotherapy. In six patients FDG concentration values decreased to the range of normal soft tissue, moreover, two of them relapsed after six and 22 months. Elevated FDG-uptake of the sacral bone was noted in PET cross sections in two patients, while there was no evidence of osseous alterations in CT. Normal levels of CEA were achieved in 14 patients and complete or partial pain relief in 20 of 21 patients. A decrease of tumor volume of more than 50% was detected in the follow-up CT scans of three patients but no complete remission was found. The result suggests that enhanced glucose uptake is associated with recurrent rectal cancer. However, enhanced glycolytic activity is related not only to malignant cells but also to all proliferating cells. To distinguish between proliferation, repair, inflammation, and residual viable tumor cells is not possible and may be responsible for an unchanged or elevated FDG-uptake after radiotherapy.
