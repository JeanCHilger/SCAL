Modern diagnostic procedures of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The aim of this study is a research of single photon emission tomography (SPET) values with talium 201 and tehnetium 99m MIBI, comparing it with other methods CT, MRI and ultrasonography. In our investigation there were two groups of patients 24 treated with T1-201 and 17 with Tc-99m-MIBI. Before the therapy 7 patients had been tested with T1 201 and was 100% proved the sensibility, specificity, sensitivity and also 6 patients as really positive TP and 1 patient really negative TN. The same result was gotten in the group where TC 99m was used, where 3 of them were really positive and 1 negative. All discoveries were confirmed pathohistologically and leaning on this we determined the status of really positive and really negative patients. After the therapy there were 7 positive and 7 negative patients, and also one positive, and 2 negatives that were false, who were treated by thalium. On the basis of formula of sensibility these findings show that 77,8%, if it observed only a group of patients who were being tested after the therapy, while all sensibility of methode is 86.7%, where in the analise was included a group of patients at whom was registred the primary tumor. The specificity of the method for this group of patients after the therapy is 87.5%, and the whole 88.9% where the accuarsy is 82.4% in the group after therapy and the whole is 87.5%.
