Neuroimaging in hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a poorly defined, complex neuropsychological disorder that often accompanies portal hypertension. Although the mechanisms underlining HE and the characterization of HE are still under investigation, the information derived from functional neuroimaging of patients with HE complemented by laboratory investigation and neuropsychological and neurophysiological studies have clarified much of the neuroanatomical defects. In this review, we have provided an outline of the understood mechanisms of HE and the associated findings on neuroimaging.
