Monitoring of bone marrow cell homing into the infarcted human myocardium. Intracoronary transfer of autologous bone marrow cells (BMCs) promotes recovery of left ventricular systolic function in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Although the mechanisms of this effect remain to be established, homing of BMCs into the infarcted myocardium is probably a critical early event.We determined BMC biodistribution after therapeutic application in patients with a first ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction who had undergone stenting of the infarct-related artery. Unselected BMCs were radiolabeled with 100 MBq 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) and infused into the infarct-related coronary artery (intracoronary n=3 patients) or injected via an antecubital vein (intravenous18F-FDG labeling and 3D PET imaging can be used to monitor myocardial homing and biodistribution of BMCs after therapeutic application in patients.
