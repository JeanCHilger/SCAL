The diagnostic value of non-invasive tests for determining idiopathic dilated, ischemic and hypertensive cardiomyopathies. The objectives of this study were to detect regional myocardial perfusion defects performing 99mTc-MIBI myocardial perfusion imaging and to compare the results with echocardiography for differential diagnostics of the idiopathic dilated, ischemic and hypertensive cardiomyopathies until coronary angiography will be performed.In total 90 patients with cardiomegaly have been evaluated: 30 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (group I), 30 with ischemic cardiomyopathy (group II) and 30 with hypertensive cardiomyopathy (group III). All patients underwent 2D echocardiography examination and 99mTc-MIBI myocardial perfusion imaging before coronary angiography was done.Informative complex findings (age, thickness of the interventricular septum, thickness of the left ventricle posterior wall, the wall motion score index in the region of the right coronary artery and the left anterior descending branch and the degree of distress of myocardial perfusion in the area of right coronary artery circulation) selected by variable logic model enabled to differentiate patients with idiopathic dilated, ischemic and hypertensive cardiomyopathies with an accuracy of 92.0%, 86.2% and 79.2%, respectively.Informative echocardiographic indices (thickness of the interventricular septum and left ventricle posterior wall, the mass of the myocardium, the wall motion score index in the region of the right coronary artery and left anterior descending branch, ejection fraction) selected by discriminative analysis enabled to differentiate patients with idiopathic dilated, ischemic and hypertensive cardiomyopathies with an accuracy of 62.1%, 75.2% and 80.0%, respectively.
