Application of 123I-FP-CIT in the clinical practice in Parkinsonism patients. 123I-FP-CIT scan has been supported in the last years by numerous studies as a technique of undeniable value to assess presynaptic integrity of the nigrostriatal pathway. The objective of this study is to perform a descriptive analysis of the main diagnostic aspects obtained from the first 110 studies made with FP-CIT in our center.The study population consisted of 110 consecutive patients distributed into 5 groups according to the clinical diagnosis, after a follow-up period of at least one year. Qualitative and quantitative scintigraphy was done.A total of 61.8 % (68/110) of the studies were considered abnormal and 38.2 % (42/110) as normal. Among the abnormal examinations there was 88.3 % (60/68) agreement with the clinical diagnosis and agreement was 83.4 % (35/42) in the normal examinations. Inverse significant correlation was assessed between striatal binding and severity according to the H and Y scale (r = -0.4) and between qualitative and quantitative assessment (r = -0.86). There was no significant correlation between the degeneration of dopaminergic function according to age and degree of asymmetry on striatal binding in the different groups.Generally an adequate agreement between clinical diagnosis and SPECT-FP-CIT was observed. Inverse correlation between striatal binding and H and Y scale and greater asymmetry at striatal binding was obtained among Parkinson patients than in the rest of groups.
