Caffeine decreases exercise-induced myocardial flow reserve. We studied the acute effect of caffeine on myocardial blood flow (MBF) at rest and exercise in healthy volunteers at normoxia and during acute exposure to simulated altitude.Caffeine is a widely consumed stimulant, although its cardiovascular safety remains controversial and its effect on MBF is unknown.15O-labeled H2O and positron emission tomography (PET) were used to measure regional MBF at rest and immediately after supine bicycle exercise in healthy volunteers at normoxia (n = 10 mean workload, 175 WResting MBF was not affected by caffeine at normoxia (1.05 +/- 0.36 ml/min/g vs. 1.17 +/- 0.27 ml/min/g p = NS), although it was significantly increased at hypoxia (1.71 +/- 0.41 ml/min/g vs. 2.22 +/- 0.49 ml/min/gIn healthy volunteers, a caffeine dose corresponding to two cups of coffee (200 mg) significantly decreased exercise-induced MFR at normoxia and was even more pronounced during exposure to altitude.
