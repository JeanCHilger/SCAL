Diet and disease: exploring the link through nutrigenomics. he success of the Human Genome Project and the powerful tools of molecular biology have ushered in a new era of medicine and nutrition. An emerging discipline, known as nutrigenomics, which allows the relationship between diet, genetics and disease to be delineated, looks set to transform clinical pet nutrition. In this article, Professor John Innes, from the University of Liverpool, evaluates the implications of nutrigenomics on pet health and takes a closer look at how this exciting technology is already being used to alleviate some of the symptoms of canine osteoarthritis (OA).
