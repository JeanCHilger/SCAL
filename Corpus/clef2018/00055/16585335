The role of functional neuroimaging in pediatric brain injury. The aim of this article is to review empirical studies published in the last 10 years that used various functional neuroimaging techniques to assess pediatric patients with brain injury. Overall, these studies have demonstrated the ability of functional neuroimaging to offer unique information concerning the diagnosis, clinical outcome, and recovery mechanisms after pediatric brain injury. Future research using functional neuroimaging is recommended to better understand the functional reorganization and neurodevelopmental consequences resulting from brain injury. Such research might allow clinicians to design tailored early-intervention and rehabilitation programs to maximize the recovery process for pediatric patients. Limitations and advantages associated with the use of functional neuroimaging in pediatric populations are discussed.
