In vivo imaging of benzodiazepine receptors of the central type. Two main types of benzodiazepine receptors exist in the human brain, the central receptor type being responsible for the classical actions of the compound. Although interesting findings have been obtained in epilepsy, hepatic encephalopathy and other clinical conditions, a relevant clinical indication for the in vivo imaging of receptor binding has not yet been defined, with the possible exception of the Lennox-Gastant syndrome.
