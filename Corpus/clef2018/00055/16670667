18-Fluoro-deoxy-glucose (15FDG) positon emission tomography (PET) for the evaluation of malignant pleural disease. Use of 18FDG-PET for malignant tumors of the pleura raises certain technical difficulties because of the small size of the tumors and their diffuse distribution, but hybrid PET/CT machines offer a better localization of FDG uptake. FDG-PET can discriminate between malignant and benign pleural tumors FDG uptake in the pleura is the best diagnostic criteria of malignancy. The presence of FDG uptake in pleural effusion is less discriminate between benign and malignant disease. For mesotheliomas, FDG-PET can difference malignant tumors from benign tumors of the pleura on the basis of the SUV value (<or > 2). It does not enable detection of mediastinal node involvement and regional extension but is effective in detecting extra-thoracic regional spread not identified with other imaging methods. FDG-PET can thus affect the therapeutic strategy. The intensity of uptake has prognostic value. SUV<4 associated with an epithelial tumor is a sign of good prognosis at three years. SUV > 4 associated with a non-epithelial tumor is a sign of poor prognosis. For mesotheliomas, FDG uptake can be used to assess the effect of chemotherapy and determine whether patients are good responders or not.
