1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced acute transient dystonia in monkeys associated with low striatal dopamine. Unilateral intracarotid infusion of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in baboons produces transient contralateral dystonia lasting 2-3 weeks followed by chronic hemiparkinsonism. We now extend this model to Macaca nemestrina and Macaca fascicularis. MPTP was infused unilaterally into the internal carotid artery of two M. nemestrina and 11 M. fascicularis. Effects were assessed with blinded clinical ratings of dystonia and Parkinsonism [18F]-6-fluoro-DOPA (FDOPA) positron emission tomography
