Risk factors for de novo acute cardiac events in patients initiating hemodialysis with no previous cardiac symptom. An initial major adverse cardiac event (MACE) is an important predictor of future cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We sought to identify factors influencing occurrence of initial MACE in new maintenance hemodialysis patients without previous cardiac symptoms during the predialysis phase of CKD. Among 112 participating patients with no predialysis cardiac history, 57 underwent coronary angiography, whereas the other 55 underwent stress thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography within 1 month of beginning hemodialysis to detect asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). In subsequent follow-up for a median of 24 months, subjects experiencing an initial MACE were compared with those who did not have such an event based on several clinical parameters at the end of predialysis phase. Asymptomatic CAD was present in 47 patients (42%), who had a higher cumulative MACE rate, than subjects without CAD (49 vs 3%, P<0.001). Multivariate Cox's regression analysis showed that three variables independently predicted initial MACE: asymptomatic CAD (hazard ratio or HR, 611.31 95% confidence interval or CI, 14.07-26549.23
