Bioinspired detection of light using a porphyrin-sensitized single-wall nanotube field effect transistor. Single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) field effect transistors (FETs), functionalized noncovalently with a zinc porphyrin derivative, were used to directly detect a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) within a donor/acceptor (D/A) system. We report here that the SWNTs act as the electron donor and the porphyrin molecules as the electron acceptor. The magnitude of the PET was measured to be a function of both the wavelength and intensity of applied light, with a maximum value of 0.37 electrons per porphyrin for light at 420 nm and 100 W/m2. A complete understanding of the photophysics of this D/A system is necessary, as it may form the basis for applications in artificial photosynthesis and alternative energy sources such as solar cells.
