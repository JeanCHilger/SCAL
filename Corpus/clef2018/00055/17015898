18F-FDG PET/CT of thymic epithelial tumors: usefulness for distinguishing and staging tumor subgroups. The purpose of our study was to assess the usefulness of integrated PET/CT using 18F-FDG for distinguishing thymic epithelial tumors according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification.Thirty-three patients (age range, 34-68 y mean age, 54.6 y) with thymic epithelial tumors, who underwent both integrated PET/CT and enhanced CT, were included. The clinicopathologic stages, maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs), and uptake patterns of tumors on integrated PET/CT images, and various enhanced CT findings, are described according to the simplified (low-risk [types A, AB, and B1] and high-risk [types B2 and B3] thymomas and thymic carcinomas) subgroups of the WHO classification. Discriminant analysis was performed to determine the relative capabilities of integrated PET/CT and enhanced CT findings to differentiate tumor subgroups.Tumors included 8 low-risk thymomas, 9 high-risk thymomas, and 16 thymic carcinomas. The maximum SUVs of high-risk thymomas (P < 0.001) and low-risk thymomas (P < 0.001) were found to be significantly lower than those of thymic carcinomas. Homogeneous 18F-FDG uptake within tumors was more frequently seen in thymic carcinomas than in high-risk thymomas (P = 0.027) or low-risk thymomas (P = 0.001). The uptake pattern (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous) on integrated PET/CT images and the presence of mediastinal fat invasion on enhanced CT images were found to be useful for differentiating tumor subgroups. In addition, integrated PET/CT helped detect lymph node metastases, which were not identified on enhanced CT in 2 patients.Integrated PET/CT was found to be useful for differentiating subgroups of thymic epithelial tumors and for staging the extent of the disease.
