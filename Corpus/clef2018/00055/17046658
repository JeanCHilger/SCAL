Micro-imaging of amyloid in mice. Scintigraphic imaging of radioiodinated serum amyloid P-component is a proven method for the clinical detection of peripheral amyloid deposits (Hawkins et al., 1990). However, the inability to perform comparably high-resolution studies in experimental animal models of amyloid disease has impacted not only basic studies into the pathogenesis of amyloidosis but also in the preclinical in vivo evaluation of potential anti-amyloid therapeutic agents. We have developed microimaging technologies, implemented novel computational methods, and established protocols to generate high-resolution images of amyloid deposits in mice. (125)I-labeled serum amyloid P component (SAP) and an amyloid-fibril reactive murine monoclonal antibody (designated 11-1F4) have been used successfully to acquire high-resolution single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) images that, when fused with x-ray computed tomographic (CT) data, have provided precise anatomical localization of secondary (AA) and primary (AL) amyloid deposits in mouse models of these diseases. This chapter will provide detailed protocols for the radioiodination and purification of amyloidophilic proteins and the generation of mouse models of AA and AL amyloidosis. A brief description of the available hardware and the parameters used to acquire high-resolution microSPECT and CT images is presented, and the tools used to perform image reconstruction and visualization that permit the analysis and presentation of image data are discussed. Finally, we provide established methods for measuring organ- and tissue-specific activities with which to corroborate the microSPECT and CT images.
