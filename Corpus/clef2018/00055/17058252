Fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography contributes to management of pediatric liver transplantation candidates with fever of unknown origin. Fever of unknown origin (FUO) frequently complicates the management of pediatric patients with terminal chronic liver failure during the pretransplantation period and may lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Nonhepatic origins of systemic infections may render the patient unsuitable for transplantation whereas infections within the liver may require organ resection for a cure. Therefore, accurate localization of the infection focus is critical for optimal management of children on the waiting list for liver transplantation. Here we report our experience using [18 F]fluordeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) to detect the origin of infection in 11 children with biliary cirrhosis presenting with FUO during the waiting period for liver transplantation. In 5 children, positive intrahepatic FDG-PET signals correlated with bacterial cultures of the excised liver and/or anatomic or histologic signs of infection. Based on the FDG-PET findings, these patients underwent transplantation after continuous antibiotic treatment with ongoing, recurrent episodes of fever. In 6 children, no abnormal hepatic FDG-PET signals were found and no infections could be detected in the liver. Transplantation in these patients was performed only after becoming afebrile. Standard imaging techniques did not reveal abnormalities compatible with infection in any of the children. In conclusion, in children with biliary cirrhosis and FUO on the waiting list for liver transplantation, information obtained by FDG-PET imaging may be useful for decisions on therapy and suitability for liver transplantation.
