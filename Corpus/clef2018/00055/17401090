Visual assessment versus quantitative assessment of 11C-PIB PET and 18F-FDG PET for detection of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) imaging with N-methyl-(11)C-2-(4'-methylamino-phenyl)-6-hydroxy-benzothiazole ((11)C-6-OH-BTA-1 also known as (11)C-PIB) shows a robust increase in cortical binding in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to explore the clinical potential of Abeta imaging for the diagnosis of AD by comparison of the accuracy of visual reading of (11)C-PIB images with quantitative analysis and (18)F-FDG.Fifteen AD patients (age, 71.1 +/- 11.3 y [mean +/- SD] mini-mental state examination [MMSE], 18.9 +/- 9.3 [mean +/- SD]) and 25 healthy control (HC) subjects (age, 71.9 +/- 6.82 yVisual agreement between readers was excellent for (11)C-PIB (kappa = 0.90) and good for (18)F-FDG (kappa = 0.56). (11)C-PIB was more accurate than (18)F-FDG both on visual reading (accuracy, 90% vs. 70%, P = 0.05) and ROC analysis (95% vs. 83%, P = 0.02). Accuracy declined more with (18)F-FDG than with (11)C-PIB in the older group.Visual analysis of (11)C-PIB images appears more accurate than visual reading of (18)F-FDG for identification of AD and has accuracy similar to quantitative analysis of a 90-min dynamic scan. The accuracy of (11)C-PIB PET is limited by cortical binding in some healthy elderly subjects, consistent with postmortem studies of cerebral Abeta. Longitudinal follow-up is required to determine if this represents detection of preclinical AD.
