Turf wars in radiology: should it be radiologists or cardiologists who do cardiac imaging? In recent years, the cardiac capabilities of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and to a lesser extent positron emission tomography have rapidly advanced. This has led to contention between radiologists and cardiologists over who should perform and interpret these studies. The authors present the arguments favoring both sides and discuss strategies radiologists should pursue. Although the arguments favoring radiologists are more compelling, this may be an instance in which both sides should work together.
