Immunoscintigraphy of local recurrent rectal cancer with 99mTc-labeled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody CL58. To explore a specific diagnostic method for local recurrent rectal cancer.Immunoscintigraphy with (99m)Tc-labeled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (MoAb) CL-58 was performed for patients suspected of having a postoperative local recurrent rectal cancer and the findings were compared with the results of conventional imaging and pathology.A total of 36 patients with a suspected local recurrent rectal cancer underwent immunoscintigraphy with (99m)Tc-conjugated CL58. Local recurrence of rectal cancer was identified in 31 patients and established in 30 during operation, endoscopy and pathological examination. No local recurrence was found in 5 patients without specific accumulation of (99m)Tc during the follow-up. Immunoscintigraphy had a positive rate of 86.11%, a specificity of 83.33%, and a sensitivity of 100%.Immunoscintigraphy has a highly specific and predictive value for detecting local recurrent rectal cancer, especially after abdominal perineal resection (APR).
