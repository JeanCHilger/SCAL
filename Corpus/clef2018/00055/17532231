The contribution of 18F-FDG PET in preoperative epilepsy surgery evaluation for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy A meta-analysis. To assess the predictive diagnostic added value of positron emission tomography (PET) in preoperative epilepsy surgery evaluation for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).A meta-analysis of publications from 1992 to 2006 was performed. Forty-six studies were identified that met inclusion criteria presenting detailed diagnostic test results and a classified postoperative outcome. Studies exclusively reporting on patients with brain tumors or on children were excluded.The analyses were complicated by significant differences in study design and often by lack of precise patient data. Ipsilateral PET hypometabolism showed a predictive value of 86% for good outcome. The predictive value was 80% in patients with normal MRI and 72% in patients with non-localized ictal scalp EEG. In a selected population of 153 TLE patients with a follow-up of >12 months PET correlated well with other non-invasive diagnostic tests, but none of the odds ratios of any test combination was significant.Our data confirm that ipsilateral PET hypometabolism may be an indicator for good postoperative outcome in presurgical evaluation of drug-resistant TLE, although the actual diagnostic added value remained questionable and unclear. PET does not appear to add value in patients localized by ictal scalp EEG and MRI. Prospective studies limited to non-localized ictal scalp EEG or MRI-negative patients are required for validation.
