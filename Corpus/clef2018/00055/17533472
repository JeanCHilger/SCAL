Association between risk factors for coronary artery disease and coronary disease in patients undergoing myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. To establish the degree of association between cardiovascular risk factors and the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in a group of patients undergoing myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS).The study included 7183 patients who had undergone MPS. Using logistic regression analysis the odds ratios for the following risk factors were evaluated: age, gender, family history, body mass index, smoking, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM) and systemic hypertension. Indicators for the presence of CAD were defined as: myocardial infarction, revascularization, angioplasty or an altered MPS. Analysis was based on the whole the group as well as on male and female subgroups. The impact of the risk factors in relation to age was also analyzed.A statistically significant association was observed between patient age and gender and the presence of CAD. For females, it was demonstrated that DM is the main modifiable risk factor for CAD. For males various modifiable risk factors were associated with the presence of CAD, particularly DM and dyslipidemia. In the analysis by age groups some risk factors showed a more expressive association.The main risk factors for CAD were aging and male gender. In relation to modifiable risk factors and the presence of CAD, the greatest associations for males were DM and dyslipidemia and for females DM. The most relevant factors for specific age groups were smoking for young men and DM and smoking for women between the ages of 40 and 50.
