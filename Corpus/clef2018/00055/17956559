Noninvasive assessment of coronary microvascular function in women at risk for ischaemic heart disease. The primary objective of the current review is to describe the assessment of coronary microvascular function by noninvasive imaging techniques in women at risk for and with ischaemic heart disease (IHD). The search criteria were the analyses of the related bibliography published in PUBMED database. Normal or minimal obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) at angiography is a common finding in women with signs of ischaemia. Up to 50% of them will have coronary microvascular dysfunction, suggesting that the mechanism of ischaemia may be localised at coronary microcirculation level. Noninvasive measurements of coronary microvascular function can be performed by radionuclide techniques. In particular, positron emission tomography (PET) measures myocardial blood flow (MBF) not only relatively but also in absolute units. Thus, PET offers the possibility to uncover microvascular dysfunction even in patients without obstructive CAD. PET-derived estimates of MBF showed an abnormal coronary microvascular function in women with chest pain and non-obstructive CAD and in women with high-risk conditions for CAD. Interestingly, there is a relationship between an abnormal coronary vascular function and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In particular, this significant relationship was observed with measurements related to endothelial function. Recent evidence suggests that vascular dysfunction plays a central role as an estimator of outcomes in women at risk for or with IHD. Therefore, assessment of coronary vascular function in these women appears to be of clinical relevance. Whether such evaluation may have an impact to reduce cardiac events needs further investigation.
