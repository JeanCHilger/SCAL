Role of cardiac computed tomography in patients with suspected coronary artery disease: interaction with nuclear cardiology. Coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) and myocardial perfusion single photon emission CT (SPECT, or MPS) provide complementary information on vascular structure and myocardial perfusion. In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), the combination of both methods is helpful for disease detection and therapeutic strategy planning. This article addresses the utility of coronary CTA with current 64-row multidetector CT instruments, MPS, and the combination of these methods in the evaluation of CAD.
