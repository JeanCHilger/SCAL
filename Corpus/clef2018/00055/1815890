Selective attention modulates extrastriate visual regions in humans during visual feature discrimination and recognition. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to identify regions of the human visual system which were selectively modulated by attention during feature discrimination and recognition tasks. In a first experiment, subjects were cued to the shape, colour or speed of visual stimulus arrays during a same-different match-to-sample paradigm. The psychophysical sensitivity for discriminating subtle attribute variations was enhanced by selective attention. Correspondingly, the neural activity (as measured by blood flow changes) in different visual associative regions was enhanced when subjects attended to different attributes of the same stimulus (intraparietal sulcus for speed collateral sulcus and dorsolateral occipital cortex for colour
