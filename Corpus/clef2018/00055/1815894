The functional anatomy of recovery from brain injury. The functional neuroanatomical basis for recovery from ischaemic brain injury is not known. We have used positron emission tomography (PET) to study changes in the functional organization of the brain in patients recovering from striatocapsular motor strokes. Significant changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were found during repetitive sequential opposition movements of the fingers in normal subjects and in patients with recovery from motor deficits. There was a difference in the pattern of cerebral activation when patients performed the motor task with the unaffected hand (when the activation was lateralized to contralateral sensorimotor and premotor cortex and ipsilateral cerebellum) and when the task was performed with the recovered, previously plegic hand (when the activation was bilateral and involved novel areas of cortex, especially area 40). Comparisons of rCBF maps at rest in the patient group and in normal subjects showed areas with significantly decreased rCBF in the patients (contralateral to the plegic hand in the basal ganglia, thalamus, insular cortex, brainstem and ipsilateral cerebellum), which reflected the distribution of dysfunction caused by the ischaemic lesions. A significantly increased activation over and above that in normal subjects was found in patients during movement of the recovered fingers in ipsilateral premotor cortex and bilateral frontal opercular/insular regions and area 40, the ipsilateral basal ganglia (the ischaemic lesion lying contralaterally) and the contralateral cerebellum. We postulate that these findings may be explained by the generation of movements by pathways that are different from those that normal subjects use to perform what are ordinarily fairly simple, automated tasks. We suggest that this is a direct demonstration of cerebral plasticity resulting in the resolution of acquired motor deficits.
