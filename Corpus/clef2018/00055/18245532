The prognostic significance of serum beta2 microglobulin levels in acute myeloid leukemia and prognostic scores predicting survival: analysis of 1,180 patients. Serum beta(2) microglobulin (beta2M) is prognostic in other hematologic malignancies therefore, we evaluated its prognostic significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).Multivariate analyses were used to examine the effect of pretreatment serum beta2M levels on clinical outcomes in patients with AML. beta2M was associated with poorer survival in older but not younger patients. We thus fit separate Cox survival models in patients above and below age 60 years treated with remission induction therapy containing high-dose cytarabine (n = 1,280). In each age group, 50% of the patients were used to develop the model, which was tested in the other 50%. Resampling methods were also used to validate the independent prognostic significance of covariates.In patients 60 years or older (n = 591), poorer risk cytogenetics poorer performance statusSerum beta2M levels can help predict outcome in patients > or =60 years with untreated AML, and their use is strongly encouraged.
