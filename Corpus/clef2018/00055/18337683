Temporal profile of fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in malignant lesions and normal organs over extended time periods in patients with lung carcinoma: implications for its utilization in assessing malignant lesions. In this study, the fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake was prospectively investigated in tumors as well as the normal organs over 8 h in patients with non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The intent of this study was to collect positron emission tomography (PET) data with regard to the time course of FDG uptake in the primary and metastatic sites and the normal tissues over extended time periods (up to 8 h) after intravenous FDG injection in patients.Three patients (2 males, 1 female mean age: 64 yearsThe observed mean SUVmax at different time points (5 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h and 8 h) in the organs and the lesions were as follows: 1) heart: 2.9, 2, 1.9, 1.6, 1.3, 1.5 2) kidney: 3.3, 3.5, 2.6, 2.1, 2, 2The results from this preliminary study indicate that while the tumor sites show increased uptake of FDG during the course of 8 h, surrounding normal tissues demonstrate declining or stable values with time. This would indicate increasing contrast between the lesion and the background and, therefore, possibly improved sensitivity of the test. While the high SUV at 5 min can be explained by the blood pool activity in the organs and the malignant lesions, the SUVmax values at the later times decreases or remains the same in normal organs. The observation on the different slopes of the curves among the various malignant lesions can be partly explained by the well known ''seed and soil'' theory in cancer biology. The finding of continued increases in the blood to plasma count ratios of (18)F activity is also noteworthy and most likely reflects GLUT-1 mediated glucose transport into red blood cells.
