Arsenic removal from water employing heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO2 immobilized in PET bottles. Arsenic oxidation (As(III) to As(V)) and As(V) removal from water were assessed by using TiO2 immobilized in PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles in the presence of natural sunlight and iron salts. The effect of many parameters was sequentially studied: TiO2 concentration of the coating solution, Fe(II) concentration, pH, solar irradiation time dissolved organic carbon concentration. The final conditions (TiO2 concentration of the coating solution: 10%
