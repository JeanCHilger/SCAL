3'-Deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine as a proliferation imaging tracer for diagnosis of lung tumors: comparison with 2-deoxy-2-18f-fluoro-D-glucose. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of 3'-deoxy-3'-F-fluorothymidine (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) for detection of lung tumor in comparison with 2-deoxy-2-F-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) PET.Fifty-four patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomographic (CT) scan suggestive of a malignant tumor were examined with both FLT and FDG PET. The intensity of uptake in lung tumors was scored. For visualized lesions, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated.Thirty-six patients were found to have lung cancer and 18, benign lesions. Using visual analysis, the sensitivity of FLT PET for detection of lung cancer was 83%These preliminary results indicate that FLT PET may be specific for malignant tumors although uptake of FLT in lung cancer was significantly lower than that of FDG.
