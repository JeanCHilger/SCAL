Intracellular and extracellular targets of molecular imaging in the myocardium. Utilization of molecular imaging has significantly advanced the field of cardiovascular medicine. In addition to the targets currently in use, novel targets are being developed, including those involved in the processes of myocardial metabolism, myocardial injury, cardiac neurotransmission, and interstitial dysregulation. Further development of these imaging targets may lead to improved characterization of disease processes and guide provision of individualized therapies.
