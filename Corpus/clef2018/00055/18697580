A study on the seroconversion in dogs vaccinated with cell culture rabies vaccine. Seroconversion studies were conducted in dogs vaccinated with rabies vaccine, of different age group, sex and breed, with a single and booster doses of cell culture Rabies vaccine. The results of the present study revealed that (i) Maternal antibodies were detected in 40% to 80% of 60 selected pet dogs. However 20% to 60% of the pet dogs did not have protective levels of antibody (<0.5IU). (ii) A single dose of vaccine resulted in appreciable levels of protective antibody in 100% of pet dogs both in seronegetive and in dogs with low levels of antibody. (iii) When a booster dose was administered at twelve months period, considerable levels of antibody persisted upto twenty-four months. It can be concluded from the present study that a single dose of potent tissue culture vaccine resulted protective levels of antibody in the seronegetive dogs (<0.5IU). In an Rabies endemic country like INDIA, annual booster dose of vaccine would enhance the immune response and help in the persistence of protective levels of antibody in the immunized dogs.
