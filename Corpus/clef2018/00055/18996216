Sensory-motor and cognitive functions of the human posterior parietal cortex involved in manual actions. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is considered the dominant structure in the dorsal stream of visual processing, defined in the context of systems for perception and action. It is well-established that the human PPC is critical to sensory-motor transformations involved in online manual actions. A related body of literature identifies the PPC as important to cognitive aspects of action representation such as imagery, tool use, and gestures. The goal of the present paper is to review and compare the PPC contribution to representations of both motor control and motor cognition. Relating the sensory-motor and cognitive components of PPC function is important for an understanding of integrative representations of manual actions and the relation between perception, action, and cognition. Proposed theories of multiple dorsal stream systems supporting different action-relevant goals are discussed.
