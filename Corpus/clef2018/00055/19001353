Potential value of quantitative analysis of cerebral PET in early cognitive decline. In patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, positron emission tomography brain scans can have characteristic hypometabolic patterns that strongly support this diagnosis, but this pattern is often subtle or absent in early stages. A sensitive and objective method for detection of positron emission tomography abnormalities may have value in early detection of Alzheimer's disease.A 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography scans from cognitively impaired patients (n = 43) were compared individually to 28 normal controls using statistical parametric mapping, hypometabolic regions visualized, and clinically correlated. The objective SPM results were compared to the official Nuclear Medicine report based upon subjective interpretation criteria.A total of 22/43 had abnormalities per the Nuclear Medicine physician, while 21/43 appeared normal. The objective analysis detected abnormalities in 41/43 participants, including 19 of 21 that appeared normal. In these 19, 8 had findings consistent with early Alzheimer's disease.Objective analysis of positron emission tomography brain scans may extend the ability to detect early brain abnormalities in patients with cognitive decline.
