Post-traumatic mutism in children. To explore the pathological mechanism of post-traumatic mutism (PTM) in children.A retrospective study of 16 children who suffered from severe head injury and developed PTM.Post-traumatic coma lasted from 2-72 days, average 15.5 days while post-traumatic mutism lasted from 2-56 days, average 11.94 days. The correlation between duration of coma and mutism was significant (p < 0.001). SPECT found that multiple persistent ischaemic brain regions occurred in all patientsMost PTM occurred in patients with diffuse brain injury. The duration of mutism was related to the number of ischaemic brain regions and the duration of post-traumatic coma.
