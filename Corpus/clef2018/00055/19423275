Alveolar echinococcosis: from an incurable rural disease to a controlled urban infection. Human alveolar echinococcosis is a parasitic zoonosis with intermediate (rodents and small lagomorphs) and final (carnivores) hosts. The latter can transmit the parasite to humans, by their feces, which are contaminated by the oncospheres of Echinococcus multilocularis, the larvae of which develop in the liver like a slow cancer. Political, socioeconomic, and ecological factors can affect the intermediate and final hosts and thus influence the long-term emergence and stability of endemic areas. The past 20 years have been marked by: Epidemiologic changes: discovery of an endemic area in China, the largest in the world extension of the European endemic range to the east and north
