Acute homing of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells in intramyocardial vs. intracoronary transplantation. Cell homing optimisation after transplantation is critical in myocardial infarction (MI) cell therapy.Eight pigs were randomized to receiving autologous purified (111)indium-labeled bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) (10(8) cells/2 ml) by intramyocardial (IM) (n=4) or by intracoronary (IC) (n=4) transplantation after 90 minutes occlusion of the CX-coronary artery. Dual isotope SPECT imaging was performed 2 and 24 hours postoperatively. Two animals were additionally analyzed on the sixth postoperative day. Tissue samples from the major organs were analyzed.In SPECT imaging revealed that BMMCs administered using IM injection remained in the injured area. In contrast, minor proportion of IC transplanted cells remained in the myocardium, as most of the cells showed homing in the lungs. Analysis of the biopsies showed a seven-fold greater number of cells in the myocardium for the IM method and a 10-fold greater number of cells in the lungs in the IC group (p < 0.001).In producing persistently high cell homing at the infarction site, the IM transplantation is superior to the IC transplantation. However, the IC administration might be more specific in targeting injured capillaries and epithelial cells within the infarcted myocardium.
