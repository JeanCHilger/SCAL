Mediastinal nodes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer: MRI findings with PET/CT and pathologic correlation. The purpose of this article is to correlate MRI findings of mediastinal nodes with PET/CT and pathology in non-small cell lung cancer.Malignant nodes show high FDG uptake at PET, or eccentric cortical thickening or obliterated fatty hilum on T2-weighted MRI. Benign nodes (with follicular hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis, fibrotic micronodules, or calcification) may show high FDG uptake at PET, whereas MRI may help distinguish benign from malignant nodes by showing low signal intensity in nodes on T2-weighted MRI.
