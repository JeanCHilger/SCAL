Preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of a nitric oxide-inducible lactate dehydrogenase from Staphylococcus aureus. Recent studies have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus can survive the nitrosative stress (caused by the radical nitric oxide NO.) mounted by the immune system of the infected host. It does this by expressing a nitric oxide-inducible L-lactate dehydrogenase (Sa-LDH-1). Therefore, if efficient inhibitors of Sa-LDH-1 can be designed then Sa-LDH-1 could be a potential drug target against the pathogen S. aureus. For this purpose, the nitric acid-inducible LDH-1 from S. aureus COL strain has been cloned into the expression vector pET-28a(+) and the protein has been expressed, purified and crystallized. The Sa-LDH-1 crystal diffracted to 2.4 A resolution at a home X-ray source and belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 131.4, b = 74.4, c = 103.2 A, beta = 133.4 degrees .
