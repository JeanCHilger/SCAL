Synthesis and evaluation of l-5-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethoxy)tryptophan as a new PET tracer. A convenient remote controlled synthesis of a new tryptophan analog, l-5-(2-[(18)F] fluoroethoxy)-tryptophan (5-(18)FEHTP) was described. The radiochemical yield within 65min was about 12-16% without decay correction, the radiochemical purity was over 98%, and 5-(18)FEHTP dissolved in saline was stable over 6h at room temperature. The biodistribution of 5-(18)FEHTP in mice and the high uptake of 5-(18)FEHTP in tumor demonstrated that it is very likely a new PET tracer for tumor imaging.
