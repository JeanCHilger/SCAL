Assessment of fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by leiomyomas in relation to histopathologic subtype and the menstrual state. The aim of this study was to assess fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake by leiomyomas in relation to histopathologic subtype and the menstrual state.We performed a retrospective study of 92 patients referred for uterine leiomyomas confirmed by histopathologic findings. On FDG-positron emission tomography, quantitative evaluation was performed using the mean values of the standardized uptake value (SUV) with reference to magnetic resonance imaging findings. Of the 92 patients, 56 had typical leiomyomas (41 premenopausal and 15 postmenopausal women), whereas 36 patients with subtype leiomyomas consisted of 21 premenopausal and 15 postmenopausal women.Although no significant differences in SUV were observed between the typical and subtype leiomyomas, tumoral SUV was significantly higher in the premenopausal patients than in the postmenopausal patients. Uterine tumoral FDG uptake during the proliferative phase was also slightly lower than in the other menstrual phases.The FDG uptake by leiomyomas in premenopausal women was greater than that in postmenopausal women.
