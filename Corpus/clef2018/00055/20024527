Magnetoencephalography in psychiatry. Neuropsychiatric disorders usually come with only sublime structural changes. Functional imaging can point at specific disturbances in information processing in neural networks. Besides imaging of receptor and metabolic functions with PET and fMRI, electromagnetic methods such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) offer the possibility for imaging of dynamic dysfunctions. As compared to EEG, MEG has a shorter history and is less common despite offering considerable advantages in temporospatial resolution and sensitivity to detect impaired signal processing and network functioning which renders it particularly interesting for psychiatric applications. Disturbed processing in the auditory and visual domain emerging in schizophrenic, affective and anxiety disorders can be detected with high sensitivity. Moreover, the neuromagnetic baseline activity allows conclusions to be drawn regarding neural network functions. Due to its high sensitivity to single deficits in information processing and to pharmacological effects, MEG will achieve clinical significance in specific areas.
