Detection of residual lymph node metastases in high-risk papillary thyroid cancer patients receiving adjuvant I-131 therapy: the usefulness of F-18 FDG PET/CT. The aims of this retrospective study were to evaluate the incidence of residual lymph node (LN) metastases in high-risk papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patients receiving adjuvant I-131 therapy, especially in those without I-131 accumulation, and to evaluate the clinical usefulness of F-18 FDG PET/CT to detect those lesions.The 37 PTC patients receiving adjuvant I-131 therapy were retrospectively evaluated. We examined the incidence of residual LN metastasis and compared the accumulation of F-18 FDG and I-131 in those lesions, and compared the serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels between patients with and without residual LN metastases.A total of 33 lesions were diagnosed as residual LN metastases in 9 patients. FDG accumulated in all of the lesions, but 19 lesions (57.6%) of them had no I-131 accumulation. The SUVmax was significantly higher in lesions without I-131 accumulation than in lesions with I-131 accumulation (6.6 +/- 2.8 vs. 4.2 +/- 1.8 P = 0.007). The serum Tg levels were significantly higher in patients with residual LN metastases than in patients without it (709.9 +/- 1470.8 vs. 25.6 +/- 37.1 ng/mLThese results indicate that the residual LN metastasis was relatively common in high-risk PTC patients receiving adjuvant I-131 therapy whose serum Tg levels remained detectable, and those lesions often had no I-131 accumulation. FDG-PET/CT would be recommended for PTC patients with detectable serum Tg levels to detect residual LN metastases.
