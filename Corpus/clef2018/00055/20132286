Interictal cerebral blood flow abnormality in cryptogenic West syndrome. To elucidate the abnormality of interictal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of West syndrome at the onset.Quantitative measurement of rCBF with an autoradiography method using N-isopropyl-((123)I) p-iodoamphetamine single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed on 14 infants with cryptogenic West syndrome. Regions of interest (ROIs) for rCBF were placed automatically using an automated ROI analysis software (three-dimensional stereotactic ROI template), and were grouped into 12 segments: callosomarginal, precentral, central, parietal, angular, temporal, posterior cerebral, pericallosal, lenticular nucleus, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. We compared rCBF between the patients and seven age-matched infants with cryptogenic focal epilepsy as a control group. The patients were divided into two groups according to the duration from onset to SPECT, to compare rCBF.Quantitative analysis revealed cerebral hypoperfusion in cryptogenic West syndrome with normal SPECT images under visual inspection. In bilateral central, posterior cerebral, pericallosal, lenticular nucleus, and hippocampus, and in the left parietal, temporal, and cerebellum, and in the right angular and thalamus segments there were statistical differences (p < 0.05). Compared with the duration from onset to SPECT, there were no significant differences of rCBF in all segments.Broad cerebral hypoperfusion with posterior predominance involving the hippocampus and lenticular nucleus implies that even cryptogenic West syndrome has a widespread cerebral dysfunction at least transiently, which would correspond to clinical manifestations of hypsarrhythmia and epileptic spasms. Hippocampal hypoperfusion suggests the dysfunction of hippocampal circuitry in the brain adrenal axis, and may contribute to subsequent cognitive impairment of cryptogenic West syndrome.
