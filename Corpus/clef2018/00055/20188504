Myocardial iodine-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine imaging and cardiac events in heart failure. Results of the prospective ADMIRE-HF (AdreView Myocardial Imaging for Risk Evaluation in Heart Failure) study. The ADMIRE-HF (AdreView Myocardial Imaging for Risk Evaluation in Heart Failure) study prospectively evaluated iodine-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-mIBG) imaging for identifying symptomatic heart failure (HF) patients most likely to experience cardiac events.Single-center studies have demonstrated the poorer prognosis of HF patients with reduced (123)I-mIBG myocardial uptake, but these observations have not been validated in large multicenter trials.A total of 961 subjects with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II/III HF and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < or =35% were studied. Subjects underwent (123)I-mIBG myocardial imaging (sympathetic neuronal integrity quantified as the heart/mediastinum uptake ratio [H/M] on 4-h delayed planar images) and myocardial perfusion imaging and were then followed up for up to 2 years. Time to first occurrence of NYHA functional class progression, potentially life-threatening arrhythmic event, or cardiac death was compared with H/M (either in relation to estimated lower limit of normal [1.60] or as a continuous variable) using Cox proportional hazards regression. Multivariable analyses using clinical, laboratory, and imaging data were also performed.A total of 237 subjects (25%) experienced events (median follow-up 17 months). The hazard ratio for H/M > or =1.60 was 0.40 (p < 0.001) the hazard ratio for continuous H/M was 0.22 (p < 0.001). Two-year event rate was 15% for H/M > or =1.60 and 37% for H/M <1.60ADMIRE-HF provides prospective validation of the independent prognostic value of (123)I-mIBG scintigraphy in assessment of patients with HF.
