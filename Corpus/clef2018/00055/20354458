Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for lymph node staging in patients with non-small cell lung cancer in non-operable patients pursuing radiotherapy as a primary treatment. Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) is a promising modality with excellent localization and significant biologic effects on tumors. Nevertheless, success depends primarily on accurate staging before radiotherapy. Surgical interventions should be avoided in patients considered for CIRT because they usually have multiple comorbidities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for lymph node staging in patients with non-small cell lung cancer before CIRT.From April 2005 to December 2007, 49 patients with non-small cell lung cancer considered for CIRT with abnormal positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) accumulations in the mediastinum and/or hilum were evaluated by EBUS-TBNA. The convex probe EBUS was used for EBUS-TBNA.There were 38 men and 11 women. Their mean age was 75.2 years (range: 55-87). Based on PET-CT, clinical staging was four with N1 disease, 42 with N2 disease, and three with N3 disease. By histology, 26 patients had adenocarcinoma, 19 had squamous cell carcinoma, and four had other histologies. All positive lymph nodes on PET-CT were aspirated (range: 1-5 average 2.55 lymph nodes/patient). EBUS-TBNA diagnosed 43 cases as N0 disease and as a result underwent CIRT. Forty of the 43 cases remained in stable condition without local recurrences (follow-up 6-46 months). The diagnostic accuracy of EBUS-TBNA for lymph node staging was 93.9%.EBUS-TBNA offers accurate minimally invasive lymph node staging in patients who are candidates for CIRT. EBUS-TBNA can be safely performed with a high diagnostic accuracy before CIRT.
