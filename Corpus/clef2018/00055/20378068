Cross-sectional evaluation of thoracic lymphoma. Thoracic lymphomas most frequently involve mediastinal lymph nodes in the anterior mediastinum and paratracheal areas. The lymphomas may also involve lung, thymus, pleura, pericardium, chest wall, and the breast and their radiologic manifestations are diverse. Lymphomas (mostly BALT lymphoma and large B-cell lymphoma) may arise primarily from the lung with various imaging features including single or multiple nodule(s) and area(s) of consolidation. CT is currently the most important imaging modality for the evaluation of thoracic lymphoma but FDG PET also plays a crucial role in the clinical management of these cases.
