Nuclear imaging of autoimmunity: focus on IBD and RA. There is a need for methods to improve the diagnosis, patient staging and evaluation of therapeutic response in patients with autoimmune conditions to improve patient care. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are two inflammatory diseases characterized by involvement of innate and adaptive immune components that change the metabolic state of their respective target tissues, thus providing an opportunity for molecular imaging probes to detect such changes. Optimally, such probes and the imaging methods employed would be non-invasive, robust and reproducible, give a quantitative result, report on the status of the affected tissue(s) and respond to the effects of a therapeutic molecule. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are nuclear imaging approaches that have the potential to satisfy such requirements. In this review, the work to date and the potential of PET and SPECT imaging probes in these two inflammatory conditions, IBD and RA, are discussed.
