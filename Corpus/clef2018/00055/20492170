Combination of super chilling and high carbon dioxide concentration techniques most effectively to preserve freshness of shell eggs during long-term storage. This study was made to examine the combined effects of stored temperature and carbon dioxide atmosphere on shell egg quality. The shell eggs were packed into polyethylene terephthalate/polyethylene (PET/PE) pouches and stored at 0 degrees C (super chilling), 10 degrees C, and 20 degrees C, respectively for 90 d. The atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration was controlled to obtain the 3 concentration levels of high (about 2.0%), medium (about 0.5%), and low (below 0.01%). Changes in Haugh unit (HU) values, weakening of vitelline membranes, and generation of volatiles were analyzed to evaluate the freshness of shell eggs. Results showed that, compared with the other combinations, the technique of super chilling and high carbon dioxide concentration enabled shell eggs to be most effectively stored for 90 d, based on estimations of the statistical significances of differences in HU values, and on maintaining the initial HU values during storage. In addition, the storage of shell eggs using this combination technique was found to significantly prevent the weakening of the vitelline membrane based on the estimations of numbers of eggs without vitelline membrane breakage when eggs broke, and significantly lowered the incidence of hexanal in the yolk from exposure to the gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analyses of volatiles. Thus, these results confirmed that the combination of super chilling and high carbon dioxide concentration was the most effective technique for preserving shell eggs during a long term of 90 d compared with other combination techniques.
