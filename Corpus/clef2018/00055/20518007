Coronary angiography is a better predictor of mortality than noninvasive testing in patients evaluated for renal transplantation. The goal of this study was to compare whether coronary angiography or noninvasive imaging more accurately identifies coronary artery disease (CAD) and predicts mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) under evaluation for transplantation.CAD is a leading cause of mortality in patients with ESRD. The optimal method for identifying CAD in ESRD patients evaluated for transplantation remains controversial with a paucity of prognostic data currently available comparing noninvasive methods to coronary angiography.The study cohort consisted of 57 patients undergoing both coronary angiography and stress perfusion imaging. Severe CAD was defined by angiography as ≥ 70% stenosis, and by noninvasive testing as ischemia in ≥ 1 zone. Follow-up for all cause mortality was 3.3 years.On noninvasive imaging, 63% had ischemia. On angiography, 40% had at least one vessel with severe stenoses. Abnormal perfusion was observed in 56% of patients without severe disease angiographically. Noninvasive imaging had poor specificity (24%) and poor positive predictive value (43%) for identifying severe disease. Angiography but not noninvasive imaging predicted survival 3 year survival was 50% and 73% for patients with and without severe CAD by angiography (p<0.05).False positive scintigrams limited noninvasive imaging in patients with ESRD. Angiography was a better predictor of mortality compared with noninvasive testing.
