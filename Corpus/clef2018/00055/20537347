Usefulness of electrocardiographic parameters as compared with computed tomography measures of left atrial volume enlargement: from the ROMICAT trial. The 12-lead surface electrocardiogram (ECG) is commonly used as a noninvasive modality to assess for left atrial enlargement (LAE), but data comparing ECG against cardiac computed tomography (CT) for LAE is lacking. We aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of 6 ECG criteria for LAE as compared with CT left atrial volume (LAV) and index to body surface area (LAVI) as the reference standard.In 339 patients (age: mean ± mean, 53 ± 12 years 63% male), we evaluated the quantitative ECG parameters of P duration, P to PR segment ratio, P wave area, and P terminal force in lead V1. We also assessed qualitatively the morphology of bifid and biphasic P waves. Patients were stratified into top and lowest quartile of LAV and LAVI by CT.Of the 6 ECG criteria, patients with P duration greater than 110 milliseconds had a 2½-fold increase likelihood of being in the top quartile of LAV (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.51 P = .01) and LAVI (adjusted OR, 2.74Only P duration greater than 110 milliseconds was independently associated with LAE based on CT-derived LA volume and index. However, none of the established ECG parameters of LAE have sufficient diagnostic accuracies for predicting volumetric enlargement by CT, thus limiting its clinical utility.
