Added value of prone position technique for PET-TAC in breast cancer patients. This study has aimed to assess if the prone position shows significant differences in regards to the supine position in PET/CT studies in breast cancer patients and to determine which modality offers better evaluation of the images.A total of 30 patients were included from October 2009 to February 2010 prior to beginning neoadjuvant chemotherapy. An intravenous (18)F-FDG dose ranging from 180 to 240 MBq was administered. Image acquisition was begun 60 ± 10 min after injection. First of all, a thorax scan was performed with the patient in prone position, followed by a whole body study with the patient in supine position.Uptake in tumor lesions was observed in all of the patients. Twenty-four patients (80%) had the same number of lesions with both techniques. Five patients (17%) had a different amount of axillary lymph nodes. One patient (3.3%) had a different number of lesions. The prone position lesions had a mean SUVmax 8.89 ± 4.18 compared to 7.67 ± 4.34 in supine position. The areas of the primary breast lesions were higher in the prone position (8.59 ± 7.80 compared with 7.81 ± 7.39). Mean SUVmax of axillary nodes was 5.97 ± 4.02 in prone and 4.41 ± 3.10 in supine.The hanging breast technique can achieve higher lesion visualization as well as higher semiquantitative values in comparison with standard procedure. This supports its inclusion in acquisition guidelines of PET/CT imaging in breast cancer patients.
