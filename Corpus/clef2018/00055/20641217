 Thrombosis plays a major role in many cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), or cerebral venous thrombosis (1, 2). DVT is a significant source of PE, which is a potentially life-threatening clinical problem. Thrombosis occurs when platelets deposit in regions of low flow in the deep venous system, followed by an activation process of thrombin, which then converts fibrinogen into fibrin. Platelets become activated and bind to fibrinogen, resulting in platelet aggregation. The thrombus may become organized or detached from the vessel wall. Bitistatin (83 amino acids) belongs to a family of platelet glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa ligands called disintegrins, which contain an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide sequence (3). Bitistatin has been shown to inhibit platelet deposition in coronary arteries in a canine model of repetitive thrombus formation (4).
