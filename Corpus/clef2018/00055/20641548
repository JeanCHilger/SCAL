4-Hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, and 7-hydroxy- analogs of 6-hydroxy-2-(4’-[ Development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been attributed to neurodegeneration as a result of the neuronal overexpression, secretion, and extracellular deposition of the neurotoxic amyloid-β (Aβ) fragment of the Aβ protein precursor in the brain (1). In addition, the AD brain neurons are known to form and deposit neurofibrillary tangles in the cytoplasm (2). No specific treatment for AD is currently available, and researchers and clinicians are increasingly focused on developing ways to either prevent or delay the formation of Aβ plaques in the brain of AD patients (3). In addition, several hundred clinical trials approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration have been completed or are in progress to develop drugs for the prevention, onset delay, or treatment of AD. Early detection of Aβ plaques by non-invasive techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) is often used to identify individuals who are prone to get the disease and to monitor the efficacy of drugs used to treat or delay onset of the disease (4). Although several immunohistochemical fluorescent stains and an antibody directed against the Aβ have been used to detect the plaques in the brain of AD patients, this information can be obtained only during postmortem (5). Hence, the development and evaluation of a suitable agent for the non-invasive detection of Aβ plaques during early onset or to monitor progression and treatment of the disease is an ongoing task. Many radiolabeled tracers have been developed and evaluated under preclinical conditions, but among these only the
