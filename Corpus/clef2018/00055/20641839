. The prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) is a glycosyl phosphoinositolâ€“anchored cell surface protein that belongs to the Thy-1/Ly-6 class of surface antigens. This protein is so named because it has a 30% homology to the stem cell antigen. Gene expression analysis has shown that PSCA is upregulated in a majority of the human pancreatic cancers and can be used for the classification of cytologically atypical specimens (1, 2). It is also overexpressed in prostate cancer (3), so the use of this antigen as a prostate and pancreatic cancer marker was suggested (3, 4). Although the exact function of the PSCA in pancreatic cancer is unknown, PSCA is an ideal candidate for the development of reagents that can be used for the immunoscintigraphic detection (6) or immunotherapeutic treatment (4) of pancreatic cancer because it has an increased expression specificity for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (1, 5) and has a cell surface location. The development of a pancreatic cancer marker could also help with patient diagnosis or screening of individuals suspected to have a pancreatic cancer. Development of the marker would also assist in the timely detection and treatment of primary or metastatic lesions in individuals and perhaps help prevent further spread of the disease. A purified rabbit anti-PSCA polyclonal antibody (Ab) (3) was labeled with radioactive iodine (
