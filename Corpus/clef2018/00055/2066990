Synthesis of an (iodovinyl)misonidazole derivative for hypoxia imaging. Nitroimidazoles undergo a bioreduction in viable hypoxic tissue, resulting in trapping within these tissues, as demonstrated by misonidazole. A radioiodinated analogue of misonidazole (IVM, (E)-5-(2-Nitroimidazolyl)-4-hydroxy-1-iodopent-1-ene, 3) has been synthesized by halodestannylation, for evaluation as an imaging agent for hypoxia. A key step in the synthetic sequence involves the use of the Lewis acid BF3.Et2O to promote the nucleophilic ring opening of glycidyl tosylate with (E)-1-lithio-2-(tributylstannyl)ethylene. Direct comparison of IVM versus F-MISO (2) another misonidazole type hypoxic cell marker, in several in vitro cell culture studies, indicates that IVM behaves in analogous fashion to F-MISO and has promise as a hypoxia imaging agent for SPECT.
