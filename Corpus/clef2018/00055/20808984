Resting electrocardiogram and stress myocardial perfusion imaging in the determination of left ventricular systolic function: an assessment enhancing the performance of gated SPET. This study aimed to determine systolic dysfunction and estimate resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from information collected during routine evaluation of patients with suspected or known coronary heart disease. This approach was then compared to gated single photon emission tomography (SPET). Patients having undergone stress (201)Tl myocardial perfusion imaging followed by equilibrium radionuclide angiography (ERNA) were separated into derivation (n=954) and validation (n=309) groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop scoring systems, containing clinical, electrocardiographic (ECG) and scintigraphic data, for the discrimination of an ERNA-LVEF<0.50. Linear regression analysis provided equations predicting ERNA-LVEF from those scores. In 373 patients LVEF was also assessed with (201)Tl gated SPET. Our results showed that an ECG-Scintigraphic scoring system was the best simple predictor of an ERNA-LVEF<0.50 in comparison to other models including ECG, clinical and scintigraphic variables in both the derivation and validation subpopulations. A simple linear equation was derived also for the assessment of resting LVEF from the ECG-Scintigraphic model. Equilibrium radionuclide angiography-LVEF had a good correlation with the ECG-Scintigraphic model LVEF (r=0.716, P=0.000), (201)Tl gated SPET LVEF (r=0.711, P=0.000) and the average LVEF from those assessments (r=0.796, P=0.000). The Bland-Altman statistic (mean+/-2SD) provided values of 0.001+/-0.176, 0.071+/-0.196 and 0.040+/-0.152, respectively. The average LVEF was a better discriminator of systolic dysfunction than gated SPET-LVEF in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and identified more patients (89%) with a </=10% difference from ERNA-LVEF than gated SPET (65%, P=0.000). In conclusion, resting left ventricular systolic dysfunction can be determined effectively from simple resting ECG and stress myocardial perfusion imaging variables. This model provides reliable LVEF estimations, comparable to those from (201)Tl gated SPET, and can enhance the clinical performance of the latter.
