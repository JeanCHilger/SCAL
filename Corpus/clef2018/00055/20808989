The role of nuclear medicine in the diagnosis of common and specific diabetic infections. Infections are usually detected in diabetes mellitus. They may be divided into: common infections such as fungal infections, pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia, bacteraemia, urinary tract infections, and diabetic foot infections and specific infections. The latter occur almost exclusively in diabetes and include rhinocerebral mucormycosis, malignant external otitis, emphysematous pyelonephritis, perirenal abscess, emphysematous cystitis and emphysematous cholecystitis. Radionuclide tests are decisive in the diagnosis and localisation of foot osteomyelitis, as well as the distinction of osteomyelitis from other conditions, notably Charcot osteoarthropathy. Technetium-99m methylene disphosphonate and labelled leukocyte bone scans are the main imaging techniques employed, while emerging techniques include single-photon emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography/CT. Nuclear medicine is also useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of specific infections in diabetes like, malignant external otitis, rhinocerebral mucormycosis, acute pyelonephritis, renal papillary necrosis and cholecystitis. The main indications of nuclear medicine tests are diabetic foot osteomyelitis, malignant external otitis, rhinocerebral mucormycosis and renal infections.
