Global trends in hybrid imaging. At the 2009 Scientific Assembly and Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, a special session was devoted to global trends in hybrid imaging. This article expands on the key points of the session, focusing primarily on positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Global trends in hybrid imaging equipment acquisition, usage, and image interpretation practices are reviewed, and emerging requirements for training and clinical privileging are discussed. Also considered are the current benefits of hybrid imaging for patient care and workflow and the potential of hybrid imaging for advancing drug development and personalized medicine.
