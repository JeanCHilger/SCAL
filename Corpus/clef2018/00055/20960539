Positive vasodilator stress ECG with normal myocardial perfusion imaging and its correlation with coronary angiographic findings in African Americans and Hispanics. Ischemic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes during vasodilator stress testing (VST) in the presence of abnormal myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) are uncommon and are associated with presence of multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD). However, there is a paucity of data regarding the significance of ischemic ECG changes during VST with normal MPI in general, and especially among African Americans and Hispanics.Ischemic changes during VST with normal MPI are associated with significant CAD.A retrospective review was done of 2945 patients undergoing VST.Only 20 patients (0.7%) had positive ECG changes with normal MPI. Their demographics were: 60% Hispanic, 40% African American 85% femaleAmong African Americans and Hispanics, ischemic ECG changes during VST with normal MPI are likely to be associated with significant CAD and may warrant coronary angiography to assess presence and extent of CAD.
