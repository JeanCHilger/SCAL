Stoichiometry-focused (18)F-labeling of alkyne-substituted oligodeoxynucleotides using azido([(18)F]fluoromethyl)benzenes by Cu-catalyzed Huisgen reaction. A novel method for (18)F-radiolabeling of oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) by a Cu-catalyzed Huisgen reaction has been developed by using the lowest possible amount of the precursor biomolecule for the realization of stoichiometry-oriented PET (positron emission tomography) chemistry. Under the optimized cyclization conditions of p- or m-azido([(18)F]fluoromethyl)benzene and alkyne-substituted ODN (20nmol) at 40°C for 15min in the presence of CuSO(4), TBTA [tris((1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)amine], and sodium ascorbate (2:1:2), the synthesis of (18)F-labeled ODNs with sufficiently high radioactivities of 2.1-2.5GBq and specific radioactivities of 1800-2400GBq/μmol have been accomplished for use in animal and human PET studies.
