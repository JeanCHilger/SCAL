Tetrazine-trans-cyclooctene ligation for the rapid construction of integrin αvβ₃ targeted PET tracer based on a cyclic RGD peptide. Labeling biomolecules with (18)F is usually done through coupling with prosthetic groups, which generally requires several time-consuming radiosynthetic steps resulting in low labeling yield. Recently, the tetrazine-trans-cyclooctene ligation has been introduced as a method of bioconjugation that proceeds with fast reaction rates without need for catalysis. Herein, we report the development of an extremely fast and efficient method for generating (18)F labeled probes based on the tetrazine-trans-cyclooctene ligation. Starting with only 30 μg (78 μM) of a tetrazine-RGD conjugate and 2 mCi (5 μM) of (18)F-trans-cyclooctene, the (18)F labeled RGD peptide could be obtained in more than 90% yield within five minutes. The (18)F labeled RGD peptide demonstrated prominent tumor uptake in vivo. The receptor specificity was confirmed by blocking experiments. These results successfully demonstrate that the tetrazine-trans-cyclooctene ligation serves as an efficient labeling method for PET probe construction.
