Non-invasive assessment of coronary blood flow in veterans of the Ministry of Defence with ischemic heart disease and age-dependent androgen deficiency. It was examined 51 pensioners of Ministry of Defence with coronary heart disease (average age 55 [52, 59] years). In 20 patients it was verified age-related androgen deficiency, in 31 patients the level of testosterone was within normal limits. The evaluation of coronary circulation was made on single-photon emission tomography with determination of myocardial perfusion in a rest and after pharmacological loading, bicycle exercise test, holter-monitoring of ECG. It was found in 39% cases in patients with coronary heart disease the androgen deficiency in pensioners of Ministry of Defence, that is exceeded the level of common population. Ishaemic changes were found on exercise test in patients with androgen deficiency more often in comparison with patients with normal testosterone level. During myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with adenosine triphosphate there were no differences among group in area of induced coronary heart insufficiency. It was found the negative correlation between the level of testosterone and the duration of ischaemic ST-depression, and positive correlation between testosterone level and tolerance to physical activity.
