Single source information systems can improve data completeness in clinical studies: an example from nuclear medicine. Data for clinical documentation and medical research are usually managed in separate systems. A documentation system for myocardial scintigraphy (SPECT/CT-data) was developed, implemented and assessed in order to integrate clinical and research documentation. This paper presents concept, implementation and results regarding data completeness of this single source information system. Completeness of documentation increased highly significantly (p&lt0.0001) after implementation of this system.
