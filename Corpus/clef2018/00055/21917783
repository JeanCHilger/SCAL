Myocardial uptake of 7'-(Z)-[(123)I]iodorotenone during vasodilator stress in dogs with critical coronary stenoses. There is a well-recognized need for a new generation of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion tracers with improved myocardial extraction over a wide flow range. Radiotracers that target complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain have been proposed as a new class of myocardial perfusion imaging agents. 7-(Z)-[(125)I]iodorotenone ((125)I-ZIROT) has demonstrated superior myocardial extraction and retention characteristics in rats and in isolated perfused rabbit hearts. We sought to fully characterize the biodistribution and myocardial extraction versus flow relationship of (123)I-ZIROT in an intact large-animal model.The (123)I-ZIROT was administered during adenosine A(2A) agonist-induced hyperemia in 5 anesthetized dogs with critical left anterior descending (LAD) stenoses. When left circumflex (LCx) flow was maximal, (123)I-ZIROT and microspheres were coinjected and the dogs were euthanized 5 minutes later. (123)I-ZIROT biodistribution was evaluated in 2 additional dogs by in vivo planar imaging. At (123)I-ZIROT injection, transmural LAD flow was unchanged from baseline (mean±SEM, 0.90±0.22 versus 0.87±0.11 mL/[min · g] P=0.92), whereas LCx zone flow increased significantly (mean±SEM, 3.25±0.51 versus 1.00±0.17 mL/[min · g]The ability of (123)I-ZIROT to more linearly track blood flow over a wide range makes it a promising new SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging agent with potential for improved coronary artery disease detection and better quantitative estimation of the severity of flow impairment.
