Novel imaging techniques for diffuse myocardial fibrosis. Diffuse myocardial fibrosis (DMF) is an important marker in many cardiac diseases, but its utility has been limited by the need for biopsy for its assessment. An accurate noninvasive method for DMF assessment could transform cardiology. This review explores the basic biology of DMF and then discusses the ability of various cardiac imaging modalities to evaluate this variable, speculating on how this area of research may develop over the next few years.
