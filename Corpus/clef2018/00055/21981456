Limited value of novel pulmonary embolism biomarkers in patients with coronary atherosclerosis. Recent research supports the efficacy of various plasma biomarkers in diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) including E-selectin, MMP-9, MPO, sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, adiponectin, hs-CRP and tPAI-1.We hypothesized that these biomarkers, which are affected in both venous and arterial thromboembolic diseases, have a limited potential of diagnosing PE in patients with concomitant coronary atherosclerosis, as assessed from a low-dose CT scan of the thorax, compared to patients without atherosclerosis.Consecutive patients suspected of PE were referred. All patients had a ventilation/perfusion single photon emission tomography (V/Q-SPECT), low-dose pulmonary CT, pulmonary multidetector computer tomography angiography, blood samples and ECG-gated cardiac CT performed the same day.A total of 69 patients were included, of which 28 (41%) had PE. In patients without coronary calcium, MMP-9 and tPAI-1 were significantly elevated (P<0路042 and P<0路049) in patients diagnosed with PE. From the receiver operating curves, we chose a cut-off value for MMP-9 at 164路4 ng l(-1) , which yielded sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 63%, 78%, 71% and 70%, respectively. With a chosen cut-off value for tPAI-1 at 56路3 ng l(-1) , the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 88%, 89%, 88% and 89%, respectively. In patients with coronary calcium, none of the biomarkers could discriminate between PE and no PE.Plasma levels of tPAI-1 and MMP-9 are potentially useful in patients suspected of PE, however, not in the presence of the coronary atherosclerosis.
