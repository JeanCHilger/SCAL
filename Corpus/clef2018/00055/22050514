Serotonin 1A receptors, depression, and memory in temporal lobe epilepsy. Memory deficits and depression are common in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies have shown reduced mesial temporal 5HT1A-receptor binding in these patients. We examined the relationships among verbal memory performance, depression, and 5HT1A-receptor binding measured with 18F-trans-4-fluoro-N-2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl-N-(2-pyridyl) cyclohexane carboxamide (18FCWAY) PET in a cross-sectional study.We studied 40 patients (24 male mean age 34.5 ± 10.7 years) with TLE. Seizure diagnosis and focus localization were based on ictal video-electroencephalography (EEG) recording. Patients had neuropsychological testing with Wechsler Adult Intelligence Score III (WAIS III) and Wechsler Memory Score III (WMS III) on stable antiepileptic drug (AED) regimens at least 24 h since the last seizure. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores were obtained. We performed interictal PET with 18FCWAY, a fluorinated derivative of WAY 100635, a highly specific 5HT1A ligand, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to estimate partial volume and plasma free fraction corrected 18FCWAY volume of distribution (V/f1).Hippocampal V/f1 was significantly lower in area ipsilateral than contralateral to the epileptic focus (73.7 ± 27.3 vs. 95.4 ± 28.4 p < 0.001). We found a significant relation between both left hippocampal 18FCWAY V/f1 (r = 0.41Our study suggests that reduced left hippocampal 5HT1A-receptor binding may play a role in memory impairment in patients with TLE.
