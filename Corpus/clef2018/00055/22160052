Positron emission tomography in the management of Hodgkin lymphoma. Accurate imaging of lymphoma is essential for optimal management. Positron emission tomography (PET), by providing both anatomic and functional information, is fundamentally altering staging, monitoring of response, response assessment, and choice of treatment modality for lymphomas, including Hodgkin lymphoma. This imaging technique, when used carefully in conjunction with standard testing, increases the sensitivity of lesion detection, provides an opportunity to monitor the quality of response during treatment, permits separation of fibronecrotic scar tissue from viable tumor, and adds prognostic information. PET has become integral to modern lymphoma management, but as a relatively new diagnostic technique, it is still being studied and neither its full potential nor its major limitations are fully understood. Discussed herein are recent observations from clinical trials and single-center experiences with PET to explore its advantages and limitations from a clinician's point of view.
