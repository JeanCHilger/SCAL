Use of (11)C-methionine PET parametric response map for monitoring WT1 immunotherapy response in recurrent malignant glioma. Immunotherapy targeting the Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) gene product is a promising treatment modality for patients with malignant gliomas, and there have been reports of encouraging results. It has become clear, however, that Gd-enhanced MR imaging does not reflect prognosis, thereby necessitating a more robust imaging evaluation system for monitoring response to WT1 immunotherapy. To meet this demand, the authors performed a voxel-wise parametric response map (PRM) analysis of (11)C-methionine PET (MET-PET) in WT1 immunotherapy and compared the data with the overall survival after initiation of WT1 immunotherapy (OS(WT1)).Fourteen patients with recurrent malignant glioma were included in the study, and OS(WT1) was compared with: 1) volume and length change in the contrast area of the tumor on Gd-enhanced MR images 2) change in maximum uptake of (11)C-methionineThe PRM analysis was able to identify the following 3 areas within the tumor core: 1) area with no change in (11)C-methionine uptake pre- and posttreatment 2) area with increased (11)C-methionine uptake posttreatment (PRM(+MET))This study describes the limited value of Gd-enhanced MR imaging and highlights the potential of voxel-wise PRM analysis of MET-PET for monitoring treatment response in immunotherapy for malignant gliomas.
