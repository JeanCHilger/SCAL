Lung imaging - two dimensional gamma scintigraphy, SPECT, CT and PET. This review will cover the principles of imaging the deposition of inhaled drugs and some of the state-of-the art imaging techniques being used today. Aerosol deposition can be imaged and quantified by the addition of a radiolabel to the aerosol formulation. The subsequent imaging of the inhaled deposition pattern can be acquired by different imaging techniques. Specifically, this review will focus on the use of two-dimensional planar, gamma scintigraphy, SPECT, CT and PET. This review will look at how these imaging techniques are used to investigate the mechanisms of drug delivery in the lung and how the lung anatomy and physiology have the potential to alter therapeutic outcomes.
