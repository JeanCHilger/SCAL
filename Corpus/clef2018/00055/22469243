Magnetic resonace-based attenuation correction for micro-single-photon emission computed tomography. Attenuation correction is necessary for quantification in micro-single-photon emission computed tomography (micro-SPECT). In general, this is done based on micro-computed tomographic (micro-CT) images. Derivation of the attenuation map from magnetic resonance (MR) images is difficult because bone and lung are invisible in conventional MR images and hence indistinguishable from air. An ultrashort echo time (UTE) sequence yields signal in bone and lungs. Micro-SPECT, micro-CT, and MR images of 18 rats were acquired. Different tracers were used: hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (brain), dimercaptosuccinic acid (kidney), colloids (liver and spleen), and macroaggregated albumin (lung). The micro-SPECT images were reconstructed without attenuation correction, with micro-CT-based attenuation maps, and with three MR-based attenuation maps: uniform, non-UTE-MR based (air, soft tissue), and UTE-MR based (air, lung, soft tissue, bone). The average difference with the micro-CT-based reconstruction was calculated. The UTE-MR-based attenuation correction performed best, with average errors ≤ 8% in the brain scans and ≤ 3% in the body scans. It yields nonsignificant differences for the body scans. The uniform map yields errors of ≤ 6% in the body scans. No attenuation correction yields errors ≥ 15% in the brain scans and ≥ 25% in the body scans. Attenuation correction should always be performed for quantification. The feasibility of MR-based attenuation correction was shown. When accurate quantification is necessary, a UTE-MR-based attenuation correction should be used.
