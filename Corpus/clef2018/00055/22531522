Correlation of fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and tumor-proliferating antigen Ki-67 in lymphomas. To investigate the correlation between cellular proliferation and the fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging by comparing 50 cases of different subtypes of lymphoma.Fifty cases of lymphomas were collected. Each case was labeled with Ki-67 stain, a marker of cellular proliferation, and a PET/CT examination was performed. All lymphoma cases were sorted according to the World Health Organization's classification, and the International Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Working Formulation was used to differentiate groups of large and small cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The Ki-67 staining was described as slight, mild, middle, or strong according to the nuclear staining of positive cells. FDG uptake by lesions in PET/CT images was semi-quantitatively analyzed to calculate the average standard uptake value. The statistics software SPSS13.0 was used to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the FDG uptake value of the lymphoma subtypes, the difference between the large and small cell lymphoma group with a Student's t-test, and the correlation between the Ki-67 level and FDG uptake of lesion with a Spearman's analysis.The FDG uptake value of large cell origin lymphoma was significantly higher than that of small cell origin lymphoma (t = 6.19, P < 0.01). The correlation coefficients between the Ki-67 level and FDG uptake value in lymph nodal and extranodal lesions was 0.750 and 0.843, respectively.Ki-67 staining, a reflection of tumor-proliferation activity, was significantly related to the FDG uptake value in lymphoma lesions.
