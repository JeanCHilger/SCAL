2:1 multiplexing function in a simple molecular system. 1-[(Anthracen-9-yl)methylene] thiosemicarbazide shows weak fluorescence due to a photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process from the thiosemicarbazide moiety to the excited anthracene. The anthracene emission can be recovered via protonation of the amine as the protonated aminomethylene as an electron-withdrawing group that suppresses the PET process. Similarly, chelation between the ligand and the metal ions can also suppress the PET process and results in a fluorescence enhancement (CHEF). When solvents are introduced as the third control, a molecular 2:1 multiplexer is constructed to report selectively the inputs. Therefore, a molecular 2:1 multiplexer is realized in a simple molecular system.
