Salvage prostatectomy. Principles of diagnostics and operative therapy. Organ-confined prostate cancer can be treated with curative intent by different types of radiotherapy or by radical surgery. Regardless of improvements in radiotherapy about 60% of patients with prostate cancer develop biochemical recurrence (BCR) which is defined by the progressive increase in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and necessitates further diagnostic procedures. If non-organ-confined cancer and metastasis are categorically excluded by cross-sectional imaging using computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography CT (PET-CT) and bone scintigraphy, a prostate biopsy should be performed. Biopsy proven detection of recurrent or persisting prostate cancer after irradiation is essential prior to a salvage prostatectomy. The function of the lower urinary tract should be evaluated prior to surgery. Preoperative PSA measurement is the best prognostic indicator prior to surgery. Salvage prostatectomy in irradiated patients is more challenging and requires extensive skill. The most common complications are incontinence, rectal injury and anastomotic strictures. Both functional and oncologic outcome have improved due to better irradiation techniques and surgical skills. Provided post-radiotherapy recurrence of prostate cancer is diagnosed early enough, curing is possible by salvage prostatectomy.
