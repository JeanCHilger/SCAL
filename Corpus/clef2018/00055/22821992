Assessment of cerebral autoregulation: the quandary of quantification. We assessed the convergent validity of commonly applied metrics of cerebral autoregulation (CA) to determine the extent to which the metrics can be used interchangeably. To examine between-subject relationships among low-frequency (LF 0.07-0.2 Hz) and very-low-frequency (VLF
