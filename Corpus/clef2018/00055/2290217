A comparative study of myocardial scintigraphy with 99mTc-SQ-30,217 and 201Tl in cases with myocardial infarction. A comparative study of myocardial scintigraphy with 99mTc-SQ-30217 (SQ) and 201Tl was performed in 6 patients having ischemic heart diseases which were confirmed by the coronary angiography. The SQ study was done 1 week after the 201Tl study. Both studies were performed in exercise and resting state. Degree of perfusion defect was compared between SQ and 201Tl SPECT by means of scoring 0-2 (0: no defect, 1: equivocal, 2: definite defect) by five doctors (two physicians and three radiologists). Ability of this agent to detect the ischemic lesions was similar to that of 201Tl except for two regions. Effect of the liver image on the evaluation of the inferior wall of the left ventricle was small on this study, although the hepatic accumulation of the tracer was prominent. This agent is a promising tracer for the evaluation of myocardial perfusion in the cases with myocardial infarction.
