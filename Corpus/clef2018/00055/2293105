Localization of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose in mouse brain neurons with micro-autoradiography. This is the first study of micro-autoradiography (micro-ARG) for [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose [( 18F]FDG). The localization of [18F]FDG was demonstrated in dendrites of neuron and also in the myelinated axon in mouse normal brain in vivo. The nucleolus was relatively free of label. The counted silver grain numbers in autoradiogram were linearly correlated to the 18F radioactivities in the specimen. The micro-ARG using positron emitting 18F is a very time-saving technique with 4 hours exposure compared with the conventional method using 3H- or 14C-labeled tracers.
