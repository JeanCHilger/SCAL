The role of 18F-FDG PET/CT metabolic tumour volume in predicting survival in patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. To investigate the role of PET-derived imaging markers in predicting metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) outcomes.A total of 56 patients with metastatic NPC were enrolled. Before treatment, all of the participants underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT. The following (18)F-FDG PET parameters were assessed: standardised uptake value, metabolic tumour volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify the independent predictors of survival.The multivariate analysis showed that performance status>1 (P=0.007), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA titre>5000 copies/mL (P=0.001), and MTV>110 mL (P=0.013) were independent risk factors for progression-free survival (PFS). Male sex (P=0.004), performance status>1 (P<0.0001), EBV DNA level>5000 copies/mL (P<0.0001), and MTV>110 mL (P=0.003) independently predicted overall survival (OS). The 2-year PFS and OS rates of the patients with MTVâ‰¤110 mL were 23.2% and 43%, respectively, compared with 0% and 9.1%, respectively, for those with MTV>110 mL. Combining the MTV with the EBV DNA titre allowed further survival stratification by dividing the patients into three groups with distinct PFS (2-year rates=30.8%, 7.1%, and 0%, P<0.0001) and OS (2-year rates=68.4%, 40%, and 0%, P<0.0001) rates.The MTV appears to be an independent risk factor in metastatic NPC patients. This factor is complementary to the EBV DNA titre for predicting survival in metastatic NPC.
