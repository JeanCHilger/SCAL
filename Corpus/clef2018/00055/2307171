Methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) Tc 99m SPECT to establish a correlate to coronary flow reserve, the perfusion reserve, from global and regional myocardial uptake after exercise and rest. With 99mTc-MIBI SPECT and a 4 h exercise (E: 150 MBq iv) and rest (R 800 MBq iv) protocol, global and regional left ventricular (LV) myocardial uptake was determined in 70 patients with angiographically confirmed coronary heart disease (CHD) and in 10 controls. The aim was to establish an E/R ratio as a correlate to coronary vascular reserve, representing perfusion reserve (PR). E/R ratios, obtained from total LV myocardium or from normal or impaired regions, were greater than 1.19 under all conditions, indicating the presence of higher flow during exercise than at rest (even in areas of low flow). Global PR separated (P less than 0.01) controls (1.63 +/- 0.21
