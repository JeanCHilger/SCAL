Effects of capsular or thalamic stroke on metabolism in the cortex and cerebellum: a positron tomography study. We used positron emission tomography to study the cortical and cerebellar metabolic rates in 21 strictly selected patients with pure internal capsular infarct (n = 8), thalamocapsular hemorrhage (n = 6), or pure thalamic stroke (n = 7). Significant diffuse ipsilateral cortical hypometabolism relative to 62 controls free of cerebrovascular risk factors was frequently, although not consistently, found in the 13 patients with thalamocapsular or thalamic lesions and neuropsychological impairment but was absent from the eight patients with pure internal capsule infarct and free of neuropsychological deficit. These data suggest that damage to the thalamus or the thalamocortical projections is important in the development of ipsilateral cortical hypometabolism and that the latter may underlie the associated neuropsychological impairment. Significant contralateral cerebellar hypometabolism relative to 49 controls was found in three of six patients with pure internal capsule infarct, suggesting a pathogenetic role for the corticopontocerebellar system. However, the occurrence of hypometabolism in two of six patients with thalamic lesions indicates that this phenomenon may also result either from damage to the ascending cerebellothalamocortical system or indirectly from hypofunction of the cerebral cortex. No systematic association was observed between crossed cerebellar hypometabolism and ipsilateral ataxia.
