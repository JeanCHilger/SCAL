Identification of clinically significant skeletal muscle necrosis by single photon emission computed tomography. Ischemia-reperfusion damage to skeletal muscle may cause serious local as well as systemic complications, its impact predominantly related to the quantity of ischemic muscle in the lower extremity. To date, there has been no noninvasive method of estimating that quantity. The authors used single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to quantify the volume of muscle that takes up technetium-99 pyrophosphate above a baseline threshold. Compared with the standard technique of staining slices of the muscle with nitroblue tetrazolium they found a close correlation using SPECT (r = 0.88, p less than 0.01, n = 19) in the canine model. In humans, this clinically applicable noninvasive technique may allow the surgeon to document accurately the extent of muscle necrosis in the lower extremity, to anticipate the impact of an ischemia-reperfusion injury and evaluate methods of reducing the extent of post-ischemic skeletal muscle necrosis.
