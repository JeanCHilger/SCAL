Clinical cerebral perfusion scintigraphy with 123I-IMP. At the first place, some experimental knowledges on the biodistribution of IMP were described for the understand of this agent. And on the basis of our clinical experience, the usefulness of cerebral perfusion imaging using SPECT and IMP was reviewed. The patients with possible ischemic cerebral diseases such as infarction, TIA and RIND are main candidates for this examination. Clinical significance of the so-called "redistribution" of IMP was discussed in detail. Dementia and epilepsy are considered to be the other indication. With improvement of the method, cerebral perfusion imaging may be accepted as essential test in the hospital dealing with the patient with neuropsychiatric deficits.
