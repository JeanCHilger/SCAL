Comparison of L-[1-11C]methionine and L-methyl-[11C]methionine for measuring in vivo protein synthesis rates with PET. To evaluate the feasibility of using either L-[1-11C]-methionine or L-[methyl-11C]methionine for measuring protein synthesis rates by positron emission tomography (PET) in normal and neoplastic tissues, distribution and metabolic studies with 14C- and 11C-labeled methionines were carried out in rats bearing Walker 256 carcinosarcoma. The tissue distributions of the two 14C-labeled methionines were similar except for liver tissue. Similar distribution patterns were observed in vivo by PET using 11C-labeled methionines. The highest 14C incorporation rate into the protein-bound fraction was found in the liver followed by tumor, brain, and pancreas. The incorporation rates in liver and pancreas were different for the two methionines. By chloroform-methanol fractionation of these four tissues, in liver significantly different amounts of 14C were observed in macromolecules. Also in brain tissue slight differences were found. By HPLC analyses of the protein-free fractions of plasma, tumor, and brain tissue at 60 min after injection, for both methionines several 14C-labeled metabolites in different amounts, were detected. About half of the 14C-labeled material in the protein-free fraction was found to be methionine. In these three tissues the amount of nonprotein metabolites and [14C]bicarbonate amount ranged from 10% to 17% and 12% to 15% for L-[1-14C]methionine and L-[methyl-14C]methionine, respectively. From these results it can be concluded that the minor metabolic pathways have to be investigated in order to quantitatively model the protein synthesis by PET.
