A silicone gel phantom suitable for multimodality imaging. A silicone gel phantom material is described. It can be molded into any shape and it can contain internal cavities. The material is selfsealing allowing the cavities to be filled with liquids. A simple geometric phantom consisting of a rectangular solid with a single internal spherical cavity was fabricated and imaged using MRI, CT, and PET. Properties important for imaging are described.
