Considerations on 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine therapy of six children with neuroblastoma. Six children affected by neuroblastoma at stages III and IV were treated with high-specific-activity 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG). After 131I-MIBG treatment three patients died at 12, 10, and 12 weeks, respectively the other three were still living at 21, 16, and 24 weeks, respectively. Although the assumptions for this therapy were propitious, the results obtained do not correspond to those expected. It is supposed that large tumor volume and previous chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy may impair the effectiveness of 131I-MIBG therapy. Consequently, 131I-MIBG therapy is recommended even if the spread of disease is not proved-only, however, when the tumor is small.
