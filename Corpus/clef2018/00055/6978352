PETT VI: a positron emission tomograph utilizing cesium fluoride scintillation detectors. We designed and built a positron emission transverse tomograph (PETT VI), designed specifically for fast dynamic studies in the human brain, and for cardiac studies in experimental animals. The scintillation detectors incorporated into this device are fitted with cesium fluoride crystals. Cesium fluoride was selected for this purpose because its short fluorescence decay allows the use of a short coincidence resolving time with a concomitant reduction of unwanted random coincidences. PETT VI utilizes four rings of 72 detectors simultaneously yielding seven tomographic sections. The system can be operated in either a low or high resolution mode with intrinsic geometrical resolutions in the plane of section of 7.1 to 11.7 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM), for a slice thickness with a resolution at the center of 13.9 mm FWHM. The maximum sensitivity of the system for seven slices in the low resolution mode is 322,000 cps/microCi/cc in a 20 cm diameter phantom. The contribution of random coincidences before subtraction in PETT VI was found to be approximately 14% of the counts in the phantom image with a source of approximately 3.5 mCi of a positron emitting radionuclide dispersed in a 20 cm diameter tissue equivalent phantom with a concentration of 1 microCi/cc. The short coincidence resolving time of the system permits rapid data acquisition for attenuation corrections and clinical dynamic studies with data acquisition times of less than a minute.
