Canine parvovirus infection in South American canids. Canine parvovirus (CPV) infections occurred in 5 of 35 South American canids at the Department of Conservation (DC), a breeding facility of the National Zoological Park in Front Royal, Va. The clinical signs were anorexia, lethargy, diarrhea, and vomiting. Three of the affected canids survived and had high hemagglutination-inhibition titers to CPV in the recovery period. Necropsy of the 2 that died revealed extensive necrosis of the intestinal mucosa CPV particles were observed by electron microscopy in the intestinal contents of both animals. Six of the 30 canids that remained healthy had high hemagglutination-inhibition titers to CPV prior to the episode of illness, indicating earlier subclinical exposure. Pet dogs belonging to DC personnel that were screened as a possible source of the infection had no evidence of disease. All canids (including pet dogs) on the DC grounds were vaccinated repeatedly with a killed feline panleukopenia virus product after the episode, with little or no effect on existing titers.
