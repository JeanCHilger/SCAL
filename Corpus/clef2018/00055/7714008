Analysis of PET neurofunctional mapping studies. In this work, we present a method for analyzing positron emission tomography (PET) functional mapping experiments. The method is useful for identifying statistically significant differences between two PET data sets. First, uniform-variance Z-images are created and then the statistical uncertainty in region-of-interest values are calculated using a previously published method. The Z-images are calculated from the emission sinograms only--the calculation does not use scanner normalization and attenuation corrections and hence variance from these sources is eliminated, with no decrease in validity. Next, the Z-images are analyzed for activation sites using two separate techniques: a cluster analysis method and a change distribution analysis method. Both of these techniques are shown to be effective for objectively locating significantly activated regions from the Z-images. Two advantages of these methods are that they are objective and efficient all of the parameters necessary in the calculations can be precomputed and stored since they depend only upon the geometry of the scanner.
