Myocardial scintigraphic characteristics in patients with primary aldosteronism. To evaluate the difference in myocardial damage between primary aldosteronism and untreated essential hypertension, we performed thallium-201 myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography in 10 patients with primary aldosteronism and 10 patients with essential hypertension who were matched for age, sex, blood pressure, and the severity of left ventricular hypertrophy for primary aldosteronism. From the analysis of thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy, extent score was calculated. Extent score was significantly higher in primary aldosteronism than in essential hypertension (45.8 +/- 23.5% versus 9.5 +/- 7.3%, P < .01). After operation, blood pressure significantly decreased, and the precordial voltages (SV1 + RV5) and left ventricular mass indexes were significantly reduced in patients with primary aldosteronism. Extent score was also significantly improved. These results suggest that despite the same severity of myocardial hypertrophy between primary aldosteronism and essential hypertension, the myocardial damage estimated by thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy is more severe in primary aldosteronism than in essential hypertension. Extent score was useful for evaluation of the severity of myocardial damage in hypertensive patients.
