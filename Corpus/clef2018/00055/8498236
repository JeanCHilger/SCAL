An interactive, computer-based atlas of neurologic positron emission tomographic studies for use in teaching. Recent developments in personal computer hardware and software allow the manipulation of radiologic images. We developed an interactive, computer-based atlas of clinical neurologic positron emission tomographic studies for use as an educational resource. A personal computer and multimedia software were used to assemble the clinical case studies. For each clinical case, the user had available the clinical history, positron emission tomographic and correlative anatomic images, study interpretation, discussion, and references. The clinical cases were selected for their educational value, either as a representative example of an abnormality or for their ability to illustrate a common pitfall in positron emission tomographic imaging of the brain.
