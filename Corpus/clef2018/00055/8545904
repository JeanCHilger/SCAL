Mapping cognitive brain function with modern high-resolution electroencephalography. High temporal resolution is necessary to resolve the rapidly changing patterns of brain activity that underlie mental function. While electroencephalography (EEG) provides temporal resolution in the millisecond range, which would seem to make it an ideal complement to other imaging modalities, traditional EEG technology and practice provides insufficient spatial detail to identify relationships between brain electrical events and structures and functions that are visualized by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET). Recent advances overcome this problem by recording EEGs from more electrodes, by registering EEG data with anatomical information from each subject's MRI, and by correcting the distortion that is caused by volume conduction of EEG signals through the skull and scalp. Along with its ability to record how brains think when performing everyday activities in the real world, these advances make modern EEG an invaluable complement to other functional neuroimaging modalities.
