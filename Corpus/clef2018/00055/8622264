A phase 3 clinical trial of 123I-iomazenil, a new central-type benzodiazepine receptor imaging agent (Part 2)--Report on clinical usefulness in diagnosis of degenerative neurological diseases and mental disorders. Iomazenil (IMZ) is a partial inverse agonist of central-type benzodiazepine receptors (BZR) which binds specifically to BZR with high affinity. A multi-center Phase 3 clinical study was performed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of 123I-IMZ-SPECT in the diagnosis of brain disorders in 169 patients with degenerative neurological diseases and 37 patients with mental disorders such as neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders. In dementia, the decrease in activity in late images, obtained three hours after administration of 123I-IMZ, correlated negatively with the dementia score. In Parkinson's disease and spinocerebellar degeneration. 123I-IMZ showed a more profound decrease in uptake in late images than seen in the cerebral blood flow (CBF) images, and this decrease was in proportion to the duration and severity of the illness. In mental disorders, the ratio of the late to early image counts showed a negative correlation with Hamilton's anxiety scale in all regions in the brain cortices. In panic disorders, the ratio of the cerebral count to the cerebellar count in the late images correlated negatively with the severity of the attack in the frontal, temporal and parietal cortices. These results suggest that 123I-IMZ-SPECT enables us to evaluate the neuronal damage in degenerative diseases and the decrease in the BZR binding potential in mental disorders.
