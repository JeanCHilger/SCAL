Dopamine D2 receptor occupancy in vivo by the novel atypical antipsychotic olanzapine--a 123I IBZM single photon emission tomography (SPET) study. We have studied striatal D2 dopamine binding in schizophrenic patients treated with the novel atypical antipsychotic drug, olanzapine. 123I iodobenzamide (IBZM) single photon emission tomography (SPET) was used to estimate striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding in vivo. Patients were recruited from a prospective, double blind controlled trial of olanzapine versus haloperidol treatment. In vivo striatal D2 binding data from olanzapine treated patients (n = 6) were compared with previously reported data from typical antipsychotic responsive (n = 10) clozapine (n = 10)
