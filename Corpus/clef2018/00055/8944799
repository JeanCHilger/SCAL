Effects of prepubertal gonadectomy on physical and behavioral development in cats. To determine the effect of prepubertal gonadectomy on physical and behavioral development in cats.Prospective controlled study of kittens randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups: group 1, neutered at 7 weeks of age group 2, neutered at 7 months of age31 clinically normal male and female kittens.Age at distal radial physeal closure and mature radius length were determined radiographically. Six behavioral characteristics were recorded monthly. At 1 year of age, body weight was recorded and thickness of the falciform ligament was measured from a lateral abdominal radiographic view. Secondary sex characteristics were also examined at 1 year of age.There were no differences between group-1 and group-2 cats for any of the study variables. Sexually intact cats (group 3) weighted significantly less than group-2 cats and had less falciform fat and earlier distal radial physeal closure than cats of both neutered groups. Group-3 cats manifested greater intraspecies aggression, less affection, and greater development of secondary sex characteristics than neutered cats.Neutering cats at 7 weeks of age had similar effects on physical and behavioral development, compared with neutering at the more traditional age of 7 months. These data lend support to the concept of prepubertal gonadectomy, already performed by many animal shelters/humane organizations, as a method of enhancing the effectiveness of pet population control programs.
