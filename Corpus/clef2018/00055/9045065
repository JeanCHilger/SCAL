Epidemiology, diagnosis and prognosis in the clinical syndrome of brain concussion. The paper is a continuation of the preliminary communication in Neurologia i Neurochirurgia Polska No 3/1995. The study in 1993-1995 included a group of 50 patients who had clinical symptom complex of brain concussion. After preliminary neurological assessment within 3 days in all cases brain CT and cerebral perfusion determination (SPECT M-PAO) were obtained. Focal reduction of blood flow was demonstrated in 47 cases, mostly in the temporal area (78%). In 30 cases EEG was done finding in 18 disturbances of cerebral electric activity. In 9 cases neuropsychological examination was done. After 3 months control study of cerebral perfusion was done in 28 cases and in 27 flow changes were found to persist. Another follow-up examination in 6 cases after a year demonstrated in all of them focal disturbances of cerebral blood flow associated with symptoms of postconcussion syndrome.
