Applications of bone scintigraphy in ankylosing spondylitis. Eighteen bone scintisans performed in 14 patients with ankylosing spondylitis were reviewed. In young patients with low back pain, positive serology, and indeterminate radiographs, quantitative sacroiliac joint assessment and the presence of typical uptake patterns, particularly costovertebral, were useful in suggesting the diagnosis. Scintigraphy was helpful in the early detection of pseudoarthrosis complicating long-standing disease, especially in patients presenting with recurrent back pain. Selective application of bone scintigraphy aids the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis and its potential complications.
