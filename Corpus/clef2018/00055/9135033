Synthesis and ligand binding of nortropane derivatives: N-substituted 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4'-iodophenyl)nortropane and N-(3-iodoprop-(2E)-enyl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(3',4'-disubstituted phenyl)nortropane. New high-affinity and selective compounds for the dopamine transporter. Two novel series of iodinated N-substituted analogs of 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4'-iodophenyl)tropane (beta-CIT) and N-(3-iodoprop-(2E)-enyl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(3',4'-dis ubstituted phenyl)nortropane were synthesized. They were evaluated for their inhibitory properties on dopamine (DA(T)), serotonin (5-HT(T)), and norepinephrine (NE(T)) transporters in rat brain homogenates using [3H]GBR-12935, [3H]paroxetine, and [3H]nisoxetine as specific ligands. All new N-substituted analogs of beta-CIT exhibited higher DAT selectivity over both 5-HT(T) and NE(T) than beta-CIT. Moreover compounds with the N-substituents propynyl (6), crotyl (4), 2-bromoprop-(2E)-enyl (5), and 3-iodoprop-(2E)-enyl (3d) showed similar to higher DA(T) affinities than beta-CIT (respectively 14, 15, 30, and 30 nM vs 27 nM). Compound 3d was found to be the most selective DA(T) agent of this series (5-HTT/DA(T) = 32.0 vs 0.1 for beta-CIT). The N-(3-iodoprop-(2E)-enyl) chain linked to the tropane nitrogen was therefore maintained on the tropane structure, and phenyl substitution was carried out in order to improve DA(T) affinity. K(i) values of N-(3-iodoprop-(2E)-enyl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(3',4'-dis ubstituted phenyl)nortropanes revealed that phenyl, 4'-isopropyl, and 4'-n-propyl derivatives weakly inhibited specific binding to DA(T), whereas phenyl substitution with 4'-methyl (3c), 3',4'-dichloro (3b), and 4'-iodo (3d) yielded high-DA(T) reuptake agents with increased DA(T) selectivity compared to beta-CIT. These results demonstrate that the combination of a nitrogen and a phenyl substitution yields compounds with high affinity and selectivity for the dopamine transporter which are usable as SPECT markers for DA neurons.
