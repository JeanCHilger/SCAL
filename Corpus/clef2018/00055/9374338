Iodine-123-epidepride-SPECT: studies in Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and Huntington's disease. Epidepride is a benzamide derivative with very high affinity for D2 receptors, which, in its [123I]-labeled form, can be used for SPECT. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness and accuracy of [123I]epidepride-SPECT for the differential diagnosis of movement disorders.SPECT imaging with a triple-headed scintillation camera was performed in 9 patients with Parkinson's disease, 9 patients with probable multiple system atrophy (MSA), 1 patient with progressive supranuclear palsy, 16 patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and 14 controls, 3 hr after the intravenous injection of 3.7 +/- 1.3 mCi of [123I]epidepride. The striatum-to-cerebellum ratio - 1, reflecting the specific-to-nondisplaceable binding ratio, was used as a semiquantitative measure of D2 receptor binding.Kinetic studies showed peak striatal uptake about 3 hr postinjection and a slow decline thereafter. The striatum-to-cerebellum ratio - 1 was significantly reduced in MSA (11.8 +/- 3.9, compared to controls, 19.0 +/- 6.3 p < 0.01) and in patients with HD (8.8 +/- 3.2Epidepride appears to be a useful SPECT ligand for studying dopamine D2 receptors. However, its markedly higher specific-to-nondisplaceable binding ratio in comparison to those of iodobenzamide or other D2 ligands did not result in a better discrimination between different basal ganglia disorders. The calculation of plasma input curves and volumes of distribution might improve the accuracy of [123I]epidepride-SPECT.
