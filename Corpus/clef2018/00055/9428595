Synthesis of 6-methyl[11C]-2'-deoxyuridine and evaluation of its in vivo distribution in Wistar rats. In this study, 6-methyl-2'-deoxyuridine, an artificial nucleoside, was labeled with 11C in the methyl position. Tissue distribution of 6-methyl[11C]-2'-deoxyuridine was investigated in normal Wistar rats and compared to the behavior of the natural nucleoside [methyl-11C]thymidine. High renal clearance, up to at least 20% of the injected activity, was noticed during the 20 min period following injection. Tissue distribution as determined by dynamic PET studies of both 11C-labeled nucleosides was significantly different for most of the organs.
