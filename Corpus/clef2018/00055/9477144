Cerebral glucose metabolism and centrotemporal spikes. The pathophysiology of regional glucose hypometabolism often associated with refractory, lesion-related, epilepsy is not well understood. In particular, the role of interictal spiking is controversial since animal models of partial epilepsy have shown that interictal spiking increases glucose metabolism. We addressed this question by studying with positron emission tomography (PET) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) the regional cerebral metabolism in children with focal spiking unrelated to a brain lesion. Patients (11 children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECS) and two children without seizures) had on EEG centrotemporal spikes which were either strictly unilateral (ten cases) or strongly predominant on one side (three cases). We looked for an asymmetry in the distribution of cerebral glucose metabolism in our group of patients using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). After spatial normalization, a reversed copy of the 13 scans was obtained, resulting in 26 scans which were assigned to two groups: a group with left-sided centrotemporal spikes and a group with right-sided centrotemporal spikes. Regional glucose metabolism was not statistically different in the two groups. This suggests that metabolic changes associated with interictal spiking cannot be demonstrated by PET with FDG in BCECS, and that this technique could be helpful for the differentiation between idiopathic and symptomatic cases of partial epilepsy in children.
