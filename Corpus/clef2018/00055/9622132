Cerebral blood flow in hypertensive patients: an initial report of reduced and compensatory blood flow responses during performance of two cognitive tasks. We asked whether the altered cerebral vasculature associated with essential hypertension might dampen or redirect the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) response to cognitive work. Relative rCBF was assessed with [(15)O]water positron emission tomography during a working memory task, a memory span task, and two perceptual control tasks. Unmedicated hypertensive patients and control subjects differed in rCBF response during both memory tasks. Hypertensives showed relatively diminished rCBF responses in right hemisphere areas combined with compensatory activation of homologous areas in the left cerebral cortex. Essential hypertension appears to selectively influence the circulatory reserve of portions of cerebral cortex and secondarily induce recruitment of other cortical areas to process certain tasks.
