Gamma emission imaging in the management of breast disorders. Breast cancer is the commonest malignancy to affect women. The malignant process may present clinicians with problems in establishing the diagnosis expeditiously, accurately staging the disease and assessing tumour response to primary systemic chemotherapy. Considerable recent interest has focused on the application of imaging techniques that utilize tumour-specific gamma-ray-emitting radiopharmaceuticals to resolve these problems. The wide availability of gamma camera systems makes single photon-imaging techniques, using radiopharmaceuticals incorporating conventional isotopes, attractive options. However, results concerning the detection of the primary breast cancer and the staging of axillary lymph nodes suggest that these techniques would appear to offer no significant advantages, when compared with those obtained using standard diagnostic methods. Dual gamma-ray-emission imaging by positron emission tomography (PET) may offer an alternative solution. Studies performed show that PET can accurately detect primary breast cancers, stage locoregional lymph nodes and visualize distant tumour metastases. Furthermore, PET may be able to monitor early tumour response to chemotherapy agents. It would appear, therefore, that dual gamma emission might have an important role to play in the management of patients with breast cancer.
