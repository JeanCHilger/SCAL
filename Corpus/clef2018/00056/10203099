Role of positron emission tomography in determining the extent of CNS ischemia in patients with sickle cell disease. Nearly 25% of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience central nervous system morbidity involving both large and small vessel disease. Optimal imaging methods for determining the extent of ischemia are not known. Positron emission tomography (PET) has the unique ability to show tissue function as well as structure. Reports concerning patients with non-SCD neurodegenerative disorders suggest PET may be useful in determining prognosis. We compared magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and neuropsychological testing with PET prospectively. Six patients with SCD and a history of stroke, aged 10 to 28, were enrolled. PET studies were performed on an ECAT HR 47 scanner (Siemens/CTI, Knoxville, TN) using 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose as a tracer. PET interpretations were conducted in blinded fashion. MRI studies found two patients with only small vessel disease and four with both large and small vessel disease. In two of four subjects with large vessel disease, PET showed a corresponding metabolic abnormality and also identified an area of hypometabolism extending beyond the anatomical lesion as shown by MRI. PET did not demonstrate an abnormality corresponding with small vessel disease. Detailed neuropsychological testing demonstrated cognitive dysfunction in all cases. For some patients, PET may add sensitivity in detecting impaired metabolism in the area surrounding a major vessel infarct. However, the technique does not appear to be generally useful in characterizing small watershed or deep white matter infarcts. Larger studies, to include control subjects and carefully selected untransfused SCD patients, are needed. A combination of conventional imaging and neuropsychological testing remains the preferred evaluation for most SCD patients with neurologic symptoms.
