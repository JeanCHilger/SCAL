Feasibility of fluorodeoxyglucose dual-head gamma camera coincidence imaging in the evaluation of lung cancer: comparison with FDG PET. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the feasibility of fluorodeoxyglucose gamma camera coincidence imaging (FDG GCI) in the evaluation of lung cancer in comparison with FDG PET.Twenty-three patients with recently diagnosed lung cancer were examined with both FDG PET and FDG GCI on the same day. Pulmonary lesions were analyzed visually and semiquantitatively using the ratio of lesion-to-background counts (L/B ratio). The L/B ratio of FDG PET without attenuation correction (AC) was also calculated and compared. Nodal stations were only visually analyzed.FDG GCI and FDG PET could detect 22 and 23, respectively, of 23 pulmonary lesions by visual analysis (95.7% versus 100%). The L/B ratio of FDG GCI was 4.26 +/- 2.55, and significantly lower than that of FDG PET (9.29 +/- 4.95 P < 0.01). The L/B ratio of FDG PET was significantly higher with AC than that without AC (9.29 +/- 4.95 vs. 6.66 +/- 4.65In this study, FDG GCI yielded results comparable to FDG PET on visual analysis to detect pulmonary lesions and lymph node metastases. However, the lesion-to-background contrasts of pulmonary lesions and nodal involvement were lower in FDG GCI than in FDG PET. Comparison between the L/B ratio of FDG PET with and without AC indicated that, with AC, FDG GCI would be closer to FDG PET in the evaluation of lung cancer.
