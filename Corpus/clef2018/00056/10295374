Purchase considerations for SPECT systems. Physicians or hospital administrators must consider many factors in the purchase of single-photon emission computed tomography systems. This article summarizes justification of purchase by forecasting SPECT use and developing pay-back scenarios, specification of equipment, development of purchase agreements and acceptance testing, and management of the delivered SPECT system. Availability, use, and quality of SPECT imaging will depend on the effort of the nuclear physician/radiologist and the hospital administrator in these purchase considerations.
