Quality assurance in SPECT imaging. The predominant type of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) system available today is the rotating gamma camera system. These systems are complex, with many variables to control, and are prone to artifacts. To maintain optimal imaging performance, we emphasize a quality-assurance program that maintains imaging detector performance, proper mechanical alignments, periodic system calibrations, and strict adherence to imaging protocols. We urge the use of SPECT phantoms to evaluate total system performance. With SPECT phantoms, rotating camera systems with both circular and noncircular orbits can be easily evaluated. Quantitative measurements of system performance can be recorded graphically on a time chart for trend analysis, which leads to timely investigation of system failures.
