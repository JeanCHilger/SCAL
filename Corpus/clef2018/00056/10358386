Positron emission tomography for the assessment of myocardial viability: a synopsis of methods and indications. An improvement of regional and global left ventricle dysfunction can be achieved in patients with coronary artery disease either by coronary revascularization with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting. Several techniques have been developed to identify dysfunctional but viable myocardium. In the last decade, positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) has been used for the detection of hibernating myocardium. It can accurately predict the recovery of abnormal wall motion in hibernating segments prior to surgery. In particular, assessment of viability with 18F-FDG is indicated in high-risk surgical candidates being considered for revascularization or transplantation. Moreover, patient selection criteria and economic consideration are also relevant for cost-effective use of the technique.
