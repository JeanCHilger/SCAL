Influence of restricted food intake on estrous cycles and pseudopregnancies in dogs. To examine effects of restricted food intake on estrous cycle frequency, interestrus interval, and pseudopregnancy prevalence in dogs.28 female Labrador Retrievers.Dogs were paired by body weight when they were 6 weeks old and fed so that the limit-fed pair-mate received 75% of the amount of food offered to its maintenance-fed counterpart. Estrous cycle, interestrus interval, and pseudopregnancy data were recorded.Mean annual frequency of estrous cycles and duration of interestrus intervals did not differ between feeding groups. Prevalence of clinically evident pseudopregnancy was significantly greater among females that were maintenance fed, although results of endocrinologic testing did not identify a mechanism for this observation.Pseudopregnancy in dogs can be influenced by physiologic factors related to nutrition. Clinicians should consider a variety of physiologic and environmental factors when evaluating reproductive function in dogs.
