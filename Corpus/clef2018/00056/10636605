Psychosocially enhanced treatment for cocaine-dependent mothers: evidence of efficacy. Eighty-four cocaine-dependent mothers were randomly assigned either to a case management-oriented outpatient treatment program (CM), or to a psychosocially enhanced treatment program (PET). Both programs included onsite child care and both offered daily group therapy sessions. Subjects randomized to the PET condition were offered a variety of additional onsite services designed to meet their special psychosocial needs including parenting skills class, access to a psychiatrist, individual therapy sessions, and GED class. Patients in the CM program could gain access to these services only through referrals to community resources. Program retention was significantly better for patients in the PET condition. In addition, while the mean number of days of cocaine use decreased from baseline in both groups, the PET group had significantly fewer days of cocaine use at 12-month follow-up than the CM group. These results show that providing psychosocial enhancement services onsite can improve treatment outcome for cocaine-dependent mothers.
