Identification of sat, an autotransporter toxin produced by uropathogenic Escherichia coli. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a very common extraintestinal infection, and Escherichia coli is by far the most common causative organism. Uropathogenic E. coli possess traits that distinguish them from commensal strains of E. coli, such as secretion systems that allow virulence factors to be targeted to extracytoplasmic compartments. One of at least five characterized secretion mechanisms is the autotransporter system, which involves translocation of a protein across the inner membrane, presumably via the sec system, and across the outer membrane through a beta-barrel porin structure formed by the carboxy-terminus autotransporter domain. We identified a 107 kDa protein that was expressed significantly more often by E. coli strains associated with the clinical syndrome of acute pyelonephritis than by faecal strains (P = 0.029). We isolated the protein from E. coli CFT073, a strain cultured from the blood and urine of a patient with acute pyelonephritis. The N-terminal amino acid sequence showed highest similarity to two known SPATE (serine protease autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae) proteins, Pet and EspC. Using a 509 bp probe from the 5' region of pet, 10 cosmid clones of an E. coli CFT073 gene library were positive for hybridization. From one cosmid clone, a 7.5 kb EcoRI restriction fragment, which reacted strongly with the probe, was shown to include the entire 3885 bp gene. The predicted 142 kDa protein product possesses the three domains that are typical of SPATE autotransporters: an unusually long signal sequence of 49 amino acids a 107 kDa passenger domain containing a consensus serine protease active site (GDSGSG)
