A Pediatric Case of Ophthalmoplegic Migraine with Recurrent Oculomotor Nerve Palsy. Purpose: A young patient of ophthalmoplegic migraine with recurrent oculomotor nerve palsy is reported.Case: A 4-year-old girl came to our hospital complaining of recurrent left ptosis and double vision which completely resolved within a few days. She had a history of drowsiness after vomiting every two months. Left oculomotor nerve palsy with internal ophthalmoplegia was observed. Electroencephalography revealed mild changes, but computed tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, and cerebrovascular Doppler-ultrasound examination demonstrated no abnormalities. This oculomotor nerve palsy completely improved on the next day.Results: Thereafter, left episodic mydriasis and oculomotor nerve palsy occurred twice each. However, the frequency and symptoms of migraine were remarkably reduced by topical administration of 0.25% timolol maleate twice daily to both eyes.Conclusion: In isolated oculomotor nerve palsy in childhood, ophthalmoplegic migraine should be also considered. We emphasize that a detailed case history is very important to its diagnosis.
