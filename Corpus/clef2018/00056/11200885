Stabilisation of [131I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine at room temperature as organic extract in ethyl acetate/chloroform. A method of purification of [131I]mIBG (diagnostic dose) by solvent extraction and possibility of its stabilisation by storage in ethyl acetate and chloroform at up to 40 degrees C for not less than 14 days is described. In order to further enhance the utility of this finding, the organic extract was dispensed into vials and dried. Vials containing such dried residue of [131I]mIBG stored at up to 40 degrees C was also found to be stable for at least 10 days. The final product reconstituted as aqueous solution resulted in 90% recovery with 99% radiochemical purity as assessed by previously reported methods, as well as a relatively more rapid paper chromatography method standardised by us. These interesting findings promise simpler and economic packaging besides transport of diagnostic doses of [131I]mIBG.
