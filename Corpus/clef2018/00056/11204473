Pericardial effusion and pericardiocentesis in a guinea pig (Cavia porcellus). A three-year-old, female guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) presented for acute dyspnea and weakness. Radiographs and echocardiography were consistent with a diagnosis of pericardial effusion and heart failure secondary to cardiac tamponade. Ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis was performed, and clinical signs rapidly improved. Serial echocardiography and radiographs demonstrated normalization of cardiac function over the subsequent six months.
