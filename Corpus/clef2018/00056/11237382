Proportion of infiltrating IgG-binding immune cells predict for tumour hypoxia. Macrophages can account for up to 50% of tumour mass and secrete many angiogenic factors. Furthermore, tumour hypoxia is thought to play a major role in the activation of macrophages and the regulation of angiogenesis. In this paper, we demonstrate a strong correlation between hypoxia and the recruitment of immune cells binding to IgG in 8 experimental tumours. We provide evidence that IgG binding immune cells in 3 tumour lines are predominately composed of macrophages. Reduced oxygenation may act as a stimulus for recruitment of immune cells to the tumour mass, and the detection of either IgG-positive host cells or macrophages may offer an alternative method for monitoring tumour hypoxia.
