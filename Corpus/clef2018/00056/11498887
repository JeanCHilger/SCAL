Radioimmunological image in tumor bearing nude mice with monoclonal antibody against human laryngeal carcinoma. To investigate the specific autoradiographic diagnosis of laryngeal carcinoma and its metastasis.Three strains of the mixed monoclonal antibodies against human laryngeal carcinoma (McAbLC9, 11, 12) labelled with 131I were injected(intraperitoneally) into the nude mice bearing squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor autoradiography was done by single photo-emission computed tomography (ECT). The percent injected dose/g of tumor were measured, and the radioactivity ratio of tumor to non-tumor tissues(T/NT) were calculated.The 131I-McAbLC 9, 11, 12 can accumulate in the area of the laryngeal carcinoma within limited time, and demonstrate a satisfactory tumor imaging at 96 h. In experimental groups: The %ID/g of tumor tissues (mean +/- s, n = 6) was 18.8 +/- 0.61 The %ID/g of tumor tissues in the control group was 4.46 +/- 0.82 (mean +/- s, n = 6) at 96 h. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01, t = 34.97).The results suggest that 131I McAbLC9, 11, 12 is specific and sensitive in recognising human laryngeal carcinoma cell, and the area and size of tumor can be easily detected by ECT. It is feasible for localization of tumor and its metastasis.
