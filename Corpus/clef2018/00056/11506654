The effects of presentation rate during word and pseudoword reading: a comparison of PET and fMRI. The effect of stimulus rate and its interaction with stimulus type on brain activity during reading was investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This (i) enabled the segregation of brain regions showing differential responses, (ii) identified the optimum experimental design parameters for maximizing sensitivity, and (iii) allowed us to evaluate further the sources of discrepancy between positron emission tomography (PET) and fMRI signals. The effect of visual word rate has already been investigated in a previous PET study. However, rate effects can be very different in PET and fMRI, as seen in previous studies of auditory word processing. In this work, we attempt to replicate rate-sensitive activations observed with PET using fMRI. Our objective was to characterize the discrepancies in regionally specific rate-sensitive effects between the two imaging modalities. Subjects were presented with words and pseudowords at varying rates while performing a silent reading task. The analysis specifically identified regions showing (i) an effect of stimulus rate on brain activity during reading (ii) modulation of this effect by word type
