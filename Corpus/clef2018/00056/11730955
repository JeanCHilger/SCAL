Developments in whole-body molecular imaging of live subjects. New molecular imaging technologies are being developed specifically for imaging animal models of human disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) in particular allows in vivo biochemistry to be studied with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity, and provides direct in vivo information on molecular and cellular pathways that underlie disease mechanisms and therapeutics. However, clinical PET systems have inadequate resolution for imaging small animals. Thus, specialized high-resolution PET hardware and software are now being developed.
