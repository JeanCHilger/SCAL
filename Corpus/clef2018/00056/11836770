MRI detection of myocardial perfusion defects due to coronary artery stenosis with MS-325. To assess the value of an intravascular, albumin-targeted contrast agent, MS-325, in visualizing myocardial ischemia with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) stenosis was created in 19 pigs using a closed-chest modified angioplasty technique. Myocardial ischemia was detected by first-pass, contrast-enhanced MRI at peak dipyridamole stress and was compared to Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Regional coronary blood flow was determined using microspheres.Inducible myocardial ischemia with >40% reduction in stress myocardial blood flow was created in eight animals. An MRI defect, classified as > or=75% reduction in peak myocardial signal intensity in the affected territory, was detected in 92.3% of these animals. In the presence of mild coronary stenosis, there was uniform enhancement with MRI and tracer uptake by SPECT. Concordance of MRI and SPECT for detecting perfusion defects was 85%.The pattern of prolonged and persistent MR hypoenhancement of the ischemic myocardial bed using MS-325, which is retained primarily in the vascular bed due to its albumin-binding properties, facilitates the detection of myocardial perfusion defects.
