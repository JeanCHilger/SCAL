Focal tracer uptake: a potential artifact in contrast-enhanced dual-modality PET/CT scans. This study was performed to evaluate a possible artifact related to the administration of intravascular contrast agent in dual-modality PET/CT imaging.Thirty oncology patients underwent whole-body PET/CT. CT images, which were collected in the presence of intravenous and oral iodinated contrast agent, were used for PET attenuation correction. PET images were assessed for the artifact, defined as a region of high count rate on attenuation-corrected images in accurate coregistration with a contrast-enhanced blood vessel. Intravascular enhancement of thoracic veins was quantified by application of regions of interest, and quantities in patients with the artifact (group 1) and without the artifact (group 2) were correlated. Body surface area was calculated for all patients.The contrast-induced PET artifact was present in 4 (13%) of 30 patients. Mean density differences in intravascular enhancement were highly significant (P < 0.001) in a comparison of group 1 (2,262 +/- 304 Hounsfield units [HU]) and group 2 (1,058 +/- 209 HU). Body surface area was significantly lower (P = 0.035) in the patients of group 1 (1.67 +/- 0.11 m(2)) than in the patients of group 2 (2.01 +/- 0.18 m(2)).Contrast-enhanced dual-modality PET/CT examinations may result in a PET artifact that is due to the transient bolus passage of undiluted intravenous contrast agent.
