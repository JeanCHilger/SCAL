Regional cerebral blood flow changes in patients with intractable obsessive compulsive disorders treated by limbic leukotomy. The object of this study is to assess the changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) following stereotactic limbic leukotomy in patients with medically intractable Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Technetium-99-Hexa Methyl Propylene Amine Oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) data obtained before and after limbic leukotomy were subjected to image fusion with MRI images. Eight samples were obtained from healthy voluteers. After localization of the ROI (Region Of Interest) in anatomical area, rCBF measurements were obtained by METLAB. The results of this study show a change of rCBF following limbic leukotomy in intractable OCD. Postoperative 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT findings implicate the medial frontal cortex, cingulate and striatum, which culd be linked to limbic leukotomy that blocks the functional connection of corticolimbic loop.
