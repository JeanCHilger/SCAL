Comparison of striatal dopamine D2 receptors in Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy patients using [123I] iodobenzofuran single-photon emission computed tomography. To investigate the clinical applicability and validity of [123I] iodobenzofuran (IBF) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), the authors analyzed the changes in striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding among 7 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), 6 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (Hoehn and Yahr stage II to IV), and 8 normal controls.SPECT data were acquired every 1 minute for 60 minutes postinjection of 167 MBq [123I] IBF. The binding potential (BP) of the striatum was evaluated by 2 methods: region-of-interest (ROI) analysis by the nonlinear least squares method using blood sampling and time-series brain radioactivities in normal controls and a voxel-by-voxel method based on a region model that provided parametric images of BP without blood sampling.Statistical parametric mapping indicated that BP in the striatum of PSP patients was significantly lower than that of PD patients and normal controls (P < .005, uncorrected), and there was no significant difference between PD patients and normal controls, even in patients with PD at an advanced stage. Data derived from the ROI method and a simplified reference region model showed good correlations in normal controls, indicating the validity of the latter model.The results predict that [123I] IBF SPECT, especially voxel-by-voxel BP parametric imaging, can discriminate among extrapyramidal diseases such as PD and PSP and may be applicable for clinical use.
