Pet therapy and increased socialization among elderly clients. Churchill et al.'s (1999) study supported the idea that pet therapy increased socialization and decreased agitation among persons with AD. This study could be used to support the group research utilization project on the use of pet therapy to increase socialization. Future research might concentrate on participants with varied ethnic backgrounds and varied clinical diagnoses. Some feasibility issues would be finding dogs or pets properly trained for therapy and finding nurses properly trained on the use of pet therapy.
