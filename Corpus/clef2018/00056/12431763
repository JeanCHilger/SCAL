Parallel distributed processing neuroimaging in the Stroop task using spatially filtered magnetoencephalography analysis. Parallel distributed processing neuroimaging in the Stroop color word interference task in five healthy subjects was studied. The total reaction time was set at 650 ms with a time window of 200 ms in steps of 50 ms. Spatially filtered magnetoencephalography analysis, as used in synthetic aperture magnetometry, was used. Neural activation began in the left posterior parietal-occipital area (150-250 ms post-stimulus), followed by the right prefrontal polar area (250-350 ms), the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (250-400 ms), and the mid- to lower- primary motor area (350-400 ms). Successive and temporally overlapping activation of various cortical regions were successfully estimated within a short 200 ms time interval, contrary to previous positron emission tomography and fMRI studies.
