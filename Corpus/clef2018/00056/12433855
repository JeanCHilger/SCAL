Muscle oxygen extraction and perfusion heterogeneity during continuous and intermittent static exercise. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of intermittent and continuous static exercise on muscle perfusion, perfusion heterogeneity, and oxygen extraction. Perfusion and oxygen uptake of quadriceps femoris muscle were measured in 10 healthy men by using positron emission tomography and [(15)O]H(2)O and [(15)O]O(2) first during intermittent static exercise [10% of maximal static force (MSF)] and thereafter during continuous static exercise at the same tension-time level (5% static 5% of MSF). In 4 of these subjects, perfusion was measured during continuous static exercise with 10% of MSF (10% continuous) instead of the second [(15)O]O(2) measurement. Muscle oxygen consumption was similar during intermittent and 5% continuous, but muscle perfusion was significantly higher during 5% continuous. Consequently, muscle oxygen extraction fraction was lower during 5% continuous. Perfusion was also more heterogeneous during 5% continuous. When exercise intensity was doubled during continuous static exercise (from 5% continuous to 10% continuous), muscle perfusion increased markedly. These results suggest that continuous, low-intensity static exercise decreases muscle oxygen extraction and increases muscle perfusion and its heterogeneity compared with intermittent static exercise at the same relative exercise intensity.
