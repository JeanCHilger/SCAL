Prokaryote expression and western analysis of BcpLH gene of Chinese cabbage. BcpLH gene preferentially expressed in folding leaf of Chinese cabbage contains dsRNA-binding domains. The cDNA of BcpLH gene was cloned into a His-fusion expression vector pET-28a (+) and was induced to express in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). Then, the specific protein was partially purified and the rabbit was immunized to prepare the anti-serum. Meanwhile BcpLH cDNA was cloned into the pMAL-c2 containing the solubizing partner, and then the soluble protein generated. It was demonstrated from Western dot assay that the BcpLH protein was specific. The BcpLH active protein and its anti-serum made it possible to study RNA-binding activity and regulation mechanism in plant development.
