Diagnostic value of gated-SPECT for each coronary artery in patients clinically diagnosed of coronary heart disease. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of gated-SPECT for each coronary artery in patients with clinical diagnosis or suspicion of coronary heart disease.The study population is made up of 43 patients (64 9 years, 88% male gender) with prior clinical diagnosis or suspicion of coronary heart disease who had undergone gated-SPECT (99mTc-tetrofosmin) and cardiac catheterization. Scintigraphic study after exercise treadmill test and rest study were performed on the same day.Gated-SPECT showed perfusion defects in 86% of patients, the mean number of territories with perfusion defects being 1.58 +/- 0.79. A total of 39 (91%) of the 43 patients had significant coronary heart disease. Single, two- and three-vessel disease was demonstrated in 12 (28%), 15 (35%) and 12 (28%) patients, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were 81% and 91%, respectively, for left anterior descending artery, 88% and 65% for right coronary artery, and 55% and 81% for circumflex one.Myocardial scintigraphy with gated-SPECT offers high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of left anterior descending artery disease. However, sensitivity for circumflex artery and specificity for right coronary artery were low in our series.
