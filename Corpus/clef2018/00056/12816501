Fluorescence and NMR binding studies of N-aryl-N'-(9-methylanthryl)diaza-18-crown-6 derivatives. N-Aryl-N'-(9-methylanthryl)diaza-18-crown-6 derivatives perform as fluorescent photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) sensors with very selective response toward Ca(2+) versus Mg(2+), Na(+), and K(+). The fluorescence intensity was increased by a factor of up to 170 in the presence of Ca(ClO(4))(2). (1)H NMR studies show that metal cations affect these molecules very differently: Ca(2+) has a global effect on each molecule, while Mg(2+) affects part of each molecule, and K(+) and Na(+) affect each molecule moderately, which is very consistent with the fluorescence response.
