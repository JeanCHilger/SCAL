Pet-keeping in early childhood and airway, nose and skin symptoms later in life. It is discussed whether exposure to pets during childhood is a risk or a protective factor for sensitization and allergic symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between pet-keeping at time of birth and allergic symptoms in airways, nose and skin among young children in Sweden.A questionnaire was sent to the parents of 14 077 children (1-6 years), the focus being on allergic symptoms, home environment and other background factors including pet-keeping and avoidance behaviour. The response rate was 79%.Almost one-tenth of the population had got rid of pets because of allergy in the family, and 27.3% reported "avoidance" behaviour towards pets. In a cross-sectional analysis current pet-keeping was "protective", but this may be due to the fact that people avoid exposing their child to something that they believe is a risk factor for allergies. Pet-keeping at the time of birth was associated with "wheezing", "asthma" and "rhinitis on pet-exposure" later in life for children from families with an "avoidance" behaviour, and was not "protective" for other children. There was also an indication of a dose-response relationship between the number of types of furred pets at time of birth and later symptoms in analyses adjusted for avoidance behaviour or current pet-keeping.The distribution of pet-keeping in the population is largely explained by avoidance behaviour, meaning that those who have pets mainly are those who can stand them, indicating a "healthy pet-keeping effect".
