Molecular-genetic imaging: a nuclear medicine-based perspective. Molecular imaging is a relatively new discipline, which developed over the past decade, initially driven by in situ reporter imaging technology. Noninvasive in vivo molecular-genetic imaging developed more recently and is based on nuclear (positron emission tomography [PET], gamma camera, autoradiography) imaging as well as magnetic resonance (MR) and in vivo optical imaging. Molecular-genetic imaging has its roots in both molecular biology and cell biology, as well as in new imaging technologies. The focus of this presentation will be nuclear-based molecular-genetic imaging, but it will comment on the value and utility of combining different imaging modalities. Nuclear-based molecular imaging can be viewed in terms of three different imaging strategies: (1) "indirect" reporter gene imaging (2) "direct" imaging of endogenous molecules
