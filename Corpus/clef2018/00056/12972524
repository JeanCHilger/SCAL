Quantitative tumor apoptosis imaging using technetium-99m-HYNIC annexin V single photon emission computed tomography. Radiolabeled annexin V may allow for repetitive and selective in vivo identification of apoptotic cell death without the need for invasive biopsy. This study reports on the relationship between quantitative technetium-99m- (99mTc-) 6-hydrazinonicotinic (HYNIC) radiolabeled annexin V tumor uptake, and the number of tumor apoptotic cells derived from histologic analysis.Twenty patients (18 men, two women) suspected of primary (n = 19) or recurrent (n = 1) head and neck carcinoma were included. All patients underwent a spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, 99mTc-HYNIC annexin V tomography, and subsequent surgical resection of the suspected primary or recurrent tumor. Quantitative 99mTc-HYNIC annexin V uptake in tumor lesions divided by the tumor volume, derived from CT, was related to the number of apoptotic cells per tumor high-power field derived from terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assays performed on sectioned tumor slices.Diagnosis was primary head and neck tumor in 18 patients, lymph node involvement of a cancer of unknown primary origin in one patient, and the absence of recurrence in one patient. Mean percentage absolute tumor uptake of the injected dose per cubic centimeter tumor volume derived from tomographic images was 0.0003% (standard deviation [SD], 0.0004%) at 1 hour postinjection (PI) and 0.0001% (SD, 0.0000%) at 5 to 6 hours PI (P =.012). Quantitative 99mTc-HYNIC annexin V tumor uptake correlated well with the number of apoptotic cells if only tumor samples with no or minimal amounts of necrosis were considered.In the absence of necrosis, absolute 99mTc-HYNIC annexin V tumor uptake values correlate well with the number of apoptotic cells derived from TUNEL assays.
