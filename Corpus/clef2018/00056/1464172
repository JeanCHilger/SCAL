Hepatic SPECT imaging in the detection and clinical assessment of hepatocellular disease. A total of 95 patients, including 45 people with no evidence of liver disease and 50 documented hepatocellular disease patients, were studied to assess the value of planar and SPECT scintigraphy in the evaluation of hepatocellular disease. The accuracy and concordance between techniques was assessed using two criteria. Criterion 1, heterogeneity of the tracer in liver, yielded a concordance of 64%, whereas with criterion 2, liver and spleen tracer pattern, concordance was 78%. SPECT was significantly more accurate than planar imaging (P < 0.01), using both criteria. The clinical severity of the hepatocellular disease was further assessed in 72 of the patients and correlated with a liver scan severity rating scale. The SPECT technique showed a good correlation (r = 0.89) with the composite clinical severity score however, no significant relationship with planar imaging was noted. The results of this study suggest that liver SPECT is a reliable technique for the assessment of hepatocellular disease.
