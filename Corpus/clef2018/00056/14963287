Cerebral ischemia in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a correlative microdialysis-PET study. Cerebral microdialysis (MD) is discussed as a technique for detection of cerebral ischemia in subarachnoid hemorrhage however, clinical data on cerebral blood flow (CBF) are limited in these patients. The main objective of this study was to investigate whether pathological MD parameters reflect a reduced regional CBF (rCBF) determined by 15O-H2O PET.Thirteen subarachnoid hemorrhage patients (age, 48.7+/-15.0 years World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grade 1 to 5) were studied. Extracellular glucose, lactate, lactate/pyruvate (L/P) ratio, glutamate, and glycerol levels were analyzed hourly. rCBF was determined in the volume of interest of the MD catheter and all vascular territories. MD values were correlated to rCBF on the day of PET. Then, MD concentrations of asymptomatic versus ischemic phases (3-day medians) were analyzed.In symptomatic patients (n=10), rCBF was significantly lower compared with controls (n=3, P=0.048). Glutamate correlated best with rCBF (r=-0.66 P=0.014), followed by glycerol (r=-0.62rCBF correlates best with glutamate, followed by glycerol, whereas the L/P ratio is sensitive only after longer periods of ischemia. Clinically relevant regional metabolic derangements occur already above an rCBF of 20 mL x 100 g(-1).min(-1). Future research should focus on identifying alternative causes of metabolic derangement in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients and optimal treatment management in these patients.
