Feasibility of endovascular cooling as an adjunct to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (results of the LOWTEMP pilot study). In a nonrandomized feasibility study of therapeutic hypothermia in acute myocardial infarction, 18 patients were treated with endovascular cooling (Alsius, Irvine, California) as adjunctive therapy to primary percutaneous coronary intervention to assess measures of infarct size (area under the curve creatinine kinase-MB and technetium-99m single-photon emission computed tomography sestamibi) and the quality of myocardial perfusion (continuous ST-segment monitoring). Periprocedural endovascular cooling successfully decreased core body temperature (median 33.5 degrees C) and was well tolerated, which supports the evaluation of adjunctive hypothermia in pivotal trials to limit infarct size and decrease reperfusion injury.
