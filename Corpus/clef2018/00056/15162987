Tc-99m depreotide detecting malignant pulmonary nodules: histopathologic correlation with semiquantitative tumor-to-normal lung ratio. Tc-99m depreotide is a synthetic somatostatin analog with a low molecular weight of 1358 and binding domains for somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) subtypes 2, 3, and 5. This agent has been used for imaging pulmonary nodules in an effort to differentiate malignancies from infectious processes. To investigate whether there is significant ratio variability predicting a specific lung cancer type, we undertook this study. We analyzed the semiquantitative tumor-to-normal lung ratios among 23 patients with histopathologically proven lung carcinoma. Eleven patients with squamous cell carcinoma had 14 nodular lesions (n = 14) the ratios ranged from 6.0 to 1.4
