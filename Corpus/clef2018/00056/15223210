Veterinary hemodialysis: advances in management and technology. Hemodialysis (HD) is a renal replacement therapy that can enable recovery of patients in acute kidney failure and prolong survival for patients with end-stage kidney failure. HD is also uniquely suited for management of refractory volume overload and removal of certain toxins from the bloodstream. Over the last decade, veterinary experience with HD has deepened and refined and its geographic availability has increased. As awareness of the usefulness and availability of dialytic therapy increases among veterinarians and pet owners and the number of veterinary dialysis facilities increases, dialytic management will become the standard of advanced care for animals with severe intractable uremia.
