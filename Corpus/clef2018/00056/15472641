Noninvasive assessment of coronary microvascular dysfunction using Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT in patients with acute myocardial infarction. We investigated whether technetium 99m tetrofosmin (TF) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) could predict coronary microvascular dysfunction in patients with acute myocardial infarction.We obtained the regional severity score index (TF-RSSI) using TF SPECT immediately after percutaneous coronary intervention in 25 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Using a Doppler guidewire, we evaluated the deceleration time of diastolic flow velocity (DDT) after percutaneous coronary intervention, and DDT of 600 milliseconds or less was suggested to be an indicator of coronary microvascular dysfunction. Moreover, the chronic regional wall motion score index (RWMSI) was obtained from echocardiography during the chronic phase. There was a good correlation between TF-RSSI and DDT (r = -0.68, P < .01). The optimal cutoff value of TF-RSSI to predict DDT of 600 milliseconds or less was defined as 1.9 or greater (sensitivity, 1.00 specificity, 0.71). The group with poor scintigraphic coronary microvascular function (TF-RSSI > or =1.9, n = 7) demonstrated a significantly shorter DDT (P = .0003), a lower frequency of early systolic retrograde flow (P = .0038), and greater chronic RWMSI (P = .0015) than the group with good scintigraphic coronary microvascular function (TF-RSSI <1.9, n = 15).Analysis of TF SPECT immediately after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with acute myocardial infarction is a useful noninvasive method for evaluating coronary microvascular dysfunction.
