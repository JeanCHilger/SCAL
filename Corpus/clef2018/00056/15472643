Do myocardial perfusion SPECT and radionuclide angiography studies in adult patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have prognostic implications? Some myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and radionuclide ventriculography studies have suggested that the presence of regional perfusion defects and diastolic abnormalities could have prognostic implications in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC). The aim of this prospective study was to analyze the prognostic value of these techniques in adult patients with HC.One hundred one patients with HC (44 women mean age, 54 +/- 16 yearsPrognostic information from myocardial perfusion SPECT and radionuclide angiography has limited clinical significance with regard to cardiac death in adult patients with HC. However, the presence of fixed defects and lower ejection fraction in these patients has an adverse prognostic meaning for severe complications.
