Metallic copper as a fiducial marker for both CT and PET. There is great interest in augmenting computed tomography (CT) with information gained from other imaging modalities. Positron emission tomography (PET) provides valuable data related to patient physiology to aid in the delineation of tumor volumes. Combining the information provided by these imaging modalities requires accurate spatial registration of the two data sets. Fiducial based mapping provides straightforward registration based on corresponding landmark points or fiducials in the two image sets. When external fiducials are employed, consistent intermodality marker placement and centroid identification are essential to achieving an accurate and reliable registration. Similarity of marker design between modalities greatly aides in achieving this goal. Solid copper may serve as a fiducial marker in both CT and PET. Small spheres or wires of copper are readily visible in CT while neutron activation of these same markers produces positron emitting Copper-64 for detection by PET. The use of identical shaped markers in both imaging modalities greatly simplifies the task of intermodality centroid matching. Copper has excellent machining properties and, prior to activation, is easy and safe to handle. The feasibility of Cu as a marker for both CT and PET is demonstrated using imaging phantoms.
