Role of radioisotopic investigations in breast cancer diagnosis and follow-up. Breast cancer represents the disease with the highest incidence in the female population. In the last years there was observed, in western countries, an increase of morbidity by breast tumors and in the same time, a decrease of mortality in direct relation with an earlier diagnosis. Until the spread at distance, breast cancer it's a loco-regional disease that can be curable by surgical treatment and adjuvant therapy, like chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The principal goal is to diagnose it before distal metastases appear, most frequently bone metastasis. Certain role has nuclear medicine in the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer because it's more sensitive and gives functional imaging. The aim of this study is to answer the question: what technique, in what indication. The detection of sentinel lymph node has now a clear place in the algorithm, the scintimammography test is important, especially for prediction of tumor resistance to chemotherapy. The bone scintigraphy (which explores the entire body in one time)is generally used in the detection of bony metastases and FDG tomoscintigraphy for the evaluation of local and distal recurrences, or response to chemotherapy. The measure of the isotopic ejection fraction, actually considered the gold standard, is very useful and also very easy to perform, in patients who will receive chemotherapy.
