Development of an epilepsy comprehensive care center: a Japanese model. To review the requirements of a comprehensive care center for people with epilepsy.Twenty-seven years have passed since the foundation of the Japanese Epilepsy Center in Shizuoka. The development of this center is presented as a model of an epilepsy comprehensive care center.Between 1926 and 1947, the Shizuoka Higashi Hospital (the former name of SMIND) served as a tuberculosis hospital. In 1975, a proposal for a special center for the care of people with epilepsy was submitted to the Japanese government. An epilepsy center (the Center) was soon built, and the tuberculosis sanatorium ended its 50-year history. The facilities of the Center include an outpatient clinic, four inpatient wards with 200 beds, a day-care center for medical rehabilitation, and classrooms for elementary and junior high school children. The Center has modern diagnostic tools such as electroencephalography (EEG), closed-circuit TV-EEG (CCTVEEG), computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single-photon emission CT (SPECT), and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Neurosurgery for intractable seizures has been conducted at the Center since 1983. Approximately 25,000 patients with epilepsy from all over Japan have been registered since 1975. Annually, approximately 5,000 outpatients and 600 inpatients attend the Center. As of March 2002, 500 patients had received resective surgery for epilepsy. Other activities in the Center include research and specialized training of professionals, including foreign nationals, in the treatment of epilepsy.The experience in Shizuoka suggests that management of epilepsy should be oriented toward psychological well-being, social rehabilitation, and seizure control.
