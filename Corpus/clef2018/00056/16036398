A prospective analysis of the role of uterine artery Doppler waveform notching in the assessment of at-risk pregnancies. To determine the value of second trimester uterine artery Doppler waveform notching in the prediction of adverse pregnancy outcome in a high-risk group.Analysis of data from a consecutively collected cohort.St. James University Hospital, Leeds, UK.Three hundred thirty women known to be at risk of preeclampsia (PET) or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) were assessed for notching of the uterine artery Doppler waveform between 24-30 weeks of pregnancy.Preeclampsia (PET), small-for-gestational-age at birth (SGA), preterm delivery (PTD), perinatal death.Two hundred thirty-two women (70.3%) had a normal uterine artery Doppler waveforms, and 98 (29.7%) demonstrated either unilateral or bilateral notching. In women where notching was present, 20 (20%) developed PET compared with 8 (3.5%) in the normal group [Odds ratio (OR) 7.2, CI 3-17] SGA birthweight was present in 24 (24.5%) of the notched group and in 21 (9%) of normal group (OR 3.3This study demonstrates that the addition of uterine Doppler waveform analysis to the monitoring profile of women at risk of PET, SGA, IUD and preterm delivery can further define those in a higher risk group and the majority that have a risk no higher than the background.
