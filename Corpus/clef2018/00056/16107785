Update: interim guidance for minimizing risk for human lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection associated with pet rodents. In May 2005, CDC received reports of illness in four solid-organ transplant recipients who were later determined to have been infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) from a common organ donor. Three of the four organ recipients died, 23-27 days after transplantation. This report updates information about the ongoing investigation and provides interim measures for reducing the risk for LCMV infection from pet rodents associated with this outbreak.
