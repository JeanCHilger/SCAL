Positron emission tomography elucidates transport system and tumor proliferation in meningiomas. To test the in vivo transport system and tumor proliferation of meningiomas, in comparison with gliomas, 25 patients with meningiomas and 8 gliomas underwent quantitative kinetic analysis of ([18F])fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) - positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and immunohistochemical study. Kinetic analysis was obtained by calculation of the rate constants: K1 (ml/g/min), which represents the transport of FDG from plasma to tissue k2 (min(-1)), which demonstrates the transport back from tissue to plasma
