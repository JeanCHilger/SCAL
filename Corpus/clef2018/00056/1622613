Diagnosis of coronary artery disease using exercise echocardiography and positron emission tomography: comparison and analysis of discrepant results. Both exercise echocardiography and rubidium-82 positron emission tomography are used in the detection and characterization of coronary artery disease. This study compared results of both in 74 patients with known coronary anatomy, by use of exercise echocardiography before and after treadmill exercise and positron emission tomography with intravenous dipyridamole-handgrip stress. Significant (greater than 50%) coronary stenoses were present in 70 patients exercise echocardiography and positron emission tomography each identified 63 patients (sensitivity 90%). Significant stenoses without previous myocardial infarction were present in 34 patients
