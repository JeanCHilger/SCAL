2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose-positron emission tomography sensitivity to serum glucose: a survey and diagnostic applications. The positron emission tomography (PET) clinical utility of the sensitivity (gamma) of uptake (Q) to a change in plasma glucose concentration (C) is investigated.Gamma is obtained from data as [ln(Q (2)/Q (1))] / [ln(C(2)/C(1))], using previously published intrapatient studies varying C within a single patient and some interpatient ones. It can be theoretically related to the half-saturation constant in the Michaelis-Menten quantification of competitive uptake. One of its uses is making uptake corrections for desired vs. actual C using Q(2) = Q(1) (C(2)/C(1))(gamma).Intrapatient studies proved to be preferable to interpatient ones, and a 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)-PET survey with analyses for gamma yielded the following result: usually the gamma values of tumors and brain tissues were near -1, whereas those of other noncerebral tissues were near 0. Regarding correcting uptakes for C, instead of a universally assumed and applied gamma = -1, corrections should be for a single tissue using its known gamma. An advantageous use of gamma is predicting how C affects image contrast, including where glucose loading is sometimes preferable to fasting.A potentially useful quantifier of uptake sensitivity to plasma glucose has been defined and values obtained. Correcting uptakes to some standard C requires special care. gamma can help PET clinicians select fasting or loading to achieve glucose levels for optimum contrast.
