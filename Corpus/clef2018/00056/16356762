Towards the control of Echinococcus multilocularis in the definitive host in Japan. Echinococcus multilocularis is distributed all over Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan. The prevalence in foxes has been around 40% in the last decade. Three trials of anthelmintic bait distribution have been conducted in Hokkaido to reduce the prevalence in foxes. In those trials, bait distribution was done along roads in the study area using cars and/or around fox breeding dens by hand. Changes in the prevalence in foxes were evaluated either by necropsy of captured foxes or by coproantigen and egg detection of faeces collected in field. All of the trials showed bait distribution was effective for the reduction of the prevalence in foxes however, it was also suggested that a frequent and continuous baiting program is necessary for effective and stable control of the prevalence in foxes. As observed in some cities in Europe, urban foxes infected with the parasite were also recognized in Sapporo. A survey of pet dogs showed that 0.4% of surveyed dogs were determined infected. In addition, a dog which was transported from Hokkaido to the main island of Japan was found excreting E. multilocularis eggs. The results raised the public recognition of canine infections, which in turn lead to the modification of a Japanese law for infectious diseases and to the enforcement of a national reporting system of dogs infected with E. multilocularis by veterinarians.
