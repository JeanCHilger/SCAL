A grid-mounted niobium body target for the production of reactive [18F]fluoride. A small-volume grid-supported niobium target was constructed for the production of [18F]-fluoride on a CTI RDS 112 cyclotron. The inert properties of niobium metal have proven compatible with the superheated environment generated during proton irradiation. A grid support, constructed from aluminum, provides the necessary heat removal for high-power irradiations. The niobium and gird combination supplies reactive fluoride over an extended target lifetime.
