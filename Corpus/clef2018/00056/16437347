Muscle activity during a dash shown by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has been used to examine muscle activity during running. The dash is a basic activity in various kinds of sports but differs from running in terms of intensity and severity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate muscle activity during running at full speed using FDG PET.Six healthy men were investigated during a dash for 10 min after intravenous injection of FDG (37 MBq). Another six healthy men were studied as controls. PET images were obtained 45 min after the FDG injection. Regions of interest were drawn on the anterior and posterior thighs and the anterior and posterior legs. The standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated to examine the FDG uptake of muscle tissue per unit volume according to an equation.In the control group, the mean SUVs of the anterior thigh, posterior thigh, anterior leg, and posterior leg were 0.49 +/- 0.04, 0.44 +/- 0.02, 0.46 +/- 0.05, and 0.44 +/- 0.07, respectively. In the dash group, the mean SUVs of the anterior thigh, posterior thigh, anterior leg, and posterior leg were 0.74 +/- 0.20, 0.79 +/- 0.08, 0.61 +/- 0.07, and 0.60 +/- 0.08, respectively. FDG accumulation of every one of the four compartments in the dash group was significantly higher than that in the control. FDG accumulation of the posterior thigh was significantly higher than that of the anterior and the posterior leg in the dash group (P < 0.02).Based on the results of our investigation, posterior thigh muscles were especially active during a dash.
