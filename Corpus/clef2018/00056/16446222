Vascular endothelial growth factor C-induced collateral formation in a model of myocardial ischemia. Besides being a known lymphangiogenic activator, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C may express angiogenic potential by proteolytic cleavage and activation of endothelial cells. We assessed myocardial collateral formation and functional changes after adenovirus-mediated VEGF-C gene transfer in an ischemic porcine model.Fifteen Landrace piglets underwent Ameroid-induced gradual occlusion of the left circumflex artery (LCx) and consequent progressive myocardial ischemia. Three weeks after Ameroid placement, the animals underwent gated 99mTc SPECT during rest and stress, in vivo angiography and 18FDG PET. Pigs were randomized to intramyocardial injections of adenoviruses encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-C n = 7) or control beta-galactosidase (LacZAngiography showed significant progression of LCx stenosis in both groups during the treatment period. Left ventricular wall thickening (LVWT) at the LCx area in gated 99mTc SPECT remained unchanged in the VEGF-C group, indicating that VEGF-C prevented progression of myocardial ischemia, whereas LVWT deteriorated in the LacZ group (p = 0.042). Semi-quantitative assessment of 18FDG PET suggests more reduction in ischemia in the adVEGF-C group than in controls (p = 0.052). Angiography showed significant clustering of collaterals in the adVEGF-C gene transfer area compared that in LacZ (p = 0.004). von Willebrand factor staining revealed a significantly (p = 0.03) greater number of microvessels in the adVEGF-C-treated myocardium.This appears to be the first large-animal study in which, during progressive ischemia, functional and metabolic benefits of intramyocardial VEGF-C gene transfer were apparent. VEGF-C-induced collateral formation occurred at the site of gene transfer. The angiogenic potency of VEGF-C deserves further study as a therapeutic option.
