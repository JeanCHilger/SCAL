Relative volume-average murine tumor blood flow measurement via deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A deuterium NMR spectroscopic method to determine relative tumor blood flow (TBF) by measuring the increase in tumor HOD concentration after intravenous injection of 100 microliters D2O (0.9% NaCl) is presented. An integration approach analogous to that validated for positron emission tomographic measurement of cerebral blood flow was implemented. Computer simulations indicated that integration from 30 to 120 s minimizes the sensitivity of the uptake integral to the shape of the arterial input function, which cannot be assessed in each mouse, while maintaining both a nearly linear relationship between TBF and the integral and high NMR signal-to-noise. A strong positive linear correlation was observed between the uptake integral and TBF measured by D2O clearance in both untreated tumors (n = 19 P less than 0.001) and tumors after hyperthermia (n = 16
