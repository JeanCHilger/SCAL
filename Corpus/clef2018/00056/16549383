Does cardiac metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake in Parkinson's disease correlate with major autonomic symptoms? To compare MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) uptake between Parkinson's disease patients with and without autonomic symptoms to investigate meanings of MIBG scintigraphy and correlations between autonomic symptoms and MIBG uptake.Forty consecutive patients with Hoehn-Yahr III or IV Parkinson's disease and 12 controls were enrolled. We compared cardiac MIBG uptake between patients with and without orthostatic hypotension. Similar comparisons were performed for constipation and bladder dysfunction.MIBG uptake did not significantly correlate with age, disease duration, Hoehn-Yahr stage, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score or levodopa equivalent daily doses. There were no significant correlations between orthostatic hypotension/constipation and cardiac MIBG uptake. Only bladder symptoms significantly correlated with MIBG uptake.Meanings of MIBG uptake abnormalities in Parkinson's disease and relationship between MIBG uptake and clinical parameters remain to be resolved in future studies.
