Microwave-enhanced nucleophilic fluorination in the synthesis of fluoropyridyl derivatives of [3,2-c]pyrazolo-corticosteroids, potential glucocorticoid receptor-mediated imaging agents. Fluoropyridyl derivatives of [3,2-c]pyrazolo-corticosteroids have high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and are highly active glucocorticoids. They are thus considered to be excellent candidates for PET imaging of GR containing tissues when labeled with fluorine-18 (t(1/2)=110 min). Previously reported syntheses of these fluorinated glucocorticoids were accomplished by conventional thermal nucleophilic halogen exchange reactions with chloropyridyl precursors. These reactions were found to proceed at rates too slow for feasible application to radiosynthesis using [(18)F]fluoride. We have applied microwave-heating methods to these reactions and found that significant rate enhancements can be realized. Kinetic experiments showed an average relative rate ratio of 3/1 for microwave versus conventional heating and preparative experiments showed an average relative conversion ratio of 4.5/1 during the initial 120 min, a period approximating one half-life of the isotope. The microwave method described was used to prepare previously unreported 2'-(2-fluoro-4-pyridyl)-11beta,17,21-trihydroxy-16alpha-methyl-20-oxo-pregn-4-eno-[3,2-c]-pyrazole, which was evaluated for biological activity.
