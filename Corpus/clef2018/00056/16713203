Brain imaging tools in neurosciences. In this chapter brain imaging tools in neurosciences are presented. These include a brief overview on single-photon emission tomography (SPET) and a detailed focus on positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In addition, a critical discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of the three diagnostic systems is added. Furthermore, this article describes the image analysis tools from visual analysis over region-of-interest technique up to statistical parametric mapping, co-registration methods, and network analysis. It also compares the newly developed combined PET/CT scanner approach with established image fusion software approaches. There is rapid change: Better scanner qualities, new software packages and scanner concepts are on the road paved for an amply bright future in neurosciences.
