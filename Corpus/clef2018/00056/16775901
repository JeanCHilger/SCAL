Immediate- and short-term outcome following recanalization of long chronic total occlusions (> 50 mm) of native coronary arteries with the Frontrunner catheter. Thirty percent of diagnostic angiograms have at least 1 chronic total occlusion (CTO). The 10-year survival of patients with a CTO is improved if they have the CTO successfully recanalized. The success of recanalization with conventional wires is 50% and the impact of new technology on recanalization is unknown. This abstract reports a single center experience with one such new device, the Lumend Frontrunner catheter in revascularization of this difficult lesion subset. A consecutive series of 18 patients with CTO's of native coronary arteries were enrolled in this single center, single operator series. The mean age of the CTO was 5.3 years. The indication for attempt at recanalization was ischemia in the territory of the CTO on SPECT imaging. Success was defined as TIMI flow restoration and < 40% residual stenosis. Primary success (defined as TIMI 3 Flow restoration and < 40% residual stenosis) was achieved in 77% of patients. At 30 days and out to 6 months, clinical TVR was 11% (2/18) in this difficult lesion subset. Conventional predictors of failure to recanalize CTOs do not appear to hold true with the use of the Frontrunner catheter. In this small series, dual cusp injections and use of the Microglide catheter appears to correlate with favorable outcomes. Fluoroscopy times and contrast use are high when attempting recanalization of CTOs with this technology.
