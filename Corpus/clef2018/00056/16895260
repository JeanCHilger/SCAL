A preliminary fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography study in healthy adults reporting dream-enactment behavior. To test the hypothesis that healthy adults reporting dream-enactment behavior (DEB+) have reduced cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) in regions preferentially affected in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).Automated brain-mapping algorithms were used to compare regional fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) measurements from previously evaluated DEB cases and controls.Tertiary-care academic medical centers.Seventeen cognitively normal patients with DEB+ and 17 control subjects (DEB-) who were individually matched for age (59 +/- 11 years), education level (16 +/- 4 years), sex (67% women), body mass index (26 +/- 4.8 kg/m2), first-degree relative with dementia (85%), and proportion of apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 carriers (13 e4 carriers, 4 noncarriers).FDG-PET.DEB was associated with significantly lower CMRgl in several brain regions known to be preferentially affected in both DLB and Alzheimer disease (parietal, temporal, and posterior cingulate cortexes) and in several other regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (p < .001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons). The DEB-associated CMRgl reductions were significantly greater in the APOE e4 noncarriers than in the carriers.These preliminary findings suggest that cognitively normal persons with DEB have reduced CMRgl in brain regions known to be metabolically affected by DLB, supporting further study of DEB as a possible risk factor for the development of DLB.
