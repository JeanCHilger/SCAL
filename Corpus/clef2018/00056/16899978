Stereotactic imaging for radiosurgery: localization accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography compared with computed tomography. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) provide complementary information for treatment planning in stereotactic radiosurgery. We evaluated the localization accuracy of MRI and PET compared with CT. Two kinds of phantoms applicable to the Leksell G stereotactic skull frame (Elekta, Tokyo) were developed. Deviations of measured coordinates at target points (x = 50, 100, 150 y = 50, 100, 150) were determined on different axial planes (z = 30-140 for MRI and CT study and Z = 50-120 for PET and CT study). For MRI, the deviations were no more than 0.8 mm in each direction. For PET, the deviations were no more than 2.7 mm. For both imaging modalities studied, accuracy was at or below the imaging resolution (pixel size) and should be considered useful for clinical stereotactic planning purposes.
