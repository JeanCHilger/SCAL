Synthesis of carbon-11 labeled sulfonanilide analogues as new potential PET agents for imaging of aromatase in breast cancer. Aromatase is a particularly good target in the treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. Novel carbon-11 labeled sulfonanilide analogues, N-[11C]methyl-N-(2-alkyloxy-4-nitrophenyl)-methanesulfonamides ([11C]3a-f, alkyl=propyl, isopropyl, 1-ethyl-propyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and cyclohexylethyl), were designed and synthesized as potential PET agents for imaging of aromatase in breast cancer.
