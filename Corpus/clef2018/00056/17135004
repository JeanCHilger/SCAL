Assessment of takotsubo (ampulla) cardiomyopathy using iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. To evaluate the role of cardiac sympathetic innervation in patients whose clinical features consisted of chest pain, transient ST-segment elevation, left ventricular apical akinesis, minimal elevation of cardiac enzymes, and onset of symptoms shortly after a severe stress condition.Five female patients, mean age 67+/-14 years, underwent thoracic 123I-MIBG (planar and SPECT) and 67Ga citrate (planar) scans within 5 days after the onset of symptoms. The 123I-MIBG myocardial washout rate between early (30 min) and delayed (3 hours) planar images was calculated. All patients presented findings consistent with takotsubo-like syndrome. Echocardiograms showed the characteristic wall motion pattern of significant apical dysfunction. Acute-phase coronary angiographies revealed a non-obstructive pattern. A peculiar apical akinesis and basal normokinesis were observed on the ventriculograms.Impairment of cardiac neuronal uptake of 123I-MIBG based on a reduction of the heart-to-mediastinum uptake ratio was observed in all patients, while the washout rate was raised in four patients. All patients presented an apical uptake defect in the 123I-MIBG SPECT and planar images and a normal 67Ga scintigraphy.Our data indicate that ampulla cardiomyopathy (AC) is associated with a cardiac sympathetic innervation deficit characterized by a reduced global 123I-MIBG uptake and an apical uptake defect. The lack of 67Ga uptake in the acute phase of this syndrome indicates that AC is probably not associated with an inflammatory process.
