Dipole source localisation using independent component analysis: single trial localisation of laser evoked pain. The accuracy of the inverse solution that finds the spatial location of the generating sources from averaged scalp-recorded event related potentials (ERPs) relies on assumptions about the ERP signals and the sources. We provide evidence that using independent component analysis (ICA) as a signal decomposition filter prior to applying the inverse solution reveals sources that cannot be detected by conventional source localisation methods. Five clusters of sources emerged: a single source cluster in caudal cingulate and bilateral sources in secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), inferior parietal cortex, premotor cortex and insular cortex. The locations of the source dipoles were consistent with findings using fMRI and PET but have not all been previously detected in a single electrophysiological study. In addition, the time-course of the activation of these dipoles was estimated. The results suggest that using ICA to localise single trial data is a powerful tool for exploring the spatiotemporal dynamics of rapid and complex brain processes.
