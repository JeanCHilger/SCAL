Cerebral mechanisms and voiding function. Some of the most recent work investigating the cerebral mechanisms involved in bladder control has been very helpful in adding to our understanding of bladder dysfunction. The group behind this work, from London, presents a mini-review which will help to update our knowledge in this area. Authors from Australia present a review describing the interactions between bone and prostate cancer cells in metastatic disease. This area has generated much interest and is something for which we should develop a full understanding, to optimise our treatments for this condition.
