Analysis on the factors related to rabies epidemic in China, in 2005. To analyse the related epidemic factors of rabies and to provide basic evidence for developing rabies control and prevention programs in China.Possible factors that causing rabies epidemics in the southern part of China were obtained through collecting both epidemic and surveillance data of rabies in 2005, and to analyse every factor by software of Excel 2002.The number of rabies cases was 2548 in 2005. Among 885 cases being investigated, 60.56%, 49.04%, 96.16% had not had any chance to receive treatment, vaccine or immunoglobulin. Among the exposed persons, 89.95% received treatment on wounds and 94.93% were immunized, and 8.56% received immunoglobulin. 94.86% of them accomplished the full rabies post-exposure prophylaxis course, but 8.56% of them did not accomplish it. 88.50% of the cases and 92% of the persons under exposure were bitten by dogs. The density of dogs was 3.20-13.37 per 100 persons. The vaccination coverage rates among dogs were 5.31% -75.11% with a positive rate of 2.93 % -6.40%.Factors as: low rate of post-exposure prophylaxis and failed to have finished the necessary post-exposure treatment (PET) of the cases, nonstandard PET in hospital or local clinic, low rabies vaccination coverage and high infectivity of rabies virus in animal host (mainly for dog) might be responsible for rabies epidemics in China, in 2005.
