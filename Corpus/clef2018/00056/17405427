Tomographic reconstruction of dynamic cardiac image sequences. In this paper, we propose an approach for the reconstruction of dynamic images from a gated cardiac data acquisition. The goal is to obtain an image sequence that can show simultaneously both cardiac motion and time-varying image activities. To account for the cardiac motion, the cardiac cycle is divided into a number of gate intervals, and a time-varying image function is reconstructed for each gate. In addition, to cope with the under-determined nature of the problem, the time evolution at each pixel is modeled by a B-spline function. The dynamic images for the different gates are then jointly determined using maximum a posteriori estimation, in which a motion-compensated smoothing prior is introduced to exploit the similarity among the different gates. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using a dynamic version of the 4-D gated mathematical cardiac torso phantom simulating a gated single photon emission computed tomography perfusion acquisition with Technitium-99m labeled Teboroxime. We thoroughly evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm using several quantitative measures, including signal-to-noise ratio analysis, bias-variance plot, and time activity curves. Our results demonstrate that the proposed joint reconstruction approach can improve significantly the accuracy of the reconstruction.
