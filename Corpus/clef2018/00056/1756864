2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-D-galactose protein N-glycosylation. 2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-D-galactose (dGalF), added to the medium of primary cultured rat hepatocytes, inhibited N-glycosylation of membrane (gp 120) and secretory glycoproteins (alpha 1-macroglobulin) in a concentration-dependent manner. Complete inhibition of N-glycosylation was achieved at concentrations of 1 mM and above. At identical concentrations, 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (dGlcF) caused only incomplete inhibition of N-glycosylation. dGalF reduced incorporation of D-[2,6-3H]mannose into lipid-linked oligosaccharides indicating interference with their assembly in the dolichol cycle.
