Discordant MRI/FDG-PET imaging for the diagnosis of borderline ovarian tumors. The objective of this study was to assess the role of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for the characterization of ovarian masses that were diagnosed as ovarian malignancies by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We performed a retrospective review of eight patients with pathologically confirmed borderline ovarian tumors (BOT) who underwent MRI and FDG-PET before surgical staging from August 2005 to March 2007. We assessed the PET imaging of the BOT, measured the FDG uptake and quantified the findings as a standardized uptake value (SUV). The FDG-PET scans, of all eight patients, showed uptake of FDG with a mean SUV of less than 2.0 in the solid portion of the masses evaluated. We conclude that the MRI-PET differences may help differentiate borderline from malignant ovarian tumors.
