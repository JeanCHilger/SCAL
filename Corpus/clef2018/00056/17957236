Movies of dopamine transporter occupancy with ultra-high resolution focusing pinhole SPECT. A pivotal question in neuropharmacology is how the function of neurotransmitter systems relates to psychiatric diseases. In experimental neuropharmacology, we have dreamt about a looking glass that would allow us to see neurotransmitter systems in action, and about animals that would faithfully serve us as models for human psychiatric disease. Analysis of animal models has been limited by the availability of methods to study in vivo neurotransmitter dynamics. Now, a single photon emission computed tomography system called U-SPECT can localize dopamine transporters in sub-compartments of the mouse brain during a range of points in time. Applied to the midbrain dopamine system of different models of disease, this will aid the understanding of dynamic processes of this neurotransmitter that underlie brain functions and human brain pathology.
