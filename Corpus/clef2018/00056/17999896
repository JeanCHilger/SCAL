Update on epilepsy and cerebral localization. The field of epilepsy has contributed significantly to localization of neurologic function, particularly in the neocortex. Methodologies such as cortical stimulation, positron emission tomography, functional MRI, trans-cranial magnetic stimulation, surgical resection, and magnetoencephalography have been used successfully in patients with epilepsy to locate specific functions, primarily for the purpose of defining eloquent cortex before surgical resections. The left hemisphere serves language-related functions and verbal memory in most people, whereas the right hemisphere serves some language function in addition to perceiving most components of music and other forms of nonverbal material. Both hemispheres cooperate in understanding spatial relationships. Studies in patients with developmental abnormalities have enriched our understanding of localization of function within the cortex. Future studies may help us understand the sequence in which specific regions are activated during specific tasks and determine which regions are necessary for tasks and which are supplementary. The ability to predict preoperatively the effect of removal of specific tissues would benefit surgical planning for all patients who undergo cortical resections, including those with epilepsy.
