Feasibility of whole-body MR with T2- and T1-weighted real-time steady-state free precession sequences during continuous table movement to depict metastases. The purpose of the study was to prospectively evaluate a whole-body magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol to help depict metastases by using unenhanced T2-weighted and contrast material-enhanced T1-weighted real-time sequences during continuous table movement. The study was conducted after approval of the local institutional review board and written informed consent were obtained. In 11 patients with positron emission tomographic (PET) scans positive for tumors and known metastases, whole-body MR imaging, including T2- and T1-weighted sequences, was performed before and after contrast material administration. A high-precision laser position sensor was used to register the table position for off-line multiplanar reformations of the acquired transverse whole-body data sets. Seventy-three of 75 metastases detected by using PET/computed tomography were correctly diagnosed by using MR imaging. Metastases with a diameter exceeding 5 mm could be visualized in all anatomic regions.
