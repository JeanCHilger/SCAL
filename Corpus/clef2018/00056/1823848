131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine therapy in medullary thyroid cancer: Guy's Hospital experienc. [131I]Metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) was utilized in the therapy of seven patients with medullary thyroid cancer. Treatment doses ranged from 3.7 to 11 GBq, for upto four total treatments. Six of the seven patients treated showed some response to treatment (from transient partial response to symptom palliation). Treatment was tolerated well in all patients, with minimal side-effects and no signs of hematologic radiotoxicity. These encouraging results emphasize the potential of 131I-MIBG as a form of targetted radiometabolic therapy in patients with medullary thyroid cancer.
