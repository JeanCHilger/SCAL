The role of [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine in the treatment of medullary thyroid carcinoma: results in five cases. Therapeutic doses of [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) were administered to 5 patients, 3 men and 2 women aged from 33 to 66 years, with proven medullary thyroid carcinoma (one "intermediate" papillary/medullary tumor). The treatment procedure consisted of single doses (3.7-8.5 GBq) of 131I-MIBG given by slow i.v. infusion at 2-8 month intervals. In two advanced-stage patients the treatment played an important palliative role, ranging from an objective response (substantial, but not complete, regression of the tumor) to pain relief which was significant for these patients. In three other cases with residual/recurrent tumor, 131I-MIBG complemented conventional treatment in the attempt to effect a cure which actually was achieved in one case. The only side-effect observed was a transient, mild hematologic toxicity in some cases.
