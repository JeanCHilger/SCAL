Quantification of liver perfusion with [(15)O]H(2)O-PET and its relationship with glucose metabolism and substrate levels. Hepatic perfusion plays an important role in liver physiology and disease. This study was undertaken to (a) validate the use of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and oxygen-15-labeled water ([(15)O]H(2)O) to quantify hepatic and portal perfusion, and (b) examine relationships between portal perfusion and liver glucose and lipid metabolism.Liver [(15)O]H(2)O-PET images were obtained in 14 pigs during fasting or hyperinsulinemia. Carotid arterial and portal venous blood were sampled for [(15)O]H(2)O activity Doppler ultrasonography was used invasively as the reference method. A single arterial input compartment model was developed to estimate portal tracer kinetics and liver perfusion. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) and insulin-mediated whole body glucose uptake (wbGU) were determined by standard methods.Hepatic arterial and portal venous perfusions were 0.15+/-0.07 and 1.11+/-0.34 ml/min/ml of tissue, respectively. The agreement between ultrasonography and [(15)O]H(2)O-PET was good for total and portal liver perfusion, and poor for arterial perfusion. Portal perfusion was correlated with EGP (r=or+0.62, p=0.03), triglyceride (r=or+0.66, p=0.01), free fatty acid levels (r=or+0.76, p=0.003), and plasma lactate levels (r=or-0.81, p=0.0009).Estimates of liver perfusion by [(15)O]H(2)O-PET compared well with those by ultrasonography. The method allowed to predict portal tracer concentrations which is essential in human studies. Portal perfusion may affect liver nutrient handling.
