Fluid therapy: options and rational administration. Fluid administration is a primary component of therapy in many small animal patients. Several different classes of fluid may be given, and there are multiple options within each class. The type, route, volume, and rate of fluid administered should be tailored to the patient's signalment, disease or injury state, and response to the administration of fluids. Monitoring vital parameters and bedside monitoring of laboratory variables allow assessment of fluid therapy success or failure. Successful fluid administration also requires that parenteral fluid therapy ultimately be discontinued with minimal adverse effects for the patient.
