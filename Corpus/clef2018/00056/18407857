Effect of loading a plate with different liquids on the propagation of lamb-like waves studied by laser ultrasonics. Three experimental laser ultrasonic configurations--line excitation with scanning detection, grating excitation with single point detection, and grating excitation with scanning probe beam--are shown to consistently reveal the modified propagation properties of Lamb waves on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film that is in contact with different liquids on its two sides. Theoretical predictions concerning the physical nature of different wave modes in symmetric and asymmetric film loading configurations (i.e., their existence, velocity, damping, and polarization) are confirmed by the experimental results.
