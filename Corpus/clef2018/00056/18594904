Sentinel node detection in patients with thyroid carcinoma: a meta-analysis. This study was designed to review the diagnostic performance of sentinel node (SN) detection for assessment of the nodal status in thyroid carcinoma patients and to determine the technique (using blue dye or Technetium-99m colloid (99mTc) that demonstrated the highest success rate with regard to the detection rate and sensitivity.A comprehensive computer literature search of studies published in English language through December 2007 and regarding SN procedures in patients with thyroid disorders was performed in MEDLINE. Pooled values regarding the SN detection rate and the pooled sensitivity values of the SN procedure were presented with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the different SN detection techniques.Ultimately, we identified 14 studies comprising a total of 457 patients. Of these, ten studies (n = 329 patients) used the blue dye technique with a pooled SN detection of 83% (95% CI, 79-87%). The remaining four studies (n = 128) used 99mTc-colloid with a pooled SN detection of 96% (95% CI, 91-99% p < 0.05 vs. blue dye technique).In patients with suspected thyroid carcinoma, SN biopsy demonstrated a higher SN detection rate when 99mTc was used (96%) instead of the blue dye technique (83%).
