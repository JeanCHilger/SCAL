Cross-sectional evaluation of thoracic lymphoma. In patients who have lymphoma, the presence and distribution of thoracic involvement is important in both tumor staging and treatment. Thoracic involvement in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is more common than in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In HL, mediastinal lymphadenopathy with contiguous spread is a hallmark, and lung parenchymal involvement at the initial presentation is almost always associated with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. NHL is more heterogeneous and generally presents at a more advanced stage than HL. Most often, mediastinal involvement occurs as a disseminated or recurrent form of extrathoracic lymphoma. Bulky mediastinal disease with compression of adjacent structures can occur, particularly with high-grade subtypes of NHL and isolated lung disease without mediastinal lymphadenopathy can occur in contrast to HL.
