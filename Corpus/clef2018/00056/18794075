The Translational Research Working Group developmental pathway for image-based assessment modalities. The Image-based assessment modality (IM) pathway refers to one of six Translational Research Working Group (TRWG) pathways that, together, describe the core domains of early translational cancer research. This pathway focuses on approaches that are based on the interaction of energy and living organisms to analyze tissue noninvasively so as to reveal properties relevant to the detection, diagnosis, or prognosis of cancer and precancer or the response of the cancer to therapy. Examples include, but are not limited to, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, as well as contemporary contrast agents designed to probe specific molecular constituents of tumors. The IM pathway is presented as a general outline of the steps required for the effective development, optimization, testing, and validation of image-based modalities. The distinctive features of the IM pathway and issues encountered that represent obstacles to effective and efficient progress through the pathway are discussed. The IM pathway also forms a framework to identify opportunities to address current barriers and is expected to adapt and evolve as the field advances.
