Cardiac parasympathetic dysfunction concurrent with cardiac sympathetic denervation in Parkinson's disease. We aimed to characterize the relationship between cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction employing cardiac (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake and other autonomic function parameters in Parkinson's disease (PD). 79 PD patients were studied. We performed (123)I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy to assess the extent of cardiac sympathetic denervation. Electrocardiogram readings at rest and postural change in blood pressure were also examined. Coefficient variation of RR intervals (CVR-R) was used as an index for cardiac parasympathetic activity. Cardiac (123)I-MIBG uptake did not vary significantly among the Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) stages. There was a significant correlation between cardiac (123)I-MIBG uptake and CVR-R (early, r=0.457, p<0.001 late, r=0.442, p<0.001). While the correlation was present among the patients who had had the disease less than two years (early, r=0.558, p<0.001
