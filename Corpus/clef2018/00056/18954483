Regional cerebral blood flow correlates of visuospatial tasks in Alzheimer's disease. This study investigated the role of visuospatial tasks in identifying cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), by correlating neuropsychological performance with cerebral perfusion measures. There were 157 participants: 29 neurologically healthy controls (age: 70.3 +/- 6.6, MMSE > or = 27), 86 patients with mild AD (age: 69.18 +/- 8.28, MMSE > or = 21) and 42 patients moderate/severe AD (age: 68.86 +/- 10.69, MMSE 8-20). Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) was used to derive regional perfusion ratios, and correlated using partial least squares (PLS) with neuropsychological test scores from the Benton Line Orientation (BLO) and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (RO). Cross-sectional analysis demonstrated that mean scores differed in accordance with disease status: control group (BLO 25.5, RO 33.3) mild AD (BLO 20.1, RO 25.5)
