Motion correction in respiratory gated cardiac PET/CT using multi-scale optical flow. Respiratory motion is a source of degradation in positron emission tomography. As the patients cannot hold breath during the PET acquisition, spatial blurring and motion artifacts are unavoidable which may lead to wrong quantification of the data. A solution based on respiratory-gating and optical flow based correction of the PET data is proposed. This includes deformation of the CT data for accurate attenuation and listmode based reconstruction. All methods are applied to real patient data and are evaluated with respect to three criteria.
