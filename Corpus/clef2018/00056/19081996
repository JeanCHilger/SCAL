Nitroxyl radicals as low toxic spin-labels for non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging of blood-brain barrier permeability for conventional therapeutics. The present study describes a novel non-radioactive methodology for in vivo non-invasive, real-time imaging of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability for conventional drugs, using nitroxyl radicals as spin-labels and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
