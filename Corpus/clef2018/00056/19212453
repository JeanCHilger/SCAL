Expanding SimSET to include block detectors: performance with pseudo-blocks and a true block model. We present a study that introduces two approaches to implementing block detectors into SimSET and compares their performance. SimSET is a photon tracking simulation package, which currently incorporates only detectors made of a solid annulus of scinitillator material. A pseudo-block approximation has been imposed on the solid annulus of conventional SimSET by discarding interactions in annulus segments that span the angular block gap. This yields blocks that are annulus segments, not rectangles. This is a quick and easy approximation of block structure, which brings SimSET results closer to actual scanner measurements. Even better agreement is expected with a deeper modification of the SimSET code that implements true rectangular blocks in the detector module (to be released late 2007/early 2008). This approach enables the greatest amount of variability and trueness to detail.We compare results from both block structure implementations to the conventional SimSET results and to measurements from a GE DSTE PET/CT scanner. Differences are evaluated in terms of sensitivities, crystal maps, and energy spectra, as well as in benchmark time tests of the simulation runs and their ease of use.Either implementation of block structure can aid in improving simulation accuracy by ameliorating one known cause of discrepancies, the geometric nature of the block detectors.
