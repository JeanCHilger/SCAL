Ocular teratogens: old acquaintances and new dangers. Recent research into animal studies has contributed significantly to understanding the pathophysiology of some well-known teratogens, such as alcohol. Techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and retinal synaptogenesis studies, have helped determine the specific areas in the developing brain and ocular structures, which are targeted by various teratogens. In this article, we also highlight a few newer agents, such as benzodiazepines, with potential for ocular malformation and morbidity in the developing foetus.
