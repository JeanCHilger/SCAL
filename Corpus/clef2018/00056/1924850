Local tissue air ratio in an anatomic phantom for 60Co total body irradiation. Tissue-air ratio (TAR), as the basic dosimetric function, is not ideally applicable to all important locations in total body irradiation (TBI) dosimetry because it generally refers to central ray measurements. We therefore introduced the local TAR which depends on the specific distribution of the scattering centres around the location of interest. Local TAR measurements were performed in an anatomic water phantom, produced by a sculptor, representing a patient during TBI in the real treatment position. A comparison has been made between TAR values, defined on the beam's ray at different locations in the anatomic phantom and cubic phantoms of different size. The local TAR values in the anatomic phantom, having more realistic outer surface curvatures, are lower by a few percent in most locations. We consider these values more accurate and better applicable to TBI conditions than those obtained in cubic water phantoms, even if the volume of the phantom is adapted to the particular side of the body.
