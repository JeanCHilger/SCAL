Use of radionuclides in cancer research and treatment. Cancer occurs as a result of misregulation of cell growth, which appears to be a consequence of alteration in the function of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. Ionising radiation has been used, since the discovery of X-rays in 1896 by Roentgen, both in cancer research and treatment of the disease. The main purpose of cancer research is to understand the molecular alterations involved in the development and progression of the disease in order to improve diagnosis and develop personalised therapies, by focusing on the features of the tumoral cell and the biological events associated to carcinogenesis. Radioisotopic techniques have been used routinely for in vitro research in the molecular and cellular biology of cancer for more than 20 years and are in the process of being substituted by alternative non-radioactive techniques. However in vivo techniques such as irradiation of cells in culture and/or experimental animal models and radioactive labelling are in development, due in part to advances in molecular imaging technologies. The objective of this review is to analyse in an integrative way the applications of ionising radiation in cancer research and therapy. It had been divided into two parts. The first one will approach the techniques applied to cancer research and the second will summarise how ionising radiation is applied to the treatment of neoplastic disease.
