Nutrition and behavior of striped skunks. Skunks are an integral part of the environment and a fascinating component of the earth's biodiversity. Their behavioral idiosyncrasies, made possible by their unique method of defense, make them entertaining to watch in the wild, and their beneficial habits far outweigh any potential negative attributes. Striped skunks can be a benefit in urban and agricultural areas because they prey on harmful and damaging insects and rodents that plague gardens and crops. The general public should be encouraged to live in harmony with skunks, as opposed to viewing them as nuisances. Keeping captive or pet skunks should be considered only after feeding, care, disease, and legal information has been investigated.
