Neuroinflammation extends brain tissue at risk to vital peri-infarct tissue: a double tracer [11C]PK11195- and [18F]FDG-PET study. Focal cerebral ischemia elicits strong inflammatory responses involving activation of resident microglia and recruitment of monocytes/macrophages. These cells express peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) and can be visualized by positron emission tomography (PET) using [(11)C]PK11195 that selectively binds to PBRs. Earlier research suggests that transient ischemia in rats induces increased [(11)C]PK11195 binding within the infarct core. In this study, we investigated the expression of PBRs during permanent ischemia in rats. Permanent cerebral ischemia was induced by injection of macrospheres into the middle cerebral artery. Multimodal imaging 7 days after ischemia comprised (1) magnetic resonance imaging that assessed the extent of infarcts (2) [(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG)-PET characterizing cerebral glucose transport and metabolism
