Baseline patterns of bone scintigraphy in patients with established post-poliomyelitis paralysis. Post-poliomyelitis syndrome causes variable musculoskeletal manifestations including pain, muscle weakness and fatigue. These manifestations are commonly secondary to overuse and misuse of muscles and joints and could follow a fall. Bone scan can be useful in determining the underlying cause and follow-up. The objective of this study was to describe the late scintigraphic patterns on bone scan following poliomyelitis.Bone scans of 8 adult patients (7 female and 1 male), aged 35 to 53 years, who were known to have paralytic poliomyelitis, were retrospectively studied. Six patients had unilateral while 1 had bilateral disease. All patients had three-phase bone scan and 5 had SPECT study as well. Studies were reviewed by two qualified nuclear medicine physicians and findings were recorded and analyzed.Several patterns were consistently identified: decreased blood pool activity in the affected lower limb of all patients deformed ipsilateral hemi-pelvis with reduced uptake on the affected side in all patients with unilateral diseaseScintigraphic patterns on bone scan associated with the post-poliomyelitis syndrome and persistent weakness following a distant episode of poliomyelitis have been described. Awareness of these characteristic scintigraphic findings may facilitate an accurate diagnosis and lead to more appropriate patient management.
