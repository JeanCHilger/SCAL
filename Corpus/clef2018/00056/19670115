The role of positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the diagnosis of pleural diseases. The aim of the study was to assess the role of F-18 fluoro-2-D-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( (18)FDG-PET)/computed tomography (CT) in patients with undiagnosed pleural diseases and to compare the findings with those of invasive diagnostic procedures.The study included 83 patients with pleural lesions (63 with pleural effusion 20 with pleural thickening) on CT scan performed between November 2005 and December 2007. The study group consisted of 63 males and 20 femalesPostoperative histopathological examination revealed malignancy in 44 cases, 25 of which were malignant mesothelioma the remaining 39 cases were benign. There were no false negative results, but two false positive results (tuberculosis). PET-CT scanning had 100 % sensitivity, 94.8 % specificity and 97.5 % accuracy.Our study suggests that PET-CT may be an effective tool for the differentiation of benign and malignant pleural diseases. We believe that PET/CT may prevent redundant surgical procedures in young patients who are SUVmax negative.
