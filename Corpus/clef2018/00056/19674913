Daunorubicin and doxorubicin inhibit the [(11)C]choline accumulation in cancer cells. We studied how very short (10-40min) incubation with anthracycline derivatives modifies the accumulation of PET tumor-diagnostic radiotracers in cancer cells. The human ovarian A2780 and A2780AD, human B lymphoid JY, human epidermoid KB-3-1 and KB-V-1, and smooth muscle DDT1 MF-2 cells were pre-incubated with daunorubicin and doxorubicin, and the uptake of [(18)F]FDG and [(11)C]choline was measured. Anthracycline treatment decreased remarkably the [(11)C]choline accumulation in a concentration dependent manner, while it did not modify significantly the [(18)F]FDG uptake of the cells.
