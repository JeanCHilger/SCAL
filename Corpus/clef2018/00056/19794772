Three-dimensional fluorescence optical tomography in small-animal imaging using simultaneous positron-emission-tomography priors. We propose three-dimensional fluorescence optical tomography imaging for small animals guided by simultaneous priors from positron emission tomography (PET). Using a sparsity regularization, the target prior from PET images was incorporated into the reconstruction algorithm for optical imaging. The method and algorithms are validated with numerical simulations and a phantom experiment performed on a combined optical-PET scanner based on a conical mirror geometry.
