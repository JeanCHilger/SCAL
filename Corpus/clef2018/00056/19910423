18F-FDOPA: a multiple-target molecule. Although 6-(18)F-fluoro-L-dopa ((18)F-FDOPA) has been available to study the striatal dopaminergic system for more than 2 decades, the full potential of the tracer was not realized before the introduction of (18)F-FDOPA PET and PET/CT to image a variety of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and pancreatic beta-cell hyperplasia. Together with receptor-based imaging, (18)F-FDOPA offers a formerly unforeseen means to assist in the management of NETs and infants with persistent hyperinsulinemic hyperplasia. Institutions with special expertise in surgical, oncologic, and radiologic therapeutic modalities for NETs derive the highest benefit from (18)F-FDOPA PET/CT. (18)F-FDOPA-guided therapy may add to NET control by ensuring maximal cytoreduction.
