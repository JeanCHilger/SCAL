Relative value of magnetic resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance perfusion, and 2-(18F) fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography for detection of recurrence or grade increase in gliomas. In a consecutive series of 26 previously operated patients diagnosed with cerebral glioma, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), 2-((18)F) fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and perfusion MRI (MRP), were performed at follow-up to distinguish recurrence from radiation necrosis, and to identify tumour upgrading. Discrepancy between techniques was observed in 9 cases. The positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV) of each technique to detect the presence of high grade glioma was: MRI, PPV=50% MRS, PPV=91.6%, NPV=100%
