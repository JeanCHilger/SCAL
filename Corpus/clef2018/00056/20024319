An enzymatic route to 5-deoxy-5-[18F]fluoro-D-ribose, a [18F]-fluorinated sugar for PET imaging. An efficient two-step, one-pot, biotransformation involving the fluorinase enzyme is described for the synthesis of 5-deoxy-5-[(18)F]fluororibose, a novel [(18)F]-fluorinated sugar suitable for positron emission tomography (PET) applications.
