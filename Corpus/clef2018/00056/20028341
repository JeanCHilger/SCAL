Clinical, neuroimaging and neurophysiological features in addicts with manganese-ephedrone exposure. To identify biomarkers supporting the clinical diagnosis of manganism in patients several years after exposure to manganese (Mn).Neurophysiological examinations, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single-photon emission computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglycose (FDG) positron emission tomography were performed in four former ephedrone addicts with extrapyramidal symptoms.Peripheral nervous system was not affected. No patients had reduced uptake of (123)I Ioflupane in the striatum. MRI signal intensities were slightly changed in the basal ganglia. All patients showed a widespread, but not uniform, pathological pattern of FDG uptake with changes mainly located to the central part of the brain including the basal ganglia and the surrounding white matter.Presynaptic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway are intact in Mn-induced parkinsonism after prolonged abstinence from ephedrone. The diagnosis is principally based on clinical signs and the history of drug abuse.
