Within-day and between-day variability of blood pressure measurement in healthy conscious Beagle dogs using a new oscillometric device. The main objective of this study was to determine the within- and between-day variability of blood pressure measurement in dogs using an oscillometric device, pet-MAP.Five healthy conscious adult Beagle dogs were used. The dogs were presented in a random order for examinations and the investigators were blinded to the dogs. Blood pressure was measured using a standardized procedure. Three investigators with the same level of experience, trained for 1 h with pet-MAP the day before starting the study, performed 480 blood pressure measurements in 5 healthy conscious dogs on two different days.The within- and between-day CVs for systolic blood pressure were 9.0-10.1% and 12.8-16.4%, respectively. The corresponding SD values were 14.7-16.6 mm Hg and 21.0-27.1 mm Hg respectively. For diastolic blood pressure, the within- and between-day CVs were 10.3-14.4% and 14.2-24.9% respectively. The corresponding SD values were 9.7-13.9 mm Hg and 13.0-24.0 mm Hg.The within- and between-day CVs for systolic blood pressure, measured with pet-MAP by investigators with a minimal period of training, seem to be acceptable in Beagle dogs without hypertension or hypotension. This study suggests that, using this device, one investigator can be replaced by another under the described circumstances.
