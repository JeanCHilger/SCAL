Comparative effects of carvedilol and lercanidipine on ultrafiltration and solute transport in CAPD patients. Peritonitis, the type of buffer used in the dialysate, continue ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) of greater than two years duration, increased exposure to dialysate glucose, diabetes mellitus, and the use of beta blockers may contribute to impaired ultrafiltration.The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of a calcium-channel blocker and a beta-blocker on the peritoneal transport and clearance.We studied 48 patients with ESRD on chronic peritoneal dialysis, included 27 females and 19 males with mean age 42.6 +/- 16.4 years. Two patients were excluded from the study due to peritonitis. Patients were treated either with carvedilol or lercanidipine. In all patients peritoneal equilibration test (PET), ultrafiltration (UF), Kt/V ratio, creatinine clearance (CrCl), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum BUN, creatinine, glucose, sodium, potassium, albumin, cholesterol, and triglyceride values were obtained before and after 8 weeks from the start of the drug treatment.Lercanidipine and carvedilol showed a good antihypertensive effect in CAPD patients. Both drugs had a good tolerability profile and showed no effect on plasma lipids. There were no differences in terms of PET, ultrafiltration, Kt/V ratio, CrCl, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum BUN, creatinine, glucose, sodium, and potassium values between both patient groups. After antihypertensive treatment, neither group showed a difference in the above-mentioned parameters (p > 0.05) except potassium, which was significantly higher in the carvedilol group (p < 0.05).In CAPD patients. short-term usage of carvedilol has no effect on ultrafiltration and solute transport like lercanidipine. Both drugs showed a good antihypertensive effect.
