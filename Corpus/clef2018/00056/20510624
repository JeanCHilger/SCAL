Energy loss straggling of 5.486 MeV alpha-particles in PP, PET and KAPTON polymeric foils. The energy loss straggling for 5.486 MeV alpha-particles, from (241)Am source, in PP (C(3)H(6)), PET (C(10)H(8)O(4)) and KAPTON (C(22)H(10)O(5)N(2)) polymeric foils was measured. These measured values were compared with the most commonly used Bohr, Lindhard & Scharff and Bethe-Livingston formulations with the aim to check the reliability of these formulations. Further, Bethe-Livingston formulation has been suitably modified to make it applicable for thicker targets.
