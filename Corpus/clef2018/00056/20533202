A comparison of attitudes towards animals between the German- and French-speaking part of Switzerland. A comparison of attitudes towards animals between German- and French-speaking Swiss adults is of particular interest, given the often invoked cultural barrier, the <RÃ¶stigraben>. We sent questionnaires to 3000 randomly chosen Swiss adults in both language regions. 319 German and 293 French questionnaires were returned. Participants had to express their opinion regarding 29 statements on nature conservation, wild animals, farm animals, meat eating, animal feelings and cognition, and pets. In 19 items we found a significant difference in responses between the German- and the French-speaking participants. It is important to note that the direction of the responses was identical in all cases, the only difference being the degree of agreement. In general, the Swiss agreed that nature conservation is important. They agreed also that animals have feelings, but that these are different from the feelings of humans. Pets were viewed as beneficial to humans. Both cats and dogs were seen as likeable animals, and there was agreement that dogs need more time to care for than cats. Strays were not viewed as a problem in Switzerland, despite the fact that there are numerous stray cat colonies.
