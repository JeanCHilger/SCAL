 The epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR) are known to play a role in the oncogenic transformation of cells (1). The EGFR is a tyrosine kinase receptor that includes four members, EGFR and three other human EGF receptors (HERs) designated as HER2/ErbB2, HER3/ErbB3, and HER4/ErbB4. The four receptors constitute the HER-kinase axis and regulate cellular responses through complex receptor-ligand interactions. The various signal transduction pathways used by the EGFRs to mediate cell responses have been described by Brandt et al. (2). The various EGFRs are known to be amplified, mutated, or overexpressed in several cancers and are a target for the development of pharmaceutical agents that inhibit the receptor or the signal transduction pathway (3). For this inhibition, a variety of small molecules and antibodies against the EGFRs have been developed (4). However, to achieve therapeutic effects the receptor or signal transduction pathway must be involved in maintenance of the malignant phenotype because HER inhibitor therapy does not necessarily result in treatment of a cancer (5). The use of antibodies alone against EGFR (e.g., Erbitux cetuximab) and HER2 (Herceptin
