Does polycythemia affect interleukin-6 response pattern in early postnatal period? Neonatal polycythemia may result in increased cytokine production. We aimed to investigate whether polycythemia and partial exchange transfusion (PET) affect interleukin-6 (IL-6) response pattern in early neonatal period.Ninety-four newborns, 57 with polycythemia (Group 1) and 37 as control group (Group 2) were enrolled in the study. PET was performed at 4-6 hr following birth in the first group. Blood levels of IL-6 were measured at 2-4 hr following birth measurements were repeated at 6 and 24 hr after PET in newborns with polycythemia and at similar hours in Group 2. In Group 1, two patients (3.5%) who were diagnosed with proven sepsis excluded from the study.Both initial and the last IL-6 levels were higher in Group 1 (21.7 5.5-190 pg/ml and 18.3IL-6 levels seem to be high in newborns with polycythemia during the first days of life, although they rarely exceed maximum acceptable levels. The pattern of IL-6 response might be taken into account to optimize its use in the diagnosis of early-onset neonatal sepsis.
