Principles and basic concepts of molecular imaging. Advanced knowledge in molecular biology and new technological developments in imaging modalities and contrast agents calls for molecular imaging (MI) to play a major role in the near future in many human diseases (Weissleder and Mahmood Radiology 219:316-333, 2001). Imaging systems are providing higher signal-to-noise ratio and higher spatial and/or temporal resolution. New specific contrast agents offer the opportunity to drive new challenges for obtaining functional and biological information on tissue characteristics and tissue processes. All this information could be relevant for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment follow-up and to drive local therapies, enhancing local drug/gene delivery. The recent explosion of all these developments is a radical change of perspective in our imaging community because they could have a tremendous impact on our clinical practice and on teaching programs and they call for a more prominent multidisciplinary approach in this field of research.
