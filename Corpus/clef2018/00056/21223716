Application of SPECT/PET to 70 patients with lymphoma: monitoring response to therapy. To evaluate the image of SPECT/PET (18)F-FDG in monitoring response to therapy for lymphoma patients.A retrospective study was performed in 83 SPECT/PET studies for 70 patients with lymphoma from 1998 to 2008 in our hospital. The risk factors for survival rate were analyzed by univariate analysis.Forty patients received SPECT/PET after 2 - 4 cycles of chemotheraphy, the median PFS in patients with positive and negative group were 5.5 months and 15.5 months, 2-year PFS were 12.5% and 66.8% the median OS were 12.5 months and 17 months, and 1-year OS were 28.8% and 94.1%, respectively, all being of significant difference between two groups (P = 0.003). Forty-three patients performed posttreatment SPECT/PET, the median PFS in patients with positive and negative group were 10 months and 23 months, the 2-year PFS were 23.3% and 83.2%SPECT/PET has significant value in monitoring response to therapy and predicting prognosis for patients with lymphoma.
