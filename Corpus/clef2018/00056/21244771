The clinical impact of a cardiologic follow-up in breast cancer survivors: an observational study. Anthracycline-containing chemotherapy (A-CHT) can induce late cardiotoxicity adding a considerable burden to cardiovascular risk. Irradiation of left breast cancer has also been associated to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this observational study is to prove the usefulness of an accurate cardiovascular evaluation in left breast cancer survivors treated with radiotherapy (RT) and A-CHT. Patients with left breast cancer, on follow-up after treatment with A-CHT plus RT in an adjuvant setting, were eligible for this observational study. Patients underwent cardiovascular assessment with myocardial perfusion imaging. Thirty patients were enrolled in the study: mean age at diagnosis 55.8 years stage: I/III
