Established, emerging and future applications of FDG-PET/CT in the uterine cancer. Integrated positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with 2-[¹⁸F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is a useful technique to acquire both glucose metabolic and anatomic imaging data using a single device in a single diagnostic session and has opened a new field in clinical oncologic imaging. FDG-PET/CT has been used successfully for the staging, optimization of treatment, re-staging, therapy monitoring, and prognostic prediction of uterine cervical cancer and endometrial cancer as well as various malignant tumours. The present review discusses the current role of FDG-PET/CT in the management of uterine cancer, discussing its usefulness and limitations in the imaging of these patients.
