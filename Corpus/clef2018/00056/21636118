Lung imaging in asthmatic patients: the picture is clearer. Imaging of the lungs in patients with asthma has evolved dramatically over the last decade with sophisticated techniques, such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and single photon emission computed tomography. New insights into current and future modalities for imaging in asthmatic patients and their application are discussed to potentially shed a clearer picture of the underlying pathophysiology of asthma, especially severe asthma, and the proposed clinical utility of imaging in patients with this common disease.
