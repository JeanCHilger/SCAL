A triad [FeFe] hydrogenase system for light-driven hydrogen evolution. A novel molecular triad [FeFe]-H(2)ase 1, and its model complexes 2 and 3 have been successfully constructed. The multistep PET and long-lived Fe(i)Fe(0) species were found to be responsible for the better performance of triad 1 than that of 2 with 3 for light-driven H(2) evolution.
