Positron emission mammography: correlation of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status and 18F-FDG. The study objective was to assess the correlation between (18)F-FDG uptake values on positron emission mammography (PEM), expressed as maximum uptake value and lesion-to-background ratio, and receptor status (i.e., estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor [PR], and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]), tumor histology, and tumor grade. We also evaluated for the correlation between maximum uptake value on PEM and maximum uptake value on a whole-body PET/CT.We retrospectively reviewed our database for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer who were referred for PEM between June 2007 and September 2009. A subset of patients also underwent a whole-body PET/CT scan. The original pathology reports were reviewed to establish the histologic type, grade, and receptor status.The study involved 98 patients with 100 lesions. ER-negative tumors and PR-negative tumors had significantly higher mean lesion-to-background ratio than did their respective receptor-positive tumors (p = 0.02). Triple-negative tumors (i.e., ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-negative tumors) had statistically higher mean lesion-to-background ratio than did ER-positive PR-positive HER2-negative tumors (p = 0.04). Infiltrating ductal carcinomas had significantly higher PEM FDG uptake values than did infiltrating lobular carcinomas (p = 0.02-0.04). Breast tumors with higher histologic grade also had significantly higher PEM FDG uptake values than did those with lower grade (p = 0.03 and p < 0.001). A moderately high correlation (0.76-0.79) was seen between whole-body PET/CT and PEM uptake values.This study shows a correlation between PEM FDG uptake values and the prognostic factors that have been shown to predict breast cancer survival.
