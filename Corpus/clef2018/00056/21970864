Fast and efficient fully 3D PET image reconstruction using sparse system matrix factorization with GPU acceleration. Statistically based iterative image reconstruction has been widely used in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The quality of reconstructed images depends on the accuracy of the system matrix that defines the mapping from the image space to the data space. However, an accurate system matrix is often associated with high computation cost and huge storage requirement. In this paper, we present a method to address this problem using sparse matrix factorization and graphics processor unit (GPU) acceleration. We factor the accurate system matrix into three highly sparse matrices: a sinogram blurring matrix, a geometric projection matrix and an image blurring matrix. The geometrical projection matrix is precomputed based on a simple line integral model, while the sinogram and image blurring matrices are estimated from point-source measurements. The resulting factored system matrix has far less nonzero elements than the original system matrix, which substantially reduces the storage and computation cost. The smaller matrix size also allows an efficient implementation of the forward and backward projectors on a GPU, which often has a limited memory space. Our experimental studies show that the proposed method can dramatically reduce the computation cost of high-resolution iterative image reconstruction, while achieving better performance than existing factorization methods.
