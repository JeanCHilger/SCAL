Radiation protection in fixed PET/CT facilities--design and operation. We describe the design of a fixed positron emission tomography (PET)/CT facility and the use of a simulated instantaneous dose-rate plot to visually highlight areas of potentially high radiation exposure. We also illustrate the practical implementation of basic radiation protection principles based on the use of distance and shielding and the minimisation of time spent in hot areas. Staff whole body doses for 4 years are presented with results of an optimisation study analysing the dose arising from the different phases within each study using direct reading dosemeters. The total whole body dose for all staff for each patient fell from 9.5 μSv in the first full year of operation to 4.8 µSv in 2008. The maximum dose to an individual member of staff per patient decreased over the same period from 3.2 to 0.9 µSv. The optimisation study showed that the highest dose was recorded during the injection phase.
