Three-dimensional C-arm computed tomography reformation combined with fluoroscopic-guided sacroplasty for sacral metastases. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate a sacroplasty technique, using three-dimensional C-arm CT reformation combined with fluoroscopic guidance for patients with severe painful sacral metastases. We studied the data of seven patients (average age 55.7 years) treated through trans-sacroiliac joint approach with the technique. Patients with additional thoracolumbar osteolytic metastases (five out of seven) also received concomitant vertebroplasty accordingly. Subjective significant pain relief was reported with visual analogue scale reduction â‰¥4 in all seven patients at 1 month after procedure, six out of seven at 3 months, and five out of six at 6 months. Pain recurrence was reported in two patients at 3 and 6 months follow-up, respectively, associated with their clinical evidence of tumor progression. One patient died from underlying disease unrelated with the procedure. Sacroplasty under three-dimensional C-arm CT reformation combined with fluoroscopic guidance was a feasible, safe, and minimally invasive procedure that could provide both the precise control of needle placement and cement injection with one imaging system.
