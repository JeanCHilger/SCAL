Predicting cetuximab accumulation in KRAS wild-type and KRAS mutant colorectal cancer using 64Cu-labeled cetuximab positron emission tomography. Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is common in colorectal cancer. However, cetuximab as an EGFR-targeting drug is useful only for a subset of patients and currently no single predictor other than V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation status has been established. In the present study, we investigated cetuximab accumulation in colorectal tumors and major organs using (111)In-DOTA-cetuximab. We also evaluated the potential of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of (64)Cu-DOTA-cetuximab. Colorectal tumor xenografts with a different EGFR expression level and KRAS mutation status were subjected to in vivo biodistribution study and PET imaging at 48 h post-injection of radiolabeled cetuximab. The EGFR expression levels on colorectal tumors were determined by ex vivo immunoblotting and ELISA. We found that KRAS wild-type tumors had significantly higher (111)In-DOTA-cetuximab accumulation than KRAS mutant tumors (P < 0.001). Based on KRAS mutation status, a strong correlation was found between (111)In-DOTA-cetuximab tumor uptake and EGFR expression level (KRAS wild type: r = 0.988 KRAS mutant: r = 0.829), and between (64)Cu-DOTA-cetuximab tumor uptake with EGFR expression level (KRAS wild type: r = 0.838
