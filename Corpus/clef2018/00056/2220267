Immunoscintigraphic follow-up studies with the 99m-Tc marked monoclonal anti-CEA antibody BW 431/26. Repeated immunoscintigraphy with murine monoclonal antibodies was performed in only few patients because of developing HAMA (Human Anti Mouse Antibodies) and therefore high risk of allergic reactions. Patients with HAMA, which could be observed in about 26% after immunoscintigraphy, show high liver-spleen uptake of labeled monoclonal antibodies in further examinations in some cases.
