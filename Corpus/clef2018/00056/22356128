Heterologous expression and characterization of an N-acetyl-β-D-hexosaminidase from Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis IL1403. The lnbA gene of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis IL1403 encodes a polypeptide with similarity to lacto-N-biosidases and N-acetyl-β-D-hexosaminidases. The gene was cloned into the expression vector pET-21d and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21* (DE3). The recombinant purified enzyme (LnbA) was a monomer with a molecular weight of approximately 37 kDa. Studies with chromogenic substrates including p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine (pNP-GlcNAc) and p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-D-galactosamine (pNP-GalNAc) showed that the enzyme had both N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase and N-acetyl-β-D-galactosaminidase activity, thus indicating that the enzyme is an N-acetyl-β-D-hexosaminidase. K(m) and k(cat) for pNP-GlcNAc were 2.56 mM and 26.7 s(-1), respectively, whereas kinetic parameters for pNP-GalNAc could not be determined due to the K(m) being very high (>10 mM). The optimal temperature and pH of the enzyme were 37 °C and 5.5, respectively, for both substrates. The half-life of activity at 37 °C and pH 6.0 was 53 h, but activity was completely abolished after 30 min at 50 °C, meaning that the enzyme has relatively low temperature stability. The enzyme was stable in the pH 5.5-8 range and was unstable at pH below 5.5. Studies with natural substrates showed hydrolytic activity on chito-oligosaccharides but not on colloidal chitin or chitosan. Transglycosylation products were not detected. In all, the data suggest that LnbA's role may be to degrade chito-oligosaccharides that are produced by the previously described chitinolytic system of L. lactis.
