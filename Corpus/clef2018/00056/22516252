Tobacco smoking produces greater striatal dopamine release in G-allele carriers with mu opioid receptor A118G polymorphism. To determine if carriers of the allelic expression of the G variant of the human mu opioid receptor (OPRM1) A118G polymorphism have greater increases in striatal dopamine (DA) release after tobacco smoking.Nineteen of 20 genotyped male tobacco smokers, after overnight abstinence, smoked denicotinized (denic) and average nicotine (nic) containing tobacco cigarettes in a PET brain imaging study using [(11)C]raclopride.The right striatum had more free D(2) receptors than the left striatum pre- and post-tobacco smoking. After smoking the nic cigarettes, mean decreased DA binding was observed in the left dorsal caudate (-14 6 11 t=3.77), left and right ventral putamen (-26 3-8This preliminary study indicates a difference in both brain striatal DA release and plasma cortisol in A118G polymorphic male tobacco smokers.
