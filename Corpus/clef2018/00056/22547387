Diagnostic accuracy of dual-time-point 18F-FDG PET/CT for the detection of axillary lymph node metastases in breast cancer patients. The diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET/CT for the detection of axillary lymph node metastases in breast cancer patients acquired 60 min after FDG administration is reported to be only moderate, especially due to low sensitivity.To test whether a delayed scan 90 min after FDG administration could enhance the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET/CT for the detection of axillary lymph node metastases.Thirty-eight women suffering from primary breast cancer (mean age 52 years range 25-78 yearsAxillary lymph nodes had a mean SUVmax of 1.6 (range 0.6-10.8 SD 1.9) at T1 and a mean SUVmax of 1.8 (range 0.5-17.9There is a slight increase of the FDG accumulation of axillary lymph nodes between 60 and 90 min after FDG administration. This increase did not translate into a statistical significant enhancement of the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET/CT for the detection of axillary lymph nodes. Especially due to false-positive results a delayed FDG-PET/CT scan 90 min after FDG administration is not able to enhance the diagnostic accuracy for the detection of lymph node metastases.
