Structural effects on the pH-dependent fluorescence of naphthalenic derivatives and consequences for sensing/switching. Naphthalenic compounds are a rich resource for designers of fluorescent sensing/switching/logic systems. The degree of internal charge transfer (ICT) character in the fluorophore excited states can vary from negligible to substantial. Naphthalene-1,84,5-diimides (11–13), 1,8-naphthalimides (16) and 4-chloro-1,8-naphthalimides (15) are of the former type. The latter type is represented by the 4-alkylamino-1,8-naphthalimides (1). Whether ICT-based or not, these serve as the fluorophore in ‘fluorophore-spacerreceptor’switching systems where PET holds sway until the receptor is bound to H+. On the other hand, 4-dialkylamino-1,8-naphthalimides (3–4) show modest H+-induced fluorescence switching unless the 4-dialkylamino group is a part of a small ring (5). Electrostatic destabilization of a non-emissive twisted internal charge transfer (ICT) excited state is the origin of this behaviour. An evolution to the nonemissive twisted ICT excited state is responsible for the weak emission of the model compound 6 (and related structures 7 and 8) across the pH range. Twisted ICT excited states are also implicated in the switch 9 and its model compound 10, which are based on the 6-dialkylamino-3H-benzimidazo[2,1-a]-benz[d,e]isoquinolin-3-one fluorophore.
