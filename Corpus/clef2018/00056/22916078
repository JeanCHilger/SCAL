Multimodality imaging evaluation of functional and clinical benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with chronic total occlusion lesion. To determine the effects of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on cardiac perfusion, cardiac function, and quality of life in patients with chronic total occlusion (CTO) lesion in left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery.Patients (n=99) with CTO lesion in the LAD coronary artery who had successfully undergone PCI were divided into three groups based on the SPECT/CTCA fusion imaging: (a) no severe cardiac perfusion defects (n=9) (b) reversible cardiac perfusion defects (n=40)PCI exerts functional and clinical benefits in patients with CTO lesion in LAD coronary artery, particularly in patients with reversible cardiac perfusion defects. SPECT/CTCA fusion imaging may serve as a useful tool to evaluate the outcomes of patients with CTO lesion in LAD coronary artery.
