ChIA-PET analysis of transcriptional chromatin interactions. Long-range chromatin contacts between specific DNA regulatory elements play a pivotal role in gene expression regulation, and a global characterization of these interactions in the 3-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure is imperative in understanding signaling networks and cell states. Chromatin Interaction Analysis using Paired-End Tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) is a method which converts functional chromatin structure into millions of short tag sequences. Combining Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP), proximity ligation and high-throughput sequencing, ChIA-PET provides a global and unbiased interrogation of higher-order chromatin structures associated with specific protein factors. Here, we describe the detailed procedures of the ChIA-PET methodology, unraveling transcription-associated chromatin contacts in a model human cell line.
