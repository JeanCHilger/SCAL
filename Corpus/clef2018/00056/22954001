Multimodality imaging of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a review of the literature. Accurate pre-operative imaging in pancreatic cancer helps avoid unsuccessful surgical explorations and forewarns surgeons regarding aberrant anatomy. This review aimed to determine the role of current imaging modalities in the diagnosis and determination of resectability of pancreatic and peri-ampullary adenocarcinomas.A systematic search of the scientific literature was carried out using EMBASE, PubMed/MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for the years 1990 to 2011 to obtain access to all publications, especially randomized controlled trials, reporting on the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography, multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) or positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) and the evaluation of resectability of pancreatic and peri-ampullary adenocarcinomas.Based on 66 articles analysed in the review, MDCT and MRI/MRCP have comparable sensitivity and specificity rates for diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancers. EUS offers the best sensitivity and specificity rates for lesions <2 cm. Improved staging has been noted when PET-CT scans are added to pre-operative evaluation.MDCT with angiography or MRI/MRCP should constitute the first imaging modality in suspected pancreatic adenocarcinomas. EUS is recommended for assessing lesions not clearly detected, but suspected, on CT/MRI and in tumours considered 'borderline resectable' on MDCT to assess vascular involvement. PET-CT in locally advanced lesions will help rule out distant metastases.
