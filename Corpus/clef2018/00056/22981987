Synthesis and preclinical evaluation of the radiolabeled P-glycoprotein inhibitor [(11)C]MC113. With the aim to develop a PET tracer to visualize P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression levels in different organs, the Pgp inhibitor MC113 was labeled with (11)C and evaluated using small-animal PET.[(11)C]MC113 was synthesized by reaction of O-desmethyl MC113 with [(11)C]methyl triflate. Small-animal PET was performed with [(11)C]MC113 in FVB wild-type and Mdr1a/b((-/-)) mice (n=3 per group) and in a mouse model of high (EMT6Ar1.0) and low (EMT6) Pgp expressing tumor grafts (n=5). In the tumor model, PET scans were performed before and after administration of the reference Pgp inhibitor tariquidar (15mg/kg).Brain uptake of [(11)C]MC113, expressed as area under the time-activity curve from time 0 to 60min (AUC(0-60)), was moderately but not significantly increased in Mdr1a/b((-/-)) compared with wild-type mice (mean±SD AUC(0-60), Mdr1a/b((-/-)): 88±7min, wild-type: 62±6min, P=0.100, Mann Whitney test). In the tumor model, AUC(0-60) values were not significantly different between EMT6Ar1.0 and EMT6 tumors. Neither in brain nor in tumors was activity concentration significantly changed in response to tariquidar administration. Half-maximum effect concentrations (IC(50)) for inhibition of Pgp-mediated rhodamine 123 efflux from CCRFvcr1000 cells were 375±60nM for MC113 versus 8.5±2.5nM for tariquidar.[(11)C]MC113 showed higher brain uptake in mice than previously described Pgp PET tracers, suggesting that [(11)C]MC113 was only to a low extent effluxed by Pgp. However, [(11)C]MC113 was found unsuitable to visualize Pgp expression levels presumably due to insufficiently high Pgp binding affinity of MC113 in relation to Pgp densities in brain and tumors.
