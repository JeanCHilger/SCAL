PET assessment of myocardial viability with glucose loading and fasting FDG images. Positron emission tomography (PET) offers the potential capability of evaluating tissue viability. We have studied the changes of myocardial F-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake with glucose loading. In a fasting state (for at least 5 hours) and in a glucose loading state (50 g glucose orally one hour before the study) FDG (74-148 MBq) PET studies were performed for 50-60 minutes in 3 cases. 2 were subjects with anterior myocardial infarction (MI) including one with a ventricular aneurysm (case 1), one with a recent MI (case 2). One was a subject of aortic valvular disease without coronary lesions (case 3). Arterial input function (Ca(t)) and myocardial activity (Cm(t)) were derived from the regions of interest (ROI) on the left atrium and from multiple ROI's circumferentially about the myocardium. Net extraction, FU (Fractional Uptake) = Cm(T)/integral of T0 Ca(t)dt, were calculated. Normal segment (N) showed an increase in FU with glucose loading, but the ischemic segment showed no increase (case 1) or a lower increase (case 2) relative to N. This study shows that the increase in FU with glucose loading suggests the persistence of viable myocardium. In conclusion, myocardial viability may be evaluated by comparing FDG images in a glucose loading state with those in a fasting state.
