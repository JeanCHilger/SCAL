Functional imaging of brain responses to repetitive sensory stimulation: sources estimated from EEG and SPECT. This study examined the effect of modality of stimulation on two measures of cerebral function: (a) the scalp distribution of sensory evoked potentials and (b) the cerebral distribution of radiolabelled HMPAO. Steady-state stimulation in the auditory, somatosensory or visual modality was presented to six subjects. Scalp potentials were measured from a distribution of electrodes, and the radiopharmaceutical was injected through an indwelling intravenous catheter midway through the stimulation/recording session. Equivalent dipole sources estimated from the spatial distribution of the scalp potentials were found to be consistent with regions of high HMPAO uptake as imaged by Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT).
