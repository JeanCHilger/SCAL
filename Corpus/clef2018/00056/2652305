Quantitative SPECT: basic theoretical considerations. Quantitative single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) requires that the reconstructed cross sectional images have accurate intensity values. The major problem with accurate reconstruction is attenuation. Several methods have been proposed to correct for attenuation, but none are entirely satisfactory. This report will review some of the basic concepts of reconstruction, and discuss the problems that are introduced by attenuation.
