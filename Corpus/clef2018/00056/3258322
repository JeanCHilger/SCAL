Anatomical adjustments in brain positron emission tomography using CT images. We have developed a method that allows us to place regions of interest on X-ray CT (XCT) images that are automatically adjusted to positron emission tomography (PET) images from the same patient. A face mask with landmarks was used during PET and XCT studies for matching slice positions between PET and XCT. Anatomical locations in different images of the same slice can be accurately adjusted using the landmarks and a video system. In our clinical experience misadjustments of the slice position are on the average less than 2 mm in axial distance and 1.0 degrees in slice angle. The method is easily applicable to any PET or XCT device.
