Measurement of cerebral blood flow in normal subjects by 133Xenon inhalation and single photon emission computerized tomography. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was studied tomographically in 40 normal volunteers between 25 and 82 years of age in the resting state by single photon emission computerized tomography (Tomomatic 564) accompanied by inhalation of 133Xenon. In order to investigate the reproducibility, five of these received a second examination within 1 hour of the first (group I). Six others received a second examination 7 to 26 days after the first examination (group II). In addition, 123I-IMP SPECT was performed in five out of 40 subjects to compare the difference between 123I-IMP SPECT and 133Xe SPECT. The Tomomatic 564 (Medimatic Inc. Denmark) gives 5 slices of 2 cm thickness simultaneously and its spatial resolution (full width at half maximum, FWHM) as measured with a 133Xenon line source in water was 1.6 cm in the center of each slice. CBF was calculated according to the early picture method and the sequence of picture method described by Kanno and Lassen. Subjects were positioned in the tomograph so that the five transverse sections were located at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 cm above and parallel to the orbito-meatal line (OML). Cerebellar flows were obtained from a slice 1 cm above the OML (slice 1) and mean hemispheric flows were obtained from slices 3 cm (slice 2), 5 cm (slice 3), 7 cm (slice 4) and 9 cm (slice 5) above the OML.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
