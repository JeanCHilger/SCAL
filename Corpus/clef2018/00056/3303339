SPECT instrumentation: performance, lesion detection, and recent innovations. The use of a gamma camera for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging places greater demand on camera performance than does planar imaging, since camera specifications that are adequate for planar imaging may produce serious image artifacts in SPECT. Manufacturers have responded to the challenge with improvements in both hardware and software, but the user must pay careful attention to quality control procedures. Field nonuniformity is caused mainly by spatial distortion, which may vary during rotation some cameras incorporate a means of automatically correcting for angular changes. The purpose of performing SPECT is to improve lesion detection, ie, to improve contrast, which is influenced by many factors. Attenuation corrections may be applied either before or after reconstruction. For Tc-99m an attenuation coefficient less than that for water, ie, either 0.11 or 0.12, would appear to give better results
