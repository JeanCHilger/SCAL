Quantification of myocardial injury produced by temporary coronary artery occlusion and reflow with technetium-99m-pyrophosphate. Previously, technetium-99m-stannous pyrophosphate (99mTc-PPi) has been used to localize and estimate the size of myocardial infarcts in animals after permanent coronary artery occlusion. This study tested the hypothesis that 99mTc-PPi accurately sizes myocardial infarctions produced by temporary coronary artery occlusion and reflow in dogs. Three groups of dogs were studied: group A underwent 3 hr of occlusion followed by 2 hr of reperfusion, with 99mTc-PPi injected 10 min after reflow (n = 10) group B underwent 3 hr of occlusion followed by 2 hr of reperfusion, with 99mTc-PPi injected 90 min after reflow (n = 11)
