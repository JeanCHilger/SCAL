The effect of ring-fluorination on the rate of O-methylation of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) by catechol-O-methyltransferase: significance in the development of 18F-PETT scanning agents. The three ring-fluorinated analogs of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) were synthesized and the kinetics of their O-methylation catalyzed by catechol-O-methyltransferase compared to those of DOPA. The affinities (Km) of 2-FDOPA, 5-FDOPA, DOPA, and 6-FDOPA were 20, 23, 55, and 552 microM, respectively, whilst the Vmax values were 4.0, 4.4, 5.0 and 5.4 nmol per min per mg protein. The importance of the low affinity and decreased rate constant of 6-FDOPA for COMT are discussed with regard to the use of 6-FDOPA as an 18-fluorine labeled probe for positron emission transaxial tomography (PETT).
