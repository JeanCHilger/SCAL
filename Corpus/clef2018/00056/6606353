Noninvasive quantification of jeopardized myocardial mass in dogs using 2-dimensional echocardiography and thallium-201 tomography. The evaluation of jeopardized myocardial mass is important in defining the effect of interventions during myocardial infarction. To quantitate the in vivo mass at risk, 2-dimensional echocardiography (2-D echo) and thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed in 10 closed-chest dogs after circumflex coronary artery occlusion. The 2-D images were manually digitized to compute left ventricular (LV) mass using a modified Simpson's rule algorithm. This measure of LV mass correlated well with the actual LV mass (r = 0.97). Perfused myocardial mass was estimated from thallium SPECT images 4 hours after occlusion using a region-growing algorithm. After the dogs were killed, the jeopardized mass was outlined using a dual perfusion staining technique using triphenyltetrazolium chloride and Evans blue dye. The actual perfused mass was well estimated by the thallium images (r = 0.96). The noninvasively determined mass at risk was calculated as: 2-D mass--thallium SPECT mass, and correlated well with the pathologically determined mass at risk (r = 0.91). Thus, the jeopardized mass may be determined noninvasively by using 2-D echo and thallium-201 tomography. This approach may provide further information regarding the effect of intervention therapy on jeopardized myocardium.
