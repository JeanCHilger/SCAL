Synthesis of C-11 iodoantipyrine for positron emission tomography. We have developed a method for the synthesis of C-11 iodoantipyrine. Carbon-11-labeled methyl iodide, prepared from 11CO2, was used to methylate 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one to form C-11 antipyrine. Following silica-gel column chromatography and iodination, radiochemical purity of the C-11 iodoantipyrine was more than 99.5%, with a 10% yield and a specific activity of 30 mCi/mumol. Preliminary animal studies showed complete cerebral extraction and local cerebral blood-flow values that were within 4.6% of those obtained using C-14 iodoantipyrine. The C-11 analog, with positron emission tomography, will facilitate local cerebral blood-flow studies in human subjects.
