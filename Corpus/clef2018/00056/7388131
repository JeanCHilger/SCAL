Ventilation-perfusion ratios and pulmonary shunt. A group of 63 healthy subjects aged from 17 to 29 years were studied in a sitting posture. The following indices of pulmonary ventilation were revealed: Vd, phys/VT-30 +/- +/- 0.6%, AaDO2-10 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, aADCO2 (PA, CO2 = = Pet, CO2)-5.0 +/- 0.4 mm Hg, Qva/QT (air)-2.3 +/- 0.3% Qs/QT (O2)-1.8 +/- 0.2%. In general VA/Qc is normal being 0.86 +/- 0,03. No differences in VA/Qc are recorded in males and females. The anatomic shunt and perfusion of nonventilated alveoli play the leading role in the formation of QVa/QT in healthy persons.
