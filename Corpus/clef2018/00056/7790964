Human dosimetry and biodistribution of iodine-123-iododexetimide: a SPECT imaging agent for cholinergic muscarinic neuroreceptors. Iodine-123-iododexetimide (IDEX) has recently been used for SPECT imaging of muscarinic cholinergic neuroreceptors (mAChR) in humans. We report the human radiation dosimetry, whole-body and normal cerebral distribution of IDEX.Serial whole-body planar and brain SPECT scans were performed over 24 hr in four normal subjects. Organ activity was calculated from attenuation-corrected geometric mean counts from ROIs drawn over visible organs. Thigh activity was used for background subtraction. Organ absorbed doses and effective dose were calculated using the MIRD schema. Brain SPECT was performed 6 hr postinjection in ten normal subjects. ROIs placed over cortical and subcortical structures were used to determine brain distribution.The effective dose was 24.7 microSv/MBq. An average of 54% of IDEX remained in the body background. Decay-corrected brain uptake was 6.9% of injected dose at 1 hr, 8.6% at 6 hr and 8.1% at 24 hr. Regional brain distribution showed high uptake in striatum and cortex with low activity in thalamus and cerebellum. At 6 hr, activity relative to striatum was 70% for frontal and parietal cortex, 102% for occipital cortex, 54% for thalamus and 11% for cerebellum.Iodine-123-IDEX produced high quality SPECT images with activity at 6 hr reflecting the known distribution of mAChR receptors. The favorable dosimetry of IDEX and high synthetic yield (50%-70%) suggest it to be a suitable agent for clinical studies.
