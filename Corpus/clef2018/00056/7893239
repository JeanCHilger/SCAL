Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) measures of brain function in schizophrenia. This study explores SPECT measured in schizophrenic patients at rest. Left temporal lobe activity was found to be decreased with increasing positive symptoms' scores scores. Medicated patients showed a reversal of this pattern underlying this positive symptom effect. Patients with a recent history of auditory hallucinations showed an atypical right temporal lobe dominance, which occurred independently of medication status. These preliminary data are suggestive of the potential utility of SPECT to elucidate symptom/medication/brain activity interrelationships in schizophrenia.
