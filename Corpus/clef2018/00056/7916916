A double FDG/PET study of the effects of scopolamine in older adults. Two consecutive positron emission scans were done in one session using a double injection method of [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose administration to examine the effects of the antimuscarinic drug scopolamine on cerebral glucose metabolism in ten older adults. Scopolamine causes temporary memory impairment, and its effects have been used to model aspects of the cognitive impairment that occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cortical metabolic rates of patients with AD have been reported to be depressed, especially in parietal, temporal, and frontal association areas. After scopolamine administration to the elderly volunteers, absolute and normalized glucose metabolic rates were depressed in prefrontal and occipital regions and increased in parietal-occipital cortical regions and a left middle temporal region. These changes in the older volunteers are generally not consistent with changes seen in AD. We conclude that deficits in muscarinic system function may contribute to some but not all of the hypometabolic changes seen in AD patients.
