Coronary artery stenosis and occlusion: value of 99Tcm-MIBI SPECT. The aim of this study was to evaluate and validate a new quantification method for 99Tcm-sestamibi single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) myocardial imaging based on a four-slice analysis method and to check the functional results of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Using the calculated pathological area of the scintigram as an index for myocardial ischaemia, the overall sensitivity was 81-90% and the overall specificity was 74-98%. Analysis of variance of the repeated measurements revealed good reproducibility (coefficient of variation 8.4%). A significant correlation was found between the size of the exercise-induced perfusion defects and the degree of coronary stenosis. The comparison of radionuclide ventriculography and the perfusion image in 27 patients revealed a good correlation between the resting global ejection fraction and myocardial perfusion, but there was no correlation during exercise, indicating a dissociation between myocardial perfusion and function during exercise conditions in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients with total coronary occlusions showed more resting defects than patients with partial stenoses. Both groups benefit from PTCA or re-opening of chronic coronary occlusion, respectively. Exercise-induced myocardial ischaemia significantly decreased, and in 36% of the patients with previous myocardial infarction a significant reduction of the size of the resting perfusion defects occurred. In conclusion, our quantification method is suitable for the accurate non-invasive diagnosis of CAD, and for the follow-up of the invasive treatment of coronary artery stenoses and occlusions.
