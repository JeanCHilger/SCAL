Effect of verapamil on myocardial ischemia in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: evaluation by exercise thallium-201 SPECT. The effect of verapamil on myocardial ischemia in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was evaluated by exercise myocardial 201Tl SPECT (EX-Tl). EX-Tl was performed before and after 8.1 +/- 6.1 weeks of oral administration of verapamil (240 mg/day) on 20 patients with HCM who showed transient 201Tl perfusion defects under control conditions. SPECT images were divided into nine segments. The 201Tl perfusion defect was visually scored and evaluated for four grades in each segment and the sum total grade was calculated as the defect score. Transient dilation index was calculated as a reflection of subendocardial ischemia. Improvements in defect score were demonstrated in 18 of 20 patients after administration of verapamil. The mean defect score decreased significantly from 5.1 +/- 2.3 to 2.5 +/- 2.4 (p < 0.001). Although 18 of 20 patients showed abnormal transient dilation index under control conditions, 16 showed improvement and 12 were normalized after verapamil therapy. Mean transient dilation index decreased from 1.24 +/- 0.19 to 1.08 +/- 0.10 (p < 0.01). Verapamil improves myocardial ischemia in patients with HCM.
