Multiple system atrophy (MSA). Sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA), Shy-Drager syndrome (SDS), striatonigral degeneration (SND) are classified as multiple system atrophy (MSA), based on their clinicopathological findings. These clinical features, neuroimaging including CT, MRI, PET and SPECT findings, autonomic function test, pathological findings and treatments are reviewed. Several advances such as noradrenaline loading test, low signal intensity on T2 weighted image on super-conductive MRI and glial cytoplasmic inclusions in the central nervous system on pathological finding are notable. However, unsatisfactory medical treatment for MSA must be resolved in a near future.
