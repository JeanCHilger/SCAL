Anticonvulsant use in the treatment of manic syndromes in patients with HIV-1 infection. A retrospective chart review identified 11 patients with type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who presented to an HIV/AIDS psychiatric service with an acute manic episode. Demographic data, neurodiagnostic studies, and treatment results are discussed. Abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging significantly predicted poor tolerance of lithium and neuroleptics. Anticonvulsants were an effective alternative.
