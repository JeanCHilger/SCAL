Non-dominant dorsal-prefrontal activation during chess problem solution evidenced by single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). Expert chess players can recall meaningful chess positions with extraordinary precision in comparison with inexperienced players. We hypothesized, therefore, that their mental performance during chess deliberation could be an appropriate target for single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) studies. We studied cerebral activation with 1110 MBq 99mTc-Bicisate SPECT in five expert male chess players during mental solution of a complex chess problem. Region of interest (ROI) analysis, in comparison with average weighted cerebellar counts, showed activation by 10% or more, of the non dominant prefrontal area (right in four dominant right handed players, left in one dominant left handed player) and by 2-6% in the non-dominant middle temporal areas. Maximum variability of ROI analysis versus cerebellar counts in test/retest evaluation is in our laboratory, as in others, 1.5%. Our results are in agreement with neuropsychological studies suggesting that the non-dominant hemisphere is specialized for chess skill, and show that non-dominant prefrontal and temporal lobe activation during chess deliberation can be detected by SPECT.
