Longitudinal changes in peritoneal equilibration test with or without peritonitis in children. This study was conducted to evaluate longitudinal changes in the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) in children treated with continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD). The effects of prolonged CPD and episodes of peritonitis on the PET were examined. PET was repeated up to five times in 12 paediatric patients who were subdivided into groups with and without peritonitis. In the peritonitis group (n = 6), the dialysate/plasma (D/P) creatinine ratio at a 4-h dwell time decreased progressively with time on CPD in five of six patients. In a comparison of the initial and final PETs performed at a mean interval of 22.8 +/- 11.6 months, the D/P creatinine ratio in the final PET was significantly lower than in the initial PET (P < 0.01). In contrast, in the non-peritonitis group (n = 6), the D/P creatinine ratio in the final PET was unchanged for 28.2 +/- 12.3 months from the initial PET. The D/Do glucose ratio at a 4-h dwell time was unchanged over time in each group. Thus, repeated PET measurements revealed that membrane permeability for creatinine was not affected by prolonged CPD itself, but decreased with time after episodes of peritonitis. Although the protocol for PET is not standardised in children, PET was useful for determining the sequential changes in peritoneal function in such patients on CPD.
