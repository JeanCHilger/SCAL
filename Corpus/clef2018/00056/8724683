Localizing the lexicon for reading aloud:replication of a PET study using fMRI. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the neural basis of written word recognition in two normal subjects. With a 1.5T scanner and temporal surface coil, T2 gradient echo images were obtained while subjects read words aloud. As a control condition, subjects visualized false font strings and said the word "range' each time such a string appeared. These two conditions were presented in an oscillatory pattern, alternating 30 s of each condition for a total of 4 min. Comparison of the two conditions using cross-correlation demonstrated strong activation in both subjects in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus, near the site predicted for the visual input lexicon by DÃ©jerine and recently demonstrated by positron emission tomography.
