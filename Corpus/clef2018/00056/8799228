Attenuation compensation for cardiac single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging: Part 2. Attenuation compensation algorithms. Attenuation is believed to be one of the major causes of false-positive cardiac single-photon emission computed tomographic perfusion images. This article provides an introduction to the approaches used to correct for nonuniform attenuation once a patient-specific attenuation map is available. Comparison is made of specific attenuation-correction algorithms from each of three major categories of compensation methods that are or will be available commercially. Examples of the use of the algorithms on simulated projections of a mathematic phantom modeling the anatomy of the upper torso are used to illustrate the ability of the methods to compensate for attenuation. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are summarized, as well as areas that need further investigation.
