The inversion of the exponential Radon transform for quantitative brain SPECT. The mathematical derivation for the inversion of the exponential Radon transform is presented and the implementation of the inversion is detailed. The inversion can be verified and implemented by the readers for practical applications, such as for quantitative reconstruction of brain SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography).
