Imaging of dopamine transporters in humans with technetium-99m TRODAT-1. Technetium-99m TRODAT-1, a tropane derivative, has shown promise as a tracer for the imaging of dopamine transporters in preliminary studies in rats and baboons. The present report concerns the first study of the use of [99mTc]TRODAT-1 for the same purpose in humans. The specific uptake of [99mTc]TRODAT-1 in dopamine transporter sites located in the basal ganglia area was confirmed: the best contrast between the basal ganglia and the occipital area, which is devoid of dopamine transporters, was achieved at 120-140 min following injection. The development of a 99mTc-based agent bypasses the need for cyclotron-produced radionuclides, which will be of benefit for routine clinical studies.
