Comparison of FDG-PET and sestamibi-SPECT in primary hyperparathyroidism. Preoperative localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism has been a longstanding diagnostic challenge. This study directly compared FDG-PET and sestamibi-SPECT for preoperative detection of abnormal parathyroid tissue.Twenty-one consecutive patients with primary hyperparathyroidism were studied prospectively before surgical neck exploration. SPECT of the neck and chest was performed at 15 min and 2 hr after intravenous 99mTc-sestamibi. Regional body PET was performed 45 min after intravenous FDG.Surgery revealed 19 solitary parathyroid adenomas, 2 parathyroid adenomas in one patient and 3 hyperplastic parathyroid glands in one patient, and 51 normal parathyroid glands. The diagnostic sensitivities for detection of parathyroid adenomas of 43% (9 of 21) for dual-phase sestamibi-SPECT and 86% (18 of 21) for FDG-PET were significantly different (p < 0.001). The difference in diagnostic specificities of 78% (40 of 51) for FDG-PET and 90% (46 of 51) for dual-phase sestamibi-SPECT approached statistical significance (p = 0.063).This study demonstrates that FDG-PET is more sensitive than sestamibi-SPECT in the preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.
