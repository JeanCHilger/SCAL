A clinical and neurophysiological study of a patient with an extensive transection of the spinal cord sparing only a part of one anterolateral quadrant. In 1976, Noordenbos and Wall studied sensory functions in a woman with a surgically verified T3 spinal cord transection which spared only a part of the left anterolateral quadrant, We re-investigated this unique case 18 years after the lesion and included a comparable sensory examination, MRI of the spinal cord, somatosensory evoked potentials, PET-activation study during hand and foot vibration and analysis of flexion reflex modulation during the Jendrassik manoeuvre. Our results show that the residual anterolateral quadrant contains ascending pathways carrying a wide range of sensory information as well as descending pathways modulating flexion reflex activity at the spinal level. Moreover, the changes in sensory functions and the unique pattern of cortical activation suggest a functional reorganization of the connectivity between the periphery and the cerebral cortex. Changes of facilitation and/or of inhibition at different levels of the somatosensory system may account for these longterm plastic changes.
