Heterogeneity of myocardial fluoro-18 2-deoxyglucose uptake in patients with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We have shown that myocardial glucose metabolism is heterogeneous in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is not known, however, whether glucose metabolism is impaired in patients with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is fairly common in Japan. We studied 7 patients with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 5 normal subjects using fluoro-18 2-deoxyglucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET). We calculated regional FDG fractional uptake and the inter-regional coefficient of variation (CV) of FDG fractional uptake in the interventricular septal, anteroapical, and posterolateral regions. The regional FDG fractional uptake was similar in the 2 groups and among the 3 different segments within each group. However, the inter-regional CV of FDG fractional uptake was increased in the anteroapical wall segment of the patient group compared with the control group and also with the other 2 regions in the patient group. The results did not differ when we studied another 5 patients and 6 normal control subjects with a PET scanner with higher spatial resolution. These data suggest that myocardial glucose metabolism may be impaired in the anteroapical wall segment of patients with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
