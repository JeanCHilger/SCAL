Functional EEG mapping and SPECT in detoxified male alcoholics. Fifteen alcoholics diagnosed according to DSM-III-R, who were detoxified for at least 2 weeks and showed no clinical withdrawal signs, were investigated with 16 channel EEG mapping during resting, manumotor and music perception conditions, and were compared with 13 control persons. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using hexa-methyl-propilene-amine-oxime (HMPAO) labeled with 99m-technetium (99mTc) as tracer was performed separately (in patients only) and submitted to semiquantitative region of interest (ROI) analysis in 2 slices, 6 and 10 cm above canthomeatal line, respectively. Resting EEG showed increased power values in fast beta frequency band for the detoxified alcoholics. On cortical stimulation, patients showed signs of pathological EEG reactivity. Correlations of EEG parameters to cerebral blood flow (CBF) values (patients only) yielded coefficients around zero for all frequency bands (signs of uncoupling). All findings point to organic brain dysfunctions in these patients which extend beyond the period of withdrawal.
