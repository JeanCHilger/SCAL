Understanding functional neuroimaging methods based on neurovascular coupling. Functional neuroimaging techniques are usually grouped according to the employed apparatus into functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques (fMRI), nuclear medicine approaches such as single photon emission tomography (SPET) or positron emission tomography (PET), and optical approaches (measurement of intrinsic signals, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)). However, the physiological parameters that are measured with these methods do not necessarily follow this technical classification. On the one hand, using different imaging modalities the same physiological parameters are measured and on the other hand, using the same imaging devices completely different physiological parameters can be assessed. The present article covers those functional neuroimaging methods which measure the vascular response to functional brain activation (PET, SPET, fMRI and NIRS). First, starting with the traditional grouping of these methods, it is outlined how the specific methods assess vascular changes associated with brain activation in order to localize brain function. Based on the understanding of the underlying physiological events, subsequently, a new classification of functional neuroimaging methods is proposed.
