Technetium-99m-labeled receptor-specific small-molecule radiopharmaceuticals: recent developments and encouraging results. The development of technetium-99m-labeled small-molecule radiopharmaceuticals directed at specific high-affinity binding sites, as are found in receptors for hormones and neurotransmitters, transport systems, and certain enzymes, is a natural outgrowth from the successful development of technetium radiopharmaceuticals for imaging flow and metabolism. Although many receptor-specific radiopharmaceuticals labeled with PET and other SPECT isotopes already exist, the low cost and widespread availability of technetium-99m would make their 99mTc-labeled counterparts much more accessible to the medical community. This review has four goals: (a) To survey and analyze critically the results of a flurry of research activity in this area in recent years, which has led to the preparation of a number of novel technetium-labeled radiopharmaceuticals targeted at high-affinity sites, a few of which appear to be very promising (b) to provide a conceptual analysis of how these agents are being designed
