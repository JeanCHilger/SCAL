Clinical results with beta-methyl-p-(123I)iodophenylpentadecanoic acid, single-photon emission computed tomography in cardiac disease. This study was undertaken to evaluate the relationships, between myocardial perfusion and metabolism. Simultaneous beta-methyl-p(123I)iodophenylpentadecanoic acid (123I-BMIPP) and thallium 201 myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were performed in 25 patients with myocardial infarction (group A) and 16 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (group B). The severity scores of 123I-BMIPP and 201Tl myocardial SPECT images were evaluated semiquantitatively by segmental analysis. In Group A, dissociations between thallium- and 123I-BMIPP-imaged defects were frequently observed in patients with successful reperfusion compared with those with no reperfusion and those with reinfarction. In four patients with successful reperfusion, repeated 123I-BMIPP and 201Tl myocardial SPECT showed gradual improvement of the 123I-BMIPP severity score compared with the thallium severity score. In group B, dissociations between thallium- and 123I-BMIPP-imaged defects were also demonstrated in hypertrophic myocardium. In addition, nonhypertrophic myocardium also had decreased 123I-BMIPP uptake. In groups A and B, 123I-BMIPP severity scores correlated well with left ventricular function compared with thallium severity scores. These findings indicate that 123I-BMIPP is a suitable agent for the assessment of functional integrity, because left ventricular wall motion is energy dependent and 123I-BMIPP may reflect an aspect of myocardial energy production. This agent may be useful for the early detection and patient management of various heart diseases as an alternative to positron emission tomographic study.
