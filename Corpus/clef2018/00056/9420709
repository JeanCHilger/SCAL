An approach to ventricular efficiency by use of carbon 11-labeled acetate and positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography-derived 11C-labeled acetate kinetics have been shown to reflect myocardial oxidative metabolism. The objective of the study was to use this metabolic imaging technique in combination with an evaluation of left ventricular work as an index of ventricular mechanical efficiency.The effects of ventricular ejection fraction and loading on this index were studied quantitatively in a canine experimental model. There was a curvilinear relationship between efficiency and the end-diastolic volume per unit mass (r = 0.84), which appeared to integrate the main determinants of left ventricular mechanical performance successfully and allowed the detection of a decreased ventricular efficiency in acute experimental heart failure.This approach appears to have the potential to assess the energetic working point of the ventricle in clinical heart disease and follow the effects of therapy. The data demonstrate the feasibility of an estimate of ventricular efficiency that relies on noninvasive data-acquisition techniques.
