PET versus SPECT for determining myocardial tissue viability using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates the manufacture and distribution of 18F-FDG. Acquisition and use of this radiopharmaceutical for myocardial imaging at our institution required approval by our Institutional Review Board. Our initial objective was to present a scientific validation for use of this radiopharmaceutical in adjudicating the "viable versus scarred myocardium question," using either a PET scanner or a gamma camera equipped with 511-keV collimators. We believe that our nuclear medicine colleagues who find themselves in a similar business/legal situation regarding the acquisition and use of 18F-FDG will find this review useful. We reviewed the literature to document the efficacy of 18F-FDG, in general, in assessing myocardial viability. We then did a literature-based comparison of PET scanner methodology versus modified gamma camera methodology for imaging 18F-FDG emissions. Imaging 18F-FDG with a modified gamma camera appears to be an effective alternative to imaging with a standard PET camera for assessing myocardial viability.
