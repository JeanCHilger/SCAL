Positron emission tomography of the heart. From research to clinical practice. Positron emission tomography (PET) is used as diagnostic and in identifying patients with reversible ischaemic dysfunction, and for non-invasive investigation of myocardial perfusion. The development of new positron-emitting tracers and user-friendly techniques suggests that the method is suitable for much wider usage, and usage over a large range of applications.
