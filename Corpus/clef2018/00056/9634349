Surgery for skeletal sarcomas. Skeletal neoplasms in pet animals are uncommon, but can represent a diagnostic and treatment challenge for the veterinary clinician. Osteosarcoma represents the most common histology of primary bone tumor and although the prognosis after treatment is still gaurded, major strides have been made in the treatment of this disease. Treatment success, however, requires a multidisciplinary approach. Additional histologic types cannot be ignored from the diagnosis of cases presenting as bone neoplasms, and many of these can have excellent long-term prognoses if treated appropriately. This article discusses the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of skeletal neoplasms in general with a specific emphasis on osteosarcoma.
