Combination of the different biological markers for increasing specificity of in vivo Alzheimer's testing. In view of existing drugs (acetylcholine esterase inhibitors) and emerging therapeutic compounds (e.g. neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory compounds), CSF markers would be of great use to improve the clinical diagnostic accuracy of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Correct identification of AD would be especially important early in the course of the disease, when the clinical diagnosis is difficult, and drugs have the greatest potential of being effective. Biochemical markers for AD include ApoE genotyping, where the ApoE epsilon 4 allele has proven to have a high predictive value for AD. Biochemical markers for AD also include several potential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers: beta-amyloid(1-42), possibly reflecting amyloid deposition and formation of senile plaques PHFtau protein a marker for the phosphorylation state of tau, and formation of neurofibrillary tangles
