A cold nose can warm the heart. Chase, a three-year-old golden retriever, is a show dog with a mission! For the past six months, Chase and his owner, Carol Ruby, of Orion Township, have been visiting patients on the inpatient Physical Rehabilitation Unit at Crittenton Hospital in Rochester. Chase played a key role in the creation of the unit's new Pet Therapy Program. Currently, Chase is one of three dogs whose goal is to bring smiles to the faces of patients at the hospital.
