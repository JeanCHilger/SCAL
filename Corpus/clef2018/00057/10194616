Effect of partition coefficient, permeability surface product, and radioisotope on the signal-to-noise ratio in PET functional brain mapping: a computer simulation. In this work we use a computer simulation to estimate the magnitude of improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio of PET functional brain mapping studies as a function of partition coefficient and permeability surface product for O-14, F-17, and O-15 labeled flow tracers. A model for signal-to-noise ratio is derived from the Kety model for inert diffusible blood flow tracers. The results of the simulation suggest that moderate increases in partition coefficient and permeability surface product compared with water would lead to an increase in signal-to-noise ratio of a factor of about 3.
