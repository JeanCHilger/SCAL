Biology of memory. The memory phenomenon is described and characterized giving also definitions connected with it--engrams and learning. Several classifications of memory are reviewed discussing differences between instant and "processed" memory, and memory declarative and procedural. Theories are presented briefly of the nature of memory, the hypothesis of closed neuronal circuits, synaptic plasticity, neurochemical theory, and Fuster's new network theory, including arguments for and against them. Attention is called to the possibility of "watching" of the mechanisms of memory, provided by the introduction of neurovisual methods PET and MRI. Finally, observations are mentioned indicating that subconscious learning occurs more frequently than it is supposed, and the mechanisms of knowledge acquiring in this way are diverse.
