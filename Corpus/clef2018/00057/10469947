Applications of the magnetoencephalography in the study of schizophrenia. In this paper we present a revision about magnetoencephalography (MEG) and schizophrenia. We focus on Auditive Magnetic Fields, principally in M100 and in his hemispheric asymmetries. Finally, it was discussed the advantages of the MEG in comparison with other techniques with low temporal (RMf, PET) or spatial (EEG) resolution.
