Incremental prognostic value of post-stress left ventricular ejection fraction and volume by gated myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography. The incremental prognostic value of post-stress left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and volume over perfusion has not been investigated.We identified 1680 consecutive patients who underwent rest Tl-201/stress Tc-99m sestamibi gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and who were followed-up for 569+/-106 days. Receiver-operator characteristics analysis defined an EF<45%, an end-systolic volume (ESV) >70 mL, and an end-diastolic volume >120 mL as optimal thresholds, yielding moderate sensitivity and high specificity in the prediction of cardiac death. Patients with an EF> or = 45% had mortality rates <1%/year, despite severe perfusion abnormalities, whereas patients with an EF<45% had high mortality rates, even with only mild/moderate perfusion abnormalities (9.2%/year P<0.00001). Similarly, an ESV< or = 70 mL was related to a low cardiac death rate (<1.2%/year), even for patients with severe perfusion abnormalities, whereas patients with an ESV>70 mL and only mild/moderate perfusion abnormalities had high death rates (8.2%/yearPost-stress EF and ESV by gated-SPECT have incremental prognostic values over prescan and perfusion information in predicting cardiac death, and they provide clinically useful risk stratification.
