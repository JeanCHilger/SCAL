Evaluation of cardiac function in myocardial infarction patients by ECG 99mTc-MIBI gated SPECT using a three-dimensional perfusion/motion map procedure. Three-dimensional (3D) radionuclear myocardial imaging has improved the evaluation of left ventricular wall motion. However, there have been no studies evaluating left ventricular function using 3D-perfusion/motion map techniques. We hypothesized that the 3D-perfusion/motion map could accurately evaluate left ventricular wall motion even in patients with a history of myocardial infarction. Electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using 99mTc-methoxy isobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) was performed in 20 patients with a history of myocardial infarction who underwent left ventriculography. Myocardial imaging data were collected during ECG-gated SPECT using a 3-headed gamma camera. Reconstructed 3D SPECT images were oriented to correspond to standard left ventriculography views (right anterior oblique and left anterior oblique projections), and the shortening fraction (SF) was calculated using the center line method. The SF and left ventricular ejection fraction from 3D SPECT images were compared with those determined by left ventriculography. There was a significant correlation between left ventriculography and the 3D-perfusion/motion map procedure in determining SF for all regions of the left ventricle except the anterobasal and posterior segments by using the Bland and Altman method. The 3D-perfusion/motion map procedure offers the advantage that the influences of contraction-related myocardial torsion and three-dimensional compression are minimized. In addition, this method facilitates evaluation of images from nonstandard projections. We conclude that this method may be useful for evaluating left ventricular function.
