Lateralized memory deficits on the Wada test correlate with the side of lobectomy only for patients with unilateral medial temporal lobe epilepsy. The aim of this study was to determine whether the predictive value of the intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) for the side to be resected is applicable only to medial temporal lobe epilepsy and to investigate whether there are different patterns of memory performances on the IAT between patients with unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis (UMT group) and those without (non-UMT group). We studied 30 patients in the UMT group and 10 in the non-UMT group, who underwent pre-surgical evaluation for intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. Memory performances on the IAT was defined as the percentage of memory items presented during unilateral hemispheric anesthesia that was recognized after recovery. More than a 20% decline of the memory performance on the IAT compared with the memory performance on the pre-test was regarded as a memory deficit. Age at onset of epilepsy was significantly younger in the UMT than in the non-UMT group. Surgical outcome was significantly better in the UMT than in the non-UMT group. The lateralizing value of unilateral memory deficits on the IAT was statistically confirmed. There was a significant association between falsely lateralizing memory performances and the non-UMT group. Excluding the exceptional cases with right-sided language dominance in spite of right-sided lesions, the high incidence of the unilateral right-sided memory deficits in the non-UMT group was statistically significant. This study suggested that the excellent lateralizing value of the memory performances on the IAT is limited to patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. IAT memory performances in patients without such lesions can be misleading, even if lateralized, because their memory status presumably reflects a natural lateralization of the memory organization which is independent of the epileptogenic focus.
