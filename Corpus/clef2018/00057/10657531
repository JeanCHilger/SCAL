A radioiodinated 7alpha-O-iodoallyl diprenorphine for mapping opioid receptors. The aim of the current research has been to validate an original radioiodinated diprenorphine (DPN) derivative suitable for imaging studies of opioid receptors. [(125)I]7alpha-O-iodoallyl diprenorphine (7alpha-O-IA-DPN) was prepared by radioiododestannylation and in vitro and in vivo opioid receptor binding assays were performed with CDF1 mouse brains. In vitro binding studies showed high affinity (K(i)= 0.4 +/- 0.2 nM) for mouse brain membranes. In vivo studies showed 63% specific binding. Ex vivo autoradiography of brain sections confirmed high uptake and retention of [(125)I]7alpha-O-IA-DPN in regions rich in opioid receptors. This new radioiodinated DPN analogue appears to be a potential radioprobe for in vivo visualization of human cerebral opioid receptors with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
