Usefulness of PET with 11C-methionine for the detection of hilar and mediastinal lymph node metastasis in lung cancer. We retrospectively evaluated the usefulness of PET with 11C-methionine (methionine PET) for the diagnosis of lymph node metastases in patients with lung cancer.Methionine PET and CT were performed before surgical intervention in 41 patients with primary lung cancer. We evaluated individual lymph nodes by methionine PET along with corresponding CT images. The 11C-methionine accumulation of lymph nodes was assessed semiquantitatively by analysis of the tumor-to-muscle ratio (TMR) and was compared with CT and histological diagnoses.A total of 126 lymph nodes, 36 of which were histologically diagnosed as metastatic, were assessed by CT and methionine PET. The TMR in metastatic lymph nodes (n = 36) was 5.15+/-1.69, whereas that of nonmetastatic lymph nodes (n = 90) was 2.91+/-0.76 this difference was significant (P < 0.0001). The most adequate TMR cutoff value for diagnosis of metastasis based on the results of receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was 4.1. The positive and negative predictive values, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of methionine PET were 79.5%, 94.3%, 86.1%, 91.1%, and 89.7%, respectively, and were superior to those of CT (57.6%, P = 0.04Methionine PET appears to be superior to CT for the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in lung cancer patients. The high negative predictive value of methionine PET suggests that cases in which lymph nodes are enlarged on CT with negative PET analysis may be diagnosed as negative for metastasis.
