Limited performance of quantitative assessment of myocardial function by thallium-201 gated myocardial single-photon emission tomography. We investigated the reproducibility between thallium-201 and technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) gated single-photon emission tomography (SPET) for the assessment of indices of myocardial function such as end-diastolic and end-systolic volume (EDV, ESV), ejection fraction (EF) and wall motion. Rest 201Tl (111 MBq) gated SPET was sequentially performed twice in 20 patients. Rest 201Tl gated SPET and rest 99mTc-MIBI (370 MBq) gated SPET were performed 24 h apart in 40 patients. Wall motion was graded using the surface display of the Cedars quantitative gated SPET (QGS) software. EDV, ESV and EF were also measured using the QGS software. The reproducibility of functional assessment on rest 201Tl gated SPET was compared with that on 99mTc-MIBI gated SPET, and also with that between 201Tl gated SPET and 99mTc-MIBI gated SPET performed on the next day. The two standard deviation (2 SD) values for EDV, ESV and EF on the Bland-Altman plot were 29 ml, 19 ml and 12%, respectively, on repeated 201Tl gated SPET, compared with 14 ml, 11 ml and 5.3% on repeated 99mTc-MIBI gated SPET. The correlations were good (r=0.96, 0.97 and 0.87) between the two measurements of EDV, ESV and EF on repeated rest studies with 201Tl and 99mTc-MIBI gated SPET. However, Bland-Altman analysis revealed that the 2 SD values between the two measurements were 31 ml, 23 ml and 12%. We were able to score the wall motion in all cases using the 3D surface display of the QGS on 201Tl gated SPET. The kappa value of the wall motion grade on the repeated 201Tl study was 0.35, while that of the wall motion grade on the repeated 99mTc-MIBI study was 0.76. The kappa value was 0.49 for grading of wall motion on repeated rest studies with 201Tl and 99mTc-MIBI. In conclusion, QGS helped determine EDV, ESV, EF and wall motion on 201Tl gated SPET. Because the EDV, ESV and EF were less reproducible on repeated 201Tl gated SPET or on 201Tl gated SPET and 99mTc-MIBI gated SPET on the next day than on repeated 99mTc-MIBI gated SPET, functional measurement on 201Tl gated SPET did not seem to be interchangeable with that on 99mTc-MIBI gated SPET.
