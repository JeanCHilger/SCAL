Dimensions of the pet population problem. In 1973, an estimated $4.5 billion was spent on the combined care and feeding of pets, whereas about 18 million neglected pets were impounded, costing our society nearly $125 million. About 72,000 dogs and cats must die or be killed each day to maintain zero growth in the population. Humane shelters and pounds have become slaughterhouses. Neglected pets constitute a hazard to the health and quality of life of man and other animals. Sizable segments of society are becomming hostile toward dogs and cats.
