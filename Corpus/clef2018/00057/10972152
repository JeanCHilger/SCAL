A water-cooled spherical niobium target for the production of [18F]fluoride. A new automated target system for the routine production of [18F]fluoride from (18)O-enriched water has been constructed. It consists of a small spherical niobium target chamber mounted into a special holder, which provides rapid cooling by water flow around the sphere. The target is irradiated with 21 MeV protons the incident energy in the target chamber is 13 MeV. The system is operated without external over-pressure and has been tested for beam currents up to 50 microA. 95% of the theoretical yield of [18F]fluoride has been extracted and used for the synthesis of [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose.
