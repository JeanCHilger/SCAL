Positron emission tomography: from production and distribution to drug research and clinical applications. The radiopharmaceutical FDG has had a major impact on PET imaging in clinical medicine, particularly in the detection and staging of certain cancers. PET isotopes offer unparalleled insight into in vivo distribution of labeled drugs. PET imaging of blood flow, metabolism, and neuroreceptor characteristics may provide new perspectives on the mechanism of action and effects of drugs.
