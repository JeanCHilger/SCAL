Temporal and spatial dynamics of human forebrain activity during heat pain: analysis by positron emission tomography. To learn about the sequence of brain activation patterns during heat pain, we acquired positron emission tomographic (PET) brain scans at different times during repetitive heat stimulation (40 or 50 degrees C 5-s contact) of each subject's left forearm. Early scans began at the onset of 60 s of stimulation
