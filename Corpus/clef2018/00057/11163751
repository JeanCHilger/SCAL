Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of 123I-labelled human recombinant annexin V. Annexin V was radiolabelled with iodine-123 in order to develop a SPECT-ligand for imaging atherosclerosis and apoptosis. Iodination by means of electrophylic substitution resulted in radiochemical yields up to 70% and specific activities of 7.4-92.5 MBq/microg protein. Binding experiments with blood platelets indicated that 123I-labelled annexin V remained its biological activity.
