Fusion and expression of the gene encoding human Mn-SOD to anti-CEA single-chain antibody in Escherichia coli. The gene encoding human manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) was fused to anti-carcinoembryonic antigen single-chain antibody gene to construct the fusion gene, then was ligated into prokaryotic expression vector pET-22b(+), The fusion gene was expressed in E. coli at high level, accounting for 24% of the total bacteria soluble protein and was characterized by SDS-PAGE and Western-blot analysis
