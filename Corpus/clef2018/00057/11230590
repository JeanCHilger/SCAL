Residential exposures associated with asthma in US children. Residential exposures are recognized risk factors for childhood asthma, but the relative contribution of specific risk factors and the overall contribution of housing to asthma in US children is unknown. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors and estimate the population attributable risk of residential exposures for doctor-diagnosed asthma for US children.A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 1988 to 1994. Survey participants were 8257 children who were <6 years old and who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a survey of the health and nutritional status of children and adults in the United States. The main outcome measure was doctor-diagnosed asthma, as reported by the parent.Six percent of children had doctor-diagnosed asthma. The prevalence of asthma was higher among boys (6.7%) than girls (5.1%) and was higher among black children (8.9%) than white children (5.2%). Risk factors for doctor-diagnosed asthma included a family history of atopy (odds ratio [OR]: 2.2 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5, 3.1), child's history of allergy to a pet (OR: 24.2The elimination of identified residential risk factors, if causally associated with asthma, would result in a 39% decline in doctor-diagnosed asthma among US children <6 years old.
