Solid-phase analysis method for (S)-[18F]fluorocarazolol and its metabolites. (S)-[18F]Fluorocarazolol is a radiopharmaceutical developed to quantitatively assess beta-adrenergic receptors in vivo via positron emission tomography imaging. Since radioactive metabolites of (S)-[18F]fluorocarazolol rapidly appear in the plasma, methods for conveniently and reliably evaluating plasma for (S)-[18F]fluorocarazolol content are required. Here we present methods and validation of an approach using commercial extraction cartridges that is faster and more convenient than an approach using internal-surface reverse-phase chromatography but yields comparable results.
