Prognostic significance of myocardial imaging with iodine-123 beta-methyl-p-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid in patients with angina pectoris. To assess the clinical significance of iodine-123 beta-methyl-p-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid(BMIPP) single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), the predictive value of BMIPP imaging in patients with angina pectoris was evaluated.One hundred seventy-four patients who underwent BMIPP imaging in our institution were aged 61.8 +/- 11 years. One hundred thirty-five patients had stable angina and 39 had unstable angina at the time of examination. Patients with previous myocardial infarction or myocardial disorders were excluded. Early and delayed images were acquired in BMIPP SPECT, and the images were analyzed visually. Cardiac events were classified into hard and soft events: the former consisted of cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction, and the latter included coronary revascularization and heart failure.The findings of BMIPP imaging were normal in 82 patients and abnormal in 92. During follow-up of 15.5 +/- 9.5 months, hard events were observed in 4 patients and soft events in 53. In patients with normal BMIPP imaging, soft events were observed in nine patients, but no hard event was encountered. Furthermore, in patients with both normal BMIPP and stress thallium imagings, no cardiac event was observed during 2 years. In contrast, 4 hard events and 44 soft events occurred in patients with abnormal BMIPP imaging. Patients with abnormal BMIPP imaging had a higher incidence of soft events than those with normal BMIPP imaging, regardless of the type of angina(16/62 vs 3/73, p < 0.0005 for stable angina 28/30 vs 6/9, p < 0.0001 for unstable angina).The finding of BMIPP imaging correlates well with the mid-term prognosis of patients with angina pectoris. Since BMIPP SPECT is performed without stress to the patient, this imaging modality is important in evaluating patients with stable or unstable angina.
