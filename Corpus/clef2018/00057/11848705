A database of [(11)C]WAY-100635 binding to 5-HT(1A) receptors in normal male volunteers: normative data and relationship to methodological, demographic, physiological, and behavioral variables. PET studies of [(11)C]WAY-100635 binding are proving to be a useful tool to evaluate 5-HT(1A) receptor function in vivo in humans. We describe the pattern of [(11)C]WAY-100635 binding in 61 healthy male brains and examine its variability. For all PET scans, binding potential (BP) values for [(11)C]WAY-100635 in different regions were calculated using a simplified reference tissue model, with the cerebellum as reference region. Specifically we describe (1) region of interest and SPM databases of PET [(11)C]WAY-100635 binding, including test-retest variability (2) the sensitivity of [(11)C]WAY-100635 binding to manipulations of endogenous 5-HT
