Radionuclide visualization of reparative osteogenesis after obliteration of the paranasal sinuses with bio-compositional implants. 18 patients with chronic recurrent inflammation and traumatic defects of the paranasal sinuses have undergone obliteration of the sinuses with biocompositional materials (hydroxyapatite and colapol) and plastic reconstruction of the bone defects with metal ceramics. Control of the repair processes with emission computed tomography registered accumulation of radiopharmaceuticals (RP) in the obliteration zone a week after the operation. Four-six weeks later RP homogeneously filled the obliteration zone. Six-twelve months after the obliteration, metabolism in the implant is close to that in the intact tissue. It is concluded that emission computed tomography can follow up metabolic changes in the implant and assess efficiency of the operation.
