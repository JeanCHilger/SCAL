Analysis of clinical brain SPECT data based on anatomic standardization and reference to normal data: an ROC-based comparison of visual, semiquantitative, and voxel-based methods. The technique of anatomic standardization and comparison with normal templates is increasingly used in clinical brain SPECT practice and allows automated, operator-independent volume-of-interest (VOI) or voxel-based analysis of whole-brain data. In 2 distinct clinical populations with severe traumatic brain injury and cognitive impairment, this study compared 3 widely available approaches that use normal templates to evaluate SPECT brain perfusion deficits.In total, 74 subjects were studied. These included 14 patients with severe, traumatic brain injury (group 1 10 males, 4 femalesIn both study groups, BRASS voxel-based analysis was most accurate, as defined by the area under the ROC curve (0.97 for group 1 and 0.96 for group 2). VOI assessment was slightly more accurate than visual consensus analysis, whereas SPM showed, overall, a lower area under the ROC curve. SPM analysis was also significantly less sensitive at thresholds corresponding to low false-positive fractions. Regional analysis showed 83%-92% agreement between all methods.Under clinical conditions, classification of brain SPECT studies can greatly be aided by anatomic standardization techniques and reference to normal data. Under the investigated circumstances, SPM was found to have a lower sensitivity than VOI or voxelwise region-growing techniques, especially at low false-positive fractions.
