Use of positron emission tomography in psychiatry. For the past years, substantial amount of experimental data has been published on the use of positron emission tomography in different psychiatric disorders. The different PET methods, which evaluate the whole-brain or regional metabolism, tissue perfusion or receptor density may help to identify the disorder specific changes in brain function and also better understand the underlying pathophysiology. In the clinical practice, PET plays an important role in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dementias and, presumably, in the near future the PET technique will be also extensively used in the clinical examination of other psychiatric disorders.
