Typical antipsychotic drugs -- D(2) receptor occupancy and depressive symptoms in schizophrenia. We tested the hypothesis that the degree of striatal dopamine D(2) receptor blockade induced by typical antipsychotic treatment directly correlates with the presence and severity of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia. Clinical and [(123)I]-IBZM single-photon emission tomography (SPET) scan data obtained from 18 typical antipsychotic treated schizophrenic patients was analysed to evaluate the relationship between striatal D(2) receptor occupancy and the depressive subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-D). Striatal D(2) receptor occupancy by typical antipsychotic drugs was significantly positively correlated with BPRS-D scores (r=0.52, p=0.025). This study suggests that high striatal dopamine D(2) blockade by typical antipsychotic drugs may contribute to the emergence of depressive symptoms in typical antipsychotic treated schizophrenic patients.
