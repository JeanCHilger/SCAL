Thermotolerant Campylobacters in domestic animals in a defined population in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We assessed the prevalence of Campylobacter jejuni in animals in a region of unsatisfied basic needs in the city of Buenos Aires and studied a few risk factors. First we conducted a census to identify all dwellings having pet animals (dogs, cats, and birds). Fecal samples were then taken for isolation and identification of strains. We observed 17% prevalence for dogs (95% CI: 13, 22), 16% for cats (95% CI: 8, 27) and 19% for birds (95% CI: 5, 42). In dogs, the highest prevalences were found in summer and in animals <1 year old in cats, in autumn and those aged 3-5 years. Strains were identified as C. jejuni biotype II in 70% of isolates. In the population described here, dogs, cats and birds kept in households were potential sources of human Campylobacter infections.
