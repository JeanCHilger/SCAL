Bone SPECT imaging of patients with internal derangement of temporomandibular joint before and after splint therapy. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) patients with disc displacement without reduction have a misaligned disc-condyle structural relation. As the condition becomes chronic, painful osteoarthritic changes may occur. For these patients, splint therapy may help to position the condyle to a more structurally compatible and functional position and to decrease the loading force of articular surfaces. The aim of this study was (1). to evaluate osseous reactions and pain relief in patients with disc displacement without reduction after splint therapy and (2). to use single photon emission tomography (SPECT) bone imaging to compare the results with the opposite joint of the patient.Twelve patients, who presented with pain involving the TMJ and limited mouth opening and were confirmed by soft tissue imaging as having disc displacement without reduction, were included in the study. Each patient underwent bone SPECT imaging, after which semiquantitative evaluation of transaxial images was conducted. The ratios of affected TMJ to nonaffected TMJ, affected TMJ to occipital bone, and nonaffected TMJ to occipital bone were calculated. After 6 months of splint therapy, bone SPECT examinations were repeated.Before splint therapy, the ratios of affected TMJ to nonaffected TMJ and of affected TMJ to occipital bone were found to be significantly higher than the ratios after splint therapy (P < 0.005).Six-month splint therapy has a positive effect on the osseous reaction and pain related to internal derangements of TMJs.
