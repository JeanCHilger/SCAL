Usefulness of whole body positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) to detect recurrent ovarian cancer based on asymptomatically elevated serum levels of tumor marker. The aim of this study was to evaluate practice usefulness of whole body positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) to detect recurrent ovarian cancer based on asymptomatically elevated tumor marker (CA-125) serum levels. Whole-body FDG-PET was performed in 28 patients with suspected recurrent ovarian cancers and asymptomatically increased serum levels of tumor marker (CA-125 antigen) but negative or equivocal other imaging modality results. All of these 28 asymptomatic patients had serum levels of CA-125 antigen >35 U/ml. The final diagnosis of recurrent ovarian cancer was established by operation/biopsy histopathological findings or clinical follow-up longer than 1 year by additional morphologic imaging techniques. Among the 28 patients, the final diagnoses of recurrent ovarian cancers and benign lesions were established in 20 and 8 patients, respectively. FDG-PET accurately diagnosed recurrent ovarian cancers in 19 patients and benign lesions in 7 patients. When asymptomatically elevated serum levels of CA-125 antigen, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FDG-PET to detect recurrent ovarian cancers were 95.0%, 87.5%, and 92.9%, respectively. FDG-PET is a useful technique to detect recurrent ovarian cancers for patients suspected of recurrent ovarian cancers due to asymptomatically elevated serum levels of CA-125 antigen.
