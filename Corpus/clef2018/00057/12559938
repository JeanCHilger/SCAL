Effects of abciximab on microvascular integrity and left ventricular functional recovery in patients with acute infarction treated by primary coronary angioplasty. To investigate the effect of abciximab on microvascular integrity and left ventricular (LV) functional recovery in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) treated by primary coronary angioplasty (PTCA).Thirty-one patients (27 males age 39-76 years) with first, acute MI (<6 h after onset) were randomized to receive either abciximab+primary PTCA (n=17) or primary PTCA alone (n=14). Baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. Myocardial reperfusion was studied shortly after PTCA by corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC) and intracoronary myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE), after 48 h by intravenous MCE using intermittent, harmonic power Doppler, and after 1 month by intravenous MCE and 99 mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT. The patients treated with abciximab showed a shorter cTFC (23+/-4 vs 30+/-9 framesAbciximab improves microvascular perfusion and LV functional recovery in primary PTCA.
