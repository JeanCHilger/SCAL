Neural areas of emotions in normal and brain pathology assessed by functional neuroimaging methods. The investigation into neural back-ground of emotions in normal and brain pathology using functional brain imaging techniques (fMRI, PET, SPECT) remains one of the most interesting scientific challenges in the area of psychiatry. The aim of the current study is: 1) to present the recent neuroimaging findings concerning functioning of "emotional brain" in normal and brain pathology with particular emphasis on psychiatric disorders, 2) to consolidate knowledge of neuroimaging techniques and experimental designs used in the assessment of human affect.
