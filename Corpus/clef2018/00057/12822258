Testing for general knowledge of dog owners--requirements for courses and examinations. The expert group of the German Veterinary Chamber has established a frame-work of basic knowledge for education and examination of normal dog owners together with other groups. The most important topics of the theoretical part are: Ethology (social-behaviour, communication dog-human and dog-dog, education, dog-training, learning, psychology, fear, aggression), keeping and caring (prevention, first aid, handling), nutrition and health (diets, vaccination, parasites, diseases), breeding (sexual differences, knowledge about dog-breeds and their needs), dogs in public and family (laws, interaction, obedience, control. The practical part concentrates on the ability of the owner to influence and control his dog, practical handling and the dogs' obedience. Minimum age of owners is 18 years, the dog should be between 18 and 24 months old. The owner has to pass the theoretical exam only once in his/her life, the practical-part has to be repeated with every new dog older than 18 months.
