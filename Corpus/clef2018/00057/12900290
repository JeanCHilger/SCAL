Imaging of striatal dopamine transporters in rat brain with single pinhole SPECT and co-aligned MRI is highly reproducible. A recently developed pinhole high-resolution SPECT system was used to measure striatal to non-specific binding ratios in rats (n = 9), after injection of the dopamine transporter ligand (123)I-FP-CIT, and to assess its test/retest reproducibility. For co-alignment purposes, the rat brain was imaged on a 1.5 Tesla clinical MRI scanner using a specially developed surface coil. The SPECT images showed clear striatal uptake. On the MR images, cerebral and extra-cerebral structures could be easily delineated. The mean striatal to non-specific [(123)I]FP-CIT binding ratios of the test/retest studies were 1.7 +/- 0.2 and 1.6 +/- 0.2, respectively. The test/retest variability was approximately 9%. We conclude that the assessment of striatal [(123)I]FP-CIT binding ratios in rats is highly reproducible.
