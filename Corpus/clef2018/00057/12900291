Evaluation of [18F]FHPG as PET tracer for HSVtk gene expression. In rats, the relationship between [(18)F]FHPG accumulation and HSVtk expression was studied with PET and autoradiography. [(18)F]FHPG distribution closely corresponded with HSVtk immunohistochemical staining. ROI analysis of tracer uptake 2 hours p.i. and Patlak graphical analysis were applied to quantify the PET data. For both analysis methods, the [(18)F]FHPG PET signal correlated well with the fraction of HSVtk expressing cells implanted, but showed a plateau when plotted against HSVtk protein levels. This might be due to rate limiting [(18)F]FHPG membrane transport.
