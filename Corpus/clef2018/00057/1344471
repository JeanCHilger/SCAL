The significance of radioisotope methods in the diagnosis of liver hemangiomas. A growing use of ultrasonography for the examination of abdominal organs has resulted in an easier detection of hemangioma-like focal benign changes in the liver. Such cases ask for further diagnosis. Apart from other methods, the diagnosis of hemangiomas is possible by in vivo technetium-labeled erythrocytes. The authors present the erythrocyte labeling technique and the scintigraphic method carried out in 44 patients. On the basis of the obtained results they conclude that scintigraphy can be successfully used for the diagnosis of hemangiomas, especially if the changes seen by ultrasonography are big enough for the scintigraphy. If they are below 20 mm only tomography (SPECT) with labeled erythrocytes is to be considered.
