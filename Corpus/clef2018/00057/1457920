Performance of a hydrogel composite pericardial substitute after long-term implant studies. A novel composite patch has been tested as a pericardial substitute to reduce adhesion formation after cardiac surgery. The patch consists of poly 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (pHEMA) hydrogel reinforced with a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) mesh. The hydrogel-PET composite pericardial patches were implanted in canines for 6, 9, and 12 months. Upon termination, adhesion formation and epicardial reaction to the implant were rated. No adhesions formed between the patch and the native pericardium or epicardium. A thin fibrous layer on the epicardium progressively developed where the patch contacted the heart. The coronary anatomy remained visible. Histologically, the response to the implant was fibrous in nature. No significant signs of cellular inflammation were found. The gross appearance of the retrieved patches was nearly identical to that of preimplant patches. Mechanical tests showed no significant changes (alpha = 0.05) in patch strength or stiffness. Hydrogel water content initially increased during implantation. The thickness of the patch did not change significantly (alpha = 0.05) throughout the study. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed unequal layers of hydrogel on either side of the PET mesh and cracks in the hydrogel surfaces of retrieved patches. Both SEM and light microscopic observation of the patches showed traces of calcification in patches in the 9 and 12 month studies.
