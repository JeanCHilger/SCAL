Unchanged striatal dopamine transporter availability in narcolepsy: a PET study with [11C]-CFT. To investigate dopamine reuptake sites (dopamine transporter) in the caudate nucleus and putamen in narcolepsy.Ten patients with narcolepsy and 15 controls were studied with positron emission tomography. A cocaine analogue [11C]-CFT was used as a radioligand.The uptake of[11C]-CFT was within normal limits (89% of age-adjusted control mean in the caudate nucleus and 91% in the putamen) in patients with narcolepsy.No evidence of altered striataldopamine transporter availability was found in narcolepsy.
