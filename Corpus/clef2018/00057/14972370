Lack of sex differences in striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding in drug-naive schizophrenic patients: an IBZM-SPECT study. Differences in antipsychotic treatment response, clinical course and outcome of schizophrenia could be related to gender-related cerebral differences in anatomy and function. The aim of the study was to assess sex differences in the striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding in 15 drug-naive schizophrenic patients (seven males, eight females) using (123)I-IBZM single photon emission computed tomography. Basal ganglia/frontal cortex (BG/FC) uptake ratios were obtained. No significant differences were found in global, left and right BG/FC ratios or laterality indices between males and females. No correlation was found between BG/FC ratios and age, duration of illness or scores on symptom rating scales. Our data indicate a lack of sex differences in striatal D2 receptor binding in drug-naive schizophrenic patients and do not support previous reports of left lateralized striatal asymmetry in male schizophrenic patients.
