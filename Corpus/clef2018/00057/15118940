Nature-based therapy: its potential as a complementary approach to treating communication disorders. Nature-based therapy (NBT) has been incorporated into the practice of many medical and mental health professions. Occupational therapists, physical therapists, nurses, social workers, psychologists, and to a lesser extent, speech-language pathologists have used NBT practices as a complementary means of treating a variety of physical, emotional, and cognitive disorders. This article includes a description of NBT and the three types that comprise the practice and a review of the literature demonstrating the use of NBT in the general population and, more specifically, with individuals with neurogenic communication disorders. It concludes with a discussion of directions for future research of NBT.
