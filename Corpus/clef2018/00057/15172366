Volumetric model and human observer comparisons of tumor detection for whole-body positron emission tomography. The performances of model and human observers were compared for detecting and localizing tumors in whole-body positron emission tomography imaging. Volumetric implementations of model observers were used instead of standard planar implementations to reproduce the common practice of using volumetric image displays to assess whole-body positron emission tomography images.Observer studies with simulated data were used to compare three different acquisition protocols for an average patient size. Multiple realizations of simulated whole-body data with multiple added 1-cm diameter spherical lesions (targets) per image volume for efficiency were used. The location and contrast ratio of the targets were chosen randomly within ranges determined by initial calibration studies. Human observer studies were performed using a volumetric image display routinely used in clinical practice, and human observer detection performance was quantified using an alternate free-response operating characteristic analysis. The human detection performances were compared with the performances of volumetric implementations of the non-prewhitening matched filter and the channelized hotelling observer and also to the target contrast measured in the reconstructed image.Human observer detectability was generally well described as a linear function of these three figures of merit for the detection task considered. The best correlations (r = 0.96, rho = 0.98) were achieved with the channelized hotelling observer and non-prewhitening matched filter model observers.The use of volumetric model observers provides a means for quantitative comparisons of different protocols and also provides a useful tool for the optimization of key parameters in whole-body positron emission tomography imaging.
