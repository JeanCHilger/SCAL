Cloning and expression and immunogenicity of Helicobacter pylori BabA2 gene. To construct a recombinant strain which expresses BabA of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) and to study the immunogenicity of BabA.BabA2 DNA was amplified by PCR and inserted into the prokaryotie expression vector pET-22b (+) and expressed in the BL21 (DE3) E.coli strain. Furthermore, BabA immunogenicity was studied by animal test.DNA sequence analysis showed the sequence of BabA2 DNA was the same as the one published by GenBank. The BabA recombinant protein accounted for 34.8% of the total bacterial protein. The serum from H pylori infected patients and Balb/c miced immunized with BabA itself could recognize rBabA.BabA recombinant protein may be an potential vaccine for control and treatment of H pylori infection.
