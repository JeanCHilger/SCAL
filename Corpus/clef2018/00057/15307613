Comparative studies of the hydrogen ion exponent (rH) level in a natural spring carbonated water and unsaturated spring water in course of the water preservation in single packaging. Redox properties of the low mineralized unsaturated and saturated natural spring water determined with the aid of hydrogen ion exponent (rH). There was marked: redox potential, hydrogen ion activity (pH), electrical conductivity, and also consument oxygen (ChZT) for the bottled water in the glass or plastic containers of various sizes during preservation of the water, taking into consideration the utility limits as well as after the limited utility period. The sort of packing, it size and the water preservation period in the packing essentially influence the values of the hydrogen index in the examined water. Statistically important changes of pH values and Eh appeared in most of examined samples. The essential changes were confirmed in unsaturated especially in the PET type containers. The conclusion was: the determination of hydrogen ion exponent (rH) of the water may be applied to the water quality control during the preservation in a single packing.
