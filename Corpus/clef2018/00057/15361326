Role of neuroimaging in our understanding of the pathogenesis of primary headaches. This article reviews new advances in neuroimaging of primary headaches. Imaging of the brain is reaching a new stage of maturity as the basic neural systems that participate in the pathogenesis of headaches are identified. Given the rapid advances in functional neuroimaging, it is no surprise that recent studies have supported the neurovascular theory of migraine and cluster headache. It is clear that functional neuroimaging will continue to be of paramount importance and ultimately may serve as the bridge between molecular and clinical domains in the field of headache research.
