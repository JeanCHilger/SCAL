Surface free energies of silica fillers and their relation to the adsorption of poly(ethylene terephthalate). The surface free energy of modified silica as well as of PET oligomers was evaluated through measurements of specific retention volumes of several probe molecules by use of the adsorption and adhesion principles in inverse gas chromatography. The nondispersive component of surface free energy of most silica fillers was larger than the dispersive component and the acidic component was much larger than the basic one, which indicated that the surfaces of most silica fillers were rather acidic. These methods were also applied to PET oligomer and it was found that the surface free energy of PET oligomer, regardless of preparation method, consisted of an almost dispersive component, suggesting that the surface of PET was neutral. The amount of PET oligomer adsorbed for the heat-treated silica fillers in acidic solvent increased linearly with increased acidic component of the surface free energy, which indicates that the acidic component of the surface free energy may be responsible for the adsorption. However, the adsorption amount on modified silica is much smaller than that for the heat-treated silica fillers because of steric hindrance caused by the attached organic chain, suggesting that the adsorption cannot be determined only by the surface free energy.
