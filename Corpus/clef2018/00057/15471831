Clinical usefulness of 18F-FDG PET in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with questionable MRI findings for recurrence. It has been reported that 18F-FDG PET is highly sensitive for the detection of recurrent head-and-neck cancer. The objective of our prospective study was to validate the ability of this technique to detect the presence of tumors in primary, nodal, and distant sites as well as to assess its overall clinical usefulness in patients with questionable MRI findings for residual or recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).From January 2002 to October 2003, a group of 37 NPC patients whose postradiation follow-up MRI examination showed questionable residual or recurrent disease was assessed with 18F-FDG PET. 18F-FDG PET was interpreted visually. Disease at primary, nodal, and distant sites was assessed. The final diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically or with clinical and imaging follow-up of at least 6 mo.Our results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET for the detection of recurrent NPC were 91.6% and 76.0%, respectively, at the primary site 90.0% and 88.9%, respectively, at nodal sites18F-FDG PET is highly sensitive and moderately specific for the detection of recurrent NPC in patients with questionable MRI findings. Overall, 18F-FDG PET appears to add significant information to MRI findings in about half of the NPC patients whose MRI examination shows questionable tumor recurrence.
