Normal variants in [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging. The number of fluorodeoxyglucose PET applications is increasing. In the process of reading fluorodeoxyglucose-PET scans, nuclear medicine physicians encounter a wide variety of normal findings, which must be recognized to determine the best management for patients. It is important to recognize and understand normal variants to avoid misinterpretation of more serious pathology. This article reviews different patterns of physiologic fluorodeoxyglucose uptake including changes with age.
