Vascular graft infections: in vitro and in vivo investigations of a new vascular graft with long-term protection. We investigated a polyester vascular prosthesis (PET) coated with elemental silver (SC). Measurement of silver release over a period of 52 weeks by means of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry of PET with (PET-G) and without (PET-N) gelatine impregnation revealed a silver release on the first day of 1.2 +/- 0.2 microg (PET-N) and 1.2 +/- 0.1 microg (PET-G) (calculated for 1 g of prosthesis) from the 90th day onward, it was between 0.22 +/- 0.14 microg (PET-N) and 0.18 +/- 0.12 microg (PET-G) per day. The prostheses were incubated with Staphylococcus aureus (S.a.), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S.e.), or Escherichia coli (E.c.) to investigate in vitro antibacterial efficacy. After 6 h of incubation, no colony-forming units were to be seen for any of the bacterial suspensions for PET with SC (p < 0.001). To investigate in vivo antibacterial efficacy, PET-G rings with and without SC contaminated with S.a., S.e., or E.c. were implanted in 18 albino rabbits and examined 7 days after agar culture for 48 h. The silver coating was associated with a significant reduction in bacterial growth (S.a., p = 0.001
