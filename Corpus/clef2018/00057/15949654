Cortical intercorrelations of temporal area volumes in schizophrenia. Abnormal temporal connections with other cortical areas may underlie some of the most prominent cognitive deficits described in schizophrenia. In order to evaluate the relationship between temporal and other cortical regions in schizophrenia, we examined the intercorrelations of volumetric measures of gray and white matter for each Brodmann's area of the temporal lobe with volumes in the rest of the cortex in patients with schizophrenia and normal comparison subjects.MR images were acquired in normal subjects (n=46) and patients with schizophrenia (n=106), divided into good-outcome (n=52) and poor-outcome (Kraepelinian n=54) subtypesPositive frontotemporal intercorrelations were significantly stronger while negative frontotemporal intercorrelations were weaker in schizophrenia patients as compared to normal subjects. Correlations between the right temporal pole and other temporal regions were significantly weaker in schizophrenia patients than in controls. When compared to normal controls and good-outcome patients, schizophrenia patients with poor outcomes showed a selective pattern of stronger gray matter correlations between the medial temporal vs. primary visual and between primary auditory vs. dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, all in the left hemisphere.Strengthening of positive associations among the temporal and extratemporal (mainly frontal and occipital) regions as well as weakening of regional intercorrelations within the temporal lobe in patients appear to constitute the major differences of correlational patterns in schizophrenia patients and normal subjects. Present findings may be implicated in object recognition deficits seen in patients with schizophrenia, as well as in purportedly deficient spatial and semantic processing of both auditory and visual information that may be associated with poor outcome.
