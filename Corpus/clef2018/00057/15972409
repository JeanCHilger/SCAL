Effectiveness of delayed enhanced MRI for identification of cardiac sarcoidosis: comparison with radionuclide imaging. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of delayed enhanced MRI for detecting cardiac sarcoidosis and to clarify the relationship between the findings of MRI and those of radionuclide imaging.Delayed enhanced MRI is considered a useful method for the early identification of cardiac sarcoidosis. Delayed hyperenhancement is frequently associated with a reduction of regional wall motion and thallium-201 perfusion defects.
