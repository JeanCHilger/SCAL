Outcome 1 year after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: relation between cognitive performance and neuroimaging. To assess the cognitive impairment and the association between neuropsychological measures and neuroimaging 1 year after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).Forty-two patients were examined clinically according to Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Computed tomography (CT), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and neuropsychological examination were performed.There were no association between GOS and cognitive impairment index based on the neuropsychological examination. CT showed no sign of cerebral ischemia in 17 (40%) and low attenuating areas indicating cerebral infarction(s) in 25 (60%) patients. A significant correlation (P = 0.01) was observed between the cognitive impairment index and the SPECT index (r = 0.6). SPECT measurement was the only independent predictor for cognitive impairment.GOS is a crude outcome measure and patients classified with good recoveries may have significant cognitive deficits. Neuropsychological examination is the preferred method for outcome evaluation as this method specifically addresses the disabilities affecting patients' everyday life.
