Platinum and palladium complexes of thiosemicarbazones derived of 2-acetylthiophene: Synthesis and spectral studies. The reaction of 2-acetylthiophene thiosemicarbazone (2-HATT) and 2-acetylthiophene 4-phenylthiosemicarbazone (2-HAT-4-FT) with Pd(COD)Cl(2) (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) and trans-Pt(2)PEt(3)Cl(4) yielded four new metal complexes: [Pd(2-HATT)Cl(2)] (1), [Pd(2-ATT)(2)] (2), [Pd(2-AT-4-FT)Cl] (3) and [Pt(2-ATT)(PEt(3))Cl] (4). Apart from compound 3 all the others were characterised by (1)H and (13)C{(1)H} NMR, infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Multinuclear NMR experiments of (31)P{(1)H} and (195)Pt{(1)H} of complex 4 have revealed that the ligand 2-HATT behaves as a bidentate chelating agent towards Pd(COD)Cl(2) and trans-Pt(2)PEt(3)Cl(4) whereas ligand 2-HAT-4-FT forms a tridentate chelating complex with Pd(COD)Cl(2).
