Evaluation of commercial kits for the identification of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Eight identification methods were evaluated against 100 isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 21 non-gonococcal Neisseria strains. The methods examined included four commercial biochemical kits, API NH, RapID NH, Gonochek II and Neisseria Preformed Enzyme Test (PET), three immunological kits, Phadebact Monoclonal GC test, GonoGen II and MicroTrak, and one in-house carbohydrate-utilization method, cystine trypticase agar (CTA) sugars. The percentage of isolates unambiguously identified as N. gonorrhoeae by each of the methods was as follows: API NH, 66 % RapID NH, 64 %
