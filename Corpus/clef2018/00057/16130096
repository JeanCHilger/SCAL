Autism severity and temporal lobe functional abnormalities. Two independent studies have described bilateral temporal hypoperfusion in autistic children. Temporal regions are implicated in social perception, language, and "theory-of-mind," abilities that are impaired in autism. We investigated a putative relationship between cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measured at rest and clinical profile of 45 autistic children (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised [ADI-R] scores). A whole-brain covariance analysis was performed. Significant negative correlation was observed between rCBF and ADI-R score in the left superior temporal gyrus. The more severe the autistic syndrome, the more rCBF is low in this region, suggesting that left superior temporal hypoperfusion is related to autistic behavior severity.
