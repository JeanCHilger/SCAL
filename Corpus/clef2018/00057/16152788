Central and peripheral mechanisms of difficult breathing in man. The review is dedicated of phenomenology of the difficult breathing and analysis of the peripheral and central mechanisms of it. Analysis based on model investigations with resistive loads in awake or sleeping healthy humans, including results of experiments in the anesthetized animals. The recent data having principle importance in estimation of the central mechanisms of the control breathing are included too in the review. It concerned to the contemporary visualization of central neuronal activity on the awake person during dyspnoea. It became possible due to application of the unique precision equipment--functional magnetic--resonance and positron--emission tomography.
