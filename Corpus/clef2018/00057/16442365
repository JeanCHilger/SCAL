Usefulness of exercise myocardial scintigraphy in multivessel coronary disease after incomplete revascularization with coronary stenting. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the prognostic value of exercise myocardial scintigraphy in patients who undergo incomplete revascularization with percutaneous coronary stenting. In 322 consecutive patients (mean age 61 +/- 10 years), exercise technetium-99m-tetrofosmin single-photon emission computed tomography scintigraphy was prospectively performed 4 to 6 months after an incomplete revascularization procedure. Follow-up lasted < or = 84 months (median 33). Patients with normal findings were at low risk of cardiac events compared with patients with mildly abnormal and severely abnormal findings (yearly event rate 1.5% vs 5.1% and 8.5%, respectively, p < 0.01). A significant difference was observed in hard, soft, and composite event-free survival among patients with normal, mildly abnormal, and severely abnormal findings (p < 0.01, p < 0.03, and p < 0.01, respectively). Nuclear data provided significant incremental prognostic value for cardiac events compared with the clinical, angiographic, and exercise test findings. In conclusion, in patients with incomplete revascularization procedures, exercise myocardial scintigraphy provides significant independent information concerning the subsequent risk of cardiac events, with an annualized event rate of < 2% for patients with normal scan findings. Myocardial scintigraphy is able to provide incremental prognostic information after adjusting for clinical, angiographic, and exercise variables.
