Percutaneous renal cryoablation. Percutaneous renal cryoablation (PRC) has been gaining acceptance as a minimally invasive option for the treatment of patients with solid renal masses. Herein, we reviewed the historical development of PRC, relevant contemporary clinical data, and future directions of percutaneous approaches to renal masses. Early experience suggests that PRC has the potential to offer an alternative treatment for patients with small renal masses, with the advantages of decreased treatment-associated morbidity and spared renal function. Ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron-emission tomography have all been explored as potential solutions to the challenges of image guidance and follow-up distinct advantages and disadvantages of each are reviewed here. Encouraging early results regarding oncologic efficacy, rate of complications, and overall costs support the continued evaluation of PRC. Longer-term oncologic follow-up is essential if the potential application of this minimally-invasive technique to a broader spectrum of patients with renal masses is to be determined.
