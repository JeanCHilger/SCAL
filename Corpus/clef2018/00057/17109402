Use of transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy in the diagnosis of pelvic malignancies. To describe our experience with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided needle biopsy of pelvic malignancies.Eleven patients with clinical suspecion of advanced malignant pelvic tumor were referred to our institution with a history of unsuccessful CT-guided biopsy, although a target lesion was demonstrated on pelvic CT or MRI. Cholin-PET and FDG-18-PET were also obtained individually in each patient. TRUS was performed using a commercially available three-dimensional scanner. Biopsies were performed with an 18G biopsy gun. In 9 of 11 patients, biopsy was successfully performed under analgesia, whereas general anesthesia was required in the other 2 patients.The lesions were identified with TRUS in all patients, and biopsies were taken successfully under TRUS guidance. In all patients, the harvested material was of excellent quality and was adequate for definitive pathological diagnosis. Pathological results included 6 nodal metastases from transitional cell carcinoma, 1 case of lymph node metastasis from prostate cancer, 1 paravesical recurrence of cervical cancer, 1 metastasis from cecal cancer, and 2 cases of paravesical metastasis of a gastric cancer.TRUS-guided biopsy is a useful technique for the diagnosis of pelvic malignancies. It is faster and less expensive than CT-guided biopsy, and in most cases sufficient material can be harvested for a definitive pathological diagnosis.
