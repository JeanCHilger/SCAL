Pet keeping and dampness in the dwelling: associations with airway infections, symptoms, and physiological signs from the ocular and nasal mucosa. The aim was to utilize data from a study of occupational indoor environments to analyze symptoms and physiological signs in relation to the home environment. A medical investigation was performed at the workplace among university staff (n = 173) from four university buildings in Bergen, in March 2004. Tear film break up time (BUT) was measured by two methods. Nasal patency was measured by acoustic rhinometry. Nasal lavage fluid analysis (NAL) included eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) myeloperoxidase (MPO), lysozyme and albumin. Atopy was assessed by total serum IgE and specific IgE (Phadiatop). Totally 21%, 21%, 18%, 11%, and 27% had weekly ocular, nasal, facial dermal symptoms, headache and tiredness, respectively, 15% had a damp dwelling, and 20% had a cat or dog. Multiple linear or logistic regressions were applied, controlling for age gender, smoking, and environmental factors. Building dampness was associated with increased NAL-lysozyme (P = 0.02) and an increase of airway infections [odd ratio (OR) = 3.14, P = 0.04]. Pet keeping was associated with difficulties to concentrate (OR = 5.10, P = 0.001), heavy headedness (OR = 4.35, P = 0.004), four more days with tiredness per month (P = 0.04), and less airway infections (OR = 0.32The main health focus on pet keeping has been allergen exposure. Our study indicates that effects on airway infections and other types of symptoms should also be considered. The findings support the view that measures should be taken to reduce building dampness in dwellings.
