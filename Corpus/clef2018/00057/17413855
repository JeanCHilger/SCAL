Assessment of infant brain development with frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy. This is the first report to demonstrate quantitative monitoring of infant brain development with frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy (FD-NIRS). Regionally specific increases in blood volume and oxygen consumption were measured in healthy infants during their first year. The results agree with prior PET and SPECT reports but, unlike these methods, FD-NIRS is portable and uses nonionizing radiation. Further, new information includes the relatively constant tissue oxygenation with age and location, suggesting a tight control between local oxygen delivery and consumption in healthy infants during brain development. FD-NIRS could become the preferred clinical tool for quantitatively assessing infant brain development.
