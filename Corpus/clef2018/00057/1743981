Positron emission tomography in the investigation of neuropsychiatric disorders: update and comparison with magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography. In many neuropsychiatric disorders, PET imaging offers functional insights unavailable from anatomic imaging alone. Functional deficits may be more extensive than structural findings would indicate, may occur before the detection of anatomic changes, or may even occur in the absence of any structural lesions. We contrast the current role of PET with that of MRI and CT in the investigation of neuropsychiatric disorders including stroke, tumor, head trauma, epilepsy, schizophrenia, movement disorders, normal aging and dementia.
