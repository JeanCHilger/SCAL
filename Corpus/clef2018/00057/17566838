Up-to-date management of lymph node metastasis and the role of tailored lymphadenectomy in cervical cancer. Lymph node metastasis (LNM), together with parametrial infiltration and positive surgical margins, is an important prognostic factor in cervical cancer. The incidence of LNM increases with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, with rates being 12%-22% in stage Ib, 10%-27% in stage IIa, and 34%-43% in stage IIb. Radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy are widely used treatments for early-stage (Ib to IIa) cervical cancer, as well as for stage IIb disease, in some European and Asian countries. In several types of cancer, the therapeutic significance of systematic lymphadenectomy has been demonstrated by recent reports showing that a larger number of lymph nodes removed relates to better survival. In cervical cancer, a significant relationship between the number of lymph nodes removed and disease-free survival has been reported in node-positive patients. Preoperative evaluation of nodal status with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging techniques is not sensitive enough to replace the histological examination of dissected nodes. The sentinel node procedure may be an alternative to systematic lymphadenectomy to reduce treatment-related morbidity, but more work on this is needed. Although the presence of LNM does not change FIGO staging, it will modulate postoperative therapy. Progression-free and overall survivals were significantly improved by the addition of chemotherapy to adjuvant radiotherapy after radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy. Adjuvant chemotherapy combined solely with radical hysterectomy and systematic lymphadenectomy may also provide a survival benefit. In conclusion, efforts to establish more tailored surgical strategies, by introducing advanced imaging technologies and molecular diagnostic procedures, are needed for cervical cancer.
