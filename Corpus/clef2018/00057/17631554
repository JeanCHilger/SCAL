Diagnostic and prognostic value of 18F-FDG PET/CT for patients with suspected recurrence from squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) are commonly at high risk of recurrence within 2 y after initial treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with possibly recurrent ESCC who underwent definitive treatment.Fifty-six patients with previously treated ESCC underwent PET/CT scans. The PET/CT findings were validated by histopathology or clinical follow-up of at least 6 mo. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PET/CT for detecting recurrence were calculated. Comparison of the standardized uptake value (SUV) was performed between patients grouped according to their status at the last follow-up (relapsed or relapse-free, alive or dead). The overall survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate independent prognostic variables for both univariate and multivariate survival analysis.Forty-five (80.4%) patients had recurrence in 72 (66.1%) malignant sites. On PET/CT, there were 9 false-positive and 5 false-negative results. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PET/CT for detecting recurrence at all sites were 93.1% (67/72), 75.7% (28/37), and 87.2% (95/109), respectively. PET/CT was highly sensitive, specific, and accurate at regional and distant sites. At local sites, sensitivity was high, but specificity was lower (50%) because of a high incidence of false-positive findings. Patients who were confirmed with recurrence or who had died at the last follow-up had higher SUVs (P = 0.027 and <0.001, respectively). In multivariate survival analysis, therapeutic modality (hazard ratio = 0.437 P = 0.044), SUV (hazard ratio = 1.07118F-FDG PET/CT is highly effective for detecting recurrent ESCC. The relatively low specificity at local sites is associated primarily with a high rate of false-positive interpretations at anastomoses. PET/CT can also provide noninvasive and independent prognostic information using SUV and recurrent disease pattern on PET/CT images for previously treated ESCC.
