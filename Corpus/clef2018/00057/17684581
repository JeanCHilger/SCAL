Drug development parameters for functional imaging in neurosciences. State-of-the-art radioactive drug development has become a helpful tool in new functional imaging technologies in neurosciences. Drug development programs are evaluated in terms of effective biodistribution, costs and time. This article details the existing drug development parameters for neuroimaging and highlights some examples, as in Parkinson's disease, alcoholic neuritis and psychotic diseases, showing the benefit and the potential of using new functional neuroimaging technologies for specific studies of the central nervous system.
