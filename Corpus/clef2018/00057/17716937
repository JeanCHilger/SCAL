An active learning approach to the physics of medical imaging. This paper describes an experimentally oriented medical imaging course where the students record, process and analyse 3D data of an unknown piece of formalin fixed porcine tissue hidden in agar in order to estimate the tissue types present in a selected 2D slice. The recorded planar X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound and SPECT images show the tissue in very different ways. The students can only estimate the tissue type by studying the physical principles of the imaging modalities. The true answer is later revealed by anatomical photographs obtained from physical slicing. The paper describes the phantoms and methods used in the course. Sample images recorded with the different imaging modalities are provided. Challenges faced by the students are outlined. Results of the course show high increase in competencies as judged from graded reports, low course drop-out rate, high pass-rate at the exam, high student participation and large student satisfaction.
