Assessment of myocardial perfusion by dynamic O-15-labeled water PET imaging: validation of a new fast factor analysis. Factor analysis (FA) is an established method for separating myocardium from blood pool by use of oxygen 15-labeled water and positron emission tomography for analyzing myocardial blood flow (MBF). Conventional FA methods generating images from sinograms (sinoFA) are time-consuming, whereas FA can be performed on the reconstructed images (reconFA) in a fraction of time. We validated the MBF values obtained by reconFA versus sinoFA.In 23 volunteers (mean age, 26.6 +/- 3.4 years) MBF was calculated from sinoFA and reconFA and blindly reanalyzed 1 month later by the same observer. Intraobserver agreement and reconFA-versus-sinoFA agreement were assessed according to Bland and Altman (BA). Reproducibility proved excellent for global sinoFA (r = 0.968 P < .001Use of reconFA allows rapid and reliable quantitative MBF assessment with O-15-labeled water.
