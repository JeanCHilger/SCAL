Imaging of topographic viral CNS infections. Infections caused by enteroviruses, rabies, adenoviruses, and Nipah and Hanta viruses are discussed. Several studies defined the pattern of MR imaging findings in these disease processes that reflect parenchymal infiltration with inflammatory cells, typically visualized as areas of low attenuation on CT, as well as of low T1 and high T2 signal intensity on MR imaging. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging has been shown to be superior to conventional magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of early signal abnormalities in encephalitis. Focal unilateral hyperperfusion as visualized by SPECT appears to be an indicator of severe inflammation of the brain tissue and was found to be an independent predictor of poor prognosis, whereas clinical outcome variables, CSF, or EEG findings are not.
