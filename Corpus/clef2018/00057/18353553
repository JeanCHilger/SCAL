Correlation between anosognosia and regional cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of this study was to determine the brain regions associated with anosognosia in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Anosognosia for memory disturbance was assessed in 29 probable AD patients, based on the discrepancy between questionnaire scores of the patients and their caregivers. In I-123-IMP single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), a significant association was found between anosognosia and decreased perfusion in the orbitofrontal cortex, using regression analysis. This result is consistent with the previous studies that have reported an association between frontal dysfunction and anosognosia, and further suggests that the orbitofrontal cortex specifically associates with anosognosia in AD within the frontal cortex.
