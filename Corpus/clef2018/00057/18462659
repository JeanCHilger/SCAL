Effect of coronary revascularization in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who satisfy viability criteria on gated-SPECT assessment of myocardial perfusion. Study on the effects of coronary revascularization and medical treatment on the prognosis of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who satisfy myocardial viability criteria on gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) assessment of myocardial perfusion. In total, 140 consecutive patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy were studied at rest using gated-SPECT and technetium-labeled contrast agents. During a mean follow-up period of 2.3 years after gated-SPECT, the rate of cardiac death in patients who underwent coronary revascularization (n=50) was 16% compared with 26.7% in those who received medical treatment (n=90). Thus, coronary revascularization had a protective effect (hazard ratio = 0.42 95% confidence interval, 0.17-1.02) in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who satisfied myocardial viability criteria.
