Imaging of urinary tract tumors. In summary, imaging now has an important role in the evaluation of patients with invasive bladder cancer. It is useful in staging of bladder cancer, despite having some limitations. CT is widely accessible and has enjoyed rapid advances in multidetector technology which have far-reaching applications. MRI, due to its intrinsic tissue characterization, is reported to have a higher accuracy for staging bladder cancer. It is superior to CT in determining the depth of bladder wall invasion. CT, as well as traditional MRI, rely on morphological criteria and are both useful in the detection of metastases to the lymph nodes, liver and bone. MRI, however, can now also take advantage of the tremendous advance in lymph node evaluation brought about by the advent of USPIO nodal imaging. MRI is also considered superior in follow-up of patients with bladder cancer post-therapy as it can distinguish biopsy changes more accurately than CT. In conclusion, it is clear that imaging plays a growing and increasingly important role in the evaluation of patients with bladder cancer.
