Prognosis after transient ischemic attacks. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are reversible neurological deficits due to cerebral ischemia in a vascular territory lasting less than 24 hours, usually less than one hour. The natural course of TIAs is variable. One third of the patients suffer from a subsequent completed stroke with lasting disability, one third of the patients continues to experience TIAs and in one third no further symptoms are encountered. TIAs are a warning symptom of a generalized vascular process, myocardial infarction being the most common cause of mortality and ischemic brain infarction being the most common cause of morbidity. Clinical parameters--besides age--seem to be of minor prognostic relevance. Vascular risk factors should be evaluated in all TIA patients especially, a cardiac work up including 2D-echocardiography and an exercise stress test should be performed. Duplex sonography of craniocervical vessels shows atherosclerotic lesions in a considerable proportion of patients with TIA
