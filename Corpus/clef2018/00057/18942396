Use of 18F-FDG PET scan in the diagnosis of large liver neoplasms and in the evaluation of therapeutic effectiveness. The study involved 207 patients with large-size tumors. Results of 18FDG PET pointed to the basic factor of malignant transformation--foci of enhanced accumulation of radiological medicinal substances. Absence of ultrasound and CT-based evidence of such pathological accumulations contributed to interpretation of changes as benign ones. The effectiveness of chemotherapy was assessed by tumor metabolic response to treatment given at the time of 18FDG PET examination.
