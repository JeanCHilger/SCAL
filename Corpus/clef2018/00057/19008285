The effect of renal failure on 18F-FDG uptake: a theoretic assessment. This work addresses the issue of using (18)F-FDG PET in patients with renal failure.A model analysis has been developed to compare tissue (18)F-FDG uptake in a patient who has normal renal function with uptake in a theoretic limiting case that assumes tracer plasma decay is tracer physical decay and is trapped irreversibly.This comparison has allowed us to propose, in the limiting case, that the usually injected activity be lowered by a factor of 3. We also proposed that the PET static acquisition be obtained at about 160 min after tracer injection. These 2 proposals were aimed at obtaining a similar patient radiation dose and similar tissue (18)F-FDG uptake.In patients with arbitrary renal failure (i.e., between the 2 extremes of normal function and the theoretic limiting case), we propose that the injected activity be lowered (without exceeding a factor of 3) and that the acquisition be started between 45 and 160 min after tracer injection, depending on the severity of renal failure. Furthermore, the model also shows that the more severe the renal failure is, the more overestimated is the standardized uptake value, unless the renal failure indirectly impairs tissue sensitivity to insulin and hence glucose metabolism.
