Do bone marrow isolated tumor cells influence long-term survival of non-small cell lung cancer? Inconsistent information on the prognostic significance of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) isolated tumor cells (ITC) has been reported to date. We sought to evaluate the survival for NSCLC in a group of patients in which the presence of bone marrow isolated tumor cells and their DNA ploidy was assessed.Seventy patients (58 males [83%] median age 70 years, range 49-89) with T1-4, N0, M0 clinical staging entered the studyRib bone marrow ITC were documented in 17 patients (25%), 6 with DNA euploidy (p stage: I 4 III 2), and 11 with DNA aneuploidy (p stage: I 5The prognostic role of bone marrow ITC seems to be corroborated by DNA ploidy studies. Patients with bone marrow ITC with abnormal DNA content showed a significantly reduced survival particularly in stage I NSCLC.
