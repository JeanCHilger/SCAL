PET and PET-CT of malignant tumors of the exocrine pancreas. Adenocarcinomas of the pancreas represent the majority (>95%) of all malignant pancreatic tumors. They are formed from malignant degeneration of the exocrine part of the pancreas. Cystic acinar tumors are much rarer and originate from secretion-producing parenchymal cells of the pancreas. Endocrine tumors of the pancreas will not be dealt with in this context.
