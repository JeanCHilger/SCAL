99mTc-HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy is superior to 131I-MIBG imaging in the evaluation of extraadrenal pheochromocytoma. In this investigation, the efficacy of scintigraphy using (99m)Tc-labeled hydrazinonicotinyl-Tyr3-octreotide (HYNIC-TOC) in the evaluation of extraadrenal pheochromocytoma was assessed and compared with (131)I-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging.Ninety-seven patients who were suspected of having pheochromocytoma but showed no definite adrenal abnormalities on CT were evaluated by both (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy and (131)I-MIBG imaging. The results were compared with pathology findings or clinical follow-up.Of 58 patients proven to be without pheochromocytoma, (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC and (131)I-MIBG imaging excluded 56 and 58 patients, respectively, rendering a specificity of 96.6% for (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC imaging and 100% for (131)I-MIBG imaging. In the evaluation of adrenal pheochromocytoma (14 patients), the sensitivity of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy and (131)I-MIBG imaging was 50% and 85.7%, respectively. However, in the evaluation of extraadrenal pheochromocytomas (25 patients), the sensitivity of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy and (131)I-MIBG imaging was 96.0% and 72.0%, respectively.(99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy is more sensitive than (131)I-MIBG imaging in the detection of extraadrenal pheochromocytomas.
