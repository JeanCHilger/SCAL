Discovery and in vitro and in vivo profiles of 4-fluoro-N-[4-[6-(isopropylamino)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]-N-methylbenzamide as novel class of an orally active metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) antagonist. We identified 4-fluoro-N-[4-[6-(isopropylamino)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]-N-methylbenzamide 27 as a potent mGluR1 antagonist. The compound possessed excellent subtype selectivity and good PK profile in rats. It also demonstrated relatively potent antipsychotic-like effects in several animal models. Suitable for development as a PET tracer, compound 27 would have great potential for elucidation of mGluR1 functions in human.
