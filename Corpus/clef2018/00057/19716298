Fully automated synthesis and initial PET evaluation of [11C]PBR28. Fully automated synthesis and initial PET evaluation of a TSPO radioligand, [11C]PBR28 (N-(2-[11C]methoxybenzyl)-N-(4-phenoxypyridin-3-yl)acetamide), are reported. These results facilitate the potential preclinical and clinical PET studies of [11C]PBR28 in animals and humans.
