Giant cell arteritis as a cardiovascular entity. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a relatively infrequent disorder that is underdiagnosed and little appraised in the field of general cardiology. However, it is important to be familiar with the clinical picture of this disease, especially because of the risk of developing fatal aortic aneurysms. If the disease is suspected after a thorough history and clinical examination combined with laboratory investigation, the diagnosis can be confirmed with (18)F-2-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomographic (FDG-PET) imaging. Early recognition of giant cell arteritis followed by prompt treatment with glucocorticosteroids will decrease the risk of developing large-vessel complications. (Neth Heart J 200917:281-3.).
