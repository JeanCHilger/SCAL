Nigrostriatal dysfunction in homozygous and heterozygous parkin gene carriers: an 18F-dopa PET progression study. Little is known about the rate of progression of striatal dysfunction in subjects with parkin-linked parkinsonism. Being a heterozygous parkin gene carrier may confer susceptibility to Parkinson's disease (PD). In a previous (18)F-dopa PET study, we reported that 69% of carriers of a single parkin mutation showed subclinical loss of putamen dopaminergic function. Using serial (18)F-dopa PET, the present longitudinal study addresses rates of progression of nigrostriatal dysfunction in both compound heterozygous (parkin-linked parkinsonism) and single heterozygous parkin gene carriers. Three symptomatic patients who were compound heterozygotes for parkin gene mutations and six asymptomatic heterozygous carriers were clinically assessed and had (18)F-dopa PET at baseline and again after 5 years. The patients with symptomatic parkin showed a mean 0.5% annual reduction in putamen (18)F-dopa uptake over 5 years while caudate (18)F-dopa uptake declined by a mean annual rate of 2 %. The asymptomatic heterozygote gene carriers showed a mean 0.56% annual reduction in putamen and 0.62 % annual reduction in caudate (18)F-dopa uptake. Neurological examination at both baseline and follow-up showed no evidence of parkinsonism. Loss of nigrostriatal dysfunction in parkin-linked parkinsonism occurs at a very slow rate compared to the 9-12% annual loss of putamen (18)F-dopa uptake reported for idiopathic PD. Although subclinical reductions of striatal (18)F-dopa uptake are common in carriers of a single parkin mutation their slow rate of progression suggests that few if any of these will develop clinical parkinsonism.
