Utility of bone SPECT-CT in percutaneous vertebroplasty. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive procedure that has shown excellent results in the treatment of back pain due to acute-subacute vertebral fracture. The bone scintigraphy shows the increase of metabolic exchange in the fracture. The new hybrid SPECT-CT equipment combines bone SPECT images with Computed Tomography (CT), making it possible to obtain more combined, functional and anatomical information. We present 5 selected patients studied by bone SPECT-CT in whom fused images made it possible to obtain a more precise localization of the pain origin, and thus assess other possible causes of the vertebral pain or even reassess the vertebroplasty indication.
