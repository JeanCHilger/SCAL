Utility of various functional and anatomic imaging modalities for detection of ectopic adrenocorticotropin-secreting tumors. Because ectopic ACTH-secreting (EAS) tumors are often occult, improved imaging is needed.Our objective was to evaluate the utility of [(111)In-DTPA-d-Phe]pentetreotide scintigraphy [octreotide (OCT)] imaging at 6 mCi [low OCT (LOCT)] and 18 mCi [high OCT (HOCT)], [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) and [(18)F]l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (F-DOPA)-PET scans, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).The study was a prospective evaluation at a clinical research center.Forty-one subjects participated, 30 (17 female) with resected EAS tumors and 11 (three female) with occult EAS, based on inferior petrosal sinus sampling results and imaging studies.INTERVENTION included CT and MRI of neck, chest, abdomen, LOCT (with or without HOCT) and FDG- or F-DOPA-PET without CT every 6-12 months.Tumor identification was the main outcome measure.Most recent results were analyzed. Eighteen patients had tumor resected on the first visit otherwise, surgery occurred 33 +/- 25 (9-99) months later. Tumor size was 1.9 +/- 1.7 (0.8-8.0) cmHigh sensitivity and PPV suggest thoracic CT/MRI plus LOCT scans for initial imaging, with lesion confirmation by two modalities.
