Advances in head and neck imaging. Imaging plays a key role in dental implantation, management of maxillofacial trauma, facial reconstruction, temporomandibular joint pathology, and evaluation and treatment of neoplasms and infections. In addition to traditional conventional radiography, recent advances in computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography-computed tomography fusion technology have made radiology an even more vital component of patient care in dental and craniomaxillofacial practice.
