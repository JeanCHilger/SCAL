SPECT imaging with the serotonin transporter radiotracer [123I]p ZIENT in nonhuman primate brain. Serotonin dysfunction has been linked to a variety of psychiatric diseases however, an adequate SPECT radioligand to probe the serotonin transporter system has not been successfully developed. The purpose of this study was to characterize and determine the in vivo selectivity of iodine-123-labeled 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4'-((Z)-2-iodoethenyl)phenyl)nortropane, [(123)I]p ZIENT, in nonhuman primate brain.Two ovariohysterectomized female baboons participated in nine studies (one bolus and eight bolus to constant infusion at a ratio of 9.0 h) to evaluate [(123)I]p ZIENT. To evaluate the selectivity of [(123)I]p ZIENT, the serotonin transporter blockers fenfluramine (1.5, 2.5 mg/kg) and citalopram (5 mg/kg), the dopamine transporter blocker methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg) and the norepinephrine transporter blocker nisoxetine (1 mg/kg) were given at 8 h post-radiotracer injection.In the bolus to constant infusion studies, equilibrium was established by 4-8 h. [(123)I]p ZIENT was 93% and 90% protein bound in the two baboons and there was no detection of lipophilic radiolabeled metabolites entering the brain. In the high-density serotonin transporter regions (diencephalon and brainstem), fenfluramine and citalopram resulted in 35-71% and 129-151% displacement, respectively, whereas methylphenidate and nisoxetine did not produce significant changes (<10%).These findings suggest that [(123)I]p ZIENT is a favorable compound for in vivo SPECT imaging of serotonin transporters with negligible binding to norepinephrine and dopamine transporters.
