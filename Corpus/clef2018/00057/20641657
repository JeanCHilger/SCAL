2´-Deoxy-2´-[ Herpes simplex virus type-1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) can be used as a suicide gene for gene therapy. As of today, animal studies using HSV1-tk gene and ganciclovir (1) have brought some success in treating malignant tumors with suicide gene therapy however, clinical results showed that such methods did not provide sufficient gene delivery to the tumor human cells for therapy (2). HSV1-tk can phosphorylate a wide range of nucleoside analogs (e.g. acycloguanosines and 2'-deoxyfuranosyluracil nucleoside derivatives) that are not phosphorylated efficiently by the native enzyme (3). The presence of fluorine in the 2'-arabino position in a furanosyluracil nucleoside results in enhanced monophosphorylation by HSV-tk type 1 and type 2 compared with the host thymidine kinase.
