Use of the 82Sr/82Rb generator in clinical PET studies. The use of the 82Sr/82Rb generator in clinical positron emission tomography (PET) studies of myocardial perfusion has been described. An infusion pump is used to deliver the short-lived 82Rb from the generator to the patient. Various characteristics of the generator and the infusion system are described. The 82Rb yield was 69.8 +/- 13.3% and the 82Sr breakthrough was always less than the limit of 0.02 microCi/mCi 82Rb. The yield of 82Rb increased with the flow rate and the potency of the generator. Patients with coronary artery disease were studied for myocardial perfusion abnormalities by the 82Rb PET technique and images of excellent diagnostic quality were obtained.
