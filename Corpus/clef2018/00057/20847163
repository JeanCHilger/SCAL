Multicenter evaluation of a standardized protocol for rest and acetazolamide cerebral blood flow assessment using a quantitative SPECT reconstruction program and split-dose 123I-iodoamphetamine. SPECT can provide valuable diagnostic and treatment response information in large-scale multicenter clinical trials. However, SPECT has been limited in providing consistent quantitative functional parametric values across the centers, largely because of a lack of standardized procedures to correct for attenuation and scatter. Recently, a novel software package has been developed to reconstruct quantitative SPECT images and assess cerebral blood flow (CBF) at rest and after acetazolamide challenge from a single SPECT session. This study was aimed at validating this technique at different institutions with a variety of SPECT devices and imaging protocols.Twelve participating institutions obtained a series of SPECT scans on physical phantoms and clinical patients. The phantom experiments included the assessment of septal penetration for each collimator used and of the accuracy of the reconstructed images. Clinical studies were divided into 3 protocols, including intrainstitutional reproducibility, a comparison with PET, and rest-rest study consistency. The results from 46 successful studies were analyzed.Activity concentration estimation (Bq/mL) in the reconstructed SPECT images of a uniform cylindric phantom showed an interinstitution variation of ±5.1%, with a systematic underestimation of concentration by 12.5%. CBF values were reproducible both at rest and after acetazolamide on the basis of repeated studies in the same patient (mean ± SD difference, -0.4 ± 5.2 mL/min/100 g, n = 44). CBF values were also consistent with those determined using PET (-6.1 ± 5.1 mL/min/100 g, n = 6).This study demonstrates that SPECT can quantitatively provide physiologic functional images of rest and acetazolamide challenge CBF, using a quantitative reconstruction software package.
