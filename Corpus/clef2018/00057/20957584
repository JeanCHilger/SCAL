Do semantic categories activate distinct cortical regions? Evidence for a distributed neural semantic system. A key issue in cognitive neuroscience concerns the neural representation of conceptual knowledge. Currently, debate focuses around the issue of whether there are neural regions specialised for the processing of specific semantic attributes or categories, or whether concepts are represented in an undifferentiated neural system. Neuropsychological studies of patients with selective semantic deficits and previous neuroimaging studies do not unequivocally support either account. We carried out a PET study to determine whether there is any regional specialisation for the processing of concepts from different semantic categories using picture stimuli and a semantic categorisation task. We found robust activation of a large semantic network extending from left inferior frontal cortex into the inferior temporal lobe and including occipital cortex and the fusiform gyrus. The only category effect that we found was additional activation for animals in the right occipital cortex, which we interpret as being due to the extra visual processing demands required in order to differentiate one animal from another. We also carried out analyses in specific cortical regions that have been claimed to be preferentially activated for various categories, but found no evidence of any differential activation as a function of category. We interpret these data within the framework of cognitive accounts in which conceptual knowledge is represented within a nondifferentiated distributed system.
