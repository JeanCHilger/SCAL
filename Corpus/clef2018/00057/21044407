Glycoalkaloid content in pet food by UPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. The glycoalkaloid content of pet food containing potatoes is investigated using a liquid-liquid solvent extraction followed by analysis by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS-MS). Pet food samples are homogenized and extracted with a solution of 50:50 (v/v) acetonitrile-deionized water containing 5% acetic acid. Following vortexing and centrifugation, 3 mL of the supernatant is filtered and diluted in deionized water. The extract is injected onto a reverse phase C18 UPLC column with an initial mobile phase composed of 0.15% acetic acid in water (A) and 0.15% acetic acid in methanol (B) in a ratio of 70:30, respectively. The mobile phase reaches a final concentration of 15% A and 85% B over 10 min, at which point it is returned to the initial conditions. α-Solanine is measured by monitoring transitions m/z = 868.50 → 398.40 and 868.50 → 722.50, while α-chaconine is measure by monitoring transitions m/z = 852.60 → 97.80 and 852.60 → 706.50. Each analyte is measured and combined to determine total glycoalkaloid content (TGA). The results of the analysis of 52 pet food samples indicate both glycoalkaloids are present in all samples and two pet foods were found to contain > 100 μg/g total glycoalkaloid.
