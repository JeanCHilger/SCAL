Impact of medication discontinuation on increased intestinal FDG accumulation in diabetic patients treated with metformin. We evaluated the impact of stopping medication for 2 days on reductions in the high intestinal FDG uptake induced by metformin.One hundred thirty-eight diabetic patients were divided into two groups: one in which the antihyperglycemic drug regimen included metformin (group A n = 107) and one in which the regimen did not include metformin (group BThe high intestinal FDG uptake in group A1 was significantly reduced after the discontinuation of metformin (p < 0.001 vs group A2) thus, there were no significant differences among group A2, group B, and group C (p = 0.581-0.872). There were also no statistically significant differences in the blood glucose levels among the three groups of diabetic patients (p > 0.9). In 10 patients who underwent serial PET/CT scans, mean intestinal FDG uptake decreased by 64% without significant changes in the blood glucose level. Hidden colorectal malignancies were revealed in two patients after the discontinuation of medication.The discontinuation of metformin for 2 days is feasible for reducing the high intestinal FDG uptake induced by metformin.
