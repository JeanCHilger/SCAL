Anomalies of coronary arteries. Concealed undiagnosed congenital anomalies of coronary arteries (CACA) can cause sudden death of young men. Isolated CACA are detected at 0.6-1.8% of coronary angiographies. Classification of CACA (2002) includes anomalous origin of coronary artery from pulmonary artery, anomalous origin of coronary artery from the aorta, congenital atresia of the left main coronary artery, coronary arteriovenous fistula, coronary artery with myocardial bridge, coronary artery aneurism, coronary artery stenosis. In most cases coronary artery anomalies for long time remain asymptomatic. Clinical picture of anomalous origin of coronary artery from pulmonary artery is often erroneously related to cardiomyopathy or myocarditis because of signs of heart failure. Modern methods of visualization are used for diagnosis of CACA: echocardiography (transthoracic and transesophageal), computer angiotomography (electron beam tomography, multispiral computer tomography), magnetic resonance angiography, thallium stress scintigraphy, single photon positron emission tomography, dobutamine stress echocardiography, endovascular ultrasound study. Coronary angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis of congenital anomalies of coronary arteries. Drug therapy, transluminal balloon angioplasty with stenting or surgical revascularization are indicated to patients with overt clinical picture.
