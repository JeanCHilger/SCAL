Positron emission tomography as predictor of rectal cancer response during or following neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Positron emission tomography (PET) shows great promise as a tool to evaluate the effectiveness of rectal cancer neoadjuvant therapy as it has demonstrated high predictive value in several studies. Creating a standardized method of using PET has the potential to reduce ineffective treatments. However, relevant studies have been heterogenous in approach, making any unified standard difficult to establish. PET related parameters used to assess treatment response include magnitude and change of standard uptake value, total lesion glycolysis, and visual response. Finding the best evaluation interval and parameters to use for interpreting PET results in the neo-adjuvant treatment of rectal cancer needs additional study.
