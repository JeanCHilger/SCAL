PET evaluation of inflammatory process in Takayasu's arteritis. To determine the application of PET in monitoring patients with Takayasu's arteritis (TA) with Inflammatory activiti (IA) and this correlation with established clnical criteria.35 patients diagnosed with TA were enrolled. Determination of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C -reactive protein, fibrinogen and a complete blood count was performed and clinical criteria of activity were applied. A baseline PET was performed in all patients. Those who were positive for IA received drug treatment. Among the group of active patients, ten were randomized to undergo another PET scan and clinical criteria determination to evaluate inflammatory activity after 6 months of treatment. We compared clinical criteria with PET capacity to determine IA. The results between the initial and final PET were finally compared.Clinical criteria had a sensitvity of 63% and a specificity of 90% to show IA. Sensivity decreased after 6 months of treatment to 27%.This is the first prospective study that compares the findings of PET before and after treatment for IA in patients with TA. Clinical criteria lack sensitivity for the detection of IA in the follow-up after treatment.PET is a diagnostic technique with high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with TA and inflammatory activity.
