The effect of fosinopril sodium on cerebral blood flow in moderate essential hypertension. The effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor fosinopril sodium on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was investigated in 8 patients with moderate essential hypertension. A constant dose of chlorthalidone (25 mg/day) was given to stimulate the renin angiotensin system, and fosinopril sodium was given in incremental doses (10 to 40 mg/day) with the aim of obtaining a diastolic blood pressure at or below 90 mm Hg. Regional CBF was measured with xenon-133 inhalation tomography. Repetitive measurements were made at the start of treatment and again after 4 to 12 weeks treatment in the resting supine position, and during lower body negative pressure (LBNP) as a substitute for the upright position. Four hours after the first 10 mg dose of fosinopril the mean arterial pressure (MAP) had been reduced from 127 +/- 13 mm Hg to 105 +/- 9 mm Hg (P less than .01) without any significant change in mean CBF (55 +/- 9 mL/(100 g X min) at baseline versus 52 +/- 9 mL/(100 g X min) after fosinopril). After prolonged treatment with chlorthalidone and fosinopril, mean CBF was still unchanged from baseline levels, when measured 4 and 24 h after a single dose of fosinopril, despite a 10% reduction in MAP (P less than .01). LBNP did not lead to any significant change in rCBF. The regional distribution of CBF was normal in all patients throughout the study. We conclude that treatment with fosinopril sodium causes a moderate fall in blood pressure without any adverse effects on rCBF.
