Synthesis and in vivo evaluation of 201Tl(III)-DOTA complexes for applications in SPECT imaging. The aim of this study was to assess the use of (201)thallium(3+) ((201)Tl(3+)) as a radiolabel for nuclear imaging tracers. Methods for labeling of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N″,N'″ tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) chelators with (201)Tl(3+) were investigated, and the levels of stability of these chelates were tested in vitro and in vivo.(201)Tl(I)Cl was treated with hydrochloric acid and ozone to form (201)Tl(III)Cl(3). The procedure for labeling of DOTA and DTPA was optimized, testing different buffer solutions and pH values. The stability levels of (201)Tl(III)-DOTA and (201)Tl(III)-DTPA were assessed in buffer, mouse serum and human serum (1:1, v/v) at a temperature of 310 K for 48 h. Subsequently, in vivo stability studies with (201)Tl(III)-DOTA were performed, comparing the biodistribution of (201)Tl(III)-DOTA with that of (201)Tl(I)Cl in a single-isotope study and with that of (177)Lu(III)-DOTA in a dual-isotope single photon emission computed tomography study.(201)Tl(III)-DTPA, (201)Tl(III)-DOTA and (177)Lu(III)-DOTA were prepared with >95% radiochemical purity. While (201)Tl(III)-DOTA showed a prolonged level of stability in buffer and serum, (201)Tl was quickly released from DTPA in serum. Apart from some urinary excretion, the biodistribution of DOTA-chelated (201)Tl(3+) was similar to that of free (ionic) (201)Tl(+) and did not match the biodistribution of (177)Lu(III)-DOTA. This indicated a limited stability of (201)Tl(III)-DOTA complexes in vivo.Despite promising results on the labeling and in vitro stability of (201)Tl(III)-DOTA, our in vivo results indicate that the integrity of (201)Tl(III)-DOTA decreases to <20% during the time required for urinary excretion, thereby limiting the use of (201)Tl(3+) as a radiolabel for tracer imaging.
