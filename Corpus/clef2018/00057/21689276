Preliminary experience with external hemipelvectomy for locally advanced and recurrent pelvic carcinoma. Eight highly selected patients are reported, undergoing external hemipelvectomy (EHP) for malignant infiltration of the lumbosacral neural plexus.All patients were evaluated by positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), CT and magnetic resonance imaging. No evidence of disseminated disease was found. With agreement by the multidisciplinary team, surgery was performed by a colorectal surgeon and an orthopaedic sarcoma surgeon and, if needed, by an urologist and vascular surgeon. Patients were reconstructed with either a femoral or a gluteal musculocutaneous flap.Of the eight women [median age 54.5 (40-68) years], two had primary carcinoma and six local recurrence of a previously treated carcinoma. R0 was possible in six patients and R1 resection in two. The median duration of hospital stay was 29.5 (17-102) days. The median follow up was 8.3 (4.7-52.8) months. Three patients have died, one from postoperative complications at 5 months and two from recurrence at 5 and 52.8 months. Phantom-limb was experienced in six patients. Four patients received a prosthesis, one is considering this and one does not want a prosthesis.Hemipelvectomy may be considered for a highly selected group of patients with locally advanced carcinoma or recurrence involving the lumbosacral neural plexus.
