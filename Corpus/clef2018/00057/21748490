Modification of loco-regional microenvironment in brain tumors by spinal cord stimulation. Implications for radio-chemotherapy. The effectiveness of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in high grade gliomas (HGG) depends on tumor micro-environment. We summarize our experience of the influence of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) on this micro-environment. Patients with HGG (n = 26) were assessed pre- and post-SCS, using: (1) Doppler in middle cerebral arteries (MCA) and (2) in common carotid arteries (CCA) (3) tumor blood-flow using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
