 Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a cytokine of 53 amino acids (6.2 kDa) that is secreted by ectodermic cells, monocytes, kidneys, and duodenal glands (1). EGF stimulates growth of epidermal and epithelial cells. EGF and at least seven other growth factors and their transmembrane receptor kinases play important roles in cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiation. The EGF receptor (EGFR) family consists of four transmembrane receptors, including EGFR (HER1/erbB-1), HER2 (erbB-2/neu), HER3 (erbB-3), and HER4 (erbB-4) (2). HER1, HER3, and HER4 comprise three major functional domains: an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. No ligand has been clearly identified for HER2 however, HER2 can be activated as a result of ligand binding to other HER receptors with the formation of receptor homodimers and/or heterodimers (3). HER1 as well as HER2 are overexpressed on many solid tumor cells such as breast, nonâ€“small-cell lung, head and neck, and colon cancers (4-6). The high levels of HER1 and HER2 expression on cancer cells are associated with a poor prognosis (7-10). Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) of antibodies with a molecular mass of 25 kDa are cleared very rapidly from the circulation, but they exhibit poor tumor retention because they have a lower affinity than the parent antibody (11). On the other hand, bivalent antibody fragments possess better tumor-targeting characteristics, including rapid tissue penetration, high target retention, and rapid blood clearance.
