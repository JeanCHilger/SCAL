Rehabilitation of stroke: a new horizon. Strokes are a leading cause of death and disability in the U.S. Comprehensive rehabilitation is needed to minimize disability. Theories that serve as a basis for recovery following stroke and therapeutic techniques used to potentiate recovery are discussed. Neuroplasticity is the potential for change in brain function. Functional brain images with positron emission tomography (PET), functional MRI (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have documented cortical reorganization in patients with partial or complete recovery following stroke. Therapeutic techniques with constraint induced movement therapy, body weight-supported treadmill training, and therapeutic electrical stimulation are reviewed.
