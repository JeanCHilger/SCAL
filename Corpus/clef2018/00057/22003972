Effect of molecular imaging on validation of developed anti-hVEGFR2 therapeutic antibody. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 (VEGFR2)-targeted tumor treatment is an antiangiogenic therapeutic strategy. The human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) gene is a useful reporter gene for tumor imaging and radiotherapy. In this study, we investigated the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in hNIS gene-transfected tumor xenografts using a gamma imaging system after treatment with an anti-VEGFR2 antibody. Human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with the hNIS gene were injected subcutaneously into the right flanks of BALB/c nude mice. Therapy was initiated when the tumor volume reached approximately 130-180 mm(3). The animals were intravenously injected with 50, 100, or 150 μg of antibody every 3 days for 16 days. Gamma imaging was performed 1 and 2 weeks after the first injection to monitor the effects of tumor therapy. Mice were sacrificed 2 weeks after the first injection of antibody and the tumors were removed for CD31 staining and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. All groups of mice that were treated with anti-hVEGFR2 antibody showed markedly reduced tumor growth compared to control mice. In vivo gamma imaging results showed that, at 1 week after the first injection of the anti-hVEGFR2 antibody, (125)I uptake of a tumor treated with 150 μg of antibody was 24.5% lower than that in the controls. At 2 weeks, (125)I uptake in the tumor treated with 150 μg of antibody was as low as 44.3% of that in the controls. CD31 staining and RT-PCR assays showed that blood vessel formation and expression of the hNIS gene were reduced with increased treatment doses. This study demonstrated the feasibility of molecular imaging and the therapeutic efficacy of developing therapeutic antibody anti-hVEGFR2 using a gamma imaging system in hNIS gene-transfected tumor xenograft mice.
