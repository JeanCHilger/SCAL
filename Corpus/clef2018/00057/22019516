In vivo positron emission tomography imaging of protease activity by generation of a hydrophobic product from a noninhibitory protease substrate. To develop an imaging technology for protease activities in patients that could help in prognosis prediction and in design of personalized, protease-based inhibitors and prodrugs for targeted therapy.Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was covalently attached to the N-terminus of a hydrophilic peptide substrate (GPLGVR) for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) to increase hydrophilicity. PEG-peptide was then linked to a hydrophobic tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) domain and labeled with (18)F to form a PEG-peptide-(18)F-TMR probe. Specific cleavage of the probe by MMP2 was tested in vitro by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF). In vivo imaging of MMP2-expressing tumors was evaluated by micro-PET.The hydrophobic TMR fragment (948 Da) was specifically generated by MMP2 enzymes and MMP-expressing HT1080 cells but not control MCF-7 cells. MMP-expressing HT1080 cells and tumors selectively accumulated the hydrolyzed, hydrophobic TMR fragment at sites of protease activity. Importantly, we found that (18)F-labeled probe ((18)F-TMR) preferentially localized in HT1080 tumors but not control MCF-7 tumors as shown by micro-PET. Uptake of the probe in HT1080 tumors was 18.4 Â± 1.9-fold greater than in the MCF-7 tumors 30 minutes after injection. These results suggest that the PEG-peptide-(18)F-TMR probe displays high selectivity for imaging MMP activity.This strategy successfully images MMP expression in vivo and may be extended to other proteases to predict patient prognosis and to design personalized, protease-based inhibitors and prodrug-targeted therapies.
