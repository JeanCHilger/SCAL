Cerebrovascular disease, β-amyloid, and cognition in aging. The present study evaluated cerebrovascular disease (CVD), β-amyloid (Aβ), and cognition in clinically normal elderly adults. Fifty-four participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Pittsburgh compound B (PIB)-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and neuropsychological evaluation. High white matter hyperintensity burden and/or presence of infarct defined CVD status (CVD-: n = 27 CVD+: n = 27). PIB-positron emission tomography ratios of Aβ deposition were extracted using Logan plotting (cerebellar reference). Presence of high levels of Aβ in prespecified regions determined PIB status (PIB-: n = 33
