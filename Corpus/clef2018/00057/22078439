Prokaryotic expression and immunogenicity analysis of the chimeric HBcAg containing APP beta cleavage site peptide and Aβ(1-15). To construct the recombinant prokaryotic expression plasmid pET/c-ABCSP-Aβ(15-c),  and evaluate the immunogenicity of the fusion protein expressed in  E.coli.The gene fragment HBc88-144 was amplified by PCR and subcloned to pUC19. The  APP beta cleavage site  peptide(ABCSP) and  Aβ(1-15) gene(ABCSP-Aβ(15)The recombinant gene was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. After IPTG induction,  fusion protein was expressed and mainly existed in the sediment of the bacterial lysate. The expression level was 40% of all the proteins in the sediment. The fusion protein could form VLP. After 5 times of immunization,  the titer of anti-ABCSP and anti-Aβantibody in sera of KM mice reached up to 1:5 000 and 1:10 000 respectively,  while the anti-HBc antibody was undetectable.Recombinant c-ABCSP-Aβ(15-c) gene can be expressed in E.coli. The expressed protein could form VLP and has a strong immunogenicity. This study lays the foundation for the study of AD genetic engineering vaccine.
