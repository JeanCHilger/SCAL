Clinical experience in using 18F-FDG PET in the staging and restaging of malignant lymphomas. The present study was undertaken to determine the diagnostic accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) in the staging and restaging of malignant lymphomas. For determination of the extent of a neoplastic process, complex radiation examination was conducted in 67 patients with malignant lymphomas. In 12 (17.9%) cases, the stage of the disease was changed, as evidenced by PET. There is evidence that the technique is of high diagnostic accuracy in detecting malignancies of l ymph nodes, skeletal system, and parenchymatous organs in lymphoproliferative diseases.
