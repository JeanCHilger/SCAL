Photoinduced electron transfer in an imidazolium ionic liquid and in its binary mixtures with water, methanol, and 2-propanol: appearance of Marcus-type of inversion. The photoinduced electron transfer (PET) reaction has been investigated in a room temperature imidazolium ionic liquid (RTIL), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate ([Emim][EtSO(4)]) and also in [Emim][EtSO(4)]-co-solvents mixtures from N,N-dimethyl aniline (DMA) to different Coumarin dyes using steady state and time-resolved fluorescence quenching measurements. We have used water and methanol and 2-propanol as the cosolvents of RTILs for the PET study. On going from neat ionic liquid to the RTIL-co-solvents mixtures the electron transfer rate has been largely enhanced. In neat RTIL as well as in [Emim][EtSO(4)]-co-solvents mixtures, a Marcus type of inversion in the PET rate have been observed.
