Imaging of non- or very subtle contrast-enhancing malignant gliomas with [¹¹C]-methionine positron emission tomography. In patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade III glioma with a lack of or minimal (< 1 cm3) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast enhancement, the volume of the metabolically active part of the tumor was assessed by [¹¹C]-methionine positron emission tomography (MET-PET). Eleven patients with WHO grade III gliomas underwent MET-PET and MRI (contrast-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted images). To calculate the volumes in cubic centimeters, threshold-based volume of interest analyses of the metabolically active tumor (MET uptake index ≥ 1.3), contrast enhancement, and the T2 lesion were performed after coregistration of all images. In all patients, the metabolically active tumor volume was larger than the volume of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) enhancement (20.8 ± 18.8 vs 0.29 ± 0.25 cm3 p < .001). With the exception of one patient, the volumes of contrast enhancement were located within the metabolically active tumor volume. In contrast, in the majority of patients, MET uptake overlapped with the T2 lesion and reached beyond it (in 10 of 12 MRIs/MET-PET scans). The present data suggest that in patients with WHO grade III glioma with minimal or a lack of contrast enhancement, MET-PET delineates metabolically active tumor tissue. These findings support the use of combined PET-MRI with radiolabeled amino acids (eg, MET) for the delineating of the true extent of active tumor in the diagnosis and treatment planning of patients with gliomas.
