Comparison of dual-source 64-slice adenosine stress CT perfusion with stress-gated SPECT-MPI for evaluation of left ventricular function and volumes. Evaluation of left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction (LVEF) represent important components of pharmacologic stress imaging with either myocardial CT perfusion (CTP) or gated single-photon emission CT (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT-MPI).We compared measurements of left ventricular function and volumes obtained with CTP and SPECT-MPI.Forty-seven patients (mean age, 62 ± 11 years male, n = 39) underwent stress CTP and SPECT-MPI. LVEF (in %), end-systolic volume (ESVStress CTP was in good agreement with SPECT-MPI for quantification of LVEF (r = 0.91), EDV (r = 0.75), and ESV (r = 0.83 all P < 0.001). The mean LVEF measured by stress CTP (66% ± 17%) was similar to SPECT-MPI (64% ± 15%). Similar values were also derived for mean EDV (123 ± 30 mL vs 120 ± 34 mL) and ESV (44 ± 28 mL vs 51 ± 34 mL) for CTP and SPECT-MPI, respectively. Good agreement was also shown between both techniques for the assessment of regional wall motion with identical wall motion scores in 95.3% of the segments (κ = 0.79).LVEF and LV volume parameters as determined by dual-source 64-slice adenosine stress CTP show a high correlation with values obtained with stress-gated SPECT-MPI.
