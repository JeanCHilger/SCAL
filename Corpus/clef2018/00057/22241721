Applying new clinicopathological characteristics to prognostication in advanced thyroid carcinoma. In the February 2011 issue of Endocrine-Related Cancer, Deandreis et al. reported that increased FDG uptake was prognostic in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer. Fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is routinely used in the staging and follow-up of patients with cancer. This study gives further evidence for the role of FDG-PET scanning in metastatic thyroid cancer, especially to identify patients with aggressive disease requiring systemic therapy.
