Molecular neuroimaging in Alzheimer's disease. This article reviews current amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with particular attention to Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB), the most extensively investigated and validated tracer. PiB specifically binds to fibrillar Î²-amyloid deposits such as those found in the cerebral cortex and striatum. PiB-PET imaging is a sensitive and specific biologic marker for underlying amyloid deposition, which is an early event on the path to dementia. Amyloid imaging in healthy controls and patients with mild cognitive impairment may detect those at high risk of future Alzheimer's disease, identifying them as candidates for early preventive measures if and when they become available.
