Nickel-catalysed aromatic Finkelstein reaction of aryl and heteroaryl bromides. A fast and efficient nickel-catalysed iodination reaction of aryl and heteroaryl bromides has been developed. The transformation was found to be general for a wide range of substrates and was used for the synthesis of iodo-PK11195, an imaging agent of Alzheimer's disease and iniparib, a compound used in the treatment of breast cancer.
