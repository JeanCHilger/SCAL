Differentiation of septic and aseptic loosening by PET with both 11C-PK11195 and 18F-FDG in rat models. This study aims to determine the value of PET with C-isoquinoline carboxamide (C-PK11195) and F-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) in assisting the differentiation of aseptic loosening (AL) from septic loosening (SL) in rat models.Initially, the histological profiles of SL and AL (cellular infiltration and the number of CD68 macrophage and PBR cells) were compared. Subsequently, we investigated whether C-PK11195 alone and also in combination with F-FDG increases the sensitivity and specificity of PET imaging for distinguishing SL from AL.There were distinguishable features between the histological profiles of the SL and AL rat groups. The number of CD68/PBR cells in AL rats was significantly higher than that seen in SL rats (P<0.05). The uptake of C-PK1195 was higher in AL and lower in SL rats. The uptake of F-FDG was higher in SL and lower in AL rats.PET with a C-PK11195 and F-FDG imaging protocol is helpful in the clinical differential diagnosis of AL from SL.
