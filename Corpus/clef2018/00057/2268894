62Cu-labeling of human serum albumin-dithiosemicarbazone (HSA-DTS) conjugate for regional plasma volume measurement: application of new 62Zn/62Cu generator system. 62Cu-Labeling of human serum albumin-dithiosemicarbazone (HSA-DTS) conjugate was performed using a newly developed 62Zn/62Cu generator system. HSA-DTS was easily labeled with 62Cu, by simple mixing with 62Cu-generator eluate. In vivo blood clearance of 62Cu-HSA-DTS was similar to 131I-HSA, indicating the high applicability of 62Cu-HSA-DTS as a method for plasma volume measurement. In a positron emission tomography study of a dog, a clear plasma pool image of the head region was obtained.
