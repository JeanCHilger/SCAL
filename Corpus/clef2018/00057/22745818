Transcriptional profiling of serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis growing in human blood: an approach to vaccine antigen discovery. Neisseria meningitidis is a nasopharyngeal commensal of humans which occasionally invades the blood to cause septicaemia. The transcriptome of N. meningitidis strain MC58 grown in human blood for up to 4 hours was determined and around 10% of the genome was found to be differentially regulated. The nuo, pet and atp operons, involved in energy metabolism, were up-regulated, while many house-keeping genes were down-regulated. Genes encoding protein chaperones and proteases, involved in the stress response complement resistant genes encoding enzymes for LOS sialylation and biosynthesis
