All printed edge-triggered register using single walled carbon nanotube-based thin film transistor. We have studied the fabrication of Single Walled Carbon Nanotube (SWNT)-based Thin Film Transistors (TFTs) using Roll-to-Roll (R2R) gravure printer and inkjet printer on PET foils to show the possibility of printed electronics in point of mass production and low cost. In this paper, for realization of all printed multi-bits digital circuit, all printed positive-edge triggered master-slave D flip-flop (DFF) was fabricated on PET foil using printed SWNT TFTs. The printed DFF, consists of 8 NAND gates and 4 inverters, exhibit propagation delay of 75 ms at the input clock signal of 5 Hz.
