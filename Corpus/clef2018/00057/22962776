Few-layer graphene direct deposition on Ni and Cu foil by cold-wall chemical vapor deposition. We report an alternative synthesis process, cold-wall thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD), is replied to directly deposit single-layer and few-layer graphene films on Ar plasma treated Ni and Cu foils using CH4 as carbon source. Through optimizing the process parameters, large scale single-layer graphene grown on Ni foil is comparable to that grown on Cu foil. The graphene films were able to be transferred to other substrates such as SiO2/Si, flexible transparent PET and verified by optical microscopy, Raman microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The sheet resistance and transmission of the transferred graphene films on PET substrate were also discussed.
