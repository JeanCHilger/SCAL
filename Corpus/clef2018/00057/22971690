Non-emissive plastic colour filters for fluorescence detection. We report the fabrication of non-emissive short- and long-pass filters on plastic for high sensitivity fluorescence detection. The filters were prepared by overnight immersion of titania-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in an appropriate dye solution - xylene cyanol for short-pass filtering and fluorescein disodium salt for long-pass filtering - followed by repeated washing to remove excess dye. The interface between the titania and the dye molecule induces efficient quenching of photo-generated excitons in the dye molecule, reducing auto-fluorescence to negligible values and so overcoming the principal weakness of conventional colour filters. Using the filters in conjunction with a 505 nm cyan light-emitting diode and a Si photodiode, dose-response measurements were made for T8661 Transfluosphere beads in the concentration range 1 × 10(9) to 1 × 10(5) beads μL(-1), yielding a limit of detection of 3 × 10(4) beads μL(-1). The LED/short-pass filter/T8661/long-pass filter/Si-photodiode combination reported here offers an attractive solution for sensitive, low cost fluorescence detection that is readily applicable to a wide range of bead-based immunodiagnostic assays.
