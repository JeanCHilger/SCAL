Cerebrovascular and metabolic perturbations in delayed heavy charged particle radiation injury. Focal heavy charged particle irradiation of the rabbit brain created defined lesions which were observable by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging techniques. The lesions appeared approximately 9-11 months after left partial hemibrain irradiation with 30 Gy (230 MeV/u helium ions), and were restricted to the white matter tracts and deep perithalamic and thalamic regions. 82Rubidium PET and Gadolinium DTPA enhanced NMR imaging were used to detect blood-brain barrier perturbations. 18Fluordeoxyglucose PET studies demonstrated widespread decreases in cerebral glucose uptake in the cortex and thalamus of the irradiated hemisphere. NMR and PET imaging results correlated well with histological findings. Rabbits irradiated with 15 Gy did not demonstrate any abnormalities in the brain with sequential NMR scans through 14 months post-irradiation.
