Speculation on the meaning of cerebral metabolic hypofrontality in schizophrenia. Cerebral metabolic hypofrontality in schizophrenia is a controversial research finding. In this article we discuss some of the issues that fuel this controversy, and we speculate on the neural mechanisms that may be responsible for the finding. Most regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) studies using radioactive xenon have found hypofrontality the results of positron emission tomography (PET) studies have been less consistent. Several technical factors are discussed that might contribute to the inconsistencies, including airway artifacts with xenon, limitations of tomography in studying the cortex, and approaches to data analysis. The possibility that hypofrontality is a result of medication is also critically examined. The medication factor is still unclear, but most studies of patients before and after neuroleptic medication find that cerebral metabolism goes up, not down, after treatment. The role of patient behavior and experience during an rCBF or PET procedure is an important variable that has not been adequately controlled in most studies. We suggest that this has been the most important variable in interpreting cerebral metabolic data in schizophrenia. Studies of patients examined during a behavior that normally activates prefrontal cortex have consistently found hypofrontality. One theoretical mechanism that could account for hypofrontality as well as many clinical and research findings in schizophrenia is dysfunction of dopaminergic neural transmission at the level of the prefrontal cortex.
