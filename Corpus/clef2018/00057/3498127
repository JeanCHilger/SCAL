Positron emission tomography studies of normal aging: a replication of PET III and 18-FDG using PET VI and 11-CDG. Using PET VI and 11-CDG we replicated our earlier PET III and 18-FDG normal aging findings. Examination of young and old normal volunteers revealed the absence of any absolute regional age-related changes in glucose utilization. For the combined sample (N = 81) we did find evidence to suggest a relative hypofrontal change with increasing age. A strong relationship between age and ventricular size (CT) was also found. These findings suggest the preserved glucose metabolism of the resting aging brain in the presence of structural atrophic changes.
