Generalized scatter correction method in SPECT using point scatter distribution functions. A new two-dimensional (2-D) scatter correction technique in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) based on convolution or frequency filtering with a 2-D scatter distribution function is described. A scatter distribution function of the form A exp(-Br), has been derived from measurements of a point source in a water phantom. Both the amplitude A and the slope B of this function, were approximately invariant with source position except near phantom surface. The accuracy of the 2-D correction technique was compared with that of the previous one-dimensional (1-D) scatter correction technique. As could be expected the latter technique was shown to be less accurate due to its dependence on axial distribution of radioactivity. Phantom SPECT studies showed a clear superiority of the 2-D over the 1-D scatter correction in quantitative imaging. Images derived from clinical studies of regional bloodflow with 99mTc-HM-PAO and liver uptake showed significant contrast improvement by both techniques.
