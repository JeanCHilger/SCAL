Glucose metabolic rate kinetic model parameter determination in humans: the lumped constants and rate constants for [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose and [11C]deoxyglucose. The rate constants and lumped constants (LCs) for [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) and [11C]deoxyglucose ([11C]DG) were determined in humans for the glucose metabolic rate kinetic model used to measure local cerebral glucose consumption. The mean values (+/- SE) of the LCs for [18F]FDG and [11C]DG are 0.52 +/- 0.028 (n = 9) and 0.56 +/- 0.043 (n = 6), respectively. The mean values (+/- SE) of the rate constants k*1, k*2, k*3, and k*4 for [18F]FDG for gray matter are 0.095 +/- 0.005, 0.125 +/- 0.002, 0.069 +/- 0.002, and 0.0055 +/- 0.0003, respectively. The corresponding values for white matter are 0.065 +/- 0.005, 0.126 +/- 0.003, 0.066 +/- 0.002, and 0.0054 +/- 0.0006, respectively. Using these values and previously published values for the rate constants for [11C]DG, the average whole-brain metabolic rates for glucose in normal subjects measured with [18F]FDG and [11C]DG are 5.66 +/- 0.37 (n = 6) and 4.99 +/- 0.23 (n = 6) mg/100 g/min, respectively. These values are not significantly different (t = 1.56, p greater than 0.10) and agree well with reported values in the literature determined by means of the Kety-Schmidt technique.
