Characteristics of a scanning, multidetector, single-photon ECT body imager. We evaluated a single-photon emission computed tomographic system using ten scanning detectors in a circular array. The system uses focusing collimators that scan radially as well as tangentially. The spatial resolution in the tomographic plane is 2.6 cm FWHM and the axial resolution is 3.3 cm FWHM. The resolution is independent of position within the field of view, and nearly independent of energy through 511 keV. Sensitivity was found to be 4600 cps/muCi-ml for an extended phantom, 20-cm in diameter, filled with Tc-99m 7200 cps/muCi-ml with TI-201
