Myocardial perfusion imaging with technetium-99m sestamibi SPECT in the evaluation of coronary artery disease. Technetium-99m hexakis-2-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (99mTc sestamibi) has been used for myocardial perfusion imaging in the evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD) since 1990. The experience of its use in an Asian population with and without previous myocardial infarction (MI), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HPT) and collateral circulation (COL) is reported. One hundred and thirty-nine patients who underwent treadmill exercise testing with 99mTc sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and coronary angiogram were studied. The overall sensitivity for the detection of CAD was 91.0% and specificity was 64.7%. For patient without previous myocardial infarction, the sensitivity was 83.8% and specificity was 83.3%. Patients with COL had a higher sensitivity while those with HPT had a lower specificity. Sensitivity was higher in patients with multi-vessel disease (MVD) than single vessel disease (SVD). The overall detection for individual artery stenosis was 74.1% with a specificity of 73.1%. Amongst the three major coronary arteries, sensitivity was highest for the right coronary artery and specificity was highest for the left circumflex artery. Specificity was higher in patients without MI or COL. We found that the agreement between 99mTc sestamibi SPECT and coronary angiogram for the extent of CAD was only 52.5%. The concordance rate was higher for patients with MVD than SVD. It is concluded that 99mTc sestamibi SPECT is a sensitive and specific test for the detection of CAD and localization of disease to individual coronary arteries in our patients with some differences in the subgroups. Agreement between coronary angiogram and 99mTc sestamibi for the extent of coronary artery disease was also satisfactory.
