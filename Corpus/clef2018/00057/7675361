Gastric activity on dipyridamole 201Tl myocardial perfusion imaging: a clinically useful finding. To determine the potential association of increased 201Tl uptake by the stomach with symptoms referable to gastritis, 39 consecutive patients experiencing chest pain syndromes underwent a routine dipyridamole 201Tl pharmacological stress test. With the patient in a fasting state, dipyridamole was infused intravenously (0.56 mg kg-1), shortly followed by 201Tl infusion and subsequent image acquisition for single photon emission tomography (SPET). The original 32 SPET images over 180 degrees of arc were interpreted without knowledge of clinical data, using a 4-point scoring system. Patients with active symptoms of gastro-oesophageal discomfort (n = 17) were found to have significantly greater 201Tl stomach uptake scores, compared to the little or no uptake in the 22 patients without such active symptoms (P = 0.0001). A stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to determine which factor(s) showed independent predictive value of 201Tl gastric uptake. The only two independent variables identified were the presence of active gastritis symptoms and the use of anti-gastritis medications. Elevated gastric 201Tl uptake may be a clinically useful finding indicative of gastric inflammation that may be of value in the differential diagnosis of chest and epigastric discomfort.
