Multi-modality megatherapy with [131I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine, high dose melphalan and total body irradiation with bone marrow rescue: feasibility study of a new strategy for advanced neuroblastoma. New therapeutic approaches are needed for advanced neuroblastoma as few patients are currently curable. We describe an innovative strategy combining [131I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine ([131I]mIBG) therapy with high dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation. The aim of combining these treatments is to overcome the specific limitations of each when used alone to maximise killing of neuroblastoma cells. Five children received combined therapy with [131I]mIBG followed by high dose melphalan and fractionated total body irradiation. Autologous bone marrow transplantation was undertaken in 3 patients and allogeneic in 2 patients. One patient received additional localised radiotherapy to residual bulk disease. One patient is alive without relapse 32 months after treatment. 4 patients relapsed after remissions of 9, 10, 14 and 21 months. These results indicate that this combined modality approach is feasible and safe, but further evaluation is necessary to establish whether it has advantages over conventional megatherapy using melphalan alone.
