Tomoscintigraphy of the lumbar spine: prospects and clinical application. In an in vivo prospective study, we examined the lumbar spine of 18 patients presenting with a first episode of acute low-back pain with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Scintigraphic activity at L2 was considered 100%, and the other levels were quantified in relation to L2. MRI scans were rated for disc signal intensity on T2-weighted images. The results show that an abnormal intervertebral MRI signal corresponds with an abnormal image on tomoscintigraphy. On tomoscintographic profiles, the disappearance of the 'discal dip' corresponds well with degeneration on MRI. Furthermore, a positive MRI at one level appears to influence other levels at which a significantly higher scintigraphic activity was observed. Of patients with acute LBP 50% had a normal disc SPECT it is concluded that in these cases a non-discal origin for the pain must be sought.
