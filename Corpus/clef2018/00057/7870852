Preliminary report: cerebral blood flow abnormalities in older schizophrenic patients. We compared global and regional cerebral blood flow in 11 schizophrenic patients and 11 normal comparison subjects, all over the age of 45 years. The schizophrenic patients had lower global cortical uptake than the control subjects. Among the individual regions of interest, the schizophrenic patients had significant decrements in the left posterior frontal region and in the bilateral inferior temporal regions. The uptake did not correlate with age of onset or duration of schizophrenia, current daily neuroleptic dose, severity of psychopathology, or global cognitive impairment.
