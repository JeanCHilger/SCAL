The yeast protein Mrs6p, a homologue of the rabGDI and human choroideraemia proteins, affects cytoplasmic and mitochondrial functions. MRS6 is a newly-identified gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Its product Mrs6p shows significant homology to the mammalian GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) of Rab/Ypt-type small G proteins and to the human choroideraemia protein (CHM), the component A of Rab-specific GGTase II. The interaction of Mrs6p with G proteins is indicated by our observation that the MRS6 gene suppresses the effect of a temperature-sensitive ypt1 mutation. Disruption of the MRS6 gene is lethal to haploid yeast cells. This is consistent with the notion that Mrs6p is interacting with Rab/Ypt-type small G proteins, which are known to have essential functions in vesicular transport. Unexpectedly, the MRS6 gene product also affects mitochondrial functions as revealed by the facts that high-copy numbers of MRS6 (1) suppress the pet- phenotype of mrs2-1 mutant strains and (2) cause a weak pet- phenotype in wild-type strains. We conclude from these results that the MRS6 gene product has a vital function in connection with Rab/Ypt-type proteins in the cytoplasm and, in addition, affects mitochondrial functions.
