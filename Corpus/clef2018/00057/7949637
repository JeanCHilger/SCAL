Long-term efficacy of acute thrombolytic therapy for myocardial infarction. We conducted a retrospective study (1981-1990) to determine whether the efficacy of intracoronary thrombolysis (ICT) could be evaluated from data obtained solely after recanalization. We investigated 55 successful ICT patients (38 with anterior and 17 with inferior myocardial infarction (MI)), and 31 control infarct patients without recanalization. The total serum creatine phosphokinase release (sigma CPK), the extent of infarction measured by T1-201 single photon emission computed tomography (total DS) and the disturbance of regional wall motion (asyn.%) were investigated as parameters for distinguishing the successful ICT and control groups. Discriminatory ability for the two groups was highest with the total DS in all patients. Only the total DS differed significantly between the two groups in patients with inferior infarction. Misidentification of control patients as successful patients was least frequent (25.5%) when using the total DS. These findings suggest that the effectiveness of ICT for acute MI may be assessed on the basis of data obtained solely after recanalization, with the total DS being particularly useful.
