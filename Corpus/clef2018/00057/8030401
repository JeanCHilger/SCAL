Single photon emission computed tomography with [99Tc]-HM-PAO and [123I]-IBZM in Alzheimer's disease and dementia of frontal type: preliminary results. Dementia of frontal type (DFT) is a fairly common degenerative disease distinct from Alzheimer's disease (AD), whose reportedly distinctive instrumental feature is frontal lobe hypoperfusion on SPECT. We evaluated the cortical dopaminergic system in 6 AD, 5 DFT, and 6 control subjects with SPECT and both [99Tc]-HM-PAO, a perfusion tracer, and [123I]-IBZM, a D2 postsynaptic ligand. Both in AD and DFT patients, [99Tc]-HM-PAO SPECT showed a relative frontal hypoperfusion. On the contrary, [123I]-IBZM SPECT showed significantly reduced ligand uptake in superior frontal regions of DFT (0.89 +/- 0.08 relative to control subjects) as compared to AD patients (0.97 +/- 0.02 difference of means: 0.08, 95% Confidence Interval 0.004 to 0.156
