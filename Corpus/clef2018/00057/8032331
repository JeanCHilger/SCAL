Clinical comparison of temporomandibular joint sound auscultation and emission imaging studies. Single photon-emission computerized tomography scintigraphy was used to examine 250 patients who previously had temporomandibular joint sounds auscultated and recorded with a Doppler machine. Patients were divided into four groups based on the presence of joint sounds: no sound, reciprocal clicks, reciprocal clicks with crepitus, and crepitus. Statistically significant differences between the groups and the single photon-emission computerized tomography scintigraphy results were determined. There was no correlation between these results and the no sound and crepitus groups, but significant correlation was established between positive results and crepitant joints with reciprocal clicks and noncrepitant clicking joints.
