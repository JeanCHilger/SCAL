Invariant tryptophan at a shielded site promotes folding of the conformational unit of spectrin. The tryptophan that is highly conserved among repeating structural units of spectrin is reported to promote the conformational stability of one such unit of chicken brain alpha-spectrin. Four constructs were inserted into pET vectors for overexpression in Escherichia coli of the following spectrin peptides: (i) two adjacent but separately expressed "conformationally phased" repeating units, R16 and R17, one of which (R17) contains a single tryptophan (ii) a mutant, M17, of the single tryptophan-containing unit with alanine substituted for the tryptophan
