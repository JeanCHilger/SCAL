Suture protection of acute ruptured anterior cruciate ligament by the Pet-band (Trevira extra strong). Indications, technique results of a five-year study. In a prospective clinical study 56 acute tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) were treated between 1986 and 1991 by reinsertion and protection of the suture by means of a PET ligament (Trevira hochfest). The patients concerned were 31 men and 23 women (1 man and 1 woman had both knees operated on), with an average age of 39.7 years 28 left and 28 right knees were affected. In 19 cases the ACL tear occurred in isolation, while in 37 concomitant intraarticular lesions were present. Nine patients had suffered multiple injury, and 3 had additional fractures distant from the knee. Haemarthrosis was encountered in 34 cases, and a clear effusion in 3 cases. The main causes of ACL rupture were sports injuries (n = 32), followed by traffic accidents (n = 14), activities of daily life (n = 6), and work accidents (n = 4). The preoperative diagnosis of ACL rupture was made correctly in 54 cases. After injury, 37 knees were operated on within the first 2 weeks, and 19 between the 3 and the 8 week. After arthroscopic repair of the concomitant lesions the alloplastic ligament was implanted isometrically by arthrotomy or miniarthrotomy through two bone tunnels and fixed to the bone with staples. Postoperative treatment included immediate continuous passive motion (CPM) and early weight-bearing with the protection of a brace. The patients were followed up at yearly intervals. At the last follow up, 6 years after the beginning of the study, 50 patients were examined clinically and radiologically, and the mean follow-up interval in these 50 was 40.2 months (12-79 months).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
