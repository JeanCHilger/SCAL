Studies with positron emission tomography after systemic administration of fluorine-18-uracil in patients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma. Fluorouracil (FU) is the most common cytostatic agent used for chemotherapy in patients with colorectal tumors. Fifty patients with 78 hepatic metastases from colorectal tumors were examined with positron emission tomography (PET) following intravenous infusion of 18F-FU. The uptake of the cytostatic agent was evaluated in normal liver parenchyma, liver metastases and the aorta. Tracer uptake was expressed with the standardized uptake value (SUV). The maximum liver activity was 11.3 SUV (mean value) with a standard deviation of 1.85 SUV. The highest activity concentrations were noted 30 min (mean value) postinjection. In comparison, the activity concentration of individual metastasis was low. Two hours after tracer injection, the mean activity in metastases was 1.3 SUV, but notable individual variation in uptake was seen. Fluorine-18 concentration values 2 hr after FU infusion were approximately 44% of the FU uptake 20 min postinfusion. Fifty-three metastases were also examined with 15O-labeled water. The examination was performed to compare the uptake of the nonmetabolized tracer with FU uptake. We noted a statistically significant correlation between 15O-water concentration, uptake of nonmetabolized FU 8 min after the end of the infusion and FU retention (120 min postinjection) in a subgroup of metastases. The results suggest that FU retention in different metastases is highly variable and mainly dependent on early FU uptake into tumor cells.
