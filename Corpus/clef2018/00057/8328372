Comparison of regional myocardial blood flow in syndrome X and one-vessel coronary artery disease. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was measured using continuous inhalation of oxygen-15-labeled carbon dioxide, and positron emission tomography before and after intravenous dipyridamole in 13 patients with syndrome X (angina pectoris, angiographically normal coronary arteries, positive exercise test and negative ergonovine test), 7 healthy subjects and 8 patients with 1-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD). In patients with syndrome X, baseline MBF was greater than in healthy subjects and patients with CAD (1.24 +/- 0.27 vs 0.87 +/- 0.07 and 1.03 +/- 0.23 ml/g/min, respectively p < 0.05), and more heterogeneous (34 +/- 7 vs 26 +/- 5 and 25 +/- 6, respectively
