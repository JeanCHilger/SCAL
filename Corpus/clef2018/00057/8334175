The use of computer-assisted diagnosis in cardiac perfusion nuclear medicine studies: a review (Part 3) Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAID) is commonly used to evaluate cardiac nuclear medicine studies such as thallium perfusion scans. Part 1 of this series (Journal of Digital Imaging, 5:209-222, 1992) reviewed the basic theory underlying CAID in nuclear medicine and its use in planar thallium imaging. Part 2 discussed the application of CAID to SPECT perfusion studies (Journal of Digital Imaging, 6:1-15, 1993). This article reviews new variations of CAID programs for SPECT imaging and the application of expert systems and neural networks to CAID of nuclear medicine perfusion studies.
