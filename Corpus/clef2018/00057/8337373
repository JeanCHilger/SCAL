Spect brain imaging in neurologic disease. In recent years cerebral SPECT imaging is rapidly evolving as a clinical tool in the evaluation of a variety of neurologic disorders. In large part, the major advances in brain imaging which have occurred in the last four years are related to new developments in instrumentation and radiopharmaceuticals. In particular, the increased availability of multidetector and dedicated ring detector systems has given rise to improved image resolution and more rapid patient throughput. Advances in the field of radiopharmaceutical development, particularly as it pertains to perfusion brain SPECT agents, has also contributed to the advances in the field. As a result of these developments, there has been an expanded interest in and use of brain SPECT imaging procedures in the evaluation of cerebrovascular disease, dementia, epilepsy, and head trauma.
