Dipyridamole-provoked chest pain implies severe coronary artery disease in children. The diagnostic significance of dipyridamole-provoked chest pain was studied in 17 children with severe coronary arterial stenotic lesions (CAL) complicated with Kawasaki disease. Although dipyridamole induced chest pain in seven patients (symptomatic group), 10 reported no pain (asymptomatic group). In the asymptomatic group, seven children had one vessel disease (1 VD) of right coronary artery (RCA) and the other three had two vessel disease (2 VD) involving the RCA and left anterior descending artery (LAD). Four multivessel disease patients, one three vessel disease (3VD) and three 2VD of LAD and RCA, and three 1VD of LAD, were symptomatic. In the thallium scans, all patients, except two of the asymptomatic group, showed perfusion abnormalities. In addition, the extent score of the symptomatic group was significantly worse than that of the asymptomatic group (P = 0.01). While only one in six of the asymptomatic group showed abnormal ST depression on treadmill exercise electrocardiography, all patients in the symptomatic group (P = 0.02) showed ischemic ST depression. These findings suggest that the occurrence of chest pain after medication with dipyridamole closely correlates with the severity of CAL in children.
