An evaluation of 99Tcm-DMSA SPET with three-dimensional reconstruction in 68 patients with varied renal pathology. Sixty-eight patients (135 kidneys) with varied renal pathology were evaluated with 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) single photon emission tomography (SPET) to determine whether it is possible to detect more renal abnormalities and to reduce the number of false-positives due to anatomical variants when compared with planar imaging. The patients ranged in age from 1 to 78 years and their pathologies included urinary tract infection (n = 50), space occupying lesions (n = 5), calculi (n = 4), hypertension (n = 4) and others (n = 5). Planar scans were performed 3 h after the injection of 80 MBq of 99Tcm-DMSA and a 64 x 20 s acquisition over 360 degrees was used for SPET. High-resolution collimation was used for both. Slices were displayed as transaxial, coronal and sagittal and/or oblique sagittal in the plane of the kidney. Three-dimensional (3D) images were formed by volume rendering. Each kidney was divided into three regions and each region scored separately for the presence of an abnormality. Planar scans were reviewed alone and then in conjunction with SPET and 3D images. Planar imaging detected 95 abnormal regions compared with 103 using SPET. SPET reduced the number of equivocal regions in 8 (12%) patients. The diagnosis was altered by SPET in 17 (4%) regions in 14 (21%) patients. SPET and 3D 99Tcm-DMSA allow more abnormalities to be detected but also allow more specific definition of apparent abnormalities on planar imaging.
