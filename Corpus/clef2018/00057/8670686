Active representation of shape and spatial location in man. Neural activity during the delay period of spatial delayed response (DR) and delayed matching (DM) tasks was investigated by positron emission tomography. A distributed cortical system was activated in each condition. The bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was activated in the delay period of both tasks activation was of higher significance on the right in the DR task and the left in the DM task, and extended to the anterolateral prefrontal cortex in the DM condition. Active representation of spatial location in the DR task was associated with co-activation of the medial and lateral parietal cortex and the extrastriate visual cortex. Active representation of shape in the DM task was associated with co-activation of medial and lateral parietal cortex and the inferior temporal cortex. Response-related activity was observed in both tasks. Activation of anterior cingulate, inferior frontal, lateral promotor and rostral inferior parietal cortex was observed in the DR condition, a task characterized by preparation of a movement to a predetermined location. In contrast, preparation to move to an undetermined location in the DM task was associated with activation predominantly in rostral SMA.
