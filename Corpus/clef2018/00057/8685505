Role of noninvasive techniques (electrocardiogram, Holter, tilt-table test, nuclear magnetic resonance, isotopes) in the evaluation of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathies. In most patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the electrocardiogram is abnormal (left ventricular hypertrophy, abnormal Q waves, giant T waves, ST segment elevation). Occasionally, the localization of ventricular hypertrophy may be suggested by the electrocardiogram. Holter monitoring should always be performed in these patients as it permits to assess one of the leading prognostic factors, i.e. nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Head-up tilt test may point to the mechanism of syncope, and thus be helpful in patients with this symptom. In patients with poor acoustic window, magnetic resonance imaging and perfusion single-photon emission tomography may give useful additional morphological information. Recent studies indicate that patients with perfusion defects have poorer prognosis, but this suggestion should be validated in wider series. Finally, radionuclide ventriculography is the most reproducible technique for the follow up of ventricular systolic and diastolic function and response to therapy.
