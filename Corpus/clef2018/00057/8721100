Changes of regional perfusion in metastatic brain tumor and peritumoral area after radiosurgery: a study by 123I-IMP dynamic SPECT. Changes of regional perfusion in the tumor, peritumoral edematous area and juxtatumor brain after radiosurgical treatment for metastatic brain tumor were investigated by dynamic SPECT using 123I-IMP. The SPECT was performed in 12 patients before and 1, 7 and 30 days after stereotactic irradiation. A region of interest (ROI) was selected each in the tumor, peritumoral edematous area, juxtatumor brain and ipsilateral cerebellum. Radioactivity in each ROIs was counted on early SPECT based on dynamic SPECT from 0 to 5 minutes. Mean count/pixel in each ROIs was divited by mean count/pixel in the ROI of the ipsilateral cerebellum and its value was designated as a count ratio (CR). Assuming the pre-treatment CRs are 1.0, relative changes of post-treatment CRs investigated. rCR in the tumor did not show any significant change after radiosurgical treatment. rCR in the edematous area and the juxtatumor brain increased at 7 days after irradiation [Mean +/- SD 1.43 +/- 0.409 (p < 0.05), 1.248 +/- 0.228 (p < 0.05) by Mann-Whitney test] and at 30 days [1.359 +/- 0.245 (p < 0.01), 1.301 +/- 0.287 (p < 0.01)] respectively. Computed tomography revealed no change in the maximum diameter of the tumor at 1 month after irradiation but a significant reduction in the diameter [0.744 +/- 0.227 (p < 0.02)] at 2 months. Early improvement of regional cerebral blood flow in the juxtatumor areas after radiosurgery suggested that radiosurgery could be effective treatment for metastatic brain tumor.
