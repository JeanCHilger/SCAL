Prevalence and varieties of Helicobacter species in dogs from random sources and pet dogs: animal and public health implications. Gastric bacteria of a variety of ultrastructural morphologies have been identified in or isolated from domestic carnivores, but their prevalence in different populations of animals and their clinical significance are still unknown. The purposes of this study were (i) to evaluate the prevalence and morphologic types of gastric bacterial in three different populations of dogs (ii) to determine which of the organisms were culturable, and if the cultured organisms were morphologically similar to the organisms seen in situ
