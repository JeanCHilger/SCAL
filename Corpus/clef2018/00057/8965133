Prediction of functional outcome after myocardial infarction using BMIPP and sestamibi scintigraphy. We determined the predictive value of combined beta-methyl iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) and sestamibi scintigraphy for the functional outcome after myocardial infarction and compared the value of this approach with dobutamine echocardiography.Rest BMIPP, rest sestamibi and low-dose dobutamine echocardiographic studies were obtained in 18 patients 4 to 10 days after infarction (mean 6.7 +/- 2.0 days). Six months later, a rest echocardiographic study was performed to assess functional outcome.Wall motion improved in 27/33 segments (82%) which showed mismatching but not in 19/21 segments (90%) with matched defects (p < 0.001). The accuracy of combined BMIPP and sestamibi SPECT in predicting segmental functional outcome was higher (85%) than that of sestamibi uptake alone (77%). Wall motion improved in 16/20 segments (80%) showing contractile reserve and not in 21/34 segments (63%) with the negative dobutamine test, giving an accuracy of 69% for dobutamine echocardiography. Combination of the two techniques resulted in higher positive (94%) and negative predictive values (94%).Mismatching of BMIPP and sestamibi uptake is predictive for long-term functional recovery after acute myocardial infarction. In contrast, segments with matched defects contain only scar tissue. Combined BMIPP and sestamibi scintigraphy offers increased accuracy compared to dobutamine echocardiography.
