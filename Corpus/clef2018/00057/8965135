Generator-produced copper-62-PTSM as a myocardial PET perfusion tracer compared with nitrogen-13-ammonia. The purpose of this study was to determine the suitability of 62Cu-pyruvaldehyde bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (62Cu-PTSM) for estimating myocardial blood flow (MBF) over a wide range of flow by comparison with 13N-ammonia (13NH3).PET studies using 62Cu-PTSM and 13NH3 were performed at rest and after pharmacological vasodilatation in 9 normal subjects and 13 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). According to the microsphere method, values for the product of the extraction fraction and MBF (ExMBF) were calculated using both tracers. In static images, the percent uptake (normalized to the peak count) of each tracer was measured in patients with CAD.The myocardial tracer distribution in the normal subjects was significantly higher in the inferior wall in the 62Cu-PTSM studies and lower in the lateral wall in the 13NH3 studies. The ExMBF values showed linear correlation for both tracers in a low flow range. In a high flow range, however, the ExMBF values for 62Cu-PTSM were nonlinearly proportional to the increase of those for 13NH3 (y = 1.1 x -0.21x2, r = 0.81). The percent uptake for both tracers at baseline well correlated linearly (y = 10.4 + 0.88x, R = 0.91). After pharmacological vasodilatation underestimation of blood flow with 62Cu-PTSM was noted compared to that with 13NH3 at high flows (y = 31.8 + 0.63x, r = 0.76).These results suggest that the MBF estimates using 62Cu-PTSM in a low flow range may be as accurate as those with 13NH3. In a high flow range, however, the extraction fraction of 62Cu-PTSM is considered to be lower than that of 13NH3, and this may limit the estimation of MBF with 62Cu-PTSM after pharmacological vasodilatation.
