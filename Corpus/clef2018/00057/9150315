Dissociation of neutrophil emigration and metabolic activity in lobar pneumonia and bronchiectasis. In animal models of pulmonary inflammation, neutrophils exhibit a dramatic influx of glucose in periods of high metabolic activity. This information was utilized to develop a technique, involving positron emission tomography (PET) of 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG), which measures neutrophil activity in situ. This technique was applied in a comparative study of neutrophil function in patients with acute lobar pneumonia or bronchiectasis. Neutrophil emigration was measured by gamma-scintigraphy of intravenously injected 111In-labelled granulocytes and neutrophil activity determined by PET of 18FDG. Neutrophil emigration was evident in 4 out of 5 bronchiectasis patients, whilst no emigration was apparent in the two pneumonia patients studied, consistent with animal studies showing maximum emigration soon after challenge. In contrast, 18FDG uptake was markedly increased in 4 out of 5 pneumonia patients but not in the patients with bronchiectasis. Localization of radioactivity to neutrophils was confirmed by microautoradiography of lavage fluid in a patient with pneumonia. These results suggest that the elevated uptake of glucose by neutrophils during the inflammatory response is a postmigratory event, most likely reflecting the respiratory burst, and that high levels of neutrophil emigration are not necessarily associated with significantly increased metabolic activity of these cells.
