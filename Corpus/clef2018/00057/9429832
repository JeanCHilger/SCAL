Assessment of coronary artery disease in women. Stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging and stress echocardiography are noninvasive imaging techniques with high diagnostic and prognostic utility. Previously, patient cohorts for studies using these methods have comprised predominantly men, but recent investigations have focused on women. Stress myocardial perfusion imaging is highly accurate for diagnosing coronary disease in women, particularly with newer techniques such as gated single-photon emission computed tomography, and has been shown to be a powerful prognostic predictor in both women and men. Comparable data for stress echocardiography are emerging. Older studies reported that for similar image findings fewer women than men were referred for invasive procedures, however, newer studies suggest an absence of such a gender bias. Further developments in attenuation correction for perfusion imaging and phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging promise to enhance the utility of noninvasive imaging for both men and women.
