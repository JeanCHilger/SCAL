Effects of size and orientation change on hippocampal activation during episodic recognition: a PET study. To determine whether physical match between studied and tested items influences blood flow increases in the hippocampal formation associated with recognition memory, positron emission tomography (PET) was used to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow while healthy volunteers made old/new judgements about line drawings of objects. Some objects were tested in the same size and orientation as they had appeared earlier during the study phase of the experiment other objects were tested in a different size or orientation than when they were studied. Blood flow increases in the vicinity of the hippocampal formation were observed in the same object condition compared with the size change and the orientation change conditions, even though recognition accuracy was affected significantly only by orientation change. Results add to previous findings suggesting that physical similarity between studied items and test cues may contribute to hippocampal activation during episodic retrieval.
