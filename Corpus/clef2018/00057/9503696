Parallel hole collimator acceptance tests for SPECT and planar studies. Several methods of determining gamma-camera collimators hole alignment and integrity were compared. Four collimators were tested: two new cast collimators and two used foil collimators, one with damage to the protective surface. The most sensitive tests for collimator damage were found to be the collimated x-ray source, COR offset test and collimator hole alignment test.
