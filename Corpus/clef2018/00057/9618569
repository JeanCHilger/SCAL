Non-invasive estimation of the net influx constant using the standardized uptake value for quantification of FDG uptake of tumours. To reduce the variability of the standardized uptake value (SUV) which is widely used to evaluate 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) uptake by neoplasms, net influx constant (Ki) was derived from SUV. The relationship Ki=SUV.kp.V0, where kp is the plasma clearance rate and V0 is the initial distribution volume of FDG, was utilized. A total of 71 plasma input functions were measured up to 60 min after intravenous injection of FDG in 55 patients and were analysed to obtain kp and V0. SUV and V0 were calculated based on either body weight or body surface area. To validate the Ki estimation, another group of eight patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck was included. Parametric images of the net influx constant were obtained by Patlak graphical analysis of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data and measured plasma input function. V0 based on body weight was 0.1627+/-0.0329 (ml/g) and showed a weak negative correlation with body weight (y=0.23356-0.00138x, r=0.591). V0 based on body surface area was 5540+/-871 (ml/m2) and had no significant correlation with body weight. kp at 50 min post injection was 0. 03272+/-0.00243 (1/min), and had no correlation with the plasma glucose concentration. A highly significant positive correlation was noted between true Ki and estimated Ki based on both body weight (y=0.0033+1.0371x, r2=0.897), and body surface area (y=0.0033+1. 0351x, r2=0.926). Ki, a better indicator of FDG uptake by tumour than SUV, is derivable non-invasively. Quantification of FDG uptake by Ki will aid standardization of diagnostic criteria of FDG PET oncology.
