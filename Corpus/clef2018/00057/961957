Brucella canis infectivity rates in stray and pet dog populations. A serological survey of 200 healthy, mature dogs was made to determine Brucella canis infectivity rates. The 9 per cent rate reported in the stray dogs was significantly higher (0.05 less than P greater than 0.025) than the 1 per cent rate found in pet dogs. These rates coupled with a predictably growing stray dog population have patent zoonotic implications.
