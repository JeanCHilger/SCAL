Compendium of measures to control Chlamydia psittaci infection among humans (psittacosis) and pet birds (avian chlamydiosis), 1998. Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Psittacosis -- also known as parrot disease, parrot fever, and ornithosiscan cause severe pneumonia and other serious health problems among humans. Approximately 800 cases of psittacosis (infection with Chlamydia psittaci) were reported to CDC from 1987 through 1996, and most resulted from exposure to pet birds, usually parrots, macaws, cockatiels, and parakeets. In birds, C. psittaci infection is referred to as avian chlamydiosis (AC). Infected birds shed the bacteria through feces and nasal discharges, which can remain infectious for several months. This compendium provides information about psittacosis and AC to public health officials, physicians, veterinarians, members of the pet bird industry, and others concerned about controlling these diseases and protecting public health. The recommendations in this compendium provide effective, standardized procedures for controlling AC in birds, a vital step to protecting human health.
