Anatomic labelling of PET brain images with automatic detection of AC and PC. A new automatic method for finding anterior commissure (AC) and posterior commissure (PC) in positron emission tomography(PET) brain image without a reference image is discussed. For labelling and localizing] anatomical structures, a PET image aligned in parallel to the detected AC-PC line is normalized spatially into the corresponding transaxial Talairach brain. This labelling system may provide practical application method to make the clinical evaluation of PET brain images easier.
