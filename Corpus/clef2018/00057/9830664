Integration of functional and morphologic MRI data for preoperative 3D visualization of tumors. Example: cervical carcinoma. The goal of this exemplary study was to integrate morphological and functional MRI to establish computer-based, pre-operative therapy planning for tumors, instancing cervical carcinoma.For morphological representation T1-weighted, filtered 3D sequences were investigated within a hierarchical segmentation approach. Using a method for image registration, segmented structures were combined and overlaid with functional information of contrast medium-enhanced, dynamic MRI. After assigning colour attributes to the segmented structures, they were presented using a method for direct volume visualisation.Segmentation of organs and vessels as well as tissue differentiation yielded a morphological visualisation of anatomical structures that were overlaid with pharmacokinetic parameters derived from dynamic MRI, subsequently. Thereby, three-dimensional, arbitrary views on the functional data were displayed.Image analysis and visualisation of the acquired MR data establishes both a morphologic and functional evaluation of suspect lesions and adjacent organs. By integrating morphologic and functional MRI additional information can be gathered that possibly impinge on preoperative planning.
