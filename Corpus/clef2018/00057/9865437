Laterally hypertrophic adenoids as a contributing factor in otitis media. Adenoidectomy has been demonstrated in randomized controlled studies to be effective in the prevention of otitis media with effusion (OME). Despite an apparent lack of correlation between adenoid size and outcome, it has been suggested that the role of adenoid tissue in the pathophysiology of OME relates either to obstruction of the Eustachian tube (ET) with impairment of its function, or to adenoid tissue serving as a reservoir of infection. The aim of this study was to further delineate the relationship between adenoid hypertrophy and OME. This prospective survey was performed in an ambulatory care setting of a tertiary care pediatric hospital, where data was collected on 273 consecutive adenoidectomy patients. At the time of surgery, adenoid position in relation to the ET orifice was recorded as well as concurrent procedures performed (e.g. pressure equalization tubes PET). Sixty percent of patients undergoing simultaneous PET insertion were found to have laterally hypertrophic adenoid tissue encroaching upon the ET orifice versus only 22% for those undergoing adenoidectomy alone. Thus, a strong correlation was found to exist between OME, requiring the placement of PET and lateral adenoids abutting the torus tubarius (chi2 = 39.12
