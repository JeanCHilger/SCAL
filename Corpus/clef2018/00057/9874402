Imaging techniques in the management and prevention of posttherapeutic upper limb edemas. Upper limb edema remains the most frequent complication after treatments for breast carcinoma. Various imaging techniques can be used to prevent these complications, to manage them, and to diagnose the possible lymphonodal evolution that may underlie these events. In the present paper, these techniques are reviewed.Based on clinical experience as well as on the data from the literature, these imaging techniques are presented, and their contributions are analyzed.The pre- and post-operative imaging and research techniques of the so-called sentinel nodes (using blue dye, and/or lymphoscintigraphy, and/or gamma probe) appear to be very promising for defining patients in whom axillary node clearance either might be avoided or is indicated. Lymphoscintigraphic investigations also can be used after surgery and/or radiation therapy to define patients who either are at risk to develop upper limb edema or present with latent edema. In patients with clinically obvious edema, even if it is limited, lymphoscintigraphic techniques can provide a morphologic and functional definition of the condition. Venous echo Doppler can be used when abnormalities of the venous return are suspected. In diagnosing the lymphonodal evolution of the disease, techniques like immunoscintigraphy, positron emission tomography (using 18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose), X-ray computed tomography, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging can contribute.Various imaging techniques can be used to prevent and/or to manage the upper limb edema that may complicate the treatment(s) of the patients with breast carcinoma.
