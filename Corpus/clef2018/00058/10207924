Presurgical evaluation and surgical outcome of temporal lobe epilepsy. The authors analyzed 22 patients younger than 18 years of age with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) treated surgically. Patients underwent a comprehensive presurgical evaluation, including video-electroencephalogram. Fifty-five percent had a history of febrile seizures. Eighty-two percent had auraes and most exhibited oroalimentary and gestural automatisms. Contralateral dystonic posturing was present in 36% and postictal dysphasia in 54% of patients with left-sided resections. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was abnormal in 59% of patients. MRI revealed changes consistent with mesial temporal sclerosis in 8 (47%) of 17 patients without lesions. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET) scans revealed ipsilateral temporal hypometabolism (PET-TH) in 12 (85.7%) of 14 patients. The intracarotid amobarbital procedure revealed impaired memory of the epileptogenic side in 59% of patients. Seventeen patients underwent en-bloc resections and five lesionectomies and resection of the epileptogenic area. There was no surgical morbidity or mortality. Forty-three percent had hippocampal sclerosis, 28.5% gliosis, 14% low-grade tumors, 9.5% cavernous angiomas, and 5% had no pathologic findings. Follow-up (6 months to 12 years) was available for 21 patients 76% became seizure free, 19% had rare seizures, and 5% had a worthwhile improvement. TLE can be safely treated surgically in younger patients with excellent results. The clinical manifestations were similar to adult patients. PET-TH was present even at a younger age, suggesting that the focal functional deficits appear early in patients with medically refractory TLE, which may help in the early identification of these patients.
