Assessing lung deposition of inhaled medications. Consensus statement from a workshop of the British Association for Lung Research, held at the Institute of Biology, London, U.K. on 17 April 1998. In vitro measurements of aerosol fine particle fraction (FPF) using particle-sizing apparatus (e.g. the twin impinger, multi-stage liquid impingers, cascade impactors) have a key role to play in the development of new pharmaceutical products and in quality control. However, use of in vitro methodology to attempt to predict lung deposition in vivo is of limited value due, in part, to the inability of current apparatus to mimic upper and lower airway anatomy satisfactorily. Estimates of FPF based on cut-off points ranging from 5-7 microns generally overestimate lung deposition as measured in vivo by gamma scintigraphy. We recommend that: 1. multistage apparatus (minimum five stages) be used to characterize particle size distribution adequately, over the range 0.5-5.0 microns 2. where possible, measurements should be made at a range of rates and profiles of flow reflecting those likely to be generated using the inhalation device in clinical practice (including use by young and elderly patients with varying degrees of airflow obstruction)
