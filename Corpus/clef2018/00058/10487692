Expression of the Na+/I- symporter gene in human thyroid tumors: a comparison study with other thyroid-specific genes. The expression of 4 thyroid tissue-specific genes [Na+/I- symporter (NIS), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), thyroglobulin (Tg), TSH receptor (TSH-R)] as well as of the glucose transporter type 1 (Glut1) gene was analyzed in 90 human thyroid tissues Messenger ribonucleic acids were extracted from 43 thyroid carcinomas (38 papillary and 5 follicular), 24 cold adenomas, 5 Graves' thyroid tissues, 8 toxic adenomas, and 5 hyperplastic thyroid tissues 5 normal thyroid tissues were used as reference. A kinetic quantitative PCR method, based on the fluorescent TaqMan methodology and real-time measurement of fluorescence, was used. NIS expression was decreased in 40 of 43 thyroid carcinomas (10- to 1200-fold) and in 20 of 24 cold adenomas (2- to 700-fold)
