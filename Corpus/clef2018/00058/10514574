Ischaemic stroke: new frontiers. Lot of advancement has taken place, not only in the management but also in the pathophysiology and imaging modalities in patients of stroke. Indolent chronic infections, particularly those due to H. pylori, have been identified as one of the risk factors. The mechanism of inflammation in inducing a precoagulant state has also been worked out. SPECT studies have detected ischaemic areas before appearance of CT abnormalities. CT angiography identifies abnormalities in the 'circle of willis' in posterior circulation strokes much better, and helps weigh the risk versus benefit of thrombolysis. With experiance in use of r-TPA, the list of contra indications and precautions has become longer than its indications. Newer drugs like lubeluzole and edselen have also been recommended. Various other drugs e.g. aptiganel hydrochloride, MDL 28170, 'basic fibroblast growth factor' and 'superoxide dismutase' are at an experimental stage. The concept of a 'stroke cocktail' may be in vogue soon. Controversies still exit regarding the exact indication of prophylactic anticoagulant and the 'international normalized ratio' (INR) to be achieved. Guidelines have been laid down for the approach to patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. However, the paramount message in stroke care is dissipation of the concept of 'brain attack', amongst the primary care medical and para-medical personnel.
