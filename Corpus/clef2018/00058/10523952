Cardiac scanning with positron emission tomography--PET. Clinical use and research aspect. Assessment of regional myocardial glucose metabolism and regional myocardial perfusion has become possible with positron emission tomography (PET). These parameters are of importance in distinguishing viable from fibrotic myocardium in patients with ischaemic heart disease. PET scanning appears to be the method of choice in these patients, which has led to an increased clinical application of PET as a method usable to select patients with severe heart disease before potential revascularisation. In the present review, PET technology is briefly described, together with an overview of the scientific evidence supporting the clinical application of cardiac PET. Finally, its applications in the fields of pathophysiology and pharmacology are briefly described.
