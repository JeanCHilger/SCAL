Visualization of mRNA expression in CNS using 11C-labeled phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide. Antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide for mRNA of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was labeled with the positron emitter 11C and administered i.v. to rats bearing glioma, which were expected to exhibit active expression of GFAP. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotide was retained in tumor cells, yielding clear images of tumors, while the control 20% mismatch oligodeoxynucleotide and sense-strand oligodeoxynucleotide were not retained in tumor cells. Findings revealed sequence-specific binding of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to the GFAP mRNA. Our methods can be used directly for non-invasive imaging of human gene expression using PET, a frequently used method of clinical examination.
