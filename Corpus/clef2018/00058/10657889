Neuroanatomy of human appetitive function: A positron emission tomography investigation. The mediating neuroanatomy of human appetitive function is poorly understood. A state induction paradigm was employed, in conjunction with positron emission tomography, to test the hypothesis that limbic/paralimbic regions respond to the desirability of food stimuli.Eight normal subjects were studied during each of three conditions, involving visual exposure to high-caloric food, low-caloric food, and nonfood stimuli. Subjective indices of hunger were measured via analog scales.Planned contrasts demonstrated significant increases in desire to eat and decreases in left temporoinsular cortical blood flow during the high-caloric versus control conditions.Results implicate the temporo-insular cortex in normal appetitive function, suggesting that activity within this region is associated with the desirability or valence of food stimuli, prior to ingestion. These data will provide a broad foundation for future studies of patients with eating disorders.
