Tinnitology, Tinnitogenesis, Nuclear Medicine, and Tinnitus Patients. Since the 1970s, clinical interest in otolaryngology and audiology for both diagnosis and treatment of the symptom of tinnitus has witnessed the evolution of a new discipline: tinnitology. Tinnitology is an integrated discipline of basic sciences, neuroscience, and clinical medicine for the understanding of aberrant auditory phenomena unrelated to an external source of sound. To patients with subjective idiopathic tinnitus, nuclear medicine techniques of positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography provide correlation of structure and function, which improves the accuracy of the tinnitus diagnosis. Additionally, they provide a monitoring system to establish the efficacy of modalities of therapy attempting to provide tinnitus relief. Further, they provide information of neuroreceptors and neurochemistry in brain underlying or accompanying basic mechanism for production of specific clinical types and subtypes of tinnitus. This study reports the application of nuclear medicine techniques for a new clinical neuropharmacology protocol for tinnitus treatment highlighted by intratympanic drug therapy in predominantly cochlear-type tinnitus. We further report a neuroprotective drug therapy to control tinnitogenesis, an auditory epileptiform phenomenon. Additionally, we report the hypothesis of a benzodiazepine deficiency syndrome.
