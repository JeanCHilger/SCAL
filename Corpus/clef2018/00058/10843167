Insulin-induced increment of coronary flow reserve is not abolished by dexamethasone in healthy young men. Hyperinsulinemia is a risk factor for coronary artery disease. Previous studies have reported that hyperinsulinemia increases cardiac and skeletal muscle sympathetic nerve activity and skeletal muscle blood flow in normal subjects. However, little is known about insulin's effects on myocardial blood flow in humans. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether physiological hyperinsulinemia affects myocardial blood flow and flow reserve in healthy subjects. Additionally, the role of the sympathetic nervous system in regulating insulin's effects on coronary perfusion was tested. We used positron emission tomography and oxygen-15-labeled water to measure myocardial blood flow and coronary flow reserve in 16 healthy nonobese men (age, 34 +/- 4 yr maximal aerobic capacity, 32 +/- 3 mL x g(-1) x min(-1)
