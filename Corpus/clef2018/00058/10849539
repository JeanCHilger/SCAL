Imaging of malignant cervical lymphadenopathy. Diagnostic imaging is superior to clinical staging in the detection of malignant cervical lymphadenopathy, and thus helps influence therapy and prognosis. The imaging modalities of CT, MRI, US and PET each have their own diagnostic criteria, accuracy and limitations. Newer innovations such as functional imaging, novel MRI contrast agents and FNAC are being appraised with the aim of identifying the micrometastases which are currently radiologically occult.
