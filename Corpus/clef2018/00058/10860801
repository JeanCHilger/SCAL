Structural group analysis of functional activation maps. We present here a new method for cerebral activation detection over a group of subjects. This method is performed using individual activation maps of any sort. It aims at processing a group analysis while preserving individual information and at overcoming as far as possible limitations of the spatial normalization used to compare different subjects. We designed it such that it provides the individual occurrence of the activations detected at a group level. The localization can then be performed on the individual anatomy of each subject. The analysis starts with a hierarchical multiscale object-based description of each individual map. These descriptions are then compared, rather than comparing the images directly. The analysis is thus performed at an object level instead of voxel by voxel. It is made using a comparison graph, on which a labeling process is performed. The label field on the graph is modeled by a Markov random field, which allows us to introduce high-level rules of interrogation of the data. The process has been evaluated on simulated data and real data from a PET protocol.
