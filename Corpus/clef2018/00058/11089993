Mastoid pneumatization of the patulous eustachian tube. The pathophysiology of the patulous eustachian tube (PET) remains unclear. The degree of mastoid cell pneumatization is considered an indicator of chronic inflammation of the middle ear. We used the mastoid cell area to investigate the relationship between past chronic inflammation of the middle ear cavity and a PET in 84 patients (20 to 83 years old). The mastoid cell size was calculated from radiographs and analyzed relative to the history of otitis media (OM). The controls were 100 normal ears. The patients' mastoid cell size was significantly suppressed versus that of the controls, in both 31 PET cases with and 53 PET cases without past OM. We surmise the possibility that the PET ears had experienced inflammation even when the patients had no history of OM and the tympanic membrane showed no OM sequelae. This study indicates the existence of some relationship between a history of chronic inflammation of the middle ear cavity and a PET.
