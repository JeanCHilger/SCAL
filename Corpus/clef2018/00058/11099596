Predictors of asthma three years after hospital admission for wheezing in infancy. To evaluate the influence of early antiinflammatory therapy in the development of asthma 3 years after hospitalization for wheezing in infancy. In addition, the effects of allergic sensitization and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection on the development of asthma were investigated.A randomized, controlled follow-up study in a university hospital that provides primary hospital care for all pediatric patients in a defined area.Eighty-nine infants under 2 years of age who had been hospitalized for infection associated with wheezing and followed up for 3 years.Early antiinflammatory therapy was given for 16 weeks 29 patients received cromolyn sodium and 31 received budesonide. Twenty-nine control patients received no therapy.Clinical diagnosis of current asthma, defined as having at least 3 episodes of physician-diagnosed wheezing and either a wheezing episode during the preceding year or ongoing antiinflammatory medication for asthma.Fourteen (48%) patients in the former cromolyn group, 15 (48%) in the former budesonide group, and 16 (55%) in the control group had current asthma. The significant predictors of asthma were age over 12 months (risk ratio [RR] 4.1 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.59-10.35), history of wheezing (RR 6.8Antiinflammatory therapy for 4 months has no influence on the occurrence of asthma 3 years after wheezing in infancy. Early sensitization to indoor allergens, especially to pets, and atopic dermatitis predict subsequent development of asthma. RSV infection in wheezing infants may have a better outcome than other infections.
