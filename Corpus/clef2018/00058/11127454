Evidence of reduced resting blood flow in viable myocardial regions with chronic asynergy. We tested the hypothesis in patients (n = 24) with ischemic heart disease that chronic contractile dysfunction occurs in myocardial regions with true reduction in rest blood flow.Whether viable myocardial regions with chronic contractile dysfunction have true reduction in rest myocardial blood flow is controversial.Positron emission tomography (PET) 13N-ammonia was used to measure myocardial blood flow in combination with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) to assess myocardial viability. Viability also was assessed by dobutamine echo and recovery of function after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Segments (n = 252) were selected based on PET measured reduced resting blood flow and rest asynergy on echo.Regional myocardial viability was present in 20 of 23 patients by PET, 13 of 23 by dobutamine echo and 10 of 11 by postrevascularization criteria. Rest blood flow in normal regions was 1.14+/-0.52 ml/min/g and by definition exceeded (p < 0.005) that in both viable (0.48+/-0.15 n = 8 patients) and nonviable (0.45+/-0.14Reduced rest blood flow in viable myocardial regions with chronic asynergy is common and cannot be accounted for by partial volume effect. Thus, hypotheses concerning physiologic mechanisms underlying chronic contractile dysfunction should consider the role played by chronic reduction of basal myocardial blood flow.
