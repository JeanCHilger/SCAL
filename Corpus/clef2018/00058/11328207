Normalization of markers for dopamine innervation in striatum of MPTP-lesioned miniature pigs with intrastriatal grafts. As part of the DaNeX study, the uptake and binding of several positron emitting tracers was recorded in brain of healthy GÃ¶ttingen minipigs, in minipigs with a syndrome of parkinsonism due to MPTP intoxication, and in parkinsonian minipigs which had received intrastriatal grafts of mesencephalic neurons from fetal pigs. The specific binding of [11C]NS 2214 to catecholamine uptake sites was reduced by two thirds in striatum of the intoxicated animals, while the rate constant for the decarboxylation of [18F]fluorodopa was reduced by 50% in the intoxicated animals. Several months after grafting, both pre-synaptic markers of dopamine fibres were normal in striatum. Dopamine depletion or grafting were without effect on the cerebral perfusion rate, measured with [15O]-water, did not alter the rate of oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) in brain, and did not alter the binding potential of tracers for dopamine D1 or D2 receptors in pig striatum. However, the grafting was associated with a local increase in the binding of [11C]PK 11195, a tracer for reactive gliosis, suggesting that an immunological reaction occurs at the site of graft, which might potentially have reduced the graft patency. However, this apparent immunological response did not preclude the re-establishment of normal [18F]fluorodopa and [11C]NS 2214 uptake in the allografted striatum.
