Abnormal magnetization transfer ratios in normal-appearing white matter on conventional MR images of patients with occlusive cerebrovascular disease. Chronic hypoperfusion may cause ischemic insult in the deep white matter. The magnetization transfer phenomenon is associated with the amount and constitution of myelin. The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) for detecting vasculometabolic abnormalities on positron emission tomography (PET) studies in patients with unilateral severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA).MTR maps and PET data-including regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), regional cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO(2)), and regional oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF)-were investigated in 13 patients with unilateral severe stenosis of the ICA. The same regions of interest were selected in the white matter both on MTR maps and PET scans. The areas were classified into three groups based on MTR values (group 0, MTR >47.22% group 1, MTR = 45.77% to 47.22%Abnormal values could not be detected in the areas classified as group 0. The areas classified as group 1 were characterized by absolutely normal values of rCMRO(2) and increased rOEF with AI, which was assessed as viable and reversible on the PET study. The areas classified as group 2 showed decreased rCMRO(2) with absolute values, which was considered irreversible in PET. A significant overall linear correlation was found between MTR and rCMRO(2) values.Using the MTR technique to classify ischemic damage into three groups (normal, reversible, and irreversible), we found a significant correlation between the reduction of MTR and that of rCMRO(2) in white matter with ICA stenosis. We believe that the MTR technique may partly replace PET data in the assessment of ischemic injury.
