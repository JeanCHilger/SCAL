Pancreatic carcinoma: imaging update 2001. This paper discusses the most recent advances in imaging of pancreatic carcinomas. The specific modalities discussed include helical computed tomography (HCT) with combined CT angiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and positron emission tomography (PET). Endoscopic ultrasound is discussed in other papers. HCT is believed to be the most efficacious modality for initial detection and staging of pancreatic carcinomas. It has an accuracy rate of about 95-97% for the detection of carcinomas and of virtually 100% for staging unresectable carcinomas. The accuracy for CT staging of a resectable tumor is about 80-85%, with small surface metastases to liver and peritoneum being the most often missed findings. MRI and MRCP are best used for evaluation of patients that cannot receive intravenous contrast media for HCT and of patients who have equivocal HCT findings. PET imaging may be useful for detection of extrapancreatic nodal metastases.
