Positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography is a sophisticated, physiology-based imaging technique that provides information about the function of tissues and organs. Combining PET data with computed tomography or magnetic resonance images provides clinicians with physiological information linked to an anatomical site. This overview discusses the biological principles underlying the technology, PET radiopharmaceuticals, PET imaging facilities, specific imaging applications and reimbursement issues.
