Clinical experience with positron emission tomography with 2-fluorine, 18F-2-deoxy-d-glucose used for the diagnosis of malignant breast neoplasms. The aim of the study was to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of positron emission tomography (PET) and 18F-fluorodesoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in breast cancer diagnosis and to assess tumor dissemination. Sixty two patients were examined: 10 without mammary disease, 10 with fibrous cystic mastopathy, and 42 with breast cancer, which was hystologically verified. PET scanning was recorded in the "Whole body" mode 70-90 min later administration of 370-420 MBq 18F-FDG. It was shown that PET has a high diagnostic accuracy in breast cancer detection. There were no False-positive cases in our investigations. PET scanning in the "Whole body" mode was allowed to assess dissemination of tumor process with high accuracy. Metastatic involvement of local lymph nodes was detected in 82.8% cases and bone metastases--86% in cases.
