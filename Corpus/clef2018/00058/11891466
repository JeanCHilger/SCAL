Clinical measurement of blood flow in tumours using positron emission tomography: a review. In oncology drug development there is an increasing need for the in vivo physiological measurement of changes in tumour blood flow in response to therapy. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is being increasingly used in oncology patients to measure blood flow. Here we review the clinical use of PET to measure vascular parameters in man.
