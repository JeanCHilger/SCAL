Evaluation of Petri dish sampling for assessment of cat allergen in airborne dust. Dust reservoir sampling is the most commonly used method for assessment of indirect allergen exposure. Because assessment of personal exposure using person-carried pumps is time-consuming and expensive we evaluated the Petri dish sampling method for measurement of airborne cat allergen in classrooms.Petri dish sampling was evaluated in three study parts. Part I: by comparison between Petri dish sampling and personal air sampling in 44 classrooms with many (> or = 20%) and few (< or = 10%) cat owners and by additional Petri dish sampling in 40 pet-free homes. Part II: by sampling with duplicate Petri dishes in 28 classrooms. Part III: by sampling in three classrooms at four sampling heights during different sampling times. All samples were analyzed for cat allergen (Fel d 1) content with a monoclonal antibody two-site ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), using signal amplification when necessary.There was a significant correlation between Petri dish sampling and personal air sampling (r = 0.66 P < 0.0001). Levels were five-fold higher in classes with many cat owners than in classes with few cat owners, regardless of method. A corresponding difference was found in the homes. Duplicate sample values were in fair agreement (Bland-Altman test) and were correlated (r = 0.77Petri dish sampling can be useful as an alternative method to personal air sampling of airborne allergens.
