Evaluation of odontogenic maxillary sinusitis after conservative therapy using CT and bone SPECT. Fifteen patients with odontogenic maxillary sinusitis examined using computed tomography (CT) and single photon emission computed tomography bone scintigraphy (bone SPECT) were reviewed. The changes in bone activity associated with causative maxillary alveolitis, evaluated by bone SPECT, before and after conservative therapy were correlated with the pathologic changes in the maxillary sinus mucosa and ostium demonstrated on CT images following conservative therapy. This combination of imaging methods is valuable for predicting the prognosis and selecting appropriate treatments for the disease.
