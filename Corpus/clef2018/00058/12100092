Cognitive disturbances and regional cerebral blood flow abnormalities in migraine patients: their relationship with the clinical manifestations of the illness. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate neuropsychological performance and regional cerebral blood flow in migraine patients, and to investigate whether possible abnormalities in any of these fields could be related to the chronicity of the disease. The sample included 60 patients and 30 healthy control subjects all of them were subjected to a complete neuropsychological assessment, including emotional variables. In addition an interictal 99Tc-HMPAO SPECT was performed in 56 patients and 15 controls. Disturbances in memory, attention and visuomotor speed processing were observed among migraineurs experiencing higher frequency of attacks and in those with a long history of migraine. Anxiety levels were higher in patients than in controls and were positively correlated with attack frequency, but not with cognitive test scores. Brain perfusion abnormalities, mostly hypoperfusion areas, were found in the 43% of patients
