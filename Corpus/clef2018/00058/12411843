Prolonged diastolic dysfunction following exercise induced ischaemia: a gated myocardial perfusion SPECT study. Prolonged impairment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function following exercise induced ischaemia has been well demonstrated. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of exercise induced ischaemia on the post-stress LV diastolic function in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Seventy-four subjects with known or suspected CAD underwent gated myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) 1 h after administration of 99mTc tetrofosmin according to a standard same day exercise rest protocol. LV volumes and ejection fractions (LVEFs) were determined by the Cedars-Sinai program. Fourier transformation of the gated SPECT volume curve was performed retaining the fourth order harmonics, and peak filling rate (PFR) and time-to-PFR (TPFR) were calculated from the derivative curve. In patients with exercise induced ischaemia (n =26), 1 h post-stress PFR (2.66+/-0.75 s(-1)) and TPFR (119+/-12 ms) were significantly impaired in comparison to the resting PFR (3.06+/-0.74 s P=0.0002) and TPFR (114+/-10 ms
