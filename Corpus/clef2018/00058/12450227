Ischaemic penumbra: highlights. The ischaemic penumbra was described for the first time in the late 1970s as a ring of hypoperfused zone surrounding the region of complete infarction. The penumbral zone is a functionally silent tissue which is able to regain its function if promptly reperfused. This implies that the ischaemic penumbra is not a static but a "dynamic" and "time-dependent" concept. In this paper we describe the role of neuroimmaging tecniques such as single photon emission tomography (SPET), positron emission tomography (PET), and diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI and PWI) in the study of ischaemic penumbra. These functional imaging techniques have the advantage of giving "in vivo" quantitative estimate of cerebral blood flow (CBF) as well as information on how the ischaemic tissue metabolic changes develop. It follows that, as therapeutic options for treating acute stroke evolve, neuroimaging strategies are assuming an increasingly important role in the initial evaluation and management of the acute ischaemic patient. In this regard, a wide range of therapeutic approaches have been investigated for either ameliorating the perfusion, or interfering with the pathobiochemical cascade leading to ischaemic neuronal damage, or improving endogenous neuroprotection pathways. The "time windows" required for these treatments to be effective varies being rather short for reperfusion and longer for neuroprotection. Salvaging more penumbra would enhance recovery and thereby allow the most appropriate candidate for therapeutic trials to be selected.
