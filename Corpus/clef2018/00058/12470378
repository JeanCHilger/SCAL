A nonsurgical porcine model of left ventricular dysfunction. Validation of myocardial viability using dobutamine stress echocardiography and positron emission tomography. BACKGROUND: Although several short-term animal models of stunning and hibernation have been studied extensively, it has been difficult to produce a consistent animal model of chronic hibernation. The aim of the present study was to develop a nonsurgical porcine stent model of coronary stenosis in order to investigate the relationship between chronic dysfunctional myocardium and viability using 2D-echo, dobutamine stress echo (DSE) and positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS AND RESULTS: Focal progressive coronary stenosis was induced by implantation of an oversized stent in the left anterior descending (LAD) and/or circumflex (LCX) coronary artery in a total of 115 pigs, according to various experimental protocols: copper stent in the LAD (group I, n = 5) noncoated stainless steel stent in the LAD combined with balloon overstretch (group II, n = 7)
