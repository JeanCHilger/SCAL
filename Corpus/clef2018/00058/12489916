Neuroimaging in dementia with Lewy bodies: metabolism, neurochemistry, and morphology. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is recognized as one of the most common forms of neurodegenerative dementia. Neuroimaging contributes to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of DLB by examining alterations in brain metabolism, neurochemisty, and morphology in living patients. Neuroimaging can provide objective and quantifiable antemortem markers for the presence of and the progression of DLB and permits differentiation from other dementias. This article reviews current neuroimaging findings in DLB with particular attention to occipital hypometabolism, dopaminergic and cholinergic deficits, and medial temporal lobe atrophy as measured by positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.
