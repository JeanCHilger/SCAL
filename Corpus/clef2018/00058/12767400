Sigma1 and dopamine D2 receptor occupancy in the mouse brain after a single administration of haloperidol and two dopamine D2-like receptor ligands. We investigated sigma(1) and dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy in mouse brain after a single injection of haloperidol, nemonapride, or spiperone using [(11)C]SA4503 and [(11)C]raclopride, respectively. Co-injection of the three compounds significantly blocked the uptake of each radioligand. Six hours later, only haloperidol blocked [(11)C]SA4503 uptake, while all three reduced [(11)C]raclopride uptake. Sigma(1) receptor occupancy by haloperidol was reduced to 19% at day 2 when D(2) receptor occupancy disappeared. [(11)C]SA4503 would be applicable to the investigation of sigma(1) receptor occupancy of antispychotic drugs using PET.
