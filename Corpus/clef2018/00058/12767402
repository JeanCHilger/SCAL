Kinetic modelling of [123I]CNS 1261--a potential SPET tracer for the NMDA receptor. N-(1-napthyl)-N'-(3-[(123)I]-iodophenyl)-N-methylguanidine ([(123)I]CNS 1261) is a novel SPET ligand developed for imaging the NMDA receptor intra-channel MK 801/PCP/ketamine site. Data was acquired in 7 healthy volunteers after bolus injection of [(123)I]CNS 1261. Kinetic modeling showed reversible tracer binding. Arterial and venous time-activity curves overlapped after 90 min. The rank order of binding was: Thalamus > striatum > cortical regions > white matter. This distribution concurs with [(11)C]-ketamine and [(18)F]-memantine PET studies. These data provide a methodological basis for further direct in vivo challenge studies.
