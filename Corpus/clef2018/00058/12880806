Developmental hemispheric asymmetry of interregional metabolic correlation of the auditory cortex in deaf subjects. The functional connectivity of the auditory cortex might be altered in deaf subjects due to the loss of auditory input. We studied the developmental changes of functional connectivity of the primary auditory cortex (A1) in deaf children, deaf adults, and normal hearing adults by examining interregional metabolic correlation with (18)F-FDG PET. The mean activity of FDG uptake in the cytoarchitectonically defined A1 region served as a covariate in the interregional and interhemispheric correlation analysis. A1 metabolic rate was correlated with that of the ipsilateral superior temporal lobe in both normal and deaf subjects. This correlated area was larger in deaf children than in deaf or normal hearing adults. Concerning the functional connectivity of A1, a hemispheric asymmetry was found in that the extent of interregional correlation was clearly larger in the right than in the left hemisphere. This asymmetry was particularly pronounced in the younger deaf children. Both extent and asymmetry of the functional connectivity of A1 subsided with age. Contrary to this, a correlation between the left and the right primary auditory cortices was absent in younger deaf children but became apparent as they grew older.
