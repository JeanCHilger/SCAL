Transplantation in Parkinson's disease: PET changes correlate with the amount of grafted tissue. We compared the striatal uptake of [(18)F]fluorodopa with [(76)Br]-FE-CBT, a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand of the dopamine transporter (DAT), which estimates the density of dopamine nerve terminals, in 6 patients with Parkinson's disease grafted with fetal mesencephalic cells. There was no change in DAT ligand binding in the grafted putamen, despite a significant increase of [(18)F]fluorodopa uptake. This finding suggests that the clinical benefit induced by the graft is more related to increased dopaminergic activity than improved dopaminergic innervation in the host striatum and, therefore, that [(18)F]fluorodopa remains the optimal tracer to evaluate grafted PD patients. Further analysis showed that the clinical and [(18)F]fluorodopa uptake changes after the grafts were correlated with the number of ventral mesencephalae used for implantation.
