Fusion protein of the hyaluronan binding domain from human TSG-6 with luciferase for assay of hyaluronan. The gene expression plasmid, pET-Lmluc, for the fusion protein of the hyaluronan binding domain from human TSG-6 [product of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-stimulated gene-6] and luciferase from Renilla reniformis was constructed. The fused gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and the resulted insoluble Lm-luc fusion protein was purified and refolded to recover both the hyaluronan binding capability and the luciferase activity. Hyaluronan as low as 1 ng ml(-1) was detected by using the indirect enzymatic immunological assay with the refolded Lm-luc fusion protein.
