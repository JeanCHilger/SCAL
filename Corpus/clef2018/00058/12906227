Clinical use of low-profile cystostomy tubes in four dogs and a cat. Traditional cystostomy tubes (used for temporary or permanent diversion of urine in dogs and cats) are long (> or = 22 cm) and cumbersome to stabilize, requiring sutures or bandages to hold the tube against the body. Use of a low-profile gastrostomy port system as a low-profile cystostomy tube (LPCT) in 4 dogs and a cat was investigated owner satisfaction with the device was assessed. Technical difficulty associated with placement and management of LPCTs was similar to that for traditional cystostomy tubes
