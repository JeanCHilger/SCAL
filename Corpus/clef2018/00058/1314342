"Central" and "peripheral" benzodiazepine receptors: opposite changes in human epileptogenic tissue. We measured the density of two benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor subtypes in neurosurgically obtained hippocampal tissue from the seizure focus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) showing mesial temporal sclerosis, the most common pathologic finding in TLE. We performed quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography with [125I]Ro 16-0154, a probe for the central-type BZ receptor and with [3H]PK 11195, a probe for the peripheral-type BZ receptor. In comparison with autopsy and neurosurgical control groups, patients with mesial temporal sclerosis had regionally selective decreased central-type and increased peripheral-type BZ receptors. These changes paralleled regional losses of neurons and proliferation of glia. Decreases of the inhibitory central-type BZ receptor may be a component of the enhanced excitability of the seizure focus and also may allow localization of the focus by in vivo neuroreceptor imaging. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of two TLE patients with [123I]Ro 16-0154 suggests that this technique may provide a more sensitive means of localizing the seizure focus than current imaging methods relying on changes in blood flow or glucose metabolism.
