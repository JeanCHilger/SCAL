Cerebral perfusion SPECT imaging for assessment of the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on patients with postbrain injury neural status. To evaluate the effects of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy on patients with postbrain injury neural status.Two to 4 courses of HBO therapy and/or medications were used to treat 320 patients who were randomly divided into two groups. Assessment was made with (99m)Tc-ethyl cysteinate dimer ( (99m)Tc-ECD) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) before and after treatment.There was a significant difference between the HBO therapy group and the non-HBO therapy group. HBO therapy was superior to medication treatment alone in the recovery of clinical symptoms, control of epilepsy, and resolution of hydrocephalus (P<0.01).HBO therapy has specific curative effects on patients with postbrain injury neural status, and (99m)Tc-ECD SPECT could play an important role in diagnosing postbrain injury neural status and monitoring the therapeutic effects of HBO.
