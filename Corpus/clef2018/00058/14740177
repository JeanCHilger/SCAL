Long-term prognostic value of exercise 99mTc-MIBI SPET myocardial perfusion imaging in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term prognostic value of exercise technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile ((99m)Tc-MIBI) single-photon emission tomography (SPET) imaging in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Three hundred and eighteen consecutive post-PCI patients who underwent exercise and rest (99m)Tc-MIBI SPET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) were followed up for 38+/-27 months. Patients with early revascularisation (<3 months after MPI) were excluded. A semiquantitative visual analysis employing a 20-segment and four-point scoring system was used to define the summed stress score (SSS), summed rest score (SRS) and summed difference score (SDS). Death and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) were considered as hard events, and late revascularisation procedures (>/=3 months after MPI) as soft events. Fifty-one patients (16.0%) suffered from cardiac events during follow-up, including 1 (0.3%) death, 13 (4.1%) non-fatal MIs, 9 (2.8%) coronary artery bypass grafting procedures and 28 (8.8%) PCIs. According to the SPET results, patients were classified into three groups: patients with normal MPI (SSS=0, n=153), patients with irreversible defects (SDS<3 and SRS>1, n=100) and patients with reversible defects (SDS>/=3, n=65). The annual hard cardiac event rate in patients with reversible defects was 3.9%, which was significantly higher than that in patients with normal MPI (0.2%, chi(2)=7.71 P<0.01). The annual soft cardiac event rate in patients with reversible defects was 10.7%, which was significantly higher than that in patients with irreversible defects (2.5% chi(2)=17.69
