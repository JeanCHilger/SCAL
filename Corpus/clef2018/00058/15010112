Event-related fMRI with painful electrical stimulation of the trigeminal nerve. Several functional brain imaging studies of pain using positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that painful stimulation causes activation of different brain areas. The aim of the present study was to develop and implement painful stimulation of the trigeminal nerve, which can be applied with event-related paradigms by using MRI. Twelve healthy, right-handed volunteers were examined. Painful electrical stimulation of the first trigeminal branch was performed. In an event-related setting with a 1.5 T clinical scanner with EPI capability, the following fMRI parameters were used: 20 slices, 3 mm thickness, isotropic voxel, 306 measurements with 54 randomized events. Statistical postprocessing was performed with SPM99. Activation of the ipsi- and contralateral secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), and the contralateral insular cortex was observed as well as a contralateral thalamic activation (T=4.45, extension 15 voxels). Six of the 12 volunteers revealed also activation of the cingulate cortex. The investigation demonstrates that painful stimulation of the trigeminal nerve activates the contralateral insular cortex, SII, and thalamus, as well as the ipsilateral SII. In contrast to other studies, the cingulate cortex was only activated inconsistently.
