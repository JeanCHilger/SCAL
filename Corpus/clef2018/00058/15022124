Molecular imaging for pediatric lung diseases. Molecular imaging is a rapidly developing multidisciplinary field that combines advances in contrast agent development, instrumentation, and molecular/cell biology to follow cellular and sub-cellular events in intact organisms. Platforms for molecular imaging include radionuclide-based methods, optical methods, and magnetic resonance. To date, molecular imaging studies of the lungs have been used to monitor the effectiveness of gene transfer, neutrophilic inflammation, and cell trafficking. Eventually, the goal will be to translate these new techniques to clinical settings such as cystic fibrosis.
