New therapeutic strategies for Hodgkin lymphoma in cooperation of radiation oncology and medical oncology. Between 1984 and 2002 more than 9500 pts. were enrolled in the multicentric randomized trials of the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) and are evaluable for response, survival, recurrences, and toxicities. Actually the GHSG evaluates the efficacy of risk-adapted therapy composed of polychemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT). An extensive RT quality assurance program has been practiced during the study generations and will be continued.The 4th study generation (1998-2002) includes the following trials: In the HD10 trial (early stages) 4x ABVD are tested against 2x ABVD followed by 20 Gy Involved Field (IF)-RT vs. 30 Gy IF-RT (4 arms). In order to optimize CT-regimen and IF-RT dose for pts. with intermediate stage, the HD11 trial compares 4x ABVD with 4x BEACOPP baseline followed by 20 Gy IF-RT vs. 30 Gy IF-RT in a 4 arm design. Concerning advanced stages (HD12), the BEACOPP regimen is to be optimized and the necessity of additive RT is tested. The standard arm (8x BEACOPP escalated) is compared with the toxicity reduced arm (4x BEACOPP escalated + 4x BEACOPP baseline) followed by 30 Gy RT on initial bulky disease and/or residual tumor vs. no RT (4 arms).Interim results (without arm comparisons) with a median follow-up of 18 months for HD10 and HD11 and 20 months for HD12 are as follows: Freedom from Treatment Failure (FFTF) at 18 months is in the HD10 trial (390 pts.) 96.4%, in the HD11 trial (480 pts.) 91.5% and in the HD12 trial (550 pts.) 90.2%.The overall survival (OS) at 18 months is in HD10 98.2%, in HD11 98.5%, in HD12 93.5%. In HD10, HD11 and HD12 respectively, 1.8%, 1.9% and 2.5% of pts. died and 1.0%, 2.5% and 2.2% suffered early progression. CONCLUSION/FURTHER STRATEGY: In order to reduce the relapse rate and toxicity and to improve the quality of life, the new HD13 trial for early stages (Fig. 1a) compares 2x ABVD, 2x ABV, 2x AVD und 2x AV, each followed by 30 Gy IF-RT. For the intermediate stages, the FFTF rate should be improved by intensifying the standard regimen. Therefore the new trial HD14 (Fig. 1b) compares 4x ABVD with 2x BEACOPP escalated + 2x ABVD, each followed by 30 Gy IF-RT. In the new trial for advanced stages HD15 (Fig. 1c),the FFTF/OS rates are to be maintained and the quality of life to be improved. 8x BEACOPP escalated, 6x BEACOPP escalated and 8x BEACOPP baseline with shortened 14-day cycle are compared. The use of PET to decide on additive RT will also be investigated.
