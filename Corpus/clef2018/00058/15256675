Long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril therapy improves cerebral perfusion reserve in patients with previous minor stroke. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-based therapy reduces the recurrence of stroke. The present study assessed the effects of long-term ACE inhibitor therapy on cerebral circulation in patients with previous minor stroke.After a run-in period, 19 patients were randomized to ACE inhibitor therapy (n=9 4 mg of perindopril dailySystolic/diastolic BP and CBF during normocapnia showed no significant changes between entry and completion of the trial in the perindopril and placebo groups. Mean value of CPR showed a significant increase in the perindopril group (from 3.7+/-1.7%/mm Hg to 4.8+/-1.7%/mm Hg P<0.05) but not in the placebo group (from 4.1+/-0.8%/mm Hg to 4.2+/-0.6%/mm HgLong-term ACE inhibitor-based therapy had a beneficial effect on the cerebral circulation by improving CPR in patients with previous minor stroke.
