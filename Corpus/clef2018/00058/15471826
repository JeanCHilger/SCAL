Defining the priority of using 18F-FDG PET for recurrent cervical cancer. PET with 18F-FDG has shown its potential in cervical cancer. For maximizing the benefits of this new imaging technology, we aimed to define the prognostic features of recurrent cervical cancer patients for selecting appropriate candidates using 18F-FDG PET.Patients enrolled were from 2 independent prospective studies investigating the role of 18F-FDG PET in cervical cancer patients after definitive treatment with documented failure (CTRP-018) or unexplained elevated tumor marker serum levels (CTRP-016) and proven relapse after PET. A total of 55 eligible patients received PET and CT or MRI. Lesion status was determined from pathologic results or clinical follow-up. The benefits calculated were based on treatment that was modified because of the PET findings. The Cox proportional hazards ratio (HR) was used to select independent prognostic covariates.Thirty-six (65.5%) patients had treatment that was modified due to PET. Primary radiation (HR = 14.62 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.74-77.92), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) > or = 4 ng/mL (HR = 5.82Using this risk score, 18F-FDG PET may offer maximal benefits by selecting appropriate recurrent cervical cancer patients for salvage therapy with precise restaging information.
