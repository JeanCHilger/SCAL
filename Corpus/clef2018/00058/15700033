Oxaliplatin combined with infusional 5-fluorouracil and concomitant radiotherapy in inoperable and metastatic rectal cancer: a phase I trial. The aim of this study was to define the recommended dose of oxaliplatin when combined with infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and concurrent pelvic radiotherapy. Eligible patients had inoperable rectal cancer, or symptomatic primary rectal cancer with metastasis. Oxaliplatin was given on day 1 of weeks 1, 3 and 5 of radiotherapy. Dose level 1 was oxaliplatin 70 mg m(-2) with 5-FU 200 mg m(-2) day(-1) continuous infusion 96 h week(-1). On dose level 2, the oxaliplatin dose was increased to 85 mg m(-2). On dose level 3, the duration of the 5-FU was increased to 168 h per week. Pelvic radiotherapy was 45 Gray (Gy) in 25 fractions over 5 weeks with a boost of 5.4 Gy. Fluorine-18 fluoro deoxyglucose and Fluorine-18 fluoro misonidazole positron emission tomography (FDG-PET and FMISO-PET) were used to assess metabolic tumour response and hypoxia. In all, 16 patients were accrued. Dose-limiting toxicities occurred in one patient at level 2 (grade 3 chest infection), and two patients at level 3 (grade 3 diarrhoea). Dose level 2 was declared the recommended dose level. FDG-PET imaging showed metabolic responses in 11 of the 12 primary tumours assessed. Four of six tumours had detectable hypoxia on FMISO-PET scans. The addition of oxaliplatin to infusional 5-FU chemoradiotherapy was feasible and generally well tolerated. For future trials, oxaliplatin 85 mg m(-2) and 5-FU 200 mg m(-2) day(-1) continuous infusion 96 h week(-1) is the recommended dose when combined with 50.4 Gy of pelvic radiotherapy.
