Demonstration of human motor cortex activation using SPECT. Recent advances in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have allowed improved image resolution with lower doses of labelled tracer. Capitalizing on these improvements, the authors have developed a new SPECT protocol for imaging neuronal activation. We outline this technique and describe how it can demonstrate increased human motor cortex activity in normal subjects performing a motor task. The ability to accurately demonstrate neuronal activation with SPECT using this method may have important scientific and clinical implications.
