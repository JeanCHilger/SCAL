Expectation of sensory stimulation modulates brain activation during visual motion stimulation. The differential effects of visual hemifield motion stimulation during fixation of a stationary target were compared under two conditions: fixation straight ahead without any further instructions and fixation straight ahead with attention shifted to the "dark hemifield." Data from nine right-handed volunteers revealed that striate and extrastriate right hemispheric visual areas exhibited larger activations during left hemifield motion stimulation when attention was shifted to the right dark hemifield. Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates (26, -98, -4) of the additional clusters activated in the latter condition corresponded best to the kinetic occipital region, which is known to process both shape and motion information, and to parts of area V3 posterior to V3A, which has been shown repeatedly to mediate motion perception. A simple computational model of transhemispheric visuovisual interaction is proposed. The basic mechanism of this model is a central predictor formed by a feedback loop that detects a mismatch between input to the two hemispheres. Predicted stimulation is then compared with the actual input. If the sensed motion of a visual hemifield is larger than the predicted net motion in the model, activation of the respective neural population is increased conversely, a smaller actual motion causes less activation.
