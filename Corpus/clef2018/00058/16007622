Three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection study of freezing of gait and brain perfusion image in Parkinson's disease. Gait disturbance is a cardinal symptom in patients with Parkinson's disease. Among the gait disturbances, freezing of gait is a unique and troublesome symptom, but its mechanism is unclear. We compared brain perfusion images using three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection analysis of N-isopropyl-p-123I iodoamphetamine single photon emission computed tomography between Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait and those without. Twenty-four cases (freezing of gait group) with Parkinson's disease with freezing of gait, and 31 Hoehn and Yahr stage-matched cases (no freezing of gait group) with Parkinson's disease without freezing of gait were studied. Bilateral Brodmann area 11 perfusion of the freezing of gait group decreased significantly compared to that of the no freezing of gait group. The Brodmann area 11 may play important roles in gait, and impairment in this region may have a close relationship with freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease.
