Effects of nonideal input functions on PET measurements of pulmonary blood flow. Regional pulmonary blood flow (rPBF) can be measured with an intravenous infusion of 15O-labeled water and positron emission tomography (PET). The current method depends on two assumptions related to the input of activity to the lung during the scan: 1) the pulmonary arterial tracer input is constant (i.e., a "step function" in shape), and 2) the scan begins at the instant of arrival of the step function. To determine the effect that departures from these assumptions might have on the measurement of rPBF, we performed a series of mathematical simulations for three different input functions: 1) a step function that arrived either 1 or 2 s before or after scan start 2) a dispersed input function, with activity rising during the scan period
