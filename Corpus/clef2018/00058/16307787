Separation of plastic mixtures using liquid-fluidized bed technology. Separation of heavier-than-water plastic mixtures had been investigated via the fluidization of their packed beds induced by an upward flow of water. The samples examined were resin pellets and crushed plastic products including PVC, PET and PBT. On the onset of a flow, a mixed bed was swelled to the state of fluidization and separated into layers of respective resins depending on their density. The effects of the flow rate, an amount of the samples and their density difference were examined on the separation of resin pellets. Under an appropriate condition, the process was completed within a few minutes, and satisfactory separation was attained when the density difference of the samples exceeded 0.05 g cm-3. By using a column equipped with several sample outlets sorted resins could be recovered with their purity intact by withdrawing each layer successively from above through a suitable outlet. Multi-stage separation was also found to be effective in treating close-density samples. Compared with uniform-sized resin pellets, size distribution of crushed plastic samples deteriorated the separation to some extent.
