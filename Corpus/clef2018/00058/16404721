Protein microarrays on hybrid polymeric thin films prepared by self-assembly of polyelectrolytes for multiple-protein immunoassays. We report here the development and characterization of protein microarrays fabricated on nanoengineered 3-D polyelectrolyte thin films (PET) deposited on glass slide by consecutive adsorption of polyelectrolytes via self-assembly technique. Antibodies or antigens were immobilized in the PET-coated glass slides by electrostatic adsorption and entrapment of porous structure of the 3-D polymer film and thus establishing a platform for parallel analysis. Both antigen and antibody microarrays were fabricated on the PET-coated slides, and direct and indirect immunoassays on protein microarrays for multiple-analyte detection were demonstrated. Microarrays produced on these PET-coated slides have consistent spot morphology and provide performance features needed for proteomic analysis. The protein microarrays on the PET films provide LOD as low as 6 pg/mL and dynamic ranges up to three orders of magnitude, which are wider than the protein microarrays fabricated on aldehyde and poly-L-lysine functionalized slides. The PET films constructed by self-assembly technique in aqueous solution is green chemistry based, cost-effective method to generate 3-D thin film coatings on glass surface, and the coated slide is well suited for immobilizing many types of biological molecules so that a wide variety of microarray formats can be developed on this type of slide.
