Brain SPECT imaging and whole-body biodistribution with [(123)I]ADAM - a serotonin transporter radiotracer in healthy human subjects. [(123)I]-2-((2-((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl)thio)-5-iodophenylamine ([(123)I]ADAM), a novel radiotracer, has promising application in the imaging of the serotonin transporter (SERT) in the human brain. In this study, the optimal scanning time for acquiring brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images was determined by performing dynamic SPECT studies at intervals from 0 to 6 h postinjection of [(123)I]ADAM. Additionally, radiation-absorbed doses were determined for three healthy human subjects using attenuation-corrected images.Twelve subjects were randomized into one of three study groups as follows: whole-body distribution imaging (n=3), dynamic SPECT imaging (n=3) and brain SPECT imaging (n=6). The radiation-absorbed dose was calculated using MIRDOSE 3.0 software with attenuation-corrected data. The specific binding (SB) ratio of the brain stem was measured from dynamic SPECT images to determine the optimal scanning time.Dynamic SPECT images showed that the SB of the brain stem gradually increased to a maximum 4 h postinjection. Single photon emission computed tomography images at 4 h postinjection showed a high uptake of the radiotracer (SB) in the hypothalamus (1.40+/-0.12), brain stem (1.44+/-0.16), pons (1.13+/-0.14) and medial temporal lobe (0.59+/-0.10). The mean adult male value of effective dose was 3.37 x 10(-2) mSv/MBq with a 4.8-h urine-voiding interval. Initial high uptake in SERT-rich sites was demonstrated in the lung and brain. A prominent washout of the radiotracer from the lung further increased brain radioactivity that reached a peak value of 5.03% of injected dose 40 min postinjection.[(123)I]ADAM is a promising radiotracer for SPECT imaging of SERT in humans with acceptable dosimetry and high uptake in SERT-rich regions. Brain SPECT images taken within 4 h following injection show optimal levels of radiotracer uptake in known SERT sites. However, dynamic changes in lung SERT distribution must be carefully evaluated.
