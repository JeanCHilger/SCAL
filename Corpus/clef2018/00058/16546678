Ketamine displaces the novel NMDA receptor SPET probe [(123)I]CNS-1261 in humans in vivo. [(123)I]CNS-1261 [N-(1-naphthyl)-N'-(3-iodophenyl)-N-methylguanidine] is a high-affinity SPET ligand with selectivity for the intra-channel PCP/ketamine/MK-801 site of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. This study evaluated the effects of ketamine (a specific competitor for the intra-channel PCP/ketamine/MK-801 site) on [(123)I]CNS-1261 binding to NMDA receptors in vivo. Ten healthy volunteers underwent 2 bolus-plus-infusion [(123)I]CNS-1261 scans, one during placebo and the other during a ketamine challenge. Ketamine administration led to a significant decrease in [(123)I]CNS-1261 V(T) in most of the brain regions examined (P<.05). [(123)I]CNS-1261 appears to be a specific ligand in vivo for the intra-channel PCP/ketamine/MK-801 NMDA binding site.
