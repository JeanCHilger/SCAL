Diagnostic value of 123I-IMT SPECT in the follow-up of head and neck cancer. Nuclear medicine imaging is increasingly used in the evaluation of tumors of the head and neck. In the current study, we assess the value of single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) using the amino acid tracer L-3-[123I]iodine-alpha-methyl-tyrosine (IMT) for the detection of recurrent head and neck cancer.45 consecutive patients with suspected recurrence of previously treated head and neck cancer were examined by IMT-SPECT using a dual head system with integrated low-dose computed tomography (CT). The accuracy of the IMT-SPECT was evaluated by correlating the findings with results of histology or clinical and CT/MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) follow-up examinations.The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of IMT-SPECT in the detection of recurrent/persistent tumors were 83, 89 and 84.5%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive value amounted to 96.5 and 60%, respectively.IMT-SPECT using integrated low-dose CT appears to be a helpful complementary imaging tool for the detection of local recurrences and lymph node metastases of head and neck cancer and their differentiation from treatment-induced changes. The advantage of the method is the high positive predictive value in the diagnosis of relapsed tumors. However, a negative IMT-SPECT result does not exclude a recurrence.
