Immunological and immunogenetic markers in sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Common polymorphisms of genes controlling inflammation-modulating cytokines and acute-phase proteins which play important roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been shown to be associated with AD.The immunological and immunogenetic markers potentially useful for the AD risk evaluation and diagnosis are briefly reviewed.The state-of-the-art of immunological and immunogenetic markers of AD indicates that new tools and strategies are necessary to identify gene products useful as diagnostic tools.
