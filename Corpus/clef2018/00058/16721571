99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-octreotate scintigraphy, an efficient method for the detection and staging of carcinoid tumours: results of 3 years' experience. At all stages of the disease, serious difficulties are encountered in the imaging diagnosis of carcinoids. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) holds great promise for detecting primary tumours and metastases. 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-octreotate should significantly improve the diagnosis of carcinoids in comparison with 111In-Octreoscan owing to the better affinity for SSR2 and the higher count rate. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic efficiency of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-octreotate scintigraphy in the detection and staging of carcinoid tumours.The study population comprised 75 patients (age 48.5+/-15.5 years): 46 with histological confirmation of carcinoid and 29 with suspected disease. 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-octreotate (740 MBq) SRS and CT were performed in all patients. Fifteen patients were examined with 111In-Octreoscan.High-quality 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-octreotate images were obtained in all cases, with maximum tumour tracer accumulation 4 h p.i. The mean target/non-target ratios for whole body (WB) and SPECT scans were, respectively, as follows: primary lesions: 4.5 and 10.2 metastases: liver, 3.1 and 12.399mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-octreotate, with high imaging quality, is an excellent alternative to 111In-Octreoscan for staging of carcinoids, and it seems to be the method of choice for detection of the primary focus in patients with metastases from an unknown primary tumour.
