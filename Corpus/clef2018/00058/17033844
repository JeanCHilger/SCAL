Serotonin transporter occupancy induced by paroxetine in patients with major depression disorder: a 123I-ADAM SPECT study. To assess the paroxetine-induced serotonin transporter (SERT) occupancy (SERTocc) using in vivo (123)I-ADAM SPECT.(123)I-ADAM SPECT was used to investigate the SERTocc induced by paroxetine in major depression disorder (MDD) patients, to compare the SERT availability in drug-free MDD patients and healthy volunteers, and to study the relationship between paroxetine plasma concentrations (Cp) and SERTocc.Measures of SERT availability by means of (123)I-ADAM SPECT were obtained in ten MDD patients before and after 4- to 6-week treatment with paroxetine 20 mg/day. (123)I-ADAM SPECT measures of SERT availability from a group of ten previously studied age-matched healthy volunteers were used for comparison. The relationship between percentages of SERTocc and paroxetine Cp was studied using an E (max) model.Mean SERTocc values were 66.4 +/- 9.5% in midbrain, 63.0 +/- 9.6% in thalamus, and 61.3 +/- 10.9% in striatum. No significant differences in SERTocc were found among these three regions. No significant differences in mean SERT availability were found in any region between drug-free MDD patients (midbrain = 1.14 +/- 0.15 thalamus = 0.85 +/- 0.13Using (123)I-ADAM SPECT, treatment with paroxetine 20 mg/day leads to more than 60% SERTocc on average in cerebral regions with known high SERT density. Data from this study do not support the existence of SERT availability differences between drug-free MDD patients and healthy volunteers. Finally, the E (max) model is suitable for the study of paroxetine Cp relationship to (123)I-ADAM SPECT-measured SERTocc. This approach may be useful for pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships in drug development.
