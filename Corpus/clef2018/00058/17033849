Multimodal fusion imaging ensemble for targeted sentinel lymph node management: initial results of an innovative promising approach for anatomically difficult lymphatic drainage in different tumour entities. There are situations where exact identification and localisation of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are very difficult using lymphoscintigraphy, a hand-held gamma probe and vital dye, either a priori or a posteriori. We developed a new method using a simultaneous injection of two lymphotropic agents for exact topographical tomographic localisation and biopsy of draining SLNs. The purpose of this prospective pilot study was to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of this method ensemble.Fourteen patients with different tumour entities were enrolled. A mixture of (99m)Tc-nanocolloid and a dissolved superparamagnetic iron oxide was injected interstitially. Dynamic, sequential static lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT served as pathfinders. MR imaging was performed 2 h after injection. SPECT, contrast MRI and, if necessary, CT scan data sets were fused and evaluated with special regard to the topographical location of SLNs. The day after injection, nine patients underwent SLN biopsy and, in the presence of SLN metastasis, an elective lymph node dissection.Twenty-five SLNs were localised in the 14 patients examined. A 100% fusion correlation was achieved in all patients. The anatomical sites of SLNs detected during surgery showed 100% agreement with those localised on the multimodal fusion images. SLNs could be excised in 11/14 patients, six of whom had nodal metastasis.Our novel approach of multimodal fusion imaging for targeted SLN management in primary tumours with lymphatic drainage to anatomically difficult regions enables SLN biopsy even in patients with lymphatic drainage to obscure regions. Currently, we are testing its validity in larger patient groups and other tumour entities.
