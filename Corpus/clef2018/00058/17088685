Relationship between cancer cell proliferation, tumour angiogenesis and 201Tl uptake in non-small cell lung cancer. To investigate whether 201Tl uptake is associated with cell proliferation and angiogenesis in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).Eighty-four patients with scheduled NSCLC underwent 201Tl single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging: 15 min (early scan) and 240 min (delayed scan) after intravenous injection of 111 MBq of 201Tl chloride. 201Tl indices were calculated on early images (early ratio: ER) and delayed images (delayed ratio: DR). The retention index (RI) was also calculated from these two parameters. Using surgically resected cancer specimens (54 adenocarcinoma, 24 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), six large-cell carcinoma), immunohistochemical stains for both Ki-67 (MIB-1 index) and CD34 were performed to examine the proliferative activity and the micro-vessel density (MVD), respectively.The mean value of 201Tl index was 1.69+/-0.77 (ER) and 2.31+/-1.08 (DR). The average RI was 42.6+/-42.9%, respectively. Both DR and RI positively correlated with MIB-1 index (r = 0.68, P < 0.05 and r = 0.52, P < 0.05). When we analyse adenocarcinoma and SCC separately, there was a significant positive correlation (r = 0.62, P < 0.05) between RI and MIB-1 index in adenocarcinoma but not in SCC (r = 0.20, P = NS). The value of ER positively correlated with MVD (r = 0.75, P < 0.05). It demonstrated strong positive correlation with both histological types (adenocarcinoma: r = 0.80, P < 0.05, SCC: r = 0.66, P < 0.05).201Tl SPECT imaging is effective non-invasive method for assessing both the proliferation and the angiogenesis in NSCLC. Both DR and RI are useful indicators for assessing cancer cell proliferation in lung adenocarcinoma. ER is a useful marker for assessing the tumour angiogenesis in NSCLC.
