Neuroimaging of the dopamine transporter in Parkinsons disease: first study using [99mTc]-TRODAT-1 and SPECT in Brazil. Dopamine transporter (DAT) neuroimaging radiotracers were developed to estimate dopamine neuronal loss in vivo in Parkinsons disease (PD).To evaluate DAT density in vivo using [99mTc]-TRODAT-1 and single photon computerized tomography (SPECT) in a population of Brazilian PD.Fifteen PD patients and 15 matched healthy controls scanned with [99mTc]-TRODAT-1 (INER-Taiwan) and SPECT. Estimates of striatum DAT density were calculated using binding potential (BP). Patients were assessed with PD scales.PD patients had significantly lower striatal DAT-BP (mean+/-SD) (0.38+/-0.12) compared to controls (BP=0.84+/-0.16 p<0.01). A 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity was obtained to discriminate PD cases from controls. Negative correlations between striatal DAT-BP and PD severity (rho=-0.7, p<0.001) and motor scales (rho=-0.80, p<0.001) were found.[99mTc]TRODAT-1 SPECTs scanning was able to discriminate PD patients from controls. The technique is a powerful instrument to measure DAT density that can be used in clinical and research settings in Brazil.
