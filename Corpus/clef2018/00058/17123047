Soft tissue carcinoma. Epidemiology, diagnostics and therapy. The treatment of soft tissue sarcoma requires an individually tailored, multimodal therapy due to the high variability in the clinical situation. Resection is the usual treatment for patients with superficial, low grade tumors with a diameter of <5 cm. For intermediate grade, differentiated lesions, resection with negative resection edges combined with radiotherapy attains an almost 80% total survival rate. For patients with high grade sarcoma of >5 cm, local control can be attained by resection and radiotherapy, however every second patient will develop metastases. Patients with a local recurrence should consider a new resection. Radiotherapy is the more effective the lower the remaining postoperative tumor burden.
