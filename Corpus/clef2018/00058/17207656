Utility of 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography and positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging in the preoperative staging of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The combination of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) has been reported to be more accurate than CT or PET alone in a preoperative setting. We compared the diagnostic utility of preoperative PET/CT, PET and CT/MRI in 167 patients with newly diagnosed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), of whom 104 underwent FDG PET and 63 underwent combined PET/CT with all receiving CT/MRI. These preoperative PET, PET/CT, and CT/MRI results were reviewed and their accuracies were compared in patients in whom diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically. Age, sex, primary sites and stage, and nodal involvement were comparable between two groups. The accuracy of PET and PET/CT for detecting primary tumors and cervical metastases was comparable, but significantly higher than that of CT/MRI (98%-97% vs. 86-88% for primary 92%-93% vs. 85%-86% for neck on a level-by-level basis
