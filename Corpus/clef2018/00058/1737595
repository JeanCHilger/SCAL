Radioimmunoscintigraphy of metastatic breast carcinoma. Seventeen patients with breast cancer underwent preoperative radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS). Planar and tomographic imaging techniques (single photon emission computerised tomography--SPECT) were studied using Indium-111-labelled anti-epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) antibodies for tumour localisation. Overall imaging sensitivities were reasonable with correct identification of around 90% of primary lesions and 50% of secondary lesions. Planar imaging was more sensitive than SPECT for identification of superficial lesions such as the primary lesions (88% vs 56%) and axillary metastases (59% vs 53%). SPECT was necessary, however, for detection of deeper lesions such as internal mammary chain metastases and often served as an adjunct rather than an alternative to planar imaging. RIS, therefore, may contribute to more accurate staging of breast cancer, although further technical advances in RIS would enhance this contribution.
