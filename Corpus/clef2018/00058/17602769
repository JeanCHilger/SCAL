Phase I/II clinical and pharmacokinetic study evaluating a fully human monoclonal antibody against EGFr (HuMax-EGFr) in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. To assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of HuMax-EGFr in patients with SCCHN.Twenty-eight patients with SCCHN were enrolled. The study comprised a single-dose escalation part for assessment of safety issues followed by a repeat dose extension including 4 weekly infusions at the same doses. Efficacy and metabolic response were evaluated according to RECIST by CT and FDG-PET.Most frequently reported adverse event was rash. All but one event were CTC grade 1 or 2 and a dose-dependent relationship was indicated. Duration of skin reactions varied from few days to 2 months. No DLTs were observed and MTD was not reached. In the two highest dose groups, 7 of 11 patients obtained a PR or SD and 9 patients obtained metabolic PR or SD.HuMax-EGFr can be safely administered in doses up to 8 mg/kg, and preliminary data on tumour response are encouraging.
