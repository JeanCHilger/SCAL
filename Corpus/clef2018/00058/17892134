Preliminary study on the value of 99Tc(m)-HL91 imaging in predicting sensitivity to radiotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. To investigate the feasibility of 9Tc(m)-HL91 imaging in prediction of 34 radiotherapy sensitivity of naqsopharyngeal cancer( NPC) and its relationship with prognosis.patients with NPC confirmed by pathology, staging from II-IVa, underwent 99Tc(m)-HL91 SPECT imaging one week before radiotherapy. 18 of them received adjuvant chemotherapy. The hypoxia in primary nasopharyngeal lesions and cervical lymph node metastases were calculated semi-quantitatively, and compared with clinical findings in medium-term therapy at 4 months and 1 year post therapy.(1) There was no significant relationship between the total preliminary curative effect of adjuvant chemotherapy and the degree of nasopharyngeal lesion hypoxia (T/Mu, gamma = -0.394, P = 0.145 T/ Ce gamma = -0.510, P = 0.052). But there was a significant difference between the partial curative effect group and significant curative effect group. (2) The degree of NPC regression in the medium-term radiotherapy group was negatively correlated with the degree of hypoxia (T/Mu, gamma = -0.60299 Tc(m)-HL91 hypoxia imaging may predict sensitivity to radiotherapy in patients with NPC, with a potential help to carry out individual therapy. However, further investigation is needed to ascertain whether it could predict the long-time curative effect on NPC radiotherapy.
