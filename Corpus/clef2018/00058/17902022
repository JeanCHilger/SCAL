2-Deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose joint uptake on positron emission tomography images: rheumatoid arthritis versus osteoarthritis. Previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies have shown increased 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) uptake in joints of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and inflamed joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study compares FDG uptake in joints of RA and OA patients and FDG-uptake with clinical signs of inflammation.FDG-PET scans of hands and wrists were performed in patients with RA and primary OA. PET data were compared with clinical data.29% of RA joints and 6% of OA joints showed elevated FDG-uptake. The level of uptake in PET-positive OA joints was not significantly different from that in RA joints. The majority of PET results of RA joints corresponded with clinical findings. Clinical synovitis was found some OA joints with FDG-uptake.FDG-uptake was observed in the majority of clinically inflamed RA joints and in a few OA joints with no significant difference in uptake level. The latter may be due to secondary synovitis.
