Extended stability of iobenguane under simulated clinical conditions. The stability of iobenguane sulfate stored at 4-7 degrees C over 91 days was studied.An iobenguane sulfate solution at a concentration of 2.2 mg/mL was prepared in a top-fill i.v. bag using 143 mg of iobenguane sulfate and 65 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. The solution was poured through a 0.22- microm filter assembly for sterilization into 60 1-mL polycarbonate plastic syringes. Each syringe was filled with 0.9 mL of the iobenguane sulfate solution and stored in amber plastic bags at 4-7 degrees C. The stability of iobenguane sulfate was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography immediately after solution preparation and on days 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 91. Samples were inspected for chemical purity by observing for particulate formation and color change.The mean concentration of ioben-guane exceeded 93% of the initial concentration in all samples throughout the 91-day study period. No changes in color or turbidity were observed.Iobenguane sulfate 2.2 mg/mL was stable for 91 days when stored in polycarbonate syringes at 4-7 degrees C.
