The clinical significance of reverse redistribution of Tl-201 SPECT at rest in the 1st month after the onset of acute myocardial infarction. The pattern of Thallium-201 reverse redistribution (r-RD) at rest has been reported in some patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the acute phase. But there is no report of this pattern in the later phase. To investigate the significance of Thallium-201 reverse redistribution in the subacute phase, 37 patients with AMI underwent Thallium-201 SPECT at rest a month after the onset. The patients were classified into three groups visually and 19 of 37 patients (51%) showed the persistent defect pattern (Group PD), and the remaining 18 patients (49%) had the reverse redistribution pattern (Group r-RD). None of them had the redistribution pattern. Coronary reflow was earlier and the incidence of the scintigraphic overlap on Dual SPECT image of 99mTc-PYP/201TlCl in the acute phase was more frequent in Group r-RD than in Group PD. A decrease in thallium defect size of patients with r-RD from the acute phase to one month after the onset represented improvement more significantly than that with PD. Initial %Tl uptake of the infarcted region of Group r-RD was greater than that of Group PD. The degree of stenosis of the infarct-related coronary artery in Group r-RD was less severe than that in Group PD. And corresponding regional wall motion of Group r-RD was less impaired. The Thallium-201 washout in the infarcted region with r-RD was significantly faster than that in the normal region. It is concluded that the r-RD pattern at rest in the 1st month after the onset of AMI may be a sign of viable myocardium.
