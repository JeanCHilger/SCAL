CSF phosporylated TAU protein levels correlate with cerebral glucose metabolism assessed with PET in Alzheimer's disease. One major goal of drug development would be the establishment of biomarkers as objective indicators of normal biological and pathogenetic processes, or pharmacological response to a therapeutic intervention. A potential approach is to investigate proteins in CSF linked to key neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently CSF phosphorylated-Tau (p-Tau) levels have been reported to reflect neurofibrillary changes within the brain of patients with AD, however the use of serial CSF investigations in order to monitor the disease progression is not applicable. PET with FDG reveals characteristic patterns in AD patients, however so far no correlation between in vivo metabolic information and pathological features has been reported. In the present study, we tested whether CSF Tau levels correlate with metabolic rate for glucose consumption in a cohort of 28 AD patients. We found a statistically significative correlation between both CSF total and p-TAU protein and relative metabolic indexes obtained from 18FDG-PET scans in parietal, temporal and occipital lobes bilaterally. These results indicate the existence of a correlation between impairment of cerebral metabolism, estimated throughout FDG-PET, and CSF Tau protein levels.
