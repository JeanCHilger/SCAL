Quantitative measurement of monoclonal antibody distribution and blood flow using positron emission tomography and 124iodine in patients with breast cancer. The uptake and in vivo quantitation of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) has been measured non-invasively using positron emission tomography (PET) and 124iodine in 9 patients with breast ductal carcinoma. Blood-flow measurements were also made using 15oxygen-labelled water and PET to evaluate antibody delivery 7 patients were studied with HMFGI antibody and 2 patients with a non-specific antibody. Tumour uptake ranged from 2-7.7 x 10(-3)% of injected dose per gram of tissue. Values for normal tissues including liver, lung and bone were also obtained. In 2 out of 7 patients studied with the specific antibody, uptake was greater than that seen with the non-specific antibody. There was no correlation between antibody uptake and blood flow. This report exemplifies the potential of PET for the non-invasive and accurate quantitative assessment of targeted antibody which is a prerequisite to therapy.
