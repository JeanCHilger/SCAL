Stereoselective synthesis of (2S,3R)- and (2R,3S)-iodoreboxetine potential SPECT imaging agents for the noradrenaline transporter. With the aim of developing a new SPECT imaging agent for the noradrenaline transporter, a twelve-step stereoselective synthesis of iodinated analogues of (2S,3R)- and (2R,3S)-reboxetine has been achieved from 4-bromobenzaldehyde. The key steps involve a Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation to establish the stereogenic centres and a copper catalysed aromatic halogen exchange reaction to introduce the key iodine atom. In vitro testing of these compounds using a [(3)H]nisoxetine displacement assay with homogenised rat brain shows both compounds to have significant affinity, with K(i) values of 320.8 nM and 58.2 nM for (2S,3R)- and (2R,3S)-iodoreboxetine respectively.
