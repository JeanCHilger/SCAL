The impact of microcirculation dysfunction on the clinical presentations of multiple sclerosis in patients above 45 years and the possible ways of correction of the vascular pathology. The study was based on the hypothesis that the age-specific vascular disturbances, along with autoimmune processes, might play a role in the development of neurodegenerative changes in multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients above 45 years. Vascular disturbances were assessed using single photon emission computer tomography. Also magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound dopplerography of the brain and evaluation of patient's neurological and mental state with the MMSE were used. The main group consisted of 10 patients with MS aged above 45 years with the history of vascular disturbances was studied before and after the treatment with fezam, a preparation contained piracetam and cinnarizine. It has been shown that in the presence of the vascular risk factors the neurological deficit can increase in this group of patients not only due to inflammation and demyelinization but to vascular disturbances as well. In these cases, the administration of fezam used in treatment of brain vascular disorders proved to be effective. The drug exerted a positive effect on the patient's mental state including cognitive dysfunction.
