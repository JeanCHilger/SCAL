Metabolic imaging--PET, PET/CT--in oncologic surgery. The availability of PET/CT examinations in Hungary has significantly improved in the past few years. In the three Hungarian centres approximately 10,000 examinations can be performed yearly, which are financed by the national healthcare system. The PET/CT technique using FDG has become an efficient tumour diagnostic method due to its outstanding sensitivity and specificity. Similarly to other medical imaging techniques, PET/CT is a useful and cost-beneficial diagnostic modality in the hand of those clinicians, who clearly know its advantages and limitations. In the present paper the most frequent indications of PET/CT examinations are reviewed, with special attention to cases relevant to the everyday surgical practice. The applicability of this technique is also considered.
