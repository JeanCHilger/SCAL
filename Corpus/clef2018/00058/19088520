The role of ankle-brachial index as a screening test for coronary artery disease in the Hispanic population. This study evaluated the role of ankle-brachial index (ABI) as an effective screening test of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the Hispanic population.This was an observational cross-sectional study, based on a retrospective review of the medical management of the study patients using already available data. The study comprised 155 patients, aged 50 to 70 years with metabolic syndrome but no known CAD, presenting in El Paso, Texas between February 2004 and November 2006. An ABI test had been performed on all the patients in this study. Also, myocardial nuclear perfusion imaging using single photon emission computed tomography and electrocardiogram gating tests had been performed on these patients, because they all had multiple traditional risk factors for CAD.Sensitivity of low ABI in screening for CAD was 82.61%, while the specificity was 77.27%.ABI is an effective and cost-efficient screening test for CAD.
