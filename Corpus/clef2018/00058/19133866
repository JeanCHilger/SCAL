Feasibility and logistics of MRI before thrombolytic treatment. The study analyzes feasibility and time-delays in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based thrombolysis and estimate the impact of MRI on individual tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) treatment.Feasibility of MRI and time logistics were prospectively recorded in patients referred with presumed acute stroke over a 2 year time period. Door-to-needle-times (DNT) were compared with those of patients treated with rtPA after conventional CT during the same time period, and to published open label studies.We received 174 patients with presumed stroke. MRI was feasible in 141 of 161 (88%) of those requiring acute imaging. MRI supported the decision to treat 11 patients with mild symptoms or seizures, and not to treat four patients with extensive infarctions. Median 'door-to-needle time' (DNT) in MR scanned patients (70 min), did not differ significantly from DNT after conventional CT (n = 17, DNT = 66 min, P = 0.27) or the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke (SITS-MOST) registry (DNT = 68 min).Magnetic resonance imaging can be performed in the majority of acute stroke patients without delaying treatment. MRI may affect decision making in a large proportion of patients.
