Radiofrequency ablation for treatment of medically inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer. This study evaluated long-term results of radiofrequency ablation for medically inoperable early-stage lung cancer.Thirty-one consecutive patients with biopsy-proven non-small cell lung cancer underwent 38 treatments of computed tomographically guided radiofrequency ablation in a 4.5-year period. All patients were carefully selected and deemed medically ineligible for resection by a multidisciplinary team. Radiofrequency ablation was performed with curative intent with a single or cluster cool-tip electrode. Patients were hospitalized for 23-hour observation.Treatment was complete in all cases, with no 30-day mortality. Local recurrence was confirmed radiographically by computed tomography, positron emission tomography, or both after 31.5% of treatments (12/38). Two patients were successfully retreated for technical failures related to pneumothorax 3 underwent radiotherapy with stable disease. Mean maximal diameter of 38 tumors treated was 2.0 +/- 1.0 cm (range 0.8-4.4 cm). After median follow-up of 17 +/- 11 months, 74% of patients (23/31) were alive. Three patients died of metastatic diseaseRadiofrequency ablation of medically inoperable early-stage lung cancer in carefully selected patients yields encouraging midterm results without significant loss of pulmonary function. Local tumor progression appears related to lung tumors larger than 3 cm. Computed tomography and positron emission tomography need further validation for the early identification of local tumor progression following radiofrequency ablation.
