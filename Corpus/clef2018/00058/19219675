A first report of radioembolization for hepatic metastases from ocular melanoma. Ocular melanoma (OM) metastasizes to the liver and is rapidly fatal despite aggressive therapy. Yttrium-90 microspheres (radioembolization) delivered via the hepatic artery is an established and effective approach for primary and metastatic hepatic tumors, although (90)Y use in OM has not been reported previously.A retrospective review was performed for all patients with OM who received radioembolization at 5 centers.11 patients received 12 treatments with a median activity of 1.55 GBq delivered per treatment. Toxicity was minimal, with PET/CT at 3 months posttreatment showing a response in all patients 1 patient had a complete response.Radioembolization can control hepatic metastases of OM with very few side effects.
