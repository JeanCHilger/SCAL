Positron-emission tomography (PET) and PET/CT in head and neck cancer - recommendations of an interdisciplinary consensus conference. Today's available therapeutic options in head and neck cancer patients have led to better treatment modalities tailored to the individually clinical staging of the patients towards a risk adapted tumour management. This, however, is only possible with an accurately pretherapeutic diagnostic regimen and closely posttherapeutic follow-up.These issues were discussed by nuclear medicine experts, otorhinolaryngologists, oral surgeons, radiologists, radio-oncologists and oncologists in a meeting that took place in PÃ¶rtschach, Austria, on 05 May 2006. The aim was to discuss the impact and indications of performing FDG PET/CT in patients with head and neck cancer and to outline possible future perspectives.FDG PET/CT is recommended for a better pretherapeutic staging in stage IV according to UICC and should be the method of choice in CUP with lymph node metastases. FDG PET/CT should be performed 3 - 4 months after radiation-/radiochemotherapy to diagnose viable tumour and to avoid false positive results. To evaluate the position and effectiveness of FDG PET/CT in therapy-monitoring further studies are needed. In case of radiation therapy FDG PET/CT allows a tailored treatment of patients with an accurate design of the target volume to reduce damage to the surrounding tissues.The interdisciplinary consensus reached by the experts is not intended to recommend standard guidelines in the management of head and neck cancer but to summarise and stress the impact of FDG PET/CT on the basis of the present literature and current clinical practise.
