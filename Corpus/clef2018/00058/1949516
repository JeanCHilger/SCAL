Ambulatory electrocardiography in dogs. Twenty-four hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recording using a Medilog tape recorder was attempted in 16 healthy pet dogs weighing between 18.4 and 34 kg, while they were living in familiar surroundings. Full 24-hour records were obtained from 10 of them and recordings of more than 10 hours duration from two others and the findings in these recordings were similar. Maximum heart rates ranged between 110 and 300 beats/minute and the minimum rates ranged between 17 and 46 beats/minute. Intermittent ventricular premature complexes were recorded from these apparently healthy dogs and all but one dog demonstrated a sinus pause, longer than two seconds
