Limited view PET reconstruction of tissue radioactivity maps. This paper proposes a state space method for limited view PET reconstruction. Due to the high-level of noise and data-incompletion, prior knowledge is required to guide PET recovery. The compartmental model is used as an evolution equation to regularize the dynamic reconstruction. The continuous-discrete Kalman filter is adopted to calculate the radioactivity value recursively. With tracer kinetic information as prior, the state space approach can obtain a better result compared with the MLEM algorithm. The identifiability of this method is proved by computer synthetic simulation and real phantom experiment on the Hamamatsu SHR-22000PET scanner.
