Assessment of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with single photon emission computed tomography and coronary computed tomography angiography. We evaluated the characteristics of coronary artery disease in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA). A total of 116 patients with DM without abnormal electrocardiographic findings or evidence of peripheral arterial disease (number of risk factors > or =2 62 +/- 7 years, 59% men) underwent CCTA and SPECT. Of the 116 patients with DM, 88 (76%) had a normal single photon emission computed tomographic findings, and 28 (24%) had abnormal perfusion defects. Of the 116 patients, 92 (79%) had atherosclerotic plaques (2 +/- 2 segments per subject), and 20 (17%) had significant stenosis seen on CCTA. Patients with DM and normal findings on SPECT had a similar prevalence of atherosclerotic plaque (78% vs 82%), significant stenosis (15% vs 25%), severe stenosis (7% vs 7%), and calcified (40% vs 43%), mixed (49% vs 57%), and noncalcified plaques (26% vs 29%) and a high (>100) coronary artery calcium score (32% vs 29%
