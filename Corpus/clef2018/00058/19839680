Another breed of "service" animals: STARS study findings about pet ownership and recovery from serious mental illness. This study elucidates the role of pets in recovery processes among adults with serious mental illness. Data derive from interviews with 177 HMO members with serious mental illness (52.2% women, average age 48.8 years) in the Study of Transitions and Recovery Strategies (STARS).

Primary themes indicate pets assist individuals in recovery from serious mental illness by (a) providing empathy and "therapy" (b) providing connections that can assist in redeveloping social avenues
