Fabrication and biocompatibility investigation of TiO(2) films on the polymer substrates obtained via a novel and versatile route. Titanium oxide (TiO(2)) films were successfully deposited onto the polymer substrates of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyethylene (PE), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which were pre-modified with polydopamine coating (polydopamine and its coating are coded as PDA and PDAc, respectively), by a simple liquid phase deposition (LPD) process. The morphology and chemical state of the obtained TiO(2) films were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. Subsequently, the biocompatibility of the samples was investigated by 3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay and acridine orange staining of MC-3T3 osteoblast cells, and the results demonstrated that the fabricated TiO(2) films could markedly improve the in vitro cytocompatibility. So, the presented route is anticipated to be a promising surface modification methodology to improve the practical outcome of the implanted materials for its versatility and validity.
