The diagnostic value of dipyridamole (201)Tl-SPECT myocardial imaging and exercise myocardial (99)Tc(m)-MIBI-SPECT imaging on detecting cardiac syndrome X. To compare the value of dipyridamole (201)Tl Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial imaging and exercise myocardial (99)Tc(m)-MIBI SPECT imaging on diagnosing cardiac syndrome X.Sixty-three patients with known cardiac syndrome X were divided into dipyridamole (201)Tl SPECT myocardial imaging group (group 1, n = 35) and exercise myocardial (99)Tc(m)-MIBI-SPECT imaging group (group 2, n = 28) and the diagnostic accuracy rates were compared.Thirty-one out of 35 cardiac syndrome X patients showed reverse redistribution in group 1 and the diagnostic accuracy rate was 89%. Positive test results were evidenced 24 out of 28 cardiac syndrome X patients in group 2 and the diagnostic accuracy rate was 87% (P > 0.05 vs. group 1).The diagnostic accuracy rates of these two myocardial imaging methods were satisfactory and comparable on detecting cardiac syndrome X.
