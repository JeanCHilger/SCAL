Migration of epileptic spike foci in encephalograms may correlate with a better outcome in pediatric epilepsy. Epileptic spike foci in children can be fixed in specific brain regions or migrate over time. We analyzed 969 encephalograms from 463 epileptic children to determine outcome differences between those with fixed foci (FF) and those with migrated foci (MF) on at least three encephalograms over 3years. All epileptic spike foci were classified as frontal, temporal, central, parietal, or occipital. Migration directions were divided into anterior, posterior, lateral, and unclassified. Seventy-nine cases met the inclusion criteria: 24 (30%) FF and 55 (70%) MF. More patients in the FF than in the MF group required multiple antiepileptic drugs (P=0.004), and had abnormal image findings (P=0.014), mental retardation (P=0.035), and worse seizure control (P=0.047). Seizure frequency (P=0.007 correlation coefficient=0.56) and the number of prescribed drugs (P=0.047
