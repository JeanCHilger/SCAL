An improved method for measurement of target-to-background ratio in assessing mediastinal lesions on 18F-FDG coincidence SPECT/CT imaging. Target-to-background ratio (T/B) is a commonly used semiquantitative index in F-FDG dual-head coincidence single-photon emission computed tomography (c-SPECT) imaging. However, because of different methods of measurement, T/B varies. This study used F-FDG c-SPECT/CT imaging of mediastinal lesions to analyze the impact of different backgrounds for determining T/Bs.Thirty-five patients with mediastinal lesions underwent thoracic F-FDG c-SPECT/CT with 1-inch crystals. According to integrated CT, five types of backgrounds were precisely positioned as airway, fat, mediastinal space, vascular blood, and heart areas. Corresponding T/Bs (T/BA, T/BF, T/BM, T/BV, and T/BH) of benign and malignant lesions were calculated. Two-way analysis of variance, receiver-operating characteristic curves, and coefficient of variation were performed for statistical analyses.Seventeen benign lesions and 23 malignant lesions were identified in patients with histological confirmation. Only T/BA was significantly different from other T/Bs in both the benign and malignant groups yet, there were no significant differences in the remaining T/Bs (P<0.01). On the basis of receiver-operating characteristic curves, cutoff values, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value, the accuracy of diagnosis followed the order of T/BV>T/BM> T/BA>T/BF>T/BH, and T/BV showed optimal sensitivity (87.0%), specificity (76.5%), and accuracy (82.5%) of diagnosis. Vascular blood and mediastinal space areas, which were in the same homogeneous subset, possessed the significantly lowest coefficient of variation, indicating good homogeneity in the regions.Choosing different backgrounds has a great impact on the diagnostic accuracies of F-FDG c-SPECT/CT imaging of mediastinal lesions. The large blood vessel area is the best background choice for optimization of T/B calculation.
