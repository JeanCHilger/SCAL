In vivo evaluation of (64)Cu-labeled magnetic nanoparticles as a dual-modality PET/MR imaging agent. A novel nanoparticle-based dual-modality positron emission tomograph/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) contrast agent was developed. The probe consisted of a superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) core coated with PEGylated phospholipids. The chelator 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclo-dodecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) was conjugated to PEG termini to allow labeling with positron-emitting (64)Cu. Radiolabeling with (64)Cu at high yield and high purity was readily achieved. The (64)Cu-SPIO probes produced strong MR and PET signals and were stable in mouse serum for 24 h at 37 degrees C. Biodistribution and in vivo PET/CT imaging studies of the probes showed a circulation half-life of 143 min and high initial blood retention with moderate liver uptake, making them an attractive contrast agent for disease studies.
