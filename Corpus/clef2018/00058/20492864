Thalamic metabolism and neurological outcome after traumatic brain injury. A voxel-based morphometric FDG-PET study. to study the relationship between thalamic metabolism and neurological outcome in patients who had sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI).nineteen patients who had sustained a severe TBI and ten control subjects were included in this study. Six of the 19 patients had a low level of consciousness (vegetative state or minimally conscious state), while thirteen showed normal consciousness. All patients underwent a PET with 18F-FDG, 459.4 +/- 470.9 days after the TBI. The FDG-PET images were normalized in intensity, with a metabolic template being created from data derived from all subjects. The thalamic trace was generated automatically with a mask of the region of interest in order to evaluate its metabolism. A comparison between the two groups was carried out by a two sample voxel-based T-test, under the General Linear Model (GLM) framework.patients with low consciousness had lower thalamic metabolism (MNI-Talairach coordinates: 12, -24, 18 T = 4.1) than patients with adequate awareness (14, -28, 6the applied method may be a useful ancillary tool to assess neurological outcomes after a TBI, since it permits an objective quantitative assessment of metabolic function for groups of subjects. Our results confirm the vulnerability of the thalamus to suffering the effects of the acceleration-deceleration forces generated during a TBI. It is hypothesized that patients with low thalamic metabolism represent a subset of subjects highly vulnerable to neurological and functional disability after TBI.
