Cys-Arg-Pro-Pro-Arg-[ Endothelial cells are important in inflammatory responses (1, 2). The presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), virus growth, inflammation, and tissue injury increase secretion of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and other cytokines and chemokines. Emigration of leukocytes from the blood is dependent on their ability to roll along endothelial cell surfaces and subsequently adhere to endothelial cell surfaces. Inflammatory mediators and cytokines induce chemokine secretion from endothelial cells and other vascular cells, and they also increase their expression of cell-surface adhesion molecules, such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, integrins, and selectins. Chemokines are chemotactic toward leukocytes and toward sites of inflammation and tissue injury. The movement of leukocytes through endothelial junctions into the extravascular space are highly orchestrated through various interactions with different adhesion molecules on endothelial cells (3). Liposomes are double-membrane lipid vesicles (4). They have been widely studied as important carriers in controlling the spatial and temporal distribution of drug molecules or other bioactive molecules for targeted therapy for example, they have been used as universal carriers of tumor chemotherapeutic agents, as antigen carriers to stimulate immune response, as carriers of nucleic acid for gene therapy, and as carriers of antibiotics for infectious disease treatment (5). Marik et al. (6) developed liposomes by incorporation of [
