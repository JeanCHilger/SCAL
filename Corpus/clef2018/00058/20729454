Spectrum of FDG PET/CT findings of uterine tumors. The purpose of this article is to review FDG PET/CT and MRI findings in a variety of benign and malignant tumors of the uterus and to become familiar with the wide variety of FDG PET/CT findings of this entity.Benign uterine tumors generally have mild FDG uptake, and leiomyoma rarely shows high uptake. Uterine malignant tumors generally have intense FDG uptake, whereas malignant uterine tumors that are small or that have low cellular density often show minimal uptake.
