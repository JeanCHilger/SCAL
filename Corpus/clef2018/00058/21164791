Experimental Cerenkov luminescence tomography of the mouse model with SPECT imaging validation. Optical molecular imaging resulting from Cerenkov radiation has become a motivating topic recently and will potentially open new avenues for the study of small animal imaging. Cerenkov-based optical imaging taken from living animals in vivo has been studied with two-dimensional (2D) planar geometry and three-dimensional (3D) homogeneous mouse model. In this study, we performed 3D Cerenkov-based luminescence tomography (CLT) using a heterogeneous mouse model with an implanted Na(131)I radioactive source, which provided the accurate location for the reconstructed source. Furthermore, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was utilized to verify the results of 3D CLT. We reconstructed the localization and intensity of an embedded radioactive source with various concentrations, and established a quantitative relationship between the radiotracer activity and the reconstructed intensity. The results showed the ability of in vivo CLT to recover the radioactive probe distribution in the heterogeneous mouse model and the potential of a SPECT imaging validation strategy to verify the results of optical molecular tomography.
