Intrathoracic manifestations of breast cancer. Breast cancer continues to be the most common malignant neoplasm in women in Spain. The radiological study of intrathoracic manifestations, often secondary to complications, is of great interest because intrathoracic manifestations have a high prevalence and diagnosing them early significantly improves the patient's prognosis. The imaging techniques in current use for this purpose include plain-film chest X-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), thoracic ultrasonography, and hybrid techniques like positron emission tomography combined with CT (PET/CT). In this article, we review the imaging findings for the different types of intrathoracic complications of breast cancer, classified as: a) complications related to tumor dissemination, b) complications related to treatment, and c) idiopathic complications.
