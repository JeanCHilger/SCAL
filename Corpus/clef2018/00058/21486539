Memory clinics in Austria - characteristics and patterns of practice. To compile a cross-sectional overview of Austria's Memory Clinics, their staffing, diagnostic and therapeutic programs, and their acceptance and use.In April and May 2009 27 out of the 29 Austrian Memory Clinics participated in a telephone survey based on a standardized questionnaire.The number of Austrian Memory Clinics has risen in an essentially linear fashion between 1987 and 2009. A large majority (85%) had public sponsors. The fact that 57% of all patients seen at these institutions had been referred by their physician (while 25% were self-referrals) illustrates that Memory Clinics enjoy considerable acceptance and reputation among physicians, patients and caregivers. The psychometric tools that are employed conform to the state of the art in depression and cognitive screening in this type of population. In the large majority of Memory Clinics blood chemistry, cell counts, and medical imaging is mandatory, and frequently includes cerebral SPECT or PET radioimaging. Psychosocial counseling was the single most frequent therapeutic program feature (44%), followed by cognition training (15%) and caregiver counseling groups with or without explicit training (6% and 23%, resp.). Interest in a potential cross-border collaboration of Memory Clinics in German-speaking countries is almost universal.
