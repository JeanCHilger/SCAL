Does cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction contribute to fatigue in Parkinson's disease? Patients with Parkinson's disease often complain of fatigue, and although cardiac sympathetic denervation is thought to be associated with fatigue, this link remains unclear. Previously, we detected cardiac sympathetic denervation in patients with Parkinson's disease using dobutamine, a selective beta-1 stimulant. To clarify the involvement of autonomic dysfunction in fatigue in Parkinson's disease, we conducted autonomic function tests on 33 patients with Parkinson's disease (mean age, 66.1 ± 5.6 years 20 men, 13 women) and evaluated their relationships to fatigue. We divided patients into 2 groups, fatigued (n = 12) and nonfatigued (n = 21), based on an average score ≥ 3.3 on the Parkinson fatigue scale. Autonomic function tests included the coefficient of variation of R-R intervals, head-up tilt test, norepinephrine and dobutamine infusion tests, and cardiac (123) I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. The coefficient of variation of R-R intervals and the systolic blood pressure changes accompanying the head-up tilt test did not show significant differences between the 2 groups
