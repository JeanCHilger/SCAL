Quantifying sclerotic bone metastases with 2D ultra short TE MRI: a feasibility study. Ultra Short TE MRI allows signal to be detected from tissues with a very short T2.The aims of this study were to optimize a 2D UTE MRI sequence for imaging and quantification of sclerotic bone metastases, establish T2* values of sclerotic components and investigate the feasibility of using the method to assess changes in T2* of sclerotic metastases and their relation to attenuation values in patients on treatment.Twenty-two subjects were recruited in 3 cohorts. Cohort 1 was used to optimize the 2-D UTE sequence, cohort 2 was used to establish T2* measurements using a range of TEs and cohort 3 was used to assess T2* changes with treatment response and relate them to changes on electron density as measured by CT Hounsfield Units.Sagittal 2D UTE MRI of the lumbar spine is feasible demonstrating short T2 components in normal volunteers. In patients with bone metastases secondary to prostate carcinoma T2* can be measured and mean T2* of sclerotic metastases measured with TEs of 0.07, 0.27, 0.47 and 0.67 ms was 8.5 ms.T2* shortened by 20.0% in responders and increased by 24.4% in progressors.The significant linear relationship between percentage change in T2* as derived from UTE MRI and percentage change in HU from corresponding CT studies is indirect evidence that they are measuring effects of the same process.If the relationship between T2* and electron density holds true in further studies it offers potential for MR guided radiotherapy planning as well as attenuation correction for PET/MRI.
