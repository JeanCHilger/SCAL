Methods for measuring the renal uptake rate of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA): a comparative study. A comparative study of the renal uptake rate of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was performed using a phantom study and clinical data from 100 patients (200 kidneys) with a variety of renal diseases. The measurement methods for renal uptake rate studied here include a posterior-view method, a conjugate-view method, and a method using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The renal uptake rates obtained by the posterior-view method significantly (P less than 0.001) depended on kidney depth correction. With the SPECT method, the cut-off level for delineating the kidney was changed according to the background count ratio using the results of the phantom study. The renal uptake rates obtained by the SPECT method correlated significantly (P less than 0.001) with those obtained by other methods, and there were no significant differences as compared with those obtained by the conjugate-view method. An analysis of error with the above methods indicated that the error relating to the sensitivity to body thickness was smallest for the SPECT method and greatest for the posterior-view method. In terms of measurement of renal uptake rate only, the conjugate-view method is considered the most useful because it needs no kidney depth correction and requires very little additional effort or examination time.
