Utility of 18FDG-PET/CT in breast cancer diagnostics--a systematic review. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18FDG-PET/CT) is a non-invasive method for visualization of focally increased metabolism in the presence of discrete morphological changes. Based on a systematic review of current literature, PET/CT cannot be recommended as a primary diagnostic procedure in breast cancer but it has the potential to be useful for the detection of distant metastases and for monitoring response to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. PET/CT should still be regarded as a supplement to conventional diagnostic procedures such as CT and MRI.
