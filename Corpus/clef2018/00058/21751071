The effect of pulsatile flow on intrathecal drug delivery in the spinal canal. Clinical studies have shown that drugs delivered intrathecally distribute much faster than can be accounted for by pure molecular diffusion. However, drug transport inside the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled spinal canal is poorly understood. In this study, comprehensive experimental and computational studies were conducted to quantify the effect of pulsatile CSF flow on the accelerated drug dispersion in the spinal canal. Infusion tests with a radionucleotide and fluorescent dye under stagnant and pulsatile flow conditions were conducted inside an experimental surrogate model of the human spinal canal. The tracer distributions were quantified optically and by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The experimental results show that CSF flow oscillations substantially enhance fluorescent dye and radionucleotide dispersion in the spinal canal experiment. The experimental observations were interpreted by rigorous computer simulations. To demonstrate the clinical significance, the dispersion of intrathecally infused baclofen, an anti-spasticity drug, was predicted by using patient-specific spinal data and CSF flow measurements. The computational predictions are expected to enable the rational design of intrathecal drug therapies.
