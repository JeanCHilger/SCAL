Cortical activations in sequential bilateral cochlear implant users. This study aimed to examine auditory and visual cortical activations in bilateral cochlear implant recipients using [(18)F]-FDG positron emission tomography. We aimed to compare the activations from use of the first implant alone, the second implant alone, and both implants together. When both implants were activated simultaneously, summation of cortical activity did not occur. The first and second implants demonstrated evidence of developing distinct neural networks. The first implants show stronger bilateral recruitment of the auditory areas than the second implants. Visual cortical activations occur in response to stimulation of the second but not the first implants. When both implants were activated together, there were no visual activations suggesting interaction between the first- and second-implant networks. These findings add to the existing knowledge of plasticity following cochlear implantation and demonstrate a variability of these processes that was previously unreported.
