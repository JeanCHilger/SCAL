L1-CAM-targeted antibody therapy and (177)Lu-radioimmunotherapy of disseminated ovarian cancer. The L1-cell adhesion molecule (L1-CAM) is highly expressed in various cancer types including ovarian carcinoma but is absent from most normal tissue. A chimeric monoclonal antibody, chCE7, specifically binds to human L1-CAM and exhibits anti-proliferative effects on L1-CAM-expressing tumor cells. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a novel (177)Lu-chCE7 radioimmunotherapeutic agent and to compare it to a treatment protocol with unlabeled, growth-inhibiting chCE7 in a mouse xenograft model of disseminated ovarian cancer. chCE7agl, an aglycosylated IgG1 variant with improved pharmacokinetics, was conjugated with 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N-N'-N'-N‴-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and labeled with the low-energy β-emitter (177)Lu. Tumor growth and survival were assessed after a single i.v. dose of 8 MBq (60 μg) radioimmunoconjugate in nude mice bearing either subcutaneous or intraperitoneal SKOV3.ip1 human ovarian cancer tumors. Therapeutic efficacy was compared with three times weekly i.p. administration of 10 mg/kg unconjugated chCE7. In vivo analysis of (177)Lu-chCE7agl biodistribution demonstrated high and specific accumulation of radioactivity at the tumor site with maximal tumor uptake of up to 48.0 ± 8.1% ID/g at 168 h postinjection. A single treatment with (177)Lu-DOTA-chCE7agl caused significant retardation of tumor growth and prolonged median survival from 33 to 71 days, while administration of a nontargeted (177)Lu-immunoconjugate had no beneficial effect. Three times weekly i.p. application of unlabeled chCE7 10 mg/kg similarly increased survival from 44 to 72 days. We conclude that a single dose of (177)Lu-DOTA-chCE7agl is as effective as repeated administration of nonradioactive chCE7 for treatment of small intraperitoneal tumors expressing L1-CAM.
