Neural basis of pleasant and unpleasant emotions induced by social reputation. We used positron emission tomography to identify brain regions involved in the processing of emotions induced by social reputation from others. During positron emission tomographic scanning, individuals were presented with either a positive or a negative social reputation combined with face photographs of persons whom the individuals either liked or disliked. Behavioral results revealed that a positive reputation led to a higher pleasantness score than a negative reputation. Imaging data demonstrated that the orbitofrontal cortex was activated with positive reputations relative to negative reputations, and that the amygdala was activated with negative reputations relative to positive reputations. These findings suggest that pleasant and unpleasant emotions induced by positive and negative social reputations from others are associated with activity in different brain regions.
