Synthesis and in vivo evaluation of [18F]N-(2-benzofuranylmethyl)-N'-[4-(2-fluoroethoxy)benzyl]piperazine, a novel σ1 receptor PET imaging agent. N-(2-Benzofuranylmethyl)-N'-[4-(2-fluoroethoxy)benzyl]piperazine (6, σ(1)K(i)=2.6 nM) was radiolabeled with fluorine-18 to provide a potential σ(1) receptor radioligand for use in positron emission tomography (PET). Radiofluorination of the appropriate tosylate precursor furnished [(18)F]6 with a specific activity of 45 GBq/μmol, in an average radiochemical yield of 18% and greater than 98% radiochemical purity. MicroPET imaging in Papio hamadryas baboon brain revealed [(18)F]6 uptake consistent with σ receptor distribution, and specificity for σ receptors was demonstrated in a haloperidol pre-treated animal. [(18)F]6 possesses suitable properties for PET imaging of σ(1) receptors, and further investigation of this σ(1) receptor tracer is warranted.
