Asymptomatic coronary heart disease in patients with type 2 diabetes with vascular complications: a cross-sectional study. Recent studies have suggested that microvascular and macrovascular diseases are associated with coronary events.To test the hypothesis that asymptomatic coronary heart disease (CHD) may be present in many patients with diabetes with vascular complications.From April 2009 to August 2010, the authors conducted a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic CHD among patients with type 2 diabetes with vascular complications at a national diabetes centre in Japan. Eligibility criteria included patients with type 2 diabetes with no known CHD and one or more of the following four criteria: (1) proliferative diabetic retinopathy or after photocoagulation (2) estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min/1.73 m² or an estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 ml/min/1.73 m² plus albuminuriaA total of 1008 patients with type 2 diabetes were screened, and 122 eligible patients consented to participate. Stress single-photon emission computed tomography revealed myocardial perfusion abnormalities in 96 (79%) patients. Of the 112 patients who completed the study protocol, 59 (53%) had asymptomatic CHD with ≥50% diameter stenosis. Additionally, 35 (31%) patients had multivessel disease or left main disease, and 42 (38%) had a coronary artery with ≥75% diameter stenosis. In the multivariate logistic-regression analysis to identify coronary risk factors associated with asymptomatic CHD, the only significant predictor was male sex (OR 6.18 95% CI 2.30 to 16.64Asymptomatic CHD with ≥50% diameter stenosis and myocardial perfusion abnormalities was detected in more than half of the patients with type 2 diabetes with vascular complications.
