Usefulness of thallium-201 SPECT for prediction of early progression in low-grade astrocytomas diagnosed by stereotactic biopsy. To establish the value of thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography ((201)Tl-SPECT) as a predictor of early progression in low-grade astrocytomas (LGAs).We studied 57 consecutive patients who underwent 201 Tl-SPECT before stereotactic biopsy (n=33) or surgical resection (n=24). The value of radiologic and histopathological variables ((201)Tl index and MIB-1 index) in predicting progression free survival (PFS) was examined in each group of patients.During a median follow up of 55 months (range, 11-101), progression of the primary lesion was identified in 46 patients (80.7%). Based on Cox's proportional hazards model, the increased thallium uptake was associated with a short PFS in both biopsy and resection groups, whereas the MIB-1 index was significant only in the resection group. Considering the cut-off value, (201)Tl index>1.7 was statistically significant for reduced PFS in the biopsy group however, MIB-1 index was not directly related to the PFS at any level. For the surgical resection group, both a (201)Tl index>1.9 and a MIB-1 index>6% were associated with short PFS.(201)Tl SPECT may play a role in prediction of early tumor progression not only in resected LGAs, but also in biopsy-proven LGAs. Therefore, we suggest that patients with LGAs established from biopsy should be considered as high-risk groups for early progression if the tumor shows a high (201)Tl uptake, even if the tumor demonstrates low proliferative activity on histopathologic examination.
