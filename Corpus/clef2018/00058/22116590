Acipimox-enhanced ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for characterizing and predicting early remodeling in the rat infarct model. The rat myocardial infarction (MI) model is widely used to study left ventricular (LV) remodeling. In this study, acipimox-enhanced (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) gated-positron emission tomography (PET) was assessed for characterizing and predicting early remodeling in the rat infarct model. Nineteen Wistar rats had surgical occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and 7 were sham-operated. PET was scheduled 48 h and 2 weeks later for quantifying MI area and LV function. Segments with <50% of FDG uptake had histological evidence of MI (74 ± 9% decrease in parietal thickness, fibrosis development). At 48 h, MI area was large (>35% of LV) in 6 rats, moderate (15-35% of LV) in 8 rats, limited (<15% of LV) in 5 rats and absent in the 7 sham rats. LV remodeling, assessed through the 2 weeks increase in end-diastolic volume, increased between rats with limited, moderate and large MI (+72 ± 25, +109 ± 56, +190 ± 69 μl, respectively, P = 0.007). This 3-groups classification allowed predicting 44% of the 2 weeks increase in end-diastolic volume, and additional 34% were predicted by heart rate at 48 h. The acipimox-enhanced FDG gated-PET technique provides efficient characterization and prediction of early remodeling in the rat infarct model.
