Quantitative EEG and LORETA: valuable tools in discerning FTD from AD? Drawing a clinical distinction between frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is tricky, particularly at the early stages of disease. This study evaluates the possibility in differentiating 39 FTD, 39 AD, and 39 controls (CTR) by means of power spectral analysis and standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) within delta, theta, alpha 1 and 2, beta 1, 2, and 3 frequency bands. Both analyses revealed in AD patients, relative to CTR, higher expression of diffuse delta/theta and lower central/posterior fast frequency (from alpha1 to beta2) bands. FTD patients showed diffuse increased theta power compared with CTR and lower delta relative to AD patients. Compared with FTD, AD patients showed diffuse higher theta power at spectral analysis and, at sLORETA, decreased alpha2 and beta1 values in central/temporal regions. Spectral analysis and sLORETA provided complementary information that might help characterizing different patterns of electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillatory activity in AD and FTD. Nevertheless, this differentiation was possible only at the group level because single patients could not be discerned with sufficient accuracy.
