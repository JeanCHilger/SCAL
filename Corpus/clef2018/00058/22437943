Toward a mechanistic understanding of how variability in neurobiology shapes individual differences in behavior. Research has begun to identify how variability in brain function contributes to individual differences in complex behavioral traits. Examining variability in molecular signaling pathways with emerging and established methodologies such as pharmacologic fMRI, multimodal PET/fMRI, and hormonal assays are beginning to provide a mechanistic understanding of how individual differences in brain function arise. Against this background, functional genetic polymorphisms are being utilized to understand the origins of variability in signaling pathways as well as to efficiently model how such emergent variability impacts behaviorally relevant brain function and health outcomes. This chapter provides an overview of a research strategy that integrates these complimentary levels of analysis existing empirical data is used to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach in illuminating the mechanistic neurobiology of individual differences in complex behavioral traits. This chapter also discusses how such efforts can contribute to the identification of predictive risk markers that interact with unique environmental factors to precipitate psychopathology.
