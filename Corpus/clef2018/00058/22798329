Cortical changes after mental imagery training combined with electromyography-triggered electrical stimulation in patients with chronic stroke. Paresis of the upper extremity after stroke is not effectively solved by existing therapies. We investigated whether mental imagery training combined with electromyogram-triggered electric stimulation improved motor function of the paretic upper extremity in patients with chronic stroke and induced cortical changes.Fourteen subjects with chronic stroke (â‰¥12 months) were randomly allocated to receive mental imagery training combined with electromyogram-triggered electric stimulation (n=7) or generalized functional electric stimulation (n=7) on the forearm extensor muscles of the paretic extremity in 2 20-minute daily sessions 5 days a week for 4 weeks. The upper extremity component of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment, the Motor Activity Log, the modified Barthel Index, and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose brain positron emission tomography were measured before and after the intervention.The group receiving mental imagery training combined with electromyogram-triggered electric stimulation exhibited significant improvements in the upper extremity component of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment after intervention (median, 7 interquartile range, 5-8Mental imagery training combined with electromyogram-triggered electric stimulation improved motor function of the paretic extremity in patients with chronic stroke. The intervention increased metabolism in the contralesional motor-sensory cortex.  Clinical Trial Registration- URL: https://e-irb.khmccri.or.kr/eirb/receipt/index.html?code=02&status=5.
