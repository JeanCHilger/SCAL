Study on blood level of human placental lactogen in abnormal pregnancy. The hormone human placental lactogen (HPL) was measured in 15 expectant mothers with pre-eclamptic toxaemia, 5 with postdated pregnancy and 2 mothers with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). These levels were compared with that of 43 expectant mothers without any complications. In preeclamptic toxaemia (PET), HPL showed higher or normal values but in severe cases of PET and in those with proteinuria, hormone level was depressed as compared to normal pregnancy. Also in younger mothers (22 years or less) with the complication, the hormone level was low, though no relation with parity was observed. In case of IUGR, the hormone level was within the normal range although one pregnancy ended in intra-uterine foetal death. Low level of the hormone was found in pregnancies ending in low birth weight babies and in postdated pregnancies with foetal postmaturity syndrome.
