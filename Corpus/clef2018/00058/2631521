Cerebral blood flow and cerebral hematocrit in patients with cerebral ischemia measured by single-photon emission computed tomography. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was used for the measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral hematocrit (Hct). CBF was measured using N-isopropyl-p-I-123-Iodoamphetamine. CBV was measured by both RBC tracer (Tc-99m RBC) and plasma tracer (Tc-99m human serum albumin) and cerebral hematocrit (Hct) was calculated. In normals, the cerebral-to-large vessel Hct ratio was 75.9%. Isovolemic hemodilution in patients with high Hct tended to increase the cerebral-to-large vessel Hct ratio. Low CBF, high CBV and slow cerebral blood mean transit time (MTT by dynamic CT scanning) was seen during the acute stage of completed infarction and during the symptom-free interval of TIA. Cerebral Hct was increased in the ischemic region of poor prognosis.
