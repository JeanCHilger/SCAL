Clinical evaluation of I-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging in suspected neuroblastoma. Twenty neuroblastoma and 4 nonneuroblastoma patients were studied by 131I-MIBG imaging. The primary tumor was detected in 89% of patients (8/9) before therapy. Bone marrow metastasis was also visualized in 4 of the 8 patients with primary positive scan. True negative results were obtained in 4 nonneuroblastoma patients. After therapy, of 10 tumor-bearing patients, eight showed positive scans and 9 of 12 lesions (75%) were visualized. The accuracies of presence or absence of neuroblastoma were compared between 131I-MIBG imaging and several tumor markers. The accuracies before and after therapy were as follows: 131I-MIBG imaging 92% (12/13), 88% (15/17), serum NSE
