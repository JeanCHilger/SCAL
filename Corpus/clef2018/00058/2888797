MR imaging of the adrenal gland in Sipple disease. We assessed imaging techniques [nuclear, CT, and magnetic resonance (MR)] in the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas in 10 patients with Sipple disease. Nine patients underwent surgery. Magnetic resonance detected all adrenal and ectopic lesions. Metaiodobenzylguanidine scans had two false-negative results. Computed tomography missed an ectopic lesion that was associated with bilateral medullar hypertrophy and had a false-positive result (a cortical nonhyperfunctioning adenoma). In our opinion MR may replace both CT and nuclear scans in the work up of Sipple disease.
