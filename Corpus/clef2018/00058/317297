Single-photon transaxial emission computed tomography of the heart in normal subjects and in patients with infarction. Resting computerized transaxial tomography was performed after the i.v. injection of thallium-201 in six normal subjects and in five patients who had had myocardial infarctions 3 mo to 4 yr before scintigraphy. Decreased myocardial activity corresponded to the site of previous infarction in all cases and was clearly separated from adjacent myocardium with normal activity. With tomography, the left ventricle was clearly separated from surrounding structures such as the left-ventricular cavity, the lungs, and the liver. This study demonstrates the feasibility for the assessment of myocardial perfusion using single-photon transaxial emmission computed tomography.
