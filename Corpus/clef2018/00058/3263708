Influx of a choline analog to dog brain measured by positron emission tomography. The influx of the 11C-labeled choline analog pyrrolidinocholine into tissue was measured in the brain of three dogs by positron emission tomography (PET). During the first 90 s after the intravenous bolus injection of the tracer, transfer of tracer from plasma to tissue was unidirectional. The influx constant for pyrrolidinocholine into intracranial tissue, Kin, was 0.017 ml/g/min (0.008 SD), and the initial volume of distribution, V0, was 0.08 ml/g (0.03 SD). The influx constant was at least five times larger than the value expected if simple diffusion were to account for tissue uptake. The method presented in this paper can be used to investigate the availability of plasma choline and its analogs to the living human brain and other tissue in degenerative diseases affecting the cholinergic system, and to provide in vivo information on a choline transport system.
