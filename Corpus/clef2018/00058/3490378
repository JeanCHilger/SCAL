Time course of metabolic findings in coronary occlusion and reperfusion and their role for assessing myocardial salvage. The techniques currently used to assess myocardial infarction are limited in their ability to determine the amount of viable myocardium after a temporary ischemic event. Blood flow and segmental function may not necessarily demonstrate salvage, whereas metabolic parameters will determine cell survival. In an open chest dog model, short occlusion times of 20 min and subsequent reperfusion using C-11 palmitate as an index of fatty acid metabolism showed depression of fatty acid oxidation, which recovered after 3 hours of reperfusion, indicating the partial reversibility of the ischemic condition. In more extensive studies, using positron emission tomography (PET) and, as an indicator of glucose metabolism, fluoro-F-18-deoxyglucose (FDG) N-13 ammonia in addition to C-11 palmitate for the determination of blood flow
