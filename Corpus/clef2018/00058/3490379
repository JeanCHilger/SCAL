Myocardial blood flow and glucose uptake after myocardial infarction. Position emission tomography can picture the distribution of flow tracers as well as of metabolic substrates or analogs. Studies of the distribution of these tracers allow to infer information about regional myocardial clearance (flow X extraction) and substrate utilization. In a study of 32 patients after myocardial infarction, we have contrasted flow and substrate utilization to demonstrate ischemic but viable myocardium in the arterial territory of the infarct in a number of patients also specially after fibrinolytic reperfusion. Restoration of blood flow to the ischemic but viable myocardium through coronary bypass or dilatation improves flow from 56.3% to 84.2% of control and restores substrate utilization. In another group of 32 patients studied with the Strontium-82/Rubidium-82 generator, we have demonstrated perfusion changes both in the myocardial infarct area and at a distance. These changes predominate in patients with multiple vessel disease. Combined PET studies of flow and substrate utilization are new tools to study early intervention after myocardial infarction and to document the benefits of revascularization.
