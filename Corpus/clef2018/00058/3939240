Detection of thrombi by 111In-oxine platelet scintigraphy. For 52 patients with cardiac disease and 11 patients with vascular disease, In-111-oxine platelet scintigraphy was performed to assess its clinical usefulness for detecting thrombi. Using Hayashida's method, platelets were separated in 43 ml peripheral blood, washed and labeled with 1 mCi In-111-oxine. In addition to planar images in the anterior, 45 degrees left anterior oblique and left lateral views, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed in some cases by rotating a dual gamma camera 24 and 72 hours after labeled platelet injection. The functions of platelet and coagulability were examined 36 hours after the injection of labeled platelets. Medical therapy was not changed during this study. Intracardiac thrombi were documented in 16 of 52 cases with cardiac disease and intravascular thrombi in 10 cases with vascular disease by angiography, CT and two-dimensional echocardiography. Positive images were obtained in 10 cases with cardiac disease and in eight cases with vascular disease by scintigraphy. Therefore, sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy were 63%, 100% and 88% in intracardiac thrombi 80%, 100% and 82% in intravascular thrombi
