Relative determination of hemisphere perfusion and hemisphere circulation. A comparison of the results of computer-assisted radionuclide angiography and dynamic single photon emission CT in patients with unilateral cerebrovascular disease. Ratios of interhemispherical perfusion and blood flow were derived from 72 patients with reversible (TIA, PRIND) or irreversible (completed stroke) ischemic neurologic deficits. Differences from normal mean values (right-to-left: 1.00) were determined by employing CARNA with 99mTc-DTPA (perfusion) or DSPECT with 133Xe-gas (blood flow in ml/100 g/min). These differences were constantly higher for CARNA than for DSPECT. Such an excess for CARNA values was interpreted as the delay portion within the CARNA results, which increased from completed stroke (33% delay) to TIA (62% delay). The complement, i.e. the low flow portion, decreased in this sequence. Separation of CARNA values into delay and flow portions provides further information on the individual severity of cerebrovascular disease by employing a simple nuclear procedure. Moreover, it complements morphological findings from radiographic angiography and transmission CT.
