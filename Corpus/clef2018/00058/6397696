Positron emission tomography in the study of cerebral tumours. Positron emission tomography (PET) uses the shortlived positron-emitting radioisotopes of elements such as oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon as tracers both to image and to measure, non-invasively, normal regional tissue physiology and pathophysiology in man. This technique has been used to study the pathophysiology of brain tumours at the time they present and after therapeutic intervention.
