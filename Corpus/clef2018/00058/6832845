The development and validation of radioallergosorbent tests for the detection of specific human IgE antibody directed against laboratory animal urinary proteins. Radioallergosorbent tests (RAST) using urinary proteins from mice, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits have been developed and used in the diagnosis of laboratory animal allergy (LAA). Of the 273 subjects tested, 15 had been previously diagnosed as laboratory animal allergic and 8 of these (53%) gave one or more positive RAST results. Of the 258 symptom-free individuals, only 9 (3.5%) had one or more positive RAST. Of these 9, 7 had previously worked with animals or had occupational exposure to the appropriate species the remaining 2 individuals had only some pet exposure. RAST was, therefore, of value in the diagnosis of LAA. During the development of these RAST assays, several sources of potential error were identified. Modest titres of total IgE (600 IU/ml and above) were found to influence the specific RAST index observed and lead to false positive results. The presence of human IgG antibody specific for rabbit serum proteins was also identified in four sera, and was responsible for interference in the rabbit urinary protein RAST system.
