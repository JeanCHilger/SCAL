Mechanistic positron emission tomography studies of 6-[18F]fluorodopamine in living baboon heart: selective imaging and control of radiotracer metabolism using the deuterium isotope effect. Mechanistic positron emission tomography (PET) studies using the deuterium isotope effect and specific pharmacological intervention were undertaken to examine the behavior of 6-[18F]fluorodopamine (6-[18F]-FDA 1) and (-)-6-[18F]fluoronorepinephrine [(-)-6-[18F]FNE
