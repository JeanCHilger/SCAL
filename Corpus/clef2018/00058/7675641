18FDG whole-body PET in differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Flipflop in uptake patterns of 18FDG and 131I. In 27 examinations of 24 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma an alternating pattern of metastases with either 131I- or FDG-uptake was found. In the follow-up of these patients this flip-flop pattern was seen in 89% (17/19) of patients with metastases and uptake of 131I or FDG as described here as uptake types 1 and 2 (type 1: FDG-positive and 131I-negative type 2: FDG-negative and 131I-positive). In 4 patients a mixed type was observed (uptake type 3), i.e. a combination of metastases with uptake types 1 and 2 in the same patient. Metastases of papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma without uptake of iodine have all been found to be FDG-positive in patients with an increase of thyroglobulin and with negative diagnostic results from other imaging modalities, and were histologically confirmed by surgery. False-negative or false-positive cases were not observed in this study. The FDG uptake showed an inverse proportionality to iodine uptake and to tumor differentiation. Increased glucose metabolism is a sign of higher malignancy.
