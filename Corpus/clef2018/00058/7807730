A longitudinal study of CMRGlu in dementia of Alzheimer type. We studied the serial changes of CMRGlu in 6 patients with dementia of Alzheimer type. All patients demonstrated moderately severe dementia at the initial PET scan. Serial PET scans were performed at an interval of 12 to 24 months. Five of the 6 patients showed a deterioration of clinical symptoms at the second scan. The global CMRGlu serially decreased in all patients. An asymmetry of CMRGlu in both the frontal and parietal regions was observed at the initial PET scan, while the direction of asymmetry was preserved at the second PET scan. The ratios (frontal/parietal and parietal/striatum) of CMRGlu showed no interval change. Therefore, CMRGlu was considered to decrease progressively throughout the entire brain in patients with moderately severe dementia of Alzheimer type.
