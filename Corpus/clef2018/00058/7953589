Cortical control of saccades and fixation in man. A PET study. To identify cortical regions activated during saccades and visual fixation, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in eight healthy subjects using C15O2 PET during the performance of three tasks: (i) central fixation (ii) reflexive saccades to random targets
