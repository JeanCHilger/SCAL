Imaging studies in partial epilepsy in children and adolescents. We reviewed the results of imaging studies on 111 children and adolescents with partial epilepsy to determine which imaging procedure had the greatest sensitivity and specificity for partial epilepsy in this age range. All cases were classified as idiopathic, lesional, and cryptogenic epilepsy based on the 1989 International League Against Epilepsy Classification. All patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 98 also had computed tomography (CT). Thirty patients with negative CT had MRI lesions that were most likely the cause of the epilepsy, and the initial diagnosis of cryptogenic partial epilepsy was changed to lesional partial epilepsy. We concluded that CT use is unwarrantedly common. MRI should be considered the procedure of first choice. CT has a complementary role, and functional neuroimaging should be encouraged.
