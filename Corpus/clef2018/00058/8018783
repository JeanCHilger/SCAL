Striatal dopamine receptor binding in epileptic psychoses. In order to study the nature of dopaminergic activity in epileptic psychoses we investigated striatal dopamine receptor binding in 14 patients with epilepsy. Seven of the patients were acutely psychotic when studied, having recently developed a periictal schizophreniform psychosis. The remaining patients were not psychotic. All patients were scanned using single photon emission tomography (SPET) with 123I-IBZM, a specific dopamine D2 receptor ligand. A region of interest analysis was performed. Comparison of mean basal ganglia to occipital cortex activity ratios in the two groups demonstrated significantly reduced specific binding of 123I-IBZM to striatal D2 receptors in the psychotic patients compared to those without psychosis.
