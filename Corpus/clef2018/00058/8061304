Multi-focal metabolic disturbances in human brain after cerebral infarction studied with 18FDG and positron emission tomography. We measured cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (CMRGlc) in the remote brain areas of 7 patients, who were affected by unilateral cortical infarction, at a chronic stage using 2[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and positron emission tomography. There were significant decreases of CMRGlc compared with each control value (p < 0.01), not only in the cerebral cortex directly damaged by the ischaemic insult, but also in the ipsilateral thalamus and in the contralateral cerebellum, areas in which no lesions had been detected by MRI or CT scan. The present study indicates that different mechanisms may be responsible for multi-focal metabolic disturbances in the remote areas after stroke. We suggest that these multi-focal brain dysfunctions may exacerbate clinical symptoms at a chronic stage of stroke.
