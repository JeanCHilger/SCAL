Synthesis and in vivo evaluation of [11C]semotiadil, a benzothiazine calcium antagonist. A carbon-11 labeled benzothiazine calcium antagonist, (+)-(R)-2-[5-methoxy-2-[3-[methyl[2-[(3,4- methylenedioxy)phenoxy]ethyl]amino]propoxy]phenyl]-4-methyl-2H-1,4- benzothiazin-3(4H)-one (semotiadil), and its enantiomer were prepared by N-methylation of the corresponding norderivatives with 11CH3I: decay-corrected radiochemical yields of 16-27% based on 11CH3I, radiochemical, chemical and optical purity of > 99%, sp. act. of 11-50 GBq/mumol and preparation time of 35-40 min. In mice, saturable and stereo-selective uptake in the hippocampus, striatum and hypothalamus was observed. The potential of the compound to visualize the regional brain calcium channels in vivo by positron emission tomography was indicated however, no promising sign was found in the myocardium.
