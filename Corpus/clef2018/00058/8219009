Localization and lateralization of stereoscopic processing in the human brain. Positron emission tomography was used to investigate the neural substrate of stereopsis. Changes in cerebral blood flow were measured in nine volunteers while they judged the orientation of a rectangular cyclopean shape in random dot stereograms. This experimental condition was compared with two control conditions, one having a two-dimensional shape but no cyclopean stimulus, the other having neither shape nor cyclopean stimulus. Blood flow increases were observed in areas 17 and 18 in the right hemisphere when comparing experimental with control conditions blood flow decreases occurred in the right inferotemporal cortex. Results indicate that stereopsis begins in posterior visual areas in the right cerebral hemisphere. Under ambiguous stereoscopic conditions, participation of more anterior areas in the temporal lobe may be elicited.
