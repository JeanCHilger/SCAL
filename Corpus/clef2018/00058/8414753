MIBG detection of hepatic neuroblastoma: correlation with CT, US and surgical findings. Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging is used in the diagnosis, staging and follow-up of virtually every case of neuroblastoma seen at our institution. Normal sites of MIBG uptake include the liver and therefore difficulties have been predicted and encountered in the diagnosis of hepatic neuroblastoma due to inability to separate abnormally increased tracer deposition from normal hepatic activity. We reviewed every MIBG (I123 and I131) study performed at our pediatric hospital over a 4 year period encompassing 88 patients, 67 of whom had biopsy proven neuroblastoma. Hepatic findings onMIBG studies were compared with concurrent abdominal CT and US studies in all 67 patients. The clinical records of all patients with abnormal MIBG scans or abnormal CT or US studies of the liver were also reviewed. Eight patients were found to have abnormal liver findings on one or more imaging studies (MIBG, CT, or US). There were 3 true positive MIBG studies, one of which was an early study in a patient who later went on to have one of the false positive studies. Two patients had false positive MIBG scans for liver neuroblastoma. MIBG failed to detect liver involvement in 4 patients.
