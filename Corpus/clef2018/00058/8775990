The role of "occult" gastroesophageal reflux in chronic pulmonary disease in children. It has repeatedly been demonstrated that a correlation exists between gastroesophageal reflux and the presence of various "atypical" complaints, such as recurrent chest pain, apneic attacks in infants, and recurrent or chronic respiratory symptoms. Very recently it has been shown that gastroesophageal reflux is frequently associated with non-controlled asthma in children and that medical treatment for reflux can improve the further course of respiratory disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible cause-relationship between recurrent respiratory symptoms in children and the presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and to investigate the value of continuous 24-hour esophageal pH-monitoring in the diagnosis and management of these complaints in 62 children with chronic respiratory disease. Continuous 24-hour pH-monitoring was abnormal in 39/62 patients (62.9%). However, no statistically significant correlation could be detected between the presence of gastroesophageal reflux and various anamnestic parameters (parental smoking, pet in household, sibling with gastroesophageal reflux disease), or concomitant atopy. All children that were found positive for gastroesophageal reflux (n = 39) were started on an antireflux therapy (cisapride 0.2 mg/kg q.i.d.). This treatment resulted in an improvement of the symptoms in 84.6%. We conclude that gastroesophageal reflux is an important (causative) factor in chronic recurrent respiratory disease. This entity is often resistant to "classical" respiratory treatment, but can be treated with an anti-reflux therapy. We, therefore, suggest to perform continuous 24-hour esophageal pH-monitorings as a standard procedure in all patients with recurrent respiratory complaints, independent of the severity of their symptoms.
