Chronological study of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites in the rat brain stab wounds using [3H] PK-11195 as a marker for gliosis. Chronological studies of the development of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor sites were undertaken with the goal of evaluating the sensitivity of this marker for the study of the gliosis development in the injured brain. No significant increase in [3H] PK-11195 binding occurred in the rat brain stab wound one day following the puncture. A significant increase in the receptor density (Bmax) from the second day onward was observed. The Bmax reached its highest levels in the grey matter on the sixth day after a 23-gauge needle wound (8.75 +/- 0.09 pmol mg-tissue-1) and on the seventh day after an 18-gauge needle wound (8.98 +/- 0.31 pmol mg-tissue-1). In the white matter, the Bmax was greatest seven days after the wound (3.42 +/- 0.07
