Coronary vasodilatory capacity is impaired in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Increases in wall stress because of left ventricular enlargement and/or alterations in coronary vasomotor tone might affect myocardial blood flow and vasodilatory capacity in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. To test this hypothesis myocardial blood flow was measured at rest and during intravenous administration of dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg) using dynamic nitrogen 13-ammonia positron emission tomography (two-compartment model) in 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (mean left ventricular ejection fraction 28 +/- 8% 1 woman, 9 men 47 +/- 13 years of age). Ten age and gender matched healthy volunteers served as controls. Coronary artery disease was ruled out by coronary angiography and left ventricular hypertrophy by two dimensional-echocardiography. Baseline heart rate (70 +/- 13 v 64 +/- 12 bpm), systolic blood pressure (111 +/- 20 v 114 +/- 12 mm Hg) and rate pressure product (7,686 +/- 1264 v 7,306 +/- 1,645) were similar in patients and controls. During dipyridamole administration, the rate pressure product increased similarly in both groups. Myocardial blood flow at rest did not differ between groups of patients and volunteers (0.69 +/ -0.27 v 0.67 +/- 0.17 mL/g/min) but correlated with the rate pressure product only in controls (myocardial blood flow, 0.18 + 0.000068214
