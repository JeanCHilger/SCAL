Improvement of radiation treatment planning in squamous-cell head and neck cancer by immuno-SPECT. Previous studies have shown high accuracy for immunoscintigraphy with 99mTc-MAb-174 in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck region compared to CT and MRI. We conducted a prospective study to determine if immunoscintigraphy provides additional diagnostic information for radiation treatment planning.Radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) was performed on 40 patients (planar, whole-body, SPECT) with histologically confirmed squamous-cell carcinoma (30 primary tumors, 10 recurrences) after injection of the 99mTc (1.1 GBq) labeled monoclonal anti-squamous-cell cancer antibody 174H0.64 (murine IgG1). Results were combined with information obtained by clinical examination, sonography, panendoscopy and x-ray CT. The strategy for radiation treatment and the required treatment volumes were defined with and without immunoscintigraphical findings.Additional diagnostically relevant information from RIS was obtained from 10 patients (25%) with advanced tumors or recurrences. In three patients (7.5%), the treatment volume had to be extended. The therapeutic strategy for seven patients (17.5%) had to be changed due to the detection of metastatic disease beyond the head and neck region. RIS of patients with squamous-cell cancers of the head and neck region with 99mTcMAb-174H0.64 enabled the detection of tumors that were not depicted by other conventional diagnostic imaging procedures.The use of RIS in radiation treatment planning of advanced tumors of the head and neck region appears to yield important diagnostic information that may alter patient management.
