Ictal cerebral blood flow in seizures originating in the posterolateral cortex. In selecting patients for epilepsy surgery, it is important to distinguish mesial temporal seizures from seizures originating in the posterolateral cortex. We studied ictal cerebral perfusion in five patients with complex partial seizures with clear posterior EEG ictal onsets and clinical seizures semiology suggesting seizure origin in the posterolateral cortex.Ictal SPECT was performed during video EEG monitoring using 99mTc-HMPAO as a cerebral perfusion tracer and a rotating gamma camera to acquire images.Three patterns of ictal hyperperfusion were seen: pattern A = temporoparieto-occipital junction extending into the lateral temporal cortex, involving the mesial temporal cortex and basal ganglia to a lesser degree and a small area of hyperperfusion in the contralateral parietal cortex (two patients) pattern B = pattern A but with no hyperperfusion of the mesial temporal cortex (one patient)Our results suggest distinct patterns of ictal perfusion in seizures with posterolateral ictal EEG onsets. Ictal SPECT may be useful in distinguishing such seizures.
