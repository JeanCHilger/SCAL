A serological indication of the existence of a guineapig poliovirus. Attempts were made to clarify whether laboratory guineapigs may harbour a poliovirus which, in 1911, was described as the cause of a disease called guineapig lameness. By the use of ELISA for antibodies against the poliovirus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), it was shown that two pet shop guineapigs suffering from lameness had extremely high titres against poliovirus, while healthy guineapigs from the same pet shop were negative. Clearly positive results were also found in 35 out of 152 laboratory guineapig sera. Positive results were found in only two out of six breeding centres, but in three out of three experimental units, all of which purchased guineapigs from one of the seropositive breeding colonies. The diseased guineapigs recovered fully after treatment with vitamins in the drinking water, a treatment used for guineapig lameness by small animal practitioners. A theory that vitamin C deficient guineapigs are, due to an impaired steroid secretion, predisposed to succumbing to infection and develop demyelinating disease similar to that in TMEV infected mice is discussed briefly. Guineapig sera were also tested serologically for other infections. Antibodies against lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Clostridium piliforme and Toxoplasma gondii were not found, but one breeding colony was infected with adenovirus, pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus type 3, Sendai virus, parainfluenza (simian) virus type 5 and Encephalitozoon cuniculi. Two other breeding colonies were infected with both reovirus type 3 and E. cuniculi. In all three experimental units infection with adenovirus was observed, and in two of these Sendai virus and E. cuniculi antibodies were also found. The pet shop guineapigs were infected with adenovirus, reovirus type 3 and E. cuniculi.
