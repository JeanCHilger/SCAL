Regional cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism during migraine with and without aura. Eleven cases of migraine with and without aura were investigated with positron emission tomography (PET). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), oxygen metabolism (rCMRO2) and oxygen extraction (rOER) were measured during baseline (n = 11), aura (n = 6), headache (n = 10) and after treatment with sumatriptan (n = 4). Data were analysed using an ROI-based approach from 26 different anatomically defined regions, and also an exploratory approach whereby all subjects were normalized to a stereotactic brain atlas t-maps were constructed by depicting significant changes between states. The exploratory approach revealed a region corresponding to the primary visual cortex with significant reductions in rCBF (23.1%) and rCMRO2 (22.5%), but no change in rOER during the headache phase compared to baseline. These data suggest that cerebral ischemia was not the primary cause of the attacks in these cases.
