Bilateral activation of fronto-parietal networks by incrementing demand in a working memory task. Working memory (WM) is known to activate the prefrontal cortex. In the present study we hypothesized that when additional contingencies are added to the instruction of a WM task, this would increase the WM load and result in the activation of additional prefrontal areas. With positron emission tomography we measured regional cerebral blood flow in nine subjects performing a control task and two delayed matching to sample tasks, in which the subjects were matching colours and patterns to a reference picture. The second of the two delayed matching tasks had a more complex instruction than the first, with additional contingencies of how to alternate between the matching of colours and patterns. This task thus required the subjects not only to remember a stimulus to match but also to perform this matching according to a specified plan. Both delayed matching tasks activated cortical fields in the middle frontal gyrus, the frontal operculum, upper cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal cortex and cortex lining the intraparietal sulcus, all in the left hemisphere. When alternated delayed matching was compared to simple delayed matching, increases were located in the right superior and middle frontal gyrus and the right anterior inferior parietal cortex. The increased demand during alternated matching thus resulted in bilateral activation of both dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortex. The area in the inferior parietal cortex has previously been coactivated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in several WM tasks, irrespective of the sensory modality of the stimuli, and during tasks involving planning.
