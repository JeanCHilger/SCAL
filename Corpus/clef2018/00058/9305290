Regional correlations between the EEG and oxygen metabolism in dementia of Alzheimer's type. To determine the relationship between EEG slowing and cerebral hypometabolism in dementia, 10 patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) were evaluated with quantitative topographic EEG and positron emission tomography (PET). Power in each 1-Hz frequency band from 2-20 Hz, power ratio index, and normalised PET data from corresponding cortical sites were compared to data obtained from 20 normal volunteers. PET revealed significant parieto-temporal hypometabolism, and topographic EEG mapping and power spectrum analysis revealed a slowing of the background EEG that was most pronounced in the parietal-temporal areas. Correlation analysis between EEG power spectrum data and CMRO2 revealed significant negative correlations for frequencies below 8 Hz and significant positive correlations above 8 Hz in the parieto-temporal regions, which have previously been identified as the areas most severely affected by pathological changes associated with DAT. Correlation coefficients plotted as functions of frequency illustrated the relationships between EEG changes and reduced CMRO2, supporting previous views that EEG slowing in DAT may be related to hypometabolism in cortical regions most affected by the disease.
