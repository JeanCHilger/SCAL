Effects of ergotamine on myocardial blood flow in migraineurs without evidence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. The effects of intravenous ergotamine (0.25 mg) on basal and hyperemic (dipyridamole) myocardial blood flow (MBF), measured with positron emission tomography and H2(15)O, were assessed in 15 migraineurs in a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, crossover study. Ergotamine produced a 27% reduction in hyperemic MBF (2.62 +/- 0.11 vs 3.72 +/- 1.05 ml x min(-1) x g(-1) p <0.05), a 31% reduction in the coronary vasodilator reserve (1.81 +/- 0.50 vs 2.71 +/- 1.15
