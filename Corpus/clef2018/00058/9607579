Quantitative [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in pretreatment and grading of sarcoma. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between sarcoma tumor grade and the quantitative tumor metabolism value for [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) determined by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Seventy patients with bone or soft-tissue sarcomas underwent PET scanning with quantitative determination of tumor FDG metabolic rate (MRFDG) before treatment. MRFDG (micromol/g/min) for each tumor was compared with National Cancer Institute tumor grade, S-phase percentage, and percentage of aneuploidy of the tumor population. The pretreatment quantitative determination of tumor MRFDG by PET correlates strongly with tumor grade but not with the other selected histopathological tumor correlates. In addition, overlap of MRFDG PET values with tumor grade suggests that PET, an objective tumor measurement, may provide an alternative means of assessing tumor biological potential or may have the potential to overcome some of the limitations of traditional pathological evaluation. FDG PET can uniquely provide a metabolic profile of a diverse group of sarcomas noninvasively and provide clinically relevant tumor biological information.
