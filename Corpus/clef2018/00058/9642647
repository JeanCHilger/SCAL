Carbohydrates as a cerebral metabolic fuel. The human brain is an extremely active metabolic organ with little endogenous stores of energy. It is thus dependent on circulating glucose to fuel metabolism and support cognitive functioning. However there is growing evidence that the human brain is able to utilise other non-glucose fuels during times of glucose lack. We review the evidence for the potential of the human brain to use the alternate fuels lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, and some recent studies examining the ability of regions of brain to use non-glucose lipid fuels. The human brain does not seem to have the ability to use the gluconeogenic precursor alanine to any significant degree. Regionality within the brain can be examined in vivo by the use of positron emission tomography, which offers the exciting prospect of studying human brain metabolism in vivo using a simple and non-interventional technique. Increased understanding of the brain's metabolism, the way in which hypoglycaemia is recognised and the manner in which this can be altered in the syndrome of hypoglycaemia unawareness and deficient counterregulation will help develop further strategies to prevent the clinical problems associated with hypoglycaemia in insulin-dependent diabetic adults and children.
