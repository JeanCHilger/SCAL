Detection of oral dysplasia in animals with fluorine-18-FDG and carbon-11-tyrosine. The uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and L-[1-(11)C]tyrosine (TYR) was investigated in male Wistar albino rats with chemically induced dysplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to correlate the uptake values with the grade of dysplasia.The palates of 54 rats was painted three times per week with 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide to create different stages of dysplasia and SCC. After 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 26 and 30 wk, these rats were investigated with PET. Immediately thereafter, the rats were killed and histologically prepared. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) of the palate of the rats were calculated and correlated with the Epithelial Atypia Index (EAI) and the thickness of the epithelial layer.The TYR SUV correlated with the EAI and the epithelial thickness, 0.5 and 0.74, respectively. No correlation could be found for FDG SUV, compared to EAI and the epithelial thickness.For dysplasia and SCC, TYR showed higher uptake values than did FDG. It appeared that, for the detection of oral dysplasia, the tissue hyperplasia was more important than malignant features of dysplastic mucosa.
