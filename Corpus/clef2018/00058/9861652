Contribution of nuclear medicine to the diagnosis of recurrent brain tumors and cerebral radionecrosis. The evaluation of brain tumor recurrence and therapy-induced benign changes following surgery and/or irradiation is a diagnostic challenge for imaging methods based on either morphology (cCT/MRI) or function (SPECT/PET). Current literature and the present data of our own patients demonstrate the diagnostic efficiency of IMT-SPECT and FDG-PET in the detection of recurrence and in-vivo grading. Thirty-nine patients suspected of brain tumor recurrence at follow-up were studied by FDG-PET and IMT-SPECT. Thirty-four of 39 patients showed recurrences in 12 cases even a change in the grade of malignancy was observed. All high-grade recurrences could be confirmed by either methods. IMT-SPECT showed a higher sensitivity in detecting low-grade tumors at recurrence. In contrast to IMT-SPECT, FDG-PET supports sufficient in-vivo grading. Both methods can be used to differentiate between tumor recurrence and radionecrosis. In conclusion the results of our study demonstrate the efficiency of IMT-SPECT and FDG-PET in confirming recurrences and determining the actual tumor grade.
