Network analysis in episodic encoding and retrieval of word-pair associates: a PET study. The involvement of distributed brain regions in declarative memory has been hypothesized based on studies with verbal memory tasks. To characterize episodic declarative memory function further, 14 right-handed volunteers performed a visual verbal learning task using paired word associates. The volunteers underwent positron emission tomography. 15O-butanol was used as a tracer of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Inter-regional functional interactions were assessed based on within-task, across-subject inter-regional rCBF correlations. Anatomical connections between brain areas were based on known anatomy. Structural equation modelling was used to calculate the path coefficients representing the magnitudes of the functional influences of each area on the ones to which it is connected by anatomical pathways. The encoding and the retrieval network elicit similarities in a general manner but also differences. Strong functional linkages involving visual integration areas, parahippocampal regions, left precuneus and cingulate gyrus were found in both encoding and retrieval the functional linkages between posterior regions and prefrontal regions were more closely linked during encoding, whereas functional linkages between the left parahippocampal region and posterior cingulate as well as extrastriate areas and posterior cingulate gyrus were stronger during retrieval. In conclusion, these findings support the idea of a global bihemispheric, asymmetric encoding/retrieval network subserving episodic declarative memory. Our results further underline the role of the precuneus in episodic memory, not only during retrieval but also during encoding.
