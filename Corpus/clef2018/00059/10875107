Clinical characteristics and indications for shunting in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus with brain atrophy (atypical idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus). To clarify clinical characteristics of atypical idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (AINPH) and indications for shunt operations.Subjects examined in the present study included 65 patients who satisfied the following 4 diagnostic criteria of AINPH and underwent V.P shunt with Medos type shunt system set pressure: epidural standard pressure x 13.6 - 20 mmH2O (omission of a figure in the first place).
