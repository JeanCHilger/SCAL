Effects of single and repetitive spreading depression on cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism in cats: a PET study. To clarify the effects of spreading depression (SD) on cerebral circulation and metabolism, we elicited a single or repetitive episode of SD and evaluated CBF and CMRglc three-dimensionally in normal cats (n=4, in each group) using a high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. SD was evoked by applying KCl to the left occipital cortex. We then monitored DC potential changes with tungsten electrodes inserted into the left temporal cortex. CBF was measured twice before and three times (immediately, 30-60 min, and 60-120 min) following KCl application using [15O]H(2)O, and CMRglc was determined using 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose immediately following the last CBF measurement. The following results were obtained: (1) a single episode of SD produced a temporary CBF increase, followed by a long-lasting hypoperfusion in the cortex, with no significant changes to CBF observed in the subcortex (2) no significant CMRglc changes were observed in either cortical or subcortical regions following a single episode of SD
