Effect of 6-fluoro-m-tyrosine on dopamine release and metabolism in rat striatum using in vivo microdialysis. 6-[(18)F]Fluoro-m-tyrosine (FMT) is a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent for the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase enzyme. Its parent compound, L-m-tyrosine (LMT) induces behavioral effects in rodents via dopamine release. To assess the potential pharmacologic effect of FMT, its role in dopamine release and metabolism in rat striatum was compared with LMT and L-DOPA using in vivo microdialysis. Results indicate that FMT will not have the same dopamine-induced behavioral effects as LMT.
