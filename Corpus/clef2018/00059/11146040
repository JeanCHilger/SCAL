Functional imaging of normal tissues with nuclear medicine: applications in radiotherapy. Functional imaging techniques are gaining significant interest from radiation oncologists. Many now claim the need for physical and physiological information during both treatment planning and in the study of normal tissue injury. Toward this goal, the nuclear medicine functional imaging modalities, single-photon emission computed tomography and positron-emission computed tomography, have been used. This article reviews the studies performed in radiotherapy that used these modalities, and attempts to stimulate further interest in this topic.
