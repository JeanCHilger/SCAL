Simultaneous near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring of left and right occipital areas reveals contra-lateral hemodynamic changes upon hemi-field paradigm. In this study we have shown that in humans it is possible to monitor non-invasively and simultaneously both hemispheres revealing cortical oxygenation changes in the occipital area in response to a contra-lateral hemi-field paradigm. A novel multi-channel near infrared spectroscopy approach with a high temporal resolution was used. The results confirm previous findings obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography with the advantage to measure directly not only concentration changes in deoxyhemoglobin as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but also in oxyhemoglobin with low cost instrumentation potentially useful to investigate the pathophysiology of vision.
