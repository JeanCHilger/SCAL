Clinical and para-clinical tests in the routine examination of headache patients. Para-clinical examinations in the diagnosis and treatment control of headache patients vary considerably between clinics and headache centers. Among the neurological societies in Europe there has been a consensus that some common procedures and recommendations should be created. In the Fall of 1998, the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) commissioned a Task Force on Neurophysiological Tests and Imaging Procedures in Headache Patients. Members of the Task Force are the present authors and we have reviewed the literature on 1) neurophysiological tests (EEG and evoked potentials), 2) autonomic nervous system and clinical tests and 3) imaging and cerebrovascular tests (X-ray, CT, MR, fMRI, PET, SPECT and transcranial Doppler). The literature was carefully evaluated with respect to validity and strength of the data. The task was to reach conclusions about each technique in the form of guidelines for clinical use. Finally, selected areas for future research will be outlined. The extensive review and the guidelines will be published by the EFNS during 2000.
