rCBF study with 123I-IMP SPECT of dural arteriovenous fistula. It is important for dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) to evaluate venous ischemia in the brain related to venous hypertension, but only a few such studies have been performed. In this study, regional cerebral blood flow(rCBF) in DAVF was examined for venous ischemia by 123I-IMP SPECT. The subjects were eighteen patients with DAVF. Of the eighteen patients, nine had DAVF with low perfusion areas and venous ischemia. The factors affecting rCBF in DAVF are: 1) the presence of retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainage, 2) sinus occlusion, and 3) DAVF with high flow. The presence of retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainage was observed in nine patients, sinus occlusion in four patients, high flow in three patients. In two patients, pure leptomeningeal venous drainage was formed by patent sinus, and blood regurgitated from DAVF on the sinus wall to cortical vein. When DAVF was associated with LMVD, most patients had venous hypertension and concomitant venous congestion in the same areas due to reduced venous circulation, resulting in a decrease in rCBF and an increase in regional cerebral blood volume. These hemodynamics suggest venous ischemia in the brain. 123I-IMP SPECT was useful for evaluating rCBF and as a parameter of the treatment.
