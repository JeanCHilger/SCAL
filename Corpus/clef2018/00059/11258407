Scintigraphic imaging of uveal melanoma with 99Tcm-glutathione. A prospective study with a new tumour-seeking agent, 99Tcm-glutathione (GSH), was performed on 17 patients with choroidal melanoma. Planar and SPECT images using 99Tcm-GSH clearly demonstrated melanotic melanoma but failed to show amelonotic melanomas. Following confirmation of our results by concurrent ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, patients were managed by either 125I plaque brachytherapy, diode laser transpupillary thermotherapy or enucleation depending on the site and location. In combination with other diagnostic tests, 99Tcm-GSH scintigraphy may play a role in the detection of uveal melanoma and its possible distant metastases.
