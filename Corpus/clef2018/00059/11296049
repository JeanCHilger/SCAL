Occult primary tumors of the head and neck: accuracy of thallium 201 single-photon emission computed tomography and computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging. To determine the accuracy of thallium 201 single-photon emission computed tomography (thallium SPECT) and computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) in the detection of occult primary tumors of the head and neck.Study of diagnostic tests.National Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.Thirty-two patients with a neck node metastasis of an epithelial tumor and negative findings by mirror examination at initial presentation were included in the study. Twenty-nine patients underwent thallium SPECT and CT/MRI before examination under general anesthesia (EUA). In 3 patients only thallium SPECT was performed before EUA. Histological confirmation of an occult primary tumor during EUA was used as the gold standard. Negative radiodiagnostic and nuclear findings in the upper aerodigestive tract in the presence of a primary carcinoma other than of the head and neck were interpreted as true-negative findings.For thallium SPECT the following results were recorded: sensitivity, 67% specificity, 69%Thallium SPECT and CT/MRI showed comparable results for detection of occult primary tumors of the head and neck. A potential advantage of thallium SPECT is that it allows total body screening.
