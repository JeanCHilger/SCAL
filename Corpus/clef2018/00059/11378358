Synthesis of potent and selective dopamine D(4) antagonists as candidate radioligands. A series of dopamine D(4) antagonists was synthesized and evaluated as potential candidates for development as positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands. All new compounds display high affinity and selectivity for the D(4) receptors and compounds 5b, 5d, and 5e were identified as candidates for radioligand development.
