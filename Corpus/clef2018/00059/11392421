The role of nuclear medicine in the evaluation of pancreatic disease. F-18 FDG PET in patients with nonendocrine pancreatic cancer and somatostatin receptor imaging in patients with endocrine pancreatic cancer have an important role in detecting or confirming the presence of a mass in the pancreas--a crucial step in the management of these patients. Both agents also have an important role in staging and in defining which patients are good candidates for resection surgery. Somatostatin receptor imaging also has a crucial role in selecting from the various systemic therapeutic options available. I-131 MIBG therapy can be of value therapeutically, mostly palliative, in patients who demonstrate a markedly elevated concentration of tumor radioactivity.
