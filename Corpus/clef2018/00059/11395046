Reduced myocardial flow reserve relates to increased carotid intima-media thickness in healthy young men. Increased carotid artery wall thickness and lipoprotein oxidation are key early events in atherosclerosis. To test the hypothesis that reduced myocardial flow reserve is a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, we examined the relationships between flow reserve and carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) in young men free from coronary heart disease. Basal and dipyridamole stimulated coronary blood flow was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) in 55 healthy men aged 36+/-4 years. Myocardial flow reserve was calculated as the ratio of stimulated flow to basal flow. The mean carotid artery IMT was measured using high-resolution ultrasound. Oxidised LDL was measured as baseline LDL diene conjugation. Myocardial flow reserve decreased across the quartiles of increasing IMT (P=0.006), and was 5.2+/-1.9 in the lowest quartile for IMT and 3.7+/-1.2 in the highest (P=0.04, I vs. IV quartile). In univariate analysis, oxidised LDL correlated inversely with flow reserve (r=-0.35, P=0.01) and directly with IMT (r=0.51, P<0.001). The association between flow reserve and IMT remained significant (P< or =0.01) in multivariate regression model including age, blood pressure, left ventricular mass, ox-LDL, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides as covariates. These data support the concept that reduced myocardial flow reserve reflects subclinical atherosclerosis in asymptomatic subjects, and suggest that increased lipoprotein oxidation is directly related to early structural and functional atherosclerotic vascular changes.
