Intracoronary electrocardiogram for early detection of myocardial viability during coronary angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction. The clinical value of the intracoronary electrocardiogram (ECG) for detecting myocardial viability in acute myocardial infarction was evaluated by thallium-201 scintigraphy and left ventriculogram at the chronic stage.Intracoronary ECGs, recorded from the tip of a guidewire during emergency coronary angioplasty, were obtained in 65 patients with reperfused anterior myocardial infarction. Further ST segment elevation of greater than 0.2 mV detected during the balloon inflation was taken as significant. The left ventricular segmental shortening was measured from left ventriculograms recorded at acute and chronic stages. The infarct area was defined as viable when a thallium uptake of more than 50% was detected on thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy at the chronic stage.During emergency coronary angioplasty, significant ST segment elevation was noted in 45 patients (Group A) however, the ST segment was not significantly elevated in the other 20 patients (Group B). The infarct area of 42 patients in Group A and three patients in Group B was viable on scintigraphy. Improvement left ventricular wall motion of the infarct area was observed in 39 of the 42 patients in Group A and the three patients in Group B. Therefore, intracoronary ECG can predict reversible dysfunction with excellent sensitivity (92.9%) and specificity (73.9%).The myocardium within an infarct area can be regarded as viable when a further ST segment elevation occurs on intracoronary ECG during emergency coronary angioplasty. It is useful, therefore, to monitor the intracoronary ECG during coronary angioplasty balloon inflation to assess the myocardial viability of the infarct area.
