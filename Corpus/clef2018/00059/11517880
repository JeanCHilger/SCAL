Diagnosis and therapy of resistant temporal epilepsy. A complex research of epileptogenic focus (electroencephalography, invasive electroencephalography, MRI, PET) has allowed to localize a primary epileptogenic zone in medial temporal epilepsy in amygdale in 52% of the patients, in the anterior hippocampus--in 30% cases, a simultaneous and equivalent involvement of both amygdale and anterior hippocampus was diagnosed in 18% of the patients examined. Stereotaxic selective amygdalehippocampotomy was found to be effective in patients with resistant medial and lateral temporal epilepsy. The attacks stopped in 36% of the cases. In other patients frequency and duration of epileptic paroxysms considerably reduced, the structure of the paroxysms changed.
