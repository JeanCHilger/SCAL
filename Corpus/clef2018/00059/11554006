Neural transplantation in Parkinson's disease. In conclusion, proof of the principle exists that neural grafts can survive transplantation in PD and that this graft survival is related to preliminary evidence of clinical benefit and improvement on FD-PET. Two prospective, randomized, surgical placebo-controlled trials of fetal tissue transplantation for the treatment of PD will be published in the near future, as will results of a placebo-controlled xenograft trial. Lifelong survival of human fetal nigral grafts is likely. The striatum is comparatively simple to target surgically in comparison to other sites such as the subthalamic nucleus. Several new sources of dopamine cells are being developed for transplantation purposes. Long-term monitoring for toxicity, such as the development of dyskinesias, will be needed, and dose-escalation trials should be performed slowly due to the irreversible nature of transplants. There are numerous ways to improve current techniques of neural transplantation.
