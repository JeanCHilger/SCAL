Stereotaxic display of brain lesions. Traditionally lesion location has been reported using standard templates, text based descriptions or representative raw slices from the patient's CT or MRI scan. Each of these methods has drawbacks for the display of neuroanatomical data. One solution is to display MRI scans in the same stereotaxic space popular with researchers working in functional neuroimaging. Presenting brains in this format is useful as the slices correspond to the standard anatomical atlases used by neuroimagers. In addition, lesion position and volume are directly comparable across patients. This article describes freely available software for presenting stereotaxically aligned patient scans. This article focuses on MRI scans, but many of these tools are also applicable to other modalities (e.g. CT, PET and SPECT). We suggest that this technique of presenting lesions in terms of images normalized to standard stereotaxic space should become the standard for neuropsychological studies.
