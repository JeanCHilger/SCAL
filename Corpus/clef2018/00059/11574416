Changes in regional brain (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake at hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetic men associated with hypoglycemia unawareness and counter-regulatory failure. We examined the effects of acute moderate hypoglycemia and the condition of hypoglycemia unawareness on regional brain uptake of the labeled glucose analog [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) using positron emission tomography (PET). FDG-PET was performed in diabetic patients with (n = 6) and without (n = 7) hypoglycemia awareness. Each patient was studied at plasma glucose levels of 5 and 2.6 mmol/l, applied by glucose clamp techniques, in random order. Hypoglycemia-unaware patients were asymptomatic during hypoglycemia, with marked attenuation of their epinephrine responses (mean [+/- SD] peak of 0.77 +/- 0.39 vs. 7.52 +/- 2.9 nmol/l P < 0.0003) and a reduced global brain FDG uptake ([mean +/- SE] 2.592 +/- 0.188 vs. 2.018 +/- 0.174 at euglycemia
