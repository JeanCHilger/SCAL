Single photon emission CT and positron emission tomography in the evaluation of neurologic disease. Widely available SPECT allows imaging of certain critical components of neurotransmission, providing clinically and experimentally significant information. Future efforts may be directed toward developing innovative techniques to delineate dynamic neurochemical changes in vivo.
