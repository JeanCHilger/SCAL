The role of nuclear medicine in breast cancer detection: functional breast imaging. Mammography remains the imaging modality of choice in detection of early, nonpalpable breast cancer. Scintimammography using SPECT, however, may prove to be a very useful adjunct to a nondiagnostic or difficult mammogram. Further prospective studies have to be designed so that the specific clinical applications of this technique are more defined. As with any new imaging procedure, special care to obtain high-quality scintimammographic studies and sufficient training of staff to perform and interpret the imaging are necessary.
