Effect of endotoxin on oleic acid lung injury does not depend on priming. Recent studies have demonstrated significant synergistic physiological and biochemical effects between low-dose endotoxin (Etx) administration and oleic acid (OA)-induced canine lung injury. To evaluate whether this interaction depends on Etx priming of some key cell population, we compared the effects of giving low-dose Etx both after as well as before inducing lung injury with OA. In addition to hemodynamic and blood-gas measurements, positron emission tomographic imaging was used to measure edema accumulation and intrapulmonary blood flow distribution. Biochemical measurements of the stable metabolites of prostacyclin and thromboxane were obtained as well as measurements of isoprostanes and reactive sulfhydryls as evidence for possible concomitant oxidant production. We found that the physiological and biochemical effects of low-dose Etx developed 30-45 min after its administration, regardless of whether Etx was administered before or after OA. No increase in either isoprostane or reactive sulfhydryl production after Etx and/or OA was detected. These data suggest that the synergistic effect of low-dose Etx and OA-induced lung injury is not due to a priming effect of Etx.
