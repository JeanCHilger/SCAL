Differential effect of 1,10-phenanthroline on mammalian, yeast, and parasite glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor synthesis. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring of proteins to the plasma membrane is a common mechanism utilized by all eukaryotes including mammals, yeast, and the Trypanosoma brucei parasite. We have previously shown that in mammals phenanthroline (PNT) blocks the attachment of phosphoethanolamine (P-EthN) groups to mannose residues in GPI anchor intermediates, thus preventing the synthesis of mammalian GPI anchors. Therefore, PNT is likely to inhibit GPI-phosphoethanolamine transferases (GPI-PETs). Here we report that in yeast, PNT also inhibits the synthesis of the GPI anchor as well as GPI-anchored proteins. Interestingly, the mechanism of PNT inhibition of GPI synthesis is different from that of YW3548, another putative GPI-PET inhibitor. In contrast to mammals and yeast, the synthesis of GPIs in T. brucei is not affected by PNT. Our results indicate that the T. brucei GPI-PET could be a potential target for antiparasitic drugs.
