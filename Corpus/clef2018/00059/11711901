Value of linsidomin in assessing myocardial viability with thallium-201 SPECT. Myocardial viability can be assessed with rest/24 h redistribution (201)Tl myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The intravenous injection of vasodilators induces an early redistribution of (201)Tl and shortens the total examination time. The aim of this study was to compare the images after injection of linsidomin with the 24 h images. We studied 51 consecutive patients (38 males, 13 females), aged 66+/-11 years, referred for assessment of myocardial viability after acute myocardial infarction. SPECT acquisition at rest (30 projections over 180 degrees, 30 s per projection) was performed 20 min after injection of (201)Tl. A second acquisition (same parameters) was performed 2 min after intravenous injection of linsidomin (2 mg). A delayed acquisition was performed on the following day (50 s per step). Myocardial perfusion at rest was normal in 111 of 255 segments. For the 144 other segments, 24 h images were similar to the images acquired after the injection of linsidomin in 94% of cases (136 of 144 segments). The 24 h images showed partial redistribution that was not present after linsidomin in only eight segments (6%). Injection of linsidomin after rest acquisition can provide a reliable and more rapid assessment of myocardial viability. This very simple protocol (rest/linsidomin (201)Tl myocardial SPECT) can be performed in less than 1 h.
