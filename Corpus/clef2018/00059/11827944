High-throughput imaging of brain gene expression. Voxelation is a new method for acquisition of three dimensional (3D) gene expression patterns in the brain. It employs high-throughput analysis of spatially registered voxels (cubes) to produce multiple volumetric maps of gene expression analogous to the images reconstructed in biomedical imaging systems. Using microarrays, 24 voxel images of coronal hemisections at the level of the hippocampus of both the normal human brain and Alzheimer's disease brain were acquired for 2000 genes. The analysis revealed a common network of coregulated genes, and allowed identification of putative control regions. In addition, singular value decomposition (SVD), a mathematical method used to provide economical explanations of complex data sets, produced images that distinguished between brain structures, including cortex, caudate, and hippocampus. The results suggest that voxelation will be a useful approach for understanding how the genome constructs the brain.
