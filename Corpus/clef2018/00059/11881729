Immunohistochemical analysis of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression in pancreatic endocrine tumors: association with tumor progression and proliferation. An immunohistochemical study of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression in pancreatic endocrine tumors (PET) was carried out, and the expression of COX-2 was compared with pathological features, the expression of several markers (hormones, vascular endothelial growth factor, single-stranded DNA, and the Ki-67 labeling index [LI]). Twenty PET, including 10 metastasizing cases (tumor size: 3-8 cm) and 10 non-metastasizing cases (tumor size: 0.3-8 cm) were studied. Tumors with a high level of COX-2 expression were placed in the H group, and the remaining tumors were placed in the L group. The H group was comprised of 13 tumors: all 10 of the metastasizing cases and three of the non-metastasizing cases. There were significant differences in tumor size between the two groups (H group 46.5 mm L group 0.9 mm). There were significant differences in the presence of the following histological criteria for malignancy: pleomorphism (H group 13/13
