PET evaluation of a tetracyclic, atypical antidepressant, [N-methyl-11C]mianserin, in the living porcine brain. We synthesized [N-methyl-11C]mianserin by alkylation of N-desmethyl mianserin with [11C]methyl iodide followed by HPLC purification. We used PET for determining the regional cerebral pharmacokinetics of the radiotracer in anesthetized swine. [N-methyl-11C]Mianserin entered most brain regions readily (range of K1 values: 0.66-1.13), reaching highest levels in the basal ganglia and thalamus. The binding potential of [N-methyl-11C]mianserin was relatively low (range: 0.07-0.50), but regional differences were nonetheless observed, with highest values in the temporal cortex and lowest values in the brainstem. These PET findings, which are the first ones for a tetracyclic, antidepressant drug, show that [N-methyl-11C]mianserin has only a limited degree of regional specificity of binding in the living brain.
