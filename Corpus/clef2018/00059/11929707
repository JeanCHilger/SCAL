Improved method for the quality assurance of [C-11]choline. [C-11]choline is a very promising radiomarker for the diagnosis of various human tumors using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The existing quality control process for [C-11]choline is complicated and combines two HPLC methods with limited separation and sensitivity which prevent the accurate determination of the specific activity. We have developed a new efficient single HPLC method for the detection of choline chloride and dimethylaminoethanol with high resolution and sensitivity using cation-exchange chromatography.
