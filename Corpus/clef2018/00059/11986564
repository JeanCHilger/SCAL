Pharmacologic stress perfusion imaging with adenosine: role of simultaneous low-level treadmill exercise. Adenosine is commonly used for pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). However, it frequently results in adverse effects, and the subdiaphragmatic tracer uptake may interfere with the image interpretation. Our aim was to determine the feasibility of combining low-level treadmill exercise with adenosine MPI and its impact on adverse effects, image quality, and myocardial ischemia.Forty-one patients underwent technetium 99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography following adenosine and adenosine with low-level exercise (adenosine-Ex) on separate occasions and rest MPI. A comparison was made of symptoms, hemodynamic response, electrocardiographic changes, image quality, and image interpretation between the 2 protocols. With adenosine-Ex, fewer patients had one or more adverse effects (61% vs 90% P =.006), more patients had ischemic electrocardiographic changes (34% vs 15%Simultaneous low-level treadmill exercise with adenosine Tc-99m sestamibi imaging is safe and feasible, significantly reduces unfavorable side effects, enhances image quality, and may result in greater ischemia detection compared with adenosine alone.
