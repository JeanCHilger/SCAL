New modalities in breast imaging: digital mammography, positron emission tomography, and sestamibi scintimammography. Digital mammography, PET, and sestamibi scintimammography are three new modalities in breast imaging. DM has advantages over film-screen mammography in image storage, retrieval, and processing and may lower the recall rate. Computer-aided detection may increase the sensitivity of mammographic screening without a substantial reduction in specificity. Whereas PET and sestambi scintimammography are not useful in breast cancer screening, PET may play a role in detecting nodal metastases and monitoring treatment response, and sestamibi scintimammography in selected cases may serve as an adjunct to conventional imaging. The cost-effectiveness of these new modalities remains to be evaluated, but all have the potential to significantly advance the diagnosis and management of women with breast cancer.
