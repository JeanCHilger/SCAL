Exercise echocardiography and thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography stress test for 5- and 10-year prognosis of mortality and specific cardiac events. Limited data suggest that stress myocardial perfusion imaging and stress echocardiography have similar prognostic value for composite cardiac events. However, it is not known whether exercise echocardiography and stress thallium are similar in their prediction of specific cardiac events, eg, death, sudden death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and congestive heart failure. A total of 206 patients undergoing stress echocardiography and thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography imaging during the same exercise test were followed-up for 5 and 10 years. Multivariate Cox regression analyses incorporating clinical, exercise stress test, echocardiographic, and nuclear imaging parameters were used to predict mortality and specific cardiac events. A moderate to large amount of ischemia (> or =4 segments on the basis of a 16-segment model) by exercise stress echocardiography was the strongest predictor of overall mortality (relative risk [RR] 6.2 P <.0001), cardiac death (RR 17.6
