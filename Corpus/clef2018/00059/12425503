Mediastinal staging of non-small cell lung carcinoma using computed and positron-emission tomography. We evaluated the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) and positron-emission tomography (PET) in the mediastinal staging of non-small cell lung cancer.Between May 14, 1999, and November 28, 2000, computerized tomography (CT) and positron-emission tomography (PET) were used to clinically stage 94 consecutive patients with non-small cell carcinoma of the lung (NSCCL). All patients underwent subsequent surgical staging with mediastinoscopy, anterior mediastinotomy, and/or thoracotomy with mediastinal lymphadenectomy.Overall accuracy was the same for both procedures. False-negative results occurred 3 times more often with CT false-positive results occurred twice as often with PET. Sensitivity and specificity were 64% and 94%, respectively, for CT, versus 88% and 86%, respectively, for PET. Positive and negative predictive values were 80% and 88%, respectively, for CT, versus 71% and 95%, respectively, for PET.In addition to routine use of CT, PET seems to achieve high negative predictive value in the evaluation of mediastinal disease PET seems particularly helpful in assessing absence of tumor in bulky nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.
