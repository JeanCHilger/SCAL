Evaluation of myocardial viability with myocardial contrast echocardiography: a preliminary clinical study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) in the assessment of myocardial viability, with positron emission tomography (PET) as the golden standard. METHODS: Eleven patients with anterior wall Q wave myocardial infarction were enrolled in this study, who received successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) 3 to 19 months prior to the examinations by PET and MCE that were completed within 2 d. RESULTS: MCE score for the segments of necrotic myocardium, viable myocardium and normal myocardium was mostly 0, 0.5 and 1 respectively, and there was a significant difference between the grades of MCE score in identifying myocardial viability. In terms of diagnosing myocardium survival, MCE result was closely correlated with that of PET (with the correlation index rp of 0.78). CONCLUSION: Myocardial perfusion evaluation can be effectively accomplished by MCE, which might serve as a new approach to assess myocardial viability in clinical practice.
