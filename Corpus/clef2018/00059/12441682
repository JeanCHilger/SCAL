Prevalence and clinical characterization of gastric Helicobacter species infection of dogs and cats in Korea. This study was carried out to evaluate the prevalence and clinical characterizations of gastric Helicobacter spp. infection of dogs and cats in Korea. The prevalence of Helicobacter spp. infection of dogs and cats determined by urease test was 78.4% and 64%, respectively, although Helicobacter genus-specific PCR assay showed that it was 82.3% and 84%. Urease mapping results based on urease test showed that total positive rate of tested tissues from clinically abnormal dogs was significantly higher than that from clinically normal dogs (p=0.0018 Odds ratio = 6.118
