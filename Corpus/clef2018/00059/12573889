Performance evaluation of principal component analysis in dynamic FDG-PET studies of recurrent colorectal cancer. Performance evaluation of principal component analysis (PCA) of dynamic F-18-FDG-PET studies of patients with recurrent colorectal cancer. Principal component images (PCI) of 17 iteratively reconstructed data sets were visually and quantitatively evaluated. The F-18-FDG compartment model parameters were estimated using polynomial regression. All structures were present in PCI1. PCI2 was correlated with the vascular component and PCI3 with the tumor. The vessel density in the tumor was estimated with a correlation coefficient equal to 0.834. PCA supports the visual interpretation of dynamic F-18-FDG-PET studies, facilitates the application of compartment modeling and is a promising quantification technique.
