Neoadjuvant therapeutic principles guided by response prediction and evaluation. Only patients with a clinical and pathohistological response to neoadjuvant therapy have a significantly improved survival. Therefore the identification of predictors for response and procedures for the early identification of nonresponders appear to be mandatory. Preliminary data of biochemical investigations of target enzymes for several cytostatics (e.g. TS, ERCC1) appear to be promising. Early changes of the tumor metabolism in the FDG-PET enable the identification of nonresponders with a negative predictive value of 88-95%. In near future these findings should lead to consequences in the design and realization of clinical studies.
