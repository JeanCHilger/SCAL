Transient left ventricular dysfunction in ischaemic myocardium after stress: comparative study with exercise and pharmacological stress gated myocardial single photon emission computed tomography. In ischaemic heart disease patients, transient left ventricular dysfunction is observed due to post-exercise stunning. The aim of this study was to determine whether transient left ventricular dysfunction could also be seen after short-acting pharmacological stress (adenosine triphosphate). A 1 day rest/stress gated myocardial single photon emission computed tomography was performed on 362 patients suspected of having ischaemic heart disease by exercise (n=199) or short-acting pharmacological stress (n=163). Left ventricular ejection fraction were estimated both at rest and stress. Based on perfusion findings, patients were subdivided into ischaemia, fixed defect and normal group. For the ischaemia and fixed defect group, left ventricular ejection fraction after stress was significantly decreased compared with the resting value by exercise stress (ischaemia group, 57.5+/-11.0 vs 60.4+/-10.4 fixed defect group, 47.7+/-16.7 vs 49.6+/-16.8
