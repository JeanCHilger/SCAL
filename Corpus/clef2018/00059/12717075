An evaluation of reconstruction techniques and scatter correction in bone SPECT of the spine. A selection of commonly used reconstruction and filter techniques in the processing of 99mTc oxidronate (i.e., 99mTc hydroxymethane diphosphonate) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the spine was compared. The possible additional value of scatter correction on image contrast was also evaluated. Twenty-eight bone SPECT examinations of consecutive patients were studied retrospectively. The reconstruction techniques used were filtered back-projection and iterative reconstruction with the use of ordered subsets estimation maximization. Three-dimensional post-filtering with a Metz filter and a Butterworth filter was used. Each combination was evaluated with or without scatter correction. Each study was also processed with the department's standard technique of two-dimensional pre-filtering with a Metz filter followed by filtered back-projection (without scatter correction). Five observers evaluated the image quality of reconstructed coronal and sagittal slices, with special reference to the resolution of vertebrae, vertebral processes, the spinal canal and suspected abnormal uptakes. A grading scale from -2 to +2 was used with the standard technique as the reference. The best image quality was found with iterative reconstruction in combination with a contrast enhancing Metz filter or a noise reducing Butterworth filter. Scatter correction did not improve image quality.
