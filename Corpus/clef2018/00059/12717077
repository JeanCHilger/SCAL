A novel radiopharmaceutical for detection of malignant melanoma, based on melanin formation: 3-iodo-4-hydroxyphenyl-L-cysteine. The aim of this study was to develop a new artificial amino acid radiopharmaceutical labelled with radioiodine for detection of malignant melanoma, based on melanin formation. By considering the affinity for tyrosinase, a starting enzyme on the branching point to melanin biosynthesis, 3-[125I]iodo-4-hydroxyphenyl-L-cysteine (125I-L-PC) was synthesized and evaluated biologically. Labelling of 125I-L-PC using the chloramine-T method was carried out conveniently and efficiently in a short period of time, with high specific activity. In a biodistribution study, 125I-L-PC showed a low accumulation in normal tissue and relative retention in B16 melanoma. A high contrast image of peripheral tumour was obtained during autoradiography. During an in vitro accumulation study, inhibition of 125I-L-PC with a tyrosinase inhibitor suggested interaction of this tracer with tyrosinase. It indicates that the uptake mechanism of 125I-L-PC to melanoma tissue was dependent on high tyrosinase activity in melanoma cells. Thus, 125I-L-PC appears to be a promising radioiodinated amino acid radiopharmaceutical for imaging malignant melanoma in relation to melanin formation, namely specific metabolism with high tyrosinase activity.
