Insulin-mediated hepatic glucose uptake is impaired in type 2 diabetes: evidence for a relationship with glycemic control. Impaired hepatic glucose uptake (HGU) has been implicated in the development of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes the relative impact of plasma glucose and insulin levels on this process remains controversial. We compared the effects of euglycemic hyperinsulinemia on HGU, skeletal muscle glucose uptake, and hepatic influx rate-constant (H-Ki) in 38 diet-treated diabetic patients and 22 nondiabetic controls, using positron emission tomography with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose and the insulin clamp technique. Control subjects were divided into two subgroups: one including older, heavier, insulin-resistant controls (whole-body glucose uptake, M = 21.4 +/- 5.4 micromol x min(-1) x kg(-1)) to match characteristics of diabetic patients (M = 20.4 +/- 9.9)
