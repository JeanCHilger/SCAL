Tumor radiotherapy monitoring with radioscintigraphy tracers: a comparative study with multiple-tracer technique. A comparative multiple-tracer study was performed to assess the tracer feasibility of monitoring tumor radiotherapy. Metabolic tracers for glucose, amino acid, nucleic acid metabolism: F-18-FDG, C-14-Met, H-3-Thd, and F-18-FdUrd and conventional Ga-67 were compared in the same AH109A radiotherapy model using a new quadruple-tracer technique. F-18-FDG showed a large uptake change and a steady response to radiotherapy which is similar to Ga-67. F-18-FdUrd showed a rapid decrease, but the range of change in uptake was narrow. H-3-Thd and C-14-Met showed a rapid response to irradiation and a high sensitivity for monitoring radiotherapy, suggesting that if labeled with C-11, they may be feasible for PET study.
