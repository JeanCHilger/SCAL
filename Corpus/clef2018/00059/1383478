Regional cerebral perfusion in Landau-Kleffner syndrome and related childhood aphasias. Assessment of cerebral perfusion may elucidate pathogenesis of Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS). We obtained 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT studies in five children with LKS and in three children with syndromes of verbal-auditory agnosia. In LKS, perfusion showed temporoparietal asymmetry (9.56% +/- 3.44%) (n = 4) or bilateral parietal abnormality (n = 1). SPECT in non-LKS patients was normal (n = 1), showed (n = 1) totihemispheral hypoperfusion accompanying structural abnormality or (n = 1) a pattern resembling but distinct from LKS. Seizures in LKS patients had never occurred (n = 1), were controlled satisfactorily (n = 2), or poorly (n = 2). Maximum EEG abnormality was left centrotemoral-occipital (n = 1), left frontocentral (n = 1), bitemporal/left central (n = 1), and left central/parasagittal (n = 1). Asymmetric temporoparietal perfusion appears characteristic of LKS, differing from findings in other childhood linguistic disturbances. This abnormality occurs across a spectrum of seizure expression, diverging from the distribution of EEG abnormalities. The SPECT abnormalities parallel PET-defined LKS metabolic abnormalities, and may indicate central pathogenetic features of the disorder.
