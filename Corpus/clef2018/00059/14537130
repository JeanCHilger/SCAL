Quantitative measurement of regional blood flow in hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia. Findings on positron emission tomography. The blood flow through normal liver parenchyma and a pathologically proven hepatic region of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) of the lateral lobe, was measured in a single patient in a quantitative manner using regional dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with O-15 carbon dioxide (steady state) and O-15 water (dynamic state). The steady state PET images revealed higher radioactivity concentration in the lateral lobe than in the surrounding normal liver parenchyma. Regional and total blood flow in the region of FNH, as determined by the dynamic state method, was 292.2 ml/100g/min and 330.2 ml/min, respectively. It was determined that the region of FNH in this patient had higher blood flow than that described previously for liver tumors such as hepatocellularcarcinoma and colorectal hepatic metastases.
