Cerebral blood flow in migraine without aura. For several years, cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies have been fueling the controversy surrounding the pathophysiology of migraine headache. The earliest studies focused mainly on migraine with aura (MA+) and provided evidence in support of the classical hemodynamic theory: a decrease in blood flow during the aura is followed by reactive vasodilation during the headache phase. Studies in migraine without aura (MA-), although less numerous, consistently demonstrated an increase in CBF during the attack. Olesen et al., gave rise to a heated debate by suggesting that hemodynamic manifestations are different in MA+ and MA- in their view, CBF remains unchanged in MA-, whereas MA+ is associated with a wave of posterior blood flow deficiency which slowly spreads forwards in a manner reminiscent of experimental spreading depression
