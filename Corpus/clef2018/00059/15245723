Nodular fasciitis: an unexpected finding on computed tomography and positron emission tomography. Nodular fasciitis is an uncommon lesion that is also designated as a pseudosarcomatous, self-limiting reactive process. We describe a 40-year-old woman with a nodular fasciitis that was detected by computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG), and histology while she was being examined for upper abdominal pain.
