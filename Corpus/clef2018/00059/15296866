Ferret oncology: diseases, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Many standard diagnostic and chemotherapeutic protocols can be adapted for use in ferrets. Unique anatomic and clinical features dictate modification of protocols, but should not prohibit diagnosis or treatment. Ferrets may be the easiest of nontraditional species to treat with chemotherapeutics. We can provide more options for our patients, with improved quality of life and longer survival times than ever before. Although clients are never happy to hear the diagnosis of "cancer," it is no longer a word that condemns their beloved pet.
