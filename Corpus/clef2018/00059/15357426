Research of plasma adsorption and action of platelet adhesion of Dacron modified by plasma surface modification. In this paper, polyethylene glycol (PEG) of different molecular weight was grafted on the polyethylene terephthalate (PET, Dacron) films by plasma surface grafting modification. The competitive adsorption relation of plasma (fibrinogen and albumin) adsorbing on materials surface was analyzed in light of surface energy and interface free energy. The results indicated that the PET films grafted PEG long chain molecular possesses the characteristic of preferentially adsorbing albumin and this adsorption tendency of grafted PEG6000 sample is most distinct. The platelet adhesion tests of the PET films whose surfaces were pre-set in contact with fibrinogen and albumin indicated that the surface adsorbing albumin can distinctly inhibit platelet adhesion and aggregation and possess favorable blood compatibility, but the surface adsorbing fibrinogen can enhance platelet adhesion and aggregation.
