Neuropathological diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease. Neuropathological diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are based on tau-related pathology: NFT or neuritic plaques (NP). The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD) criterion evaluates the highest density of neocortical NP from 0 (none) to C (abundant). Clinical documentation of dementia and NP stage A in younger cases, B in young old cases and C in older cases fulfils the criterion of AD. The CERAD criterion is most frequently used in clinical outcome studies because of its inclusion of clinical information. Braak and Braak's criterion evaluates the density and distribution of NFT and classifies them into: I/II, entorhinal III/IV, limbic
