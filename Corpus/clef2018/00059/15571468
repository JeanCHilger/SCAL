Clinical uses of recombinant human thyrotropin. Recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH), used to enhance diagnostic radioiodine whole body scanning and thyroglobulin testing, has dramatically altered the management of patients with thyroid cancer. Withdrawal from thyroid hormone suppression therapy and subsequent hypothyroidism is no longer the only safe and effective method for thyroid cancer surveillance. Currently, rhTSH is only approved for the monitoring of low-risk patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer and radioactive iodine administration, in selected cases. Additional applications of rhTSH include enhancing the sensitivity of positron emission tomography in thyroid cancer, the management of multinodular goiter, and dynamic testing of thyroid reserve. The diagnostic and therapeutic role of rhTSH in these areas is discussed in this review.
