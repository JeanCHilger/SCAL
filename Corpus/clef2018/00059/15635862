Cystatin C in estimates of glomerular filtration in patients with renal disease--initial experience. Cystatin is reported in the literature with increasing frequency as a new reliable parameter for estimates of glomerular filtration. The authors examined cystatin C by the PET method of DAKO Co. in 151 patients from the nephrological out-patient clinic. 91 patients had normal renal functions, 60 suffered from renal insufficiency of different severity. Between cystatin C and glomerular filtration assessed by creatinine clearance was a close correlation, R = -0.787 according to Pearson. The authors evaluated separately a group of 36 patients with glomerulonephritis, 34 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy, 38 patients with tubulointerstitial nephritis and 43 subjects with other kidney diseases. The groups did not differ significantly when compared with the whole group nor mutually (p = n.s.). The authors of the study confirmed that a good correlation of cystatin with creatinine filtration is not influenced by the type of basic nephrological disease. The effect of administration of insulin, antihypertensive drugs, cyclosporin A and glucocorticoids was not proved in the investigated group. The published method is accurate, not demanding from the technical aspect. The examined subject is not restricted by conditions ensuring the accuracy of assessment and seems thus useful and perspective for nephrological patients.
