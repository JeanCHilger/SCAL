Quantitative measurement of infarct size by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging early after acute myocardial infarction: comparison with single-photon emission tomography using Tc99m-sestamibi. The aim of this research was to evaluate kinetics and extent of myocardial contrast enhancement (CE) in comparison with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) early after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).Quantification of infarct size serves as a surrogate end point in evaluating new therapies of AMI. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CeMRI) of the myocardium is a promising new method for identification of irreversible tissue injury.A total of 33 patients were examined by CeMRI and SPECT 7 +/- 2 days after AMI and successful coronary intervention. After gadolinium-diethylenetraimine pentaacetic acid injection (0.2 mmol/kg), continuous short-axis slices of the left ventricle (LV) were acquired every 7 min up to 42 min using different inversion times (TI). Myocardial CE at each imaging time point was quantified and compared with corresponding SPECT perfusion defect.All patients showed myocardial CE in the infarct region. A constant TI for CeMRI resulted in a decrease of signal intensity and extent of CE on late acquisitions. With TI adjustment, infarct image intensity peaked at 21 min with a contrast of 478% of remote myocardium and remained at this level up to 42 min after contrast injection (437%) CE extent was stable over time and agreed well with SPECT within an average difference of 3% of the LV myocardium, yielding the best correlation at 28 min (r = 0.86).In patients after AMI and successful reperfusion, CE is stable over time and matches well with SPECT perfusion defect CeMRI under standardized conditions can accurately assess myocardial infarct size in vivo and may be attractive for serving as a surrogate end point early after AMI.
