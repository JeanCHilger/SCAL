Evaluation of myocardial flow reserve using pharmacological stress thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography: is there a difference between total arterial off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and conventional coronary artery bypass grafting? The advantage of total arterial off-pump coronary bypass grafting (OPCAB) over conventional onpump coronary artery bypass grafting with 1 internal thoracic artery and veins (CCAB) in terms of myocardial flow reserve has not been studied. We studied these procedures using thallium- 201 perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (Tl-201 perfusion SPECT).Between 1997 and 2001, 152 patients were recruited from our database (OPCAB, n = 100 CCAB, n = 52). All patients underwent pharmacological stress Tl-201 perfusion SPECT 3 to 12 months after bypass surgery. Myocardial perfusion was analyzed semiquantitatively with a 5-point scoring system in a 20-segment model (0, normal, to 4, absence of uptake). Summed stress (SSS), rest (SRS), and difference score (SDS) of the entire myocardium as well as average scores (ASS, ARS, ADS) of individual walls (anterior, septal, lateral, and inferior) were compared by Student t test as well as by repeated-measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction.The SSS, SRS, and SDS of OPCAB versus those of CCAB were 6.86 +/- 0.72 versus 7.17 +/- 0.92, 3.95 +/- 0.57 versus 3.75 +/- 0.73, and 2.91 +/- 0.47 versus 3.42 +/- 0.74 (P > .05). However, the lateral wall showed lower scores in OPCAB (ASS, 0.18 versus 0.41, P = .015 ARS, 0.12 versus 0.20, P = .168OPCAB led to results similar to those of CCAB. The better results in the lateral wall have been the effect of grafting radial artery rather than vein. The similarity in myocardial reserve in the inferior wall between the 2 groups needs further study. There was no deleterious effect of off-pump as opposed to on-pump CAB.
