Plasma NT-proBNP concentration is related to ambulatory pulse pressure in peripheral arterial disease. Increased levels of N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are associated with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), but the relation of NT-proBNP to ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and hypertensive target organ damage in high-risk patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) has not been studied. We hypothesized that NT-proBNP levels were increased in patients with PAD in comparison to a matched control group and that levels of NT-proBNP were related to ABP.Blood samples were analysed for NT-proBNP in 103 males with PAD and 96 age- and sex-matched controls. Ninety-eight PAD patients performed ABP monitoring and 99 underwent Tc-99m Sestamibi myocardial perfusion SPECT.NT-proBNP was significantly increased in PAD patients compared with controls [median (interquartiles)] 167(76, 418) vs 68(38, 142) pg/ml, p<0.001. Plasma levels of NT-proBNP correlated positively to systolic blood pressure (SBP), pulse pressure (PP), night-day ratio of SBP and showed the strongest correlation to average night PP (r=0.42, p<0.001). In multiple regression analysis, night PP remained independently related to NT-proBNP.NT-proBNP levels are markedly increased in PAD patients compared to age-matched controls. Night PP is related to NT-proBNP levels independently of other variables highlighting the importance of ambulatory PP as a cardiovascular risk factor. Measurement of NT-proBNP could be indicated in PAD patients for further risk stratification.
