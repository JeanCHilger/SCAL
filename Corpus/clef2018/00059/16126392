Single photon emission computed tomography in planning unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. A prospective study examining the association between scan findings and intraoperative assessment of osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between preoperative single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan findings and intraoperative assessments of knee osteoarthritis (OA) in patients undergoing tibiofemoral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Fifty knees in 46 patients undergoing UKA were investigated preoperatively with a SPECT scan to confirm unicompartmental disease. There were 38 men and 12 women in the cohort with an average age of 63 years (range 44-78). The SPECT scan uptake in each compartment of the knee was graded by a single radiologist and these findings were compared with intraoperative assessments of OA (size and grade of lesion), made by two experienced surgeons, blinded to the scan findings. Significant association was demonstrated between scan findings and OA in all compartments of the knee (p<0.05), and this was strongest in the medial compartment and weakest in the patellofemoral compartment and lateral tibial plateau. We conclude that SPECT scan is a useful imaging modality in the planning of medial tibiofemoral UKA to confirm unicompartmental disease. The lower degree of association between scan findings and OA encountered in the patellofemoral compartments and lateral tibial plateau indicates that greater vigilance should be exercised in the intraoperative assessment of these areas.
