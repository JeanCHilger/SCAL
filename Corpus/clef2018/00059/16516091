Relevance of coronary microvascular flow impairment to long-term remodeling and systolic dysfunction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This study sought to evaluate whether the entity of microvascular dysfunction, assessed by positron emission tomography (PET), predicts the long-term development of left ventricular (LV) remodeling and systolic dysfunction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).A subgroup of patients with HCM developed LV dilation and systolic impairment. A causal role of coronary microvascular dysfunction has been suggested as the underlying pathophysiological mechanism.Fifty-one patients (New York Heart Association functional class I to II) were followed up for 8.1 +/- 2.1 years after measurement of resting and dipyridamole (Dip) myocardial blood flow (MBF). Left ventricular systolic dysfunction was defined as an ejection fraction (LVEF) <50%.The Dip-MBF was blunted in HCM patients compared with a group of healthy control patients (1.50 +/- 0.69 ml/min/g vs. 2.71 +/- 0.94 ml/min/g p < 0.001). At final evaluation, 11 patients (22%) had an LVEF <50%Severe microvascular dysfunction is a potent long-term predictor of adverse LV remodeling and systolic dysfunction in HCM. Our findings indicate microvascular dysfunction as a potential target for prevention of disease progression and heart failure in HCM.
