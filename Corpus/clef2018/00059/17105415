Imaging probes targeting matrix metalloproteinases. During the past few years, several imaging probes targeting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been developed. Most of these probes have been validated in animal models. Overall, results derived from most of these studies have been disappointing. Whether or not this relates to shortcomings of the imaging probes used or to the set-up of the reported studies is currently unclear. Firstly, MMPs targeted in these studies, MMP-1, -2 and -9, are cell secreted and their expression is known to vary extensively within one tumor type, depending on the stage of development of the tumor and on the presence of naturally occurring TIMPs. Given the lack of data on the levels of MMP expression by incoculated tumor tissue at the time of imaging in most studies reported, it cannot be excluded that the negative results reported are, in fact, false-negative imaging results. Secondly, given that most of the agents used for imaging are intrinsically broad-spectrum agents, their higher affinity for specific subsets of MMPs does not necessarily imply that a positive imaging result also corresponds to overexpression of specific subsets of MMPs, as suggested in some papers published. Accordingly, well-characterized tumor models need to be developed for the purpose of validating currently available, as well as future, MMP-imaging probes. So far, only 111In-DTPA-N-TIMP-2 has been injected in patients, respectively suffering from Kaposi Sarcoma. Imaging results obtained with this agent proved disappointing. Imaging results obtained with other MMP-targeting probes in patients are awaited.
