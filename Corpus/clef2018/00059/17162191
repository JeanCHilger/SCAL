Human herpesvirus 6 encephalopathy predominantly affecting the frontal lobes. Isolated cases of human herpesvirus 6 encephalopathy have recently been reported, although the pathophysiology remains largely unknown. To elucidate the changes specific to human herpesvirus 6 encephalopathy on diagnostic images, this study investigated magnetic resonance imaging findings in 10 patients with a diagnosis of human herpesvirus 6 encephalopathy including diffusion-weighted imaging in 6 of 10, and findings of cerebral blood flow imaging by single-photon emission computed tomography in 9 of 10 patients. No abnormalities were evident on T(1)-weighted, T(2)-weighted, or fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery magnetic resonance imaging during acute phases however, diffusion-weighted imaging indicated abnormal hyperintensity in the subcortical white matter of the frontal lobes in all six patients during the acute phase. Cerebral blood flow single-photon emission computed tomography revealed decreased perfusion, predominantly in the frontal region of all nine patients during their clinical course. Disturbances predominantly affecting the frontal lobes (region) on magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral blood flow single-photon emission computed tomography were common in all patients, suggesting that the findings may be characteristic of human herpesvirus 6 encephalopathy.
