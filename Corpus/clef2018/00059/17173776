Evaluation of efficacy and clinical impact of FDG-PET on patients with suspicion of recurrent cutaneous melanoma. To evaluate the efficacy and clinical impact of positron emission tomography with 18F-FDG (FDG-PET) in patients with suspected recurrent melanoma.We studied 105 patients with melanoma and suspicion of recurrent melanoma by clinical symptoms in 38 cases or equivocal/positives morphological tests (TC, MR, US) in 77 cases. In all patients a whole body scan was performed with FDG-PET (ECAT HR +) after an intravenous injection of 444-518 MBq of 18F-FDG, in normoglucemia conditions, and previous administration of muscular relaxant, hydration and diuretic. Images were evaluated by 2 dxpert nuclear physicians and were analysed qualitatively and semiquantitatively. In 48 cases the results were confirmed by histology and clinical evolution (follow-up period >12 months) and imaging tests in 57 cases.Prevalence of recurrent melanoma was 63.8 %. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of FDG-PET was 97 %, 97.2 %, 98.5 %, 82 % y 94.7 % respectively. FDG-PET had led to a management change in 48 cases (38 %).FDG-PET has high clinical impact in patients with suspicion of recurrent melanoma, and should be incorporated in the diagnosis protocols, before making therapeutic decision.
