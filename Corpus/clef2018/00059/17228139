The imaging of pancreatic exocrine solid tumors: the role of computed tomography and positron emission tomography. The only potentially radical treatment for pancreatic cancer is the removal of the tumor which can be performed by total or subtotal surgical resection of the pancreas this is possible in the early stages of the disease when the tumor is confined to the pancreatic gland without metastasis to the liver, lymph nodes and/or the peritoneum, or involvement of the vascular system such as the celiac trunk and its branches and the superior mesenteric artery. In this paper, we describe the accuracy of computed tomography and positron emission tomography in the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic cancer.
