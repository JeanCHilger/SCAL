Quantitative evaluation of 2-deoxy-2[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose-positron emission tomography imaging on the woodchuck model of hepatocellular carcinoma with histological correlation. The Eastern woodchuck (Marmota monax) is considered as a naturally occurring animal model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The performance of 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) for imaging HCC on the woodchuck using Positron emission tomography (PET) was investigated in this study.Dynamic FDG-PET scans were performed on five woodchucks with HCC and one healthy woodchuck before removal and processing of the liver tissues for histology. The parameters of a two-tissue compartment model with dual input were estimated using weighted least squares (WLS).Ten HCCs were confirmed histologically. Six HCCs had a tumor-to-liver standardized uptake value (SUV) ratio < or =1.15, a k (4) / k (3) ratio similar to that in hepatic tissues and were well-differentiated. Four HCCs had a tumor-to-liver SUV ratio >1.15, a lower k (4) / k (3) ratio than the hepatic tissues and were moderately differentiated.Increased FDG uptake was observed in HCCs that were the least differentiated and correlated with a lower k (4) / k (3) ratio.
