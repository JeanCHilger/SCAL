18F-FDG metabolism in a rat model of chronic infarction: a 17-sector semiquantitative analysis. Strategies to establish the functional benefit of cell therapy in cardiac regeneration and the potential mechanism are needed.Development of a semi-quantitative method for non invasive assessment of cardiac viability and function in a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI) based on the use of microPET.Ten rats were subjected to myocardial imaging 2, 7, 14, 30, 60 and 90 days after left coronary artery ligation. Intravenous 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-2-D-glucose (18F-FDG) was administered and regional 18F activity concentrations per unit area were measured in 17 regions of interest (ROIs) drawn on cardiac polar maps. By comparing the differences in 18F uptake between baseline and each of the follow up time points, parametric polar maps of statistical significance (PPMSS) were calculated. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was blindly assessed echocardiographically. All animals were sacrificed for histopathological analysis after 90 days.The diagnostic quality of 18F-FDG microPET images was excellent. PPMSS demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in 18F concentrations as early as 48 hours after MI in 4 of the 17 ROIs (segments 7, 13, 16 and 17 p < 0.05) that persisted throughout the study. Semiquantitative analysis of 18F-FDG uptake correlated with echocardiographic decrease in LVEF (p < 0.001).The use of PPMSS based on 18F-FDG-microPET provides valuable semi-quantitative information of heart glucose metabolism allowing for non-invasive follow up thus representing a useful strategy for assessment of novel therapies in cardiac regeneration.
