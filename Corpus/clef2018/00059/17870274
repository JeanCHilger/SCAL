Anatomo-metabolic characteristics of atelectasis in F-18 FDG-PET/CT imaging. To evaluate the structural and metabolic characteristics of atelectasis in FDG-PET/CT.Twenty one consecutive patients (13 males, 8 females, median age 67 years) with CT features of atelectasis, undergoing PET/CT imaging for preoperative staging of histologically proven malignancies (20 lung cancer and 1 ovarian cancer metastasis to lung), were included in the study.Hounsfield units of atelectasis (-383.58+/-189, range -631 to 82) were significantly higher than in normal lung (-756+/-67.46, range -839 to -555 P=0.0001), and lower than in malignant tissue (35+/-19, range 4-77There is a positive relationship between the density of collapsed lung and the intensity of FDG uptake. FDG uptake in atelectasis is higher than in normal lung, and generally lower than in tumor tissue.
