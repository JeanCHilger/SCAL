The estimation of the goiter by means of ultrasonography and scintigraphy (SPECT) with using 131I. Ultrasonography (US) and scintigraphy (SPECT) are used to evaluate the volume of thyroid glands. An accurate estimation of the thyroid volume, among other factors, is necessary to calculate the suitable radioactive iodine dose, which determines the success of the therapy. The aim of the study was to estimate the volume of the goiter by means of US and (131)I-SPECT.A group of 80 patients with a thyroid disorder in their past medical history was examined. Patients were divided into two groups. The group A contained 50 patients (39 females, 11 males) with a goiter, where the volume of the thyroid was evaluated with the use of US and (131)I-SPECT. The group B contained 30 patients (21 females, 9 males) with a normal volume of the thyroid gland shown by US and (131)I-SPECT. US of the thyroid gland was made by means of an ALOKA SSD 500 device, with the linear head 7.5 MHz frequency. (131)I-SPECT was made by means of a one head gammacamera Diacam with a high energy collimator.In the group A, the average volume of the goiter was 44.55 ml in US and 49.67 ml in SPECT (p<0.001). In control group B the average volumes of the thyroid gland were respectively 13.83 ml vs. 16.19 ml (p<0.001).The results of the thyroid volume measurement was dependent on the method used in both the investigated and control groups.
