Semiautomated radiosynthesis and biological evaluation of [18F]FEAU: a novel PET imaging agent for HSV1-tk/sr39tk reporter gene expression. 2'-deoxy-2'-[(18)F]fluoro-5-ethyl-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil ([(18)F]FEAU) is a promising radiolabeled nucleoside designed to monitor Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) reporter gene expression with positron emission tomography (PET). However, the challenging radiosynthesis creates problems for being able to provide [(18)F]FEAU routinely. We have developed a routine method using a commercial GE TRACERlab FX-FN radiosynthesis module with customized equipment to provide [(18)F]FEAU. All radiochemical yields are decay corrected to end-of-bombardment and reported as means +/- SD. Radiofluorination (33 +/- 8% n = 4), bromination (85 +/- 8%
