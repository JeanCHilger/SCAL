The impact of early lifestyle factors on wheezing and asthma in Austrian preschool children. This study investigated the influence of early lifestyle factors on the prevalence of asthma and wheezing in preschool children in Tyrol, Austria.A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was performed in 1761 preschool children to obtain information on wheezing and asthma in the light of early lifestyle factors.Factors independently associated with an increased risk for wheezing in the past 12 months included high parental education (OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.1) and parental hay fever (OR: 1.5, 95%CI: 1.1-2.2). Risk factors for doctor-diagnosed asthma (DDA) were early pet contact (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1-4.8) and parental asthma (OR: 3.0, 95%CI: 1.0-9.1), whereas breastfeeding decreased the risk (OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.2-1.0). Boiling the pacifier/sucker daily increased the risk for wheezing in the past 12 months (OR: 1.4, 95%CI: 1.0-2.0) and revealed a tendency towards DDA (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 0.9-4.0).In preschool children, we established an independent association between wheezing in the past 12 months, DDA and boiling frequency of the pacifier/bottle sucker during infancy. The impact of pacifier boiling frequency on atopic diseases on the basis of the hygiene hypothesis needs further investigation.
