The characteristics of EEC PET instrumentation. As a result of a Guide-Questionnaire distributed among all European PET centers an inventory of the European PET instrumentation has become available in a data base. An overview and analysis of the European PET equipment, cyclotrons, scanners and software, together with some global information on the different PET programs is presented in the paper. The data gathered in this data base represents the situation on PET Instrumentation in the EEC as it was in the middle of 1990.
