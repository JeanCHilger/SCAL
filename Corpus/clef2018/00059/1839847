Standards for performance measurements of PET scanners: evaluation with the UGM PENN-PET 240H scanner. A standard set of performance measurements is proposed for use with positron emission tomographs. This set of measurements has been developed by the Computer and Instrumentation Council of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and the National Electrical Manufacturers Associations. These measurements are discussed and compared to the set of standard measurements being proposed by the Instrumentation Task Group of the European Economic Community Concerted Action of Cellular Regeneration and Degeneration. The performance of the PENN-PET 240H scanner from UGM Medical Systems is tested with this set of measurements. The PENN-PET scanner consists of six continuous position-sensitive NaI(T1) detectors, which results in a 50 cm transverse field-of-view and a 12.8 cm axial field-of-view. The fine spatial sampling in the axial direction allows the data to be sorted into as many as 64 transverse planes, each 2 mm thick. A large axial acceptance angle, without inter-plane septa, results in a high sensitivity, with a low scatter and randoms fraction, due to the use of a narrow photopeak energy window. This paper emphasizes those performance measurements which illustrate the special characteristics of a volume imaging scanner, compared to a more traditional multi-ring scanner.
