Postoperative follow-up of gastric adenocarcinoma with neoplastic markers and 18-FDG-PET/TC. The usefulness of tumour markers CEA, CA19.9 and CA72.4 in association with FDG-PET/TC were prospectively evaluated in the post-operative follow-up of gastric cancer patients.Fifty one consecutive patients were enrolled in a follow-up programme entailing with periodical clinical evaluations, instrumental examinations and tumour markers assay FDG-PET/TC was performed only in cases of suspected recurrence.Sensitivity of CEA, CA19.9 e CA72.4 during the follow-up period was respectively: 16%, 33.3% e 50%. Overall sensitivity was 66.6%. Specificity was 100% for CEA, 93.3% for CA19.9, 100% for CA72.4, with an overall specificity of 96.2%. FDG-PET/TC had a sensitivity of 100%.Tumour markers in association with FDG-PET/TC allow an early identification of recurrences after surgery, with the advantage to start chemotherapy or surgical protocols before the tumour has reached an advanced stage.
