Ictal single photon emission computed tomography in seizures induced by eye closure. Ictal single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) studies were performed on a 12 year old child with reflex seizures induced by eye closure. EEGs had shown generalised polyspike waves during eye closure. A magnetic resonance head scan was normal. There was no photosensitive induction of the seizure. Comparison between ideal and post treatment (ethosuximide) interictal SPECT revealed increased ictal perfusion in the basal ganglis, lateral frontal region and superior temporal lobe in the left hemisphere. It is suggested that the reflex epilepsy in this case was triggered by sensory afferents from the orbicularis oculi and mediated via the thalamus.
