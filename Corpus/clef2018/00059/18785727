In vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with an alphavbeta6 specific peptide radiolabeled using 18F-"click" chemistry: evaluation and comparison with the corresponding 4-[18F]fluorobenzoyl- and 2-[18F]fluoropropionyl-peptides. Numerous radiolabeled peptides have been utilized for in vivo imaging of a variety of cell surface receptors. For applications in PET using [(18)F]fluorine, peptides are radiolabeled via a prosthetic group approach. We previously developed solution-phase (18)F-"click" radiolabeling and solid-phase radiolabeling using 4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoic and 2-[(18)F]fluoropropionic acids. Here we compare the three different radiolabeling approaches and report the effects on PET imaging and pharmacokinetics. The prosthetic groups did have an effect metabolites with significantly different polarities were observed.
