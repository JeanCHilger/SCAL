Imaging of gynecologic malignancies with FDG PET-CT: case examples, physiologic activity, and pitfalls. The utilization of 2-[fluorine 18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in combination with computed tomography (CT) in the assessment of gynecologic malignancies has been rapidly growing in recent years however, its role in clinical practice has yet to be established. A number of pitfalls are commonly encountered, including normal physiologic activity in bowel loops and blood vessels, or focal retained activity in ureters and urinary bladder. Increased uptake has also been reported in many benign pelvic processes and in premenopausal patients
