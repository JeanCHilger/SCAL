Differential visually-induced gamma-oscillations in human cerebral cortex. Using intracranial electrocorticography, we determined how cortical gamma-oscillations (50-150 Hz) were induced by different visual tasks in nine children with focal epilepsy. In all children, full-field stroboscopic flash-stimuli induced gamma-augmentation in the anterior-medial occipital cortex (starting on average at 31 ms after stimulus presentation) and subsequently in the lateral-polar occipital cortex minimal gamma-augmentation was noted in the inferior occipital-temporal cortex
