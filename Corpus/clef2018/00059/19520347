Comparison of positron emission tomography measurement of adenosine-stimulated absolute myocardial blood flow versus relative myocardial tracer content for physiological assessment of coronary artery stenosis severity and location. This study tests the hypothesis that absolute measurement of adenosine (Ado)-stimulated myocardial blood flow (MBFado) is superior to measurement of relative tracer uptake for identification of hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease (CAD).Positron emission tomography measurement of absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) ((13)N-ammonia) with Ado has the capability to more accurately assess hemodynamic severity of CAD than measurement of relative tracer content (TC) (nCi/ml) during Ado, which by definition depends on at least 1 normal zone to which others are compared.A total of 27 patients (20 male, 58 +/- 11 years, mean +/- SD) with known or suspected CAD and 21 normal subjects (13 male, 38 +/- 10 years) were studied. Parametric (K1) MBF images and TC sum images were analyzed. A stenosis > or =70% defined significant CAD. The receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis area under the curve (AUC) compared MBF and TC results. Cut-point analysis for sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy showed the best MBF criteria for CAD as MBFado <1.85 ml/min/g and the best TC as <70% maximum. The myocardial blood flow reserve ratio (MBFR) (optimal <2.0x) also was studied.The ROC analysis of PET parameters showed that MBFado was superior to <70% maximum uptake for CAD detection (n = 144 vessels AUC 0.900 vs. 0.690, respectively, p < 0.0001) and was marginally greater than MBFR (0.856Measurement of Ado-stimulated absolute MBF is superior to relative measurement of myocardial tracer retention for identification of CAD and can be accomplished with a single MBFado measurement.
