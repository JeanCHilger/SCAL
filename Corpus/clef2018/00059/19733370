Identification, recombinant expression, and biochemical characterization of a flavonol 3-O-glucosyltransferase clone from Citrus paradisi. Glucosylation is a predominant flavonoid modification reaction affecting the solubility, stability, and subsequent bioavailability of these metabolites. Flavonoid glycosides affect taste characteristics in citrus making the associated glucosyltransferases particularly interesting targets for biotechnology applications in these species. In this work, a Citrus paradisi glucosyltransferase gene was identified, cloned, and introduced into the pET recombinant protein expression system utilizing primers designed against a predicted flavonoid glucosyltransferase gene (AY519364) from Citrus sinensis. The encoded C. paradisi protein is 51.2 kDa with a predicted pI of 6.27 and is 96% identical to the C. sinensis homologue. A number of compounds from various flavonoid subclasses were tested, and the enzyme glucosylated only the flavonol aglycones quercetin (K(m)(app)=67 microM V(max)=20.45 pKat/microg), kaempferol (K(m)(app)=12 microM
