Regulation of pet foods in the United States. In the United States, pet foods (including treats, edible chews, and supplements) are subject to regulation at both federal and state levels. Products found to be adulterated or misbranded are subject to enforcement action. Veterinarians play a key role in helping ensure pet food safety by reporting possible adverse effects to authorities in a timely manner.
