Non-invasive assessment and clinical strategy of stable coronary artery disease by magnetic resonance imaging, multislice computed tomography and myocardial perfusion SPECT. Coronary multislice computed tomography (MSCT) angiography and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) have emerged as new diagnostic techniques that allow direct visualization of the coronary artery. These new modalities have both advantages and disadvantages concerning radiation exposure, the use of contrast medium, ability of visualizing heavily calcified artery lumens, and spatial and temporal resolution. However, these modalities only provide anatomical information of the coronary artery. Functional assessment of the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) is essential for the management of patients with known or suspected CAD in practical clinical settings. Myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography is thought to be the most suitable diagnostic procedure for the determination of therapeutic strategy when coronary MSCT and MRA show significant and also insignificant coronary artery lesions.
