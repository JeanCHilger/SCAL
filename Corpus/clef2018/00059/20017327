CT guided radio frequency ablation as a treatment of pelvis tumor. To explore the clinical value of CT guided radio frequency ablation in the treatment of pelvis tumor.11 males and 8 females ranging from 25 to 49 years old (average 37) were enrolled in this study, all the 19 patients were suffering from pelvis tumor including giant cell tumor of bone (2/19), Ewing's sarcoma (2/19), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (3/19) and metastatic diseases (12/19). The average diameter of the lesions were 6.2 cm. The predominant clinical symptom of the patients was pain in the local region. All the patients were treated by CT guided radio frequency ablation. Single pole or multiple poles radio frequency ablation device was used according to the characteristics of the tumor tissue. Time of therapy was 5-15 min. Superposition was performed if necessary.All the patients received PET-CT scan or enhanced CT scan 1 month after the treatment, CR, PR was seen in 10 and 7 cases respectively. Total pain relief was seen in 10 patients, partial pain relief was seen in 8 patients, and gently pain relief was seen in 1 patient.CT guided CT guided radio frequency ablation is an effective methods in the treatment of pelvis tumor.
