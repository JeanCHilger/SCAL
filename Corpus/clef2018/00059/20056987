Influence of the preceding dwell time on the peritoneal equilibration test with 3.86% glucose solution in automated peritoneal dialysis. The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) using 3.86% glucose solution is preceded by a long dwell with 3.86% glucose solution. A point of concern in patients treated with automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) is the influence of the preceding short nightly dwells on the results of a standardized PET. The aim of the study was to compare net ultrafiltration, small solute transport, sodium sieving, and solute transport type between a PET preceded by a long night dwell and one preceded by short (APD) dwells.13 stable APD patients (mean age 60 +/- 15 years mean duration of peritoneal dialysis 31 +/- 15 months) underwent 2 PETs: 1 preceded by short nightly dwells (PET A) and 1 preceded by a long night dwell (PET B).Both PETs were performed within a mean period of 8 (range 5 - 11) days. Mean total ultrafiltration of PET A was 626 +/- 218 mL and PET B was 644 +/- 223 mL (NS). The 4-hour results of both tests for dialysate-to-plasma (D/P) ratios of creatinine and urea, D(t)/D(0) ratios of glucose, and the dip in D/P sodium (sodium sieving) were similar. Classification of transport categories was identical for 10 of 13 patients.In APD, the preceding dwell time of a 3.86% glucose PET does not influence fluid transport, solute transport, or transport type.
