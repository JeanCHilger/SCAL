Safety of regadenoson in patients with end-stage renal disease. Regadenoson is a selective A(2A) receptor agonist that was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for vasodilator stress myocardial perfusion imaging. Because the drug is cleared by renal excretion, its safety in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) needs to be determined. We studied 277 consecutive patients with ESRD who had undergone regadenoson stress gated single photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging and compared their side effect profile and safety outcome to those of 134 patients with normal kidney function. The ESRD group included 164 men (59%) and the control group included 73 men (54% p = NS). The patients with ESRD were younger than the controls (52 +/- 11 years vs 61 +/- 12 years
