The influence of the time activity variation on dynamic SPECT images in camera based SPECT. Image quality of dynamic single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using a rotating gamma camera is dependent on the time activity variation of the tracer such as accumulation and excretion in the object's organ. Especially at the early time after injection of radionuclide, artifacts may occur strongly in the SPECT images. Simulated and experimental projection data of line sources and Jaszczak phantom were altered by sequentially weighting the projections with a function that varied linearly with time. With a variation of object activity given by linearly decaying functions, the main effect observed on the SPECT images obtained from simulated line sources was an elliptical deformation on the object. If the changing rate (R (t + 1)-R(t))/R(t) x 100 remained within 20% during acquisition, this deformation of SPECT images of line sources was not noticeable visually and resolution (FWHM) of line sources scarcely was degraded. In renal dynamic SPECT study using 99mTc-DTPA, the image quality of the first scan (30 sec) was considerably degraded. However, the changing rates after the third scan were less than 20% on the mean of 10 kidneys and the image quality was not noticeable visually.
