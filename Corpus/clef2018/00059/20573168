Photoallergic contact dermatitis from benzydamine presenting mainly as lip dermatitis. Benzydamine, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in use for more than four decades, has been reported to cause photosensitivity.To study the results of photopatch testing to benzydamine and the clinical features of the dermatitis during a 3-year period (2006-2008).During this period, 74 patients with photodermatoses were photopatch tested with an extended baseline series of allergens including benzydamine and in suspicious cases, with drugs that contain it. Test sites were irradiated on D2 with 5 J/cm(2) and readings were performed on D2 and D4.Ten patients (six females/four males), aged 21-84 years (mean 64.9) had a positive photopatch test to benzydamine [1-5% petrolatum (pet.) from Bial-Aristegui] and to drugs that contain it (Tantum verde oral solution and Momen gel). Nine patients had lower lip cheilitis and one lichenified eczema on photo-exposed sites.Photosensitivity from both topical and systemic benzydamine has been occasionally described, mainly in southern Spain. Despite its widespread use and its known photosensitizing capacity, photoallergic contact dermatitis from benzydamine is probably underdiagnosed as the clinical presentation of mainly the lip and chin is not typical of photoallergic contact dermatitis and benzydamine is not part of most photoallergen series.
