. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is a mitochondrial enzyme that inactivates dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin in the brain (1, 2). Two isoforms (A and B) of the enzyme have been identified. MAO-A preferentially oxidizes serotonin and noradrenaline, whereas MAO-B preferentially oxidizes phenethylamine. Dopamine is a substrate for both enzymes. MAO-A is predominately associated with depression and anxiety disorders, whereas MAO-B is predominately associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), as indicated by studies with specific MAO isoform inhibitors (3-5).
