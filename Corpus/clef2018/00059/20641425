 Angiogenesis is a process of development and growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels. Tumor growth depends on the formation of new blood vessels via this process. Tumor angiogenesis is important in the carcinogenesis, growth and progression of human solid tumors. Fibronectin (FN) are a widely distributed family of universal cell-adhesion molecules (1). FN is a polymorphic glycoprotein of ~2500 amino acids and has a high molecular mass of 250âˆ’280 kDa. FN occurs in soluble form in plasma and other body fluids and in insoluble form in the extracellular matrixes (2, 3). The splice variant ED-B FN is highly expressed during angiogenesis in vasculatures of tumor, normal and fetal tissues (4). In contrast, normal adult tissues do not express ED-B FN. High levels of ED-B FN expression have been found in vasculatures of breast, colorectal, and non-small cell lung tumors (1, 5-7). Angiogenesis is essential for the growth of solid tumors and their metastases. Imaging angiogenesis may be useful for monitoring angiogenic treatments of tumors and cardiovascular diseases (8-10). A molecular probe that targets ED-B FN can be both an early tumor marker and a tool to monitor the success of antiangiogenic cancer therapy.
