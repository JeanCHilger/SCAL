RGD-cyclam conjugate: synthesis and potential application for positron emission tomography. Cyclam and DOTA-containing positron emission tomography radiotracers were prepared by using a modular chemical strategy based on peptide synthesis and chemoselective ligations. These molecules encompass two functional domains, one a tumour 'homing' domain and the other a chelating ligand for copper allowing nuclear imaging of tumours.
