Diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound and 18-F-FDG PET or PET/CT for patients with suspected recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracies of ultrasound (US) and 18-F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET) or PET/computed tomography (CT) for detecting recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) after total thyroidectomy. Our study enrolled 76 postoperative patients who underwent both neck US and PET because of the suspicion of recurrence. The results of US and PET were correlated with the histopathology, the radioactive iodine whole body scan (WBS) or the clinical follow-up results. Among them, 53 patients had recurrent disease (local recurrence, 42 distant metastasis, 3
