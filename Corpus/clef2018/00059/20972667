The relationship between psychiatry and neurology. Neurology and psychiatry deal with diseases of the (central) nervous system. Historically neurological disorders are related to a proven organic basis, whereas psychiatric disorders are mainly defined by the phenomenology and course of the symptoms. Neuroscientific research methods such as molecular genetics, neurochemistry, neurophysiology, neuropathology, functional (SPECT, PET, fMRI) or structural (MRI) imaging have dramatically increased our knowledge of psychiatric and neurological disorders in the last 20 years. Accordingly diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the long-term prognosis of numerous diseases in both disciplines have substantially improved (i.e. pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, functional neurosurgery). For major brain disorders - such as dementia of the Alzheimer type - close collaboration between both disciplines is developing in diagnosis, therapy and care. Due to common neurobiological research topics, educational programs, medical training and the challenges of assuring appropriate care to patients with brain disorders, further cooperation between neurology and psychiatry is expected and necessary.
