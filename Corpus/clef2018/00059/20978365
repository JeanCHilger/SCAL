Localization of medullary thyroid carcinoma after surgery using (11)C-methionine PET/CT: comparison with (18)F-FDG PET/CT. Tumor localization is difficult in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) that have persistent hypercalcitoninemia after thyroidectomy. In this study, the (11)C-methionine positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was compared with the (18)F-FDG PET/CT for diagnostic sensitivity in detecting residual or metastatic disease. (11)C-methionine PET/CT and (18)F-FDG PET/CT were performed on 16 consecutive patients with MTC that had persistent hypercalcitoninemia after surgery in this prospective, single-center study. Patient- and lesion-based analyses were performed using a composite reference standard which was the sum of the lesions confirmed by all combined modalities, including neck ultrasonography (US) with or without fine needle aspiration cytology, CT, bone scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and surgery. By patient-based analysis, the sensitivities of (11)C-methionine PET/CT and (18)F-FDG PET/CT were both 63%. By lesion-based analysis, the sensitivity of (11)C-methionine PET/CT was similar to (18)F-FDG PET/CT (73% vs. 80%). Excluding hepatic lesions, which could not be detected because of physiological uptake of methionine by the liver, the sensitivity of (11)C-methionine PET/CT was better than (18)F-FDG PET/CT especially for detecting cervical lymph node lesions however, it was not superior to US. All patients with serum calcitonin levels â‰¥370 pg/mL showed uptake by (11)C-methionine PET/CT and (18)F-FDG PET/CT. This preliminary data showed that despite its similar sensitivity to (18)F-FDG PET/CT for detecting residual or metastatic MTC, (11)C-methionine PET/CT provided minimal additional information compared to combined (18)F-FDG PET/CT and neck US.
