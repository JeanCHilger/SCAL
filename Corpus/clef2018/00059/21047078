Gallium(III) complexes of DOTA and DOTA-monoamide: kinetic and thermodynamic studies. Given the practical advantages of the (68)Ga isotope in positron emission tomography applications, gallium complexes are gaining increasing importance in biomedical imaging. However, the strong tendency of Ga(3+) to hydrolyze and the slow formation and very high stability of macrocyclic complexes altogether render Ga(3+) coordination chemistry difficult and explain why stability and kinetic data on Ga(3+) complexes are rather scarce. Here we report solution and solid-state studies of Ga(3+) complexes formed with the macrocyclic ligand 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid, (DOTA)(4-), and its mono(n-butylamide) derivative, (DO3AM(Bu))(3-). Thermodynamic stability constants, log K(GaDOTA) = 26.05 and log K(GaDO3AM(Bu)) = 24.64, were determined by out-of-cell pH-potentiometric titrations. Due to the very slow formation and dissociation of the complexes, equilibration times of up to ∼4 weeks were necessary. The kinetics of complex dissociation were followed by (71)Ga NMR under both acidic and alkaline conditions. The GaDOTA complex is significantly more inert (τ(1/2) ∼12.2 d at pH = 0 and τ(1/2) ∼6.2 h at pH = 10) than the GaDO3AM(Bu) analogue (τ(1/2) ∼2.7 d at pH = 0 and τ(1/2) ∼0.7 h at pH = 10). Nevertheless, the kinetic inertness of both chelates is extremely high and approves the application of Ga(3+) complexes of such DOTA-like ligands in molecular imaging. The solid-state structure of the GaDOTA complex, crystallized from a strongly acidic solution (pH < 1), evidenced a diprotonated form with protons localized on the free carboxylate pendants.
