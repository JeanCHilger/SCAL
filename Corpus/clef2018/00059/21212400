Association of adiponectin, resistin, and vascular inflammation: analysis with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Adiponectin and resistin are adipokines that are linked to obesity, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography is a promising imaging technique that can be used to evaluate vascular inflammation.We measured adiponectin and resistin levels, as well as traditional cardiovascular risk factors, in 60 obese subjects and 60 nonobese controls. In addition, we compared carotid intima-media thickness and target-to-background ratio (TBR) measured using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography. The mean TBR values were significantly higher in the obese group compared with normal subjects, although their mean carotid intima-media thickness levels were not significantly different. Serum adiponectin levels showed a significant negative correlation with mean TBR values (r = -0.215, P = 0.020), whereas resistin levels were positively correlated with mean TBR values (r = 0.214, P = 0.021). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that mean TBR values were independently associated with body mass index, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and resistin levels (R(2) = 0.308).Adiponectin and resistin may be useful as biomarkers to reflect vascular inflammation. In particular, resistin levels were independently associated with vascular inflammation even after adjusting for other cardiovascular risk factors.
