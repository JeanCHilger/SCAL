Comparison of 123I-MIBG SPECT-CT and 18F-DOPA PET-CT in the evaluation of patients with known or suspected recurrent paraganglioma. Detection of recurrent disease is essential for treatment planning in patients with paraganglioma. The aim of this study was to compare 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) scintigraphy [whole-body and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) computed tomography (CT) scanning] and fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography CT (18F-DOPA PET-CT) in the re-staging of patients with known or suspected recurrent paraganglioma.Twelve patients with known or suspected recurrent paraganglioma after initial surgery were included in the study. 18F-DOPA PET-CT and 123I-MIBG scintigraphy (whole-body and SPECT-CT scanning) were performed in all patients the results were compared on a per patient and a per lesion basis. Cytohistology (when available) and a combination of laboratory and imaging studies and follow-up were used as reference standardAll patients had positive 18F-DOPA studies (100% sensitivity) whereas nine had positive 123I-MIBG studies (75% sensitivity P=not significant). 18F-DOPA detected 98% of lesions, whereas 38% were detected with 123I-MIBG (P=0.04). 18F-DOPA showed more lesions than 123I-MIBG in eight patientsThese data support the superiority of 18F-DOPA PET-CT over 123I-MIBG scintigraphy to assess disease extension in patients with recurrent paraganglioma however, in cases with inoperable disease, 123I-MIBG maintains a unique role in allowing the selection of patients suitable for 123I-MIBG therapy.
