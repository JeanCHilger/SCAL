Use of laparoscopy as an alternative to computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans for the detection of recurrence in patients with gastric cancer: a pilot study. This study aimed to evaluate laparoscopy as a diagnostic method for detecting recurrence in patients with advanced gastric cancer.Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed for 12 patients with insufficient evidence of intraabdominal gastric cancer recurrence by computed tomography or positron emission tomography. By comparing laparoscopic observations with conventional radiologic results, the diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy was assessed.In 11 (92%) of 12 cases of recurrence not diagnosed by imaging studies, laparoscopic examination confirmed the case as a recurrence. Using diagnostic laparoscopy, retroperitoneal lymph node recurrence was confirmed in two patients, peritoneal seeding nodules in five patients, and recurrent masses invading the mesocolon in two patients. Two patients had no definitive recurrence grossly but were confirmed as recurrence cases by washing cytology during the laparoscopic procedure. One patient had a duodenal stump recurrence. No patients experienced operation-related morbidity.Laparoscopy is a safe and feasible method for detecting recurrence with acceptable accuracy. This approach provides more accurate information than conventional imaging methods.
