Clinical significance of primary lesion FDG uptake for choice between oesophagectomy and endoscopic submucosal dissection for resectable oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas. To correlate primary oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (18)F-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake with pathological factors and examine its significance regarding choice of therapy.We retrospectively examined the factors affecting visible and non-visible FDG uptake in 37 primary lesions in 32 oesophageal SCC patients who underwent PET/CT before oesophagectomy or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). We divided the lesions into pathological depth invasion ≥sm2 oesophagectomy (n = 18) and ≤sm1 ESD (n = 19) indicated groups and compared the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET with that of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) performed for 23 superficial lesions to discriminate between these groups.There were 17 visible and 20 non-visible lesions. The lesion visibility was significantly higher in the larger (≥40 mm), non-flat type, more deeply invaded, positive vascular invasion (P < 0.001 each), positive nodal metastasis (P = 0.04) and higher Glut-1 score (P = 0.005) tumour groups. When the visible and non-visible lesions indicated a need for oesophagectomy and ESD respectively, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of oesophagectomy were 94% (17/18), 100% (19/19) and 97% (36/37) and those of EUS were 75% (3/4), 79% (15/19) and 78% (18/23) respectively.Primary lesion FDG visibility can be one of the indicators for choosing between oesophagectomy and ESD for resectable oesophageal SCCs.
