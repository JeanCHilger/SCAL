Neuroimaging in child and adolescent psychiatry. Although less well studied in child and adolescent psychiatry than in adult psychiatry, brain imaging has significantly altered psychiatric research and practice. This review focuses on the modalities that are used to image the brain. These include structural imaging techniques of computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as functional imaging techniques of computed electroencephalography (CEEG), positron emission tomography (PET), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The technologies are reviewed, strengths and weaknesses of modalities discussed, and research progress reported.
