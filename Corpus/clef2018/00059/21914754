Association of heat production with 18F-FDG accumulation in murine brown adipose tissue after stress. Previous studies have demonstrated that cold stress results in increased accumulation of (18)F-FDG in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Although it has been assumed that this effect is associated with increased thermogenesis by BAT, direct measurements of this phenomenon have not been reported. In the current investigation, we evaluated the relationship between stimulation of (18)F-FDG accumulation in BAT by 3 stressors and heat production measured in vivo by thermal imaging. Male SKH-1 hairless mice were subjected to full-thickness thermal injury (30% of total body surface area), cold stress (4°C for 24 h), or cutaneous wounds. Groups of 6 animals with each treatment were kept fasting overnight and injected with (18)F-FDG. Sixty minutes after injection, the mice were sacrificed, and biodistribution was measured. Other groups of 6 animals subjected to the 3 stressors were studied by thermal imaging, and the difference in temperature between BAT and adjacent tissue was recorded (ΔT). Additional groups of 6 animals were studied by both thermal imaging and (18)F-FDG biodistribution in the same animals. Accumulation of (18)F-FDG in BAT was significantly (P < 0.0001) increased by all 3 treatments (burn, ∼5-fold cold, ∼15-fold
