Measurement of SUVmax plus ADCmin of the primary tumour is a predictor of prognosis in patients with cervical cancer. The objectives of this study were to determine if measurements of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) by positron emission tomography/computed tomography and minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCmin) by magnetic resonance imaging are correlated with the clinical characteristics and prognosis of primary cervical cancer.The correlations between biological parameters and prognosis and SUVmax and ADCmin of the primary tumour were determined in 66 patients with cervical cancer before radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy.There were significant correlations between SUVmax of the primary tumour and FIGO stage (p = 0.036), tumour maximum size (p = 0.018) and pelvic lymph node metastasis (p = 0.044). The median durations of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 16.1 and 19.2 months, respectively. The DFS and OS of patients exhibiting high SUVmax of the primary tumour were significantly lower than those of patients exhibiting low SUVmax of the primary tumour (p = 0.0171 and p = 0.0367). The OS of patients exhibiting low ADCmin of the primary tumour was significantly lower than that of patients exhibiting high ADCmin of the primary tumour (p = 0.0376). The DFS and OS of patients exhibiting high SUVmax together with low ADCmin of the primary tumour were significantly lower (p = 0.003 and p = 0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that high SUVmax together with low ADCmin of the primary tumour was an independent prognostic factor for both DFS (p = 0.0030) and OS (p = 0.0036).High SUVmax together with low ADCmin of the primary tumour is an important predictive factor for identifying patients with cervical cancer who have a poor prognosis.
