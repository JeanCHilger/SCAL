 Infections are the most common cause of patient morbidity in hospitals, and noninvasive imaging modalities such as X-ray/computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging that are used to detect an infected site(s) in a patient are not able to distinguish between inflammation, tumors, and microbial infections (1). The early detection of infection in a patient can help healthcare providers devise a suitable treatment plan to control and monitor recovery from the disease.
