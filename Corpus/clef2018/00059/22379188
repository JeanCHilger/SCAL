FDG-PET predicts survival in recurrent high-grade gliomas treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan. Prognosis of recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG) is poor, although bevacizumab has been documented in that context. This study aimed to determine the independent prognostic value of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of recurrent HGG after combined treatment with bevacizumab and irinotecan, compared with other documented prognostic variables. Twenty-five adult patients with histologically proven HGG were included at recurrence. Brain FDG-PET imaging was performed within 6 weeks of starting chemotherapy with bevacizumab and irinotecan. Response based on MRI was assessed every 2 months according to revised assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. Median PFS and OS were 4 months (range, 0.9-10.4 months) and 7.2 months (range, 1.2-41.7 months), respectively. At 6 months, PFS and OS rate were 16.0% and 72.0%. FDG uptake was the most powerful predictor of both PFS and OS, using either univariate or multivariate analysis, among all variables tested: histological grade, Karnofsky performance status, steroid intake, and number of previous treatments. Moreover, FDG uptake was also prognostic of response to bevacizumab-based therapy. This study provides the first evidence that pretreatment FDG-PET can serve as an imaging biomarker in recurrent HGG for predicting survival following anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab.
