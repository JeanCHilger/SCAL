Risk for recurrence of preeclampsia and outcome of subsequent pregnancy in women with preeclampsia in their first pregnancy. To assess subsequent pregnancy outcome and to identify risk factors for recurrence of preeclampsia (PET) in women with PET in their first pregnancy.A retrospective cohort study of all nulliparous women diagnosed with PET during the years 1996-2008 (PET group, N = 600). Outcome of subsequent pregnancy was compared with a control group of nulliparous women without PET matched by maternal age in a 3:1 ratio (N = 1800).Subsequent pregnancies in the PET group were characterized by a higher rate of preterm delivery at less than 37 and 34 weeks (15.2% vs. 5.7%, p < 0.001 and 3.8% vs. 0.8%, p < 0.001, respectively), placental abruption (1.7% vs. 0.2%, p = 0.004), IUGR (2.8% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.016), and PET (5.9% vs. 0.8%, p < 0.001). Risk factors for PET and adverse outcome in the subsequent pregnancy included: PET complicated by placental abruption in the index pregnancy (OR = 10.8, 95%-CI = 1.8-34.6), PET requiring delivery prior to 34 weeks in the index pregnancy (OR = 6.5, 95%-CI = 1.6-22.5), chronic hypertension (OR = 5.3, 95%-CI = 1.9-12.7), and maternal age > 35 (OR = 4.3, 95%-CI = 1.2-20.5).PET in the first pregnancy is independently associated with an increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcome and recurrence of PET in the subsequent pregnancy in a manner that is related to the severity of PET in the first pregnancy.
