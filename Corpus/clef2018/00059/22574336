 Angiogenesis is an essential process in the development of new blood vessels in normal physiological states and in diseases (1, 2). Targeting of tumor vasculature is a promising strategy for tumor imaging and therapy because tumor growth and metastasis largely depend on angiogenesis (3, 4). A cyclic 9-mer peptide (CGNSNPKSC (GX1)) was initially identified as a recognition motif for binding to the human gastric tumor vasculature (5-7). GX1 has also been shown to bind to a variety of human cancer vasculatures. The molecular target of GX1 has not been identified however, GX1 inhibits endothelial cell proliferation
