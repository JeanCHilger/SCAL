Neuroimaging of voice hearing in non-psychotic individuals: a mini review. Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) or "voices" are a characteristic symptom of schizophrenia, but can also be observed in healthy individuals in the general population. As these non-psychotic individuals experience AVH in the absence of other psychiatric symptoms and medication-use they provide an excellent model to study AVH in isolation. Indeed a number of studies used this approach and investigated brain structure and function in non-psychotic individuals with AVH. These studies showed that increased sensitivity of auditory areas to auditory stimulation and aberrant connectivity of language production and perception areas is associated with AVH. This is in concordance with investigations that observed prominent activation of these areas during the state of AVH. Moreover, while effortful attention appears not to be related to AVH, individuals prone to hallucinate seem to have an enhanced attention bias to auditory stimuli which may stem from aberrant activation of the anterior cingulated regions. Furthermore, it was observed that decreased cerebral dominance for language and dopamine dysfunction, which are consistently found in schizophrenia, are most likely not specifically related to AVH as these abnormalities were absent in healthy voice hearers. Finally, specific aspects of AVH such as voluntary control may be related to the timing of the supplementary motor area and language areas in the experience of AVH.
