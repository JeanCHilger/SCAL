A new look at Crohn's disease:  novel imaging techniques. Imaging the gut provides information on Crohn's disease activity, identifies complications and provides insight into patient symptoms. Imaging can help direct therapy and can predict important patient outcomes. In a rapidly changing, technology-driven field, new imaging applications add novel insights that we are only beginning to appreciate. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in imaging as they are applied to the assessment of patients with Crohn's disease.In the past year, key literature describing cross-sectional imaging techniques, including computed tomography (CT) based imaging, specifically CT enterography (CTE) and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), transcutaneous ultrasound, and PET-based imaging, has emerged in the field of inflammatory bowel disease. MRI sequences that have been recently applied to Crohn's disease assessment, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetization transfer imaging (MTI), add important new insights. These new data highlight the current status of available imaging modalities and provide a glimpse into the future of our practice.CTE and MRE are our new standard imaging modalities for small bowel Crohn's disease. PET scanning is promising but currently only used routinely in centers with a strong research presence in this area. Ultrasound is emerging as a useful, potentially less costly, radiation-free technique. New MRI sequences offer future promise for effectively monitoring the natural history of Crohn's disease.
