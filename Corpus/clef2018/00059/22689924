Inhibition of poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase enhances the toxicity of 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine/topotecan combination therapy to cells and xenografts that express the noradrenaline transporter. Targeted radiotherapy using (131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-MIBG) has produced remissions in some neuroblastoma patients. We previously reported that combining (131)I-MIBG with the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan induced long-term DNA damage and supraadditive toxicity to noradrenaline transporter (NAT)-expressing cells and xenografts. This combination treatment is undergoing clinical evaluation. This present study investigated the potential of poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) inhibition, in vitro and in vivo, to further enhance (131)I-MIBG/topotecan efficacy.Combinations of topotecan and the PARP-1 inhibitor PJ34 were assessed for synergism in vitro by combination-index analysis in SK-N-BE(2c) (neuroblastoma) and UVW/NAT (NAT-transfected glioma) cells. Three treatment schedules were evaluated: topotecan administered 24 h before, 24 h after, or simultaneously with PJ34. Combinations of PJ34 and (131)I-MIBG and of PJ34 and (131)I-MIBG/topotecan were also assessed using similar scheduling. In vivo efficacy was measured by growth delay of tumor xenografts. We also assessed DNA damage by Î³H2A.X assay, cell cycle progression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and PARP-1 activity in treated cells.In vitro, only simultaneous administration of topotecan and PJ34 or PJ34 and (131)I-MIBG induced supraadditive toxicity in both cell lines. All scheduled combinations of PJ34 and (131)I-MIBG/topotecan induced supraadditive toxicity and increased DNA damage in SK-N-BE(2c) cells, but only simultaneous administration induced enhanced efficacy in UVW/NAT cells. The PJ34 and (131)I-MIBG/topotecan combination treatment induced G(2) arrest in all cell lines, regardless of the schedule of delivery. In vivo, simultaneous administration of PJ34 and (131)I-MIBG/topotecan significantly delayed the growth of SK-N-BE(2c) and UVW/NAT xenografts, compared with (131)I-MIBG/topotecan therapy.The antitumor efficacy of topotecan, (131)I-MIBG, and (131)I-MIBG/topotecan combination treatment was increased by PARP-1 inhibition in vitro and in vivo.
