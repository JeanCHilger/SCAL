Importance of SPECT/CT for resolving diseases of the jaw. Diseases of the jaw, such as osteomyelitis, condylar hyperactivity and tumors need adequate imaging to evaluate the extension and activity for therapy planning.Conventional planar scintigraphy, orthopantomography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used for the evaluation of jaw diseases.Single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) provides metabolic and morphologic information in one imaging step and is becoming increasingly more available in larger hospitals.The SPECT/CT is superior to planar scintigraphy alone, CT and orthopantomography in the evaluation of the extension and activity of osteomyelitis and jaw tumors.In our hospital SPECT/CT has replaced the other imaging modalities in the evaluation of osteomyelitis and condylar hyperactivity.If available SPECT/CT should be performed for the evaluation of osteomyelitis of the jaw.
