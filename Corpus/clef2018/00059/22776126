Effects of various anesthetic protocols on 18F-flurodeoxyglucose uptake into the brains and hearts of normal miniature pigs (Sus scrofa domestica). This study used positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) to evaluate the effects of 4 anesthetic protocols on 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) accumulation in the brains and hearts of miniature pigs (Sus scrofa domestica). The 18F-FDG standard uptake value was quantified by dividing the brain into 6 regions: cerebellum, brainstem, and frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Five (2 female and 3 male) clinically normal miniature pigs were premedicated with medetomidine (200 Î¼g/kg IM) after which the following 4 anesthetic protocols were administered by using a crossover design: 1) propofol (4 mg/kg IV)-isoflurane inhalation 2) propofol (4 mg/kg IV)
