Detection of coronary artery disease using automated quantitation of myocardial perfusion on single-photon emission computed tomography images from patients with angina pectoris without prior myocardial infarction. Whether or not automated scores obtained from myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging using software correlate with the visual interpretations by experts remains obscure.Eighty-seven consecutive patients with known or suspected angina pectoris underwent (201)thallium stress/rest SPECT followed by coronary angiography and the summed difference scores (SDS) were calculated using Heart Score View software. The SDS was substantially associated with coronary stenosis and accurately detected culprit lesions, because the diagnostic accuracy was comparable to that of expert visual evaluation.Automated scores obtained from myocardial SPECT can help detect coronary artery disease.
