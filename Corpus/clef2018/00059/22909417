EduGATE - basic examples for educative purpose using the GATE simulation platform. EduGATE is a collection of basic examples to introduce students to the fundamental physical aspects of medical imaging devices. It is based on the GATE platform, which has received a wide acceptance in the field of simulating medical imaging devices including SPECT, PET, CT and also applications in radiation therapy. GATE can be configured by commands, which are, for the sake of simplicity, listed in a collection of one or more macro files to set up phantoms, multiple types of sources, detection device, and acquisition parameters. The aim of the EduGATE is to use all these helpful features of GATE to provide insights into the physics of medical imaging by means of a collection of very basic and simple GATE macros in connection with analysis programs based on ROOT, a framework for data processing. A graphical user interface to define a configuration is also included.
