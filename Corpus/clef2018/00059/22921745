¹⁸F]FE@SNAP-A new PET tracer for the melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1): microfluidic and vessel-based approache. Changes in the expression of the melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) are involved in a variety of pathologies, especially obesity and anxiety disorders. To monitor these pathologies in-vivo positron emission tomography (PET) is a suitable method. After the successful radiosynthesis of [(11)C]SNAP-7941-the first PET-Tracer for the MCHR1, we aimed to synthesize its [(18)F]fluoroethylated analogue: [(18)F]FE@SNAP. Therefore, microfluidic and vessel-based approaches were tested. [(18)F]fluoroethylation was conducted via various [(18)F]fluoroalkylated synthons and direct [(18)F]fluorination. Only the direct [(18)F]fluorination of a tosylated precursor using a flow-through microreactor was successful, affording [(18)F]FE@SNAP in 44.3 ± 2.6%.
