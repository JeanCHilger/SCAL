Acetazolamide effect on cerebellar blood flow in crossed cerebral-cerebellar diaschisis. We studied the effect of acetazolamide on cerebellar blood flow in 11 stroke patients with large, unilateral cerebral hemispheric infarcts and no evidence of cerebellar infarction, but with cerebrocerebellar diaschisis of cerebral blood flow. Blood flow was determined with xenon-133 inhalation and dynamic single-photon emission computed tomography at rest and 20 minutes after the intravenous injection of 1.0 g acetazolamide. After acetazolamide, the mean +/- SD increases in blood flow in the affected and contralateral cerebellar hemispheres were 11.1 +/- 3.7 and 12.0 +/- 5.3 ml/100 g/min, respectively the difference between hemispheres was not significant. The absolute increase in cerebellar flow in these 11 patients was of the same magnitude as that in 12 healthy controls. We conclude that cerebellar vasoreactivity is intact in stroke patients with crossed cerebrocerebellar diaschisis of cerebral blood flow. Our results lend further support to the concept that reduced cerebellar blood flow is secondary to functional deactivation. Our patients were studied 2 weeks to 5 years after their stroke, indicating that this phenomenon may be persistent.
