Rats with mammary cancer treated with toremifene and interferon: morphometry and needle aspiration biopsy for determination of ATP and 14C-fluorodeoxyglucose content. The combined and separate action of the antiestrogen toremifene (TOR) and recombinant rat gamma interferon (RIF) was studied in rat mammary cancer induced by dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA). The content of ATP and 14C-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was also determined from fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB). RIF alone had no antitumor activity, when measured as the average number of new tumors appearing in RIF and control animals (2.4 vs 2.4 new tumors per animal), while TOR and TOR + RIF had a significant effect (1.2, P less than 0.05 and 0.6, P less than 0.01). Morphometrically, there was a significant decrease in the amount of epithelium in the tumors of the RIF + TOR animals (65% vs 82% in the controls, P less than 0.05) there was conversely an increase in the stromal component (25% vs 14%, NS). It appears that an increase of the stromal compartment is part of the healing process. The feasibility of the FNAB-technique was shown by the finding that there was a close correlation between FDG and ATP content in almost all the groups before and after treatment. Thus, FDG and ATP measure the same phenomenon, i.e., energy content. There was a large variation in the contents of ATP and FDG within and among the groups, which invalidated considerations regarding the predictive value of ATP and FDG content in tumors subject to treatment.
