131I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine in the treatment of metastatic neuroblastoma. Clinical, pharmacological and dosimetric aspect. Ten children with stage III or IV neuroblastoma that had either relapsed or was refractory were treated with [131I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) from 1984 to 1986. The total dose ranged from 4,365 to 21,900 MBq and was given in one to five courses. Two patients achieved a complete remission (CR), two, a partial remission (PR), and three, an arrest of the disease. Pharmacological studies showed that 93% of detectable radioactivity was attributable to MIBG at the beginning of the infusion. However, by the end of the infusion this had decreased to 88%. The terminal half-life of MIBG was 37.0 h, whereas that of non-MIBG-bound iodine was 71.6 h. Therefore, the radioactivity-time product of non-MIBG-bound 131I was much higher than that of MIBG. Dosimetric studies showed a mean level of absorbed radiation for the total body of 160 microGy/MBq, a liver irradiation of 540 microGy/MBq and a mean tumour radiation of 10,500 microGy/MBq.
