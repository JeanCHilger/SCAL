The role of antimyosin antibodies in acute myocardial infarction. Antimyosin is an Fab fragment of a monoclonal antibody that binds with human myosin exposed in myocytes irreversibly damaged by an ischemic event. Labeled with 111In, the antibody is taken up into acutely necrotic tissue and can be imaged by planar or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) techniques. A large, multicenter clinical trial has demonstrated a high degree of both sensitivity for detecting infarction and specificity for excluding a recent ischemic event in patients admitted with chest pain syndrome. No allergic reactions to antibody injection have occurred, nor have there been documented significant increases in human antimouse antibody titers postinjection. Due to relatively slow blood clearance, the optimal imaging time is 24 to 48 hours post-injection. Between 13% and 21% of 24-hour scans are nondiagnostic due to persistent blood pool activity. In two thirds of these patients, 48-hour scans confirm negative tracer uptake. Moderate to intense cardiac uptake occurs in greater than 80% of scans. Faint tracer uptake, which occurs in a small minority of patients, is associated with inferoposterior infarct location and an occluded infarct vessel. Potential clinical uses include both diagnostic and prognostic areas. A negative scan in a patient with chest pain syndrome and no ECG changes rules out a recent significant ischemic event. The extent of antimyosin uptake (infarct size), measured semiquantitatively from planar scans or quantitatively from SPECT reconstructions, has been shown to correlate with future cardiac events. Relative patterns of distribution of indium-antimyosin and 201TI on simultaneous dual isotope SPECT reconstructions may identify patients with residual myocardium at further ischemic risk.
