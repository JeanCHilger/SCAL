Demographic and psychosocial characteristics of asthmatic children in a Canadian rehabilitation setting. This study investigated the demographic and psychosocial characteristics of patients attending a residential treatment program for children with asthma. Measures of background information and standardized psychosocial variables were administered to 54 inpatients over an 18-month period. Typically, our patients presented with moderate to severe chronic asthma, mostly diagnosed before 3 years of age and often associated with atopic dermatitis. The families exhibited normal levels of emotional bonding and flexibility in response to stress. Psychosocially, most children were experiencing behavioral and school-related problems, with 6-11-year-old boys exhibiting global social competency problems as well. Girls exhibited lower self-esteem. Locus of control was within the normal range for all age groups. Half the children had not previously attended an asthma education program and two-thirds of the family members either smoked and/or had a pet. The treatment implications of these characteristics of our asthma population were considered.
