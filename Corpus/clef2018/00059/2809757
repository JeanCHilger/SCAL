Characterization of technetium-99m-L,L-ECD for brain perfusion imaging, Part 2: Biodistribution and brain imaging in humans. The safety, biodistribution and kinetics of a new perfusion imaging agent [99mTc-L,L]-ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) was evaluated in normal volunteers. Technetium-99m-L,L-ECD is a neutral, lipophilic complex, which is radiochemically pure and stable. Twelve healthy adults were injected with 25-30 mCi of 99mTc-L,L-ECD and imaged periodically for up to 24 hr. Planar imaging showed rapid brain uptake with a peak concentration of 4.9% injected dose and very slow brain washout (approximately 6% per hour during the first 6 hr). Repeat or dynamic tomographic imaging of the brain using either a rotating gamma camera or a multidetector system was performed up to 6 hr postinjection. The distribution of 99mTc-L,L-ECD in the brain did not change and was similar to the pattern seen with other perfusion agents. Background facial areas and lungs cleared rapidly. Peak blood activity was below 10% injected dose at all times and 99mTc-L,L-ECD cleared rapidly through the kidneys. Vital signs, blood and urine chemistries were normal in all volunteers and no adverse reactions were noted. These results suggest that 99mTc-L,L-ECD should be useful for routine assessment of cerebral perfusion in humans.
