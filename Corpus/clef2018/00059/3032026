Determination of thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and cortisol changes during simultaneous adrenal and thyroid function tests in healthy dogs. Changes in thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and cortisol during a combined adrenal (dexamethasone suppression/adrenocorticotrophic hormone response test) and thyroid function tests (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] response test) were determined in 20 healthy hospitalized pet dogs. The effect of dexamethasone on T4 and T3 changes was evaluated during a simultaneous TSH response/dexamethasone suppression adrenocorticotrophic hormone response test. Greater ranges in basal cortisol concentrations and slower changes after dexamethasone was administered were observed in healthy pet dogs kenneled in a hospital setting than those reported for conditioned laboratory dogs. Pet dogs were observed to demonstrate cortisol suppression more reliably at 4 hours than at 2 hours after dexamethasone was administered. Dexamethasone had no effect on the response to TSH as assessed by T4 and T3 assays, thus supporting the validity of combining adrenal and thyroid response tests in a 5-hour period.
