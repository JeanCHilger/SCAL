Regional lung density and blood volume in nonsmoking and smoking subjects measured by PET. Regional lung density (DL) and regional fractional pulmonary blood volume (VB) were measured quantitatively during tidal breathing in 30 healthy supine subjects (15 smokers and 15 nonsmokers) in a 1.7-cm-thick midthoracic cross section using positron emission tomography (PET) and 11CO (inhaled)-labeled erythrocytes. Regional alveolar volume (VA), extravascular lung density (DEV), and relative alveolar size (Valv = VA/DEV) were calculated. For the nonsmokers, mean values (+/- SD between subjects) for the right lung were as follows: DL, 0.28 +/- 0.03 g/cm3 DEV, 0.10 +/- 0.02 g/cm3
