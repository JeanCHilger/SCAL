Interactions between viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle diseases virus and pet birds of six species. I. Clinical and serologic responses, and viral excretion. Clinical and serologic responses to a psittacine isolate of viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease virus (VVNDV) were evaluated in pet birds of six species: budgerigar, yellow-headed Amazon parrot, halfmoon conure, lesser hill mynah, black-headed nun, canary. The clinical response was most marked in the budgerigars, parrots, and conures, and only minimal in the nuns. Between post-exposure days (PED) 3 and 5 some birds developed ruffled plumage, conjunctivitis, and central nervous system dysfunction: ataxia, wing tremors, paralysis of the extremities, and tremors of the head accompanied by nodding and jerking. Mortality by PED 203 was 55% (29/52) in the halfmoon conures, 22% (23/105) in budgerigars, 29% (12/42) in parrots, and 21% (15/71) in nuns. The only clinical signs in canaries and mynahs were progressive death losses, respectively 25% (33/132) and 21% (10/48). The visceral lesions common in chickens with VVNDV were not observed in these six species. Canaries rapidly eliminated Newcastle disease virus (NDV), whereas it was detected for protracted periods in the oral and cloacal secretions of the other five species (for more than a year in parrots). Serologic evaluation by the hemagglutination-inhibition and neutralization tests also indicated prolonged NDV infections in 5 of the 6 species. The seroconversion rate observed in canaries was minimal (13%).
