Interactions between viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease virus and pet birds of six species. II. Viral evolution through bird passage. Following in vivo studies in pet birds of 6 species, 279 Newcastle disease virus (NDV) reisolates were selected for characterization by the embryonated-chicken-egg mean-death-time, plaque-assay, hemagglutination-elution, and hemagglutinin-thermostability techniques. Initially, the 279 isolates were screened by the mean-death-time and plaque-assay techniques, and 5 sequential isolates were chosen for each of 3 budgerigars and 2 parrots for characterization by the other 2 in vitro assays to determine whether the Colorado Psittacine Isolate of viscerotropic velogenic (VV) NDV (COPI-VVNDV) had evolved during passage through pet birds. Nineteen isolates were then selected for chicken back-passage studies. Fifteen of the 19 isolates were chosen for potential avirulence for 8-week-old domestic chickens. The 4 remaining isolates produced large red plaques when assayed and were therefore used as virulent virus controls likely to be VVNDV. Subsequent in vitro characterization of selected back-passage chicken NDV isolates demonstrated little change in the 4 parameters originally evaluated for the pet-bird isolates used for the back-passage studies. Although the psittacine isolate slowly evolved to relatively avirulent strains of NDV by passage in pet birds, reversion did not occur during the chicken back-passage studies.
