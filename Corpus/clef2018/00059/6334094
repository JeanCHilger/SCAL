A quantitative model for the measurement of cerebral vascular extraction fraction in vivo following intravenous injection: simulation studies. A mathematical method has been developed by which the cerebral vascular extraction fraction of flow- and diffusion-limited tracers injected intravenously can be measured quantitatively. Successive injections of three tracers are required: a test tracer such as 15O-labeled water a completely diffusible tracer as a reference tracer and also as a flow tracer
