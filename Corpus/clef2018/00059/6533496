Imaging of phaeochromocytoma and adrenal medulla with 123I-meta-iodobenzyl guanidine. A method for preparing meta-iodobenzyl guanidine (MIBG) labelled with 123I is described. This compound clearly imaged the normal adrenal medulla in seven out of eight patients with hypertension. The sites of metastases were demonstrated in two patients with malignant phaeochromocytoma.
