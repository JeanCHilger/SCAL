Beta-methyl[1-11C]heptadecanoic acid: a new myocardial metabolic tracer for positron emission tomography. We have tagged heptadecanoic acid with C-11 at the carboxyl group and have inserted a methyl radical in the beta position to inhibit beta oxidation of the fatty acid we have then explored the tracer's potential as an indicator of myocardial metabolism for use with the positron tomograph. In this preliminary evaluation, biodistribution studies were made in rats and dogs, and imaging of normal and infarcted dogs was performed. At 30 min the tissue distribution studies in rats and dogs showed, respectively, 1.9% and 8.3% uptake in the heart. Sequential images of the canine heart exhibited a remarkable uptake, peaking at 16-18 min and retaining the same level of activity over the one-hour study period. Images of the heart after LAD ligation showed an area of diminished uptake corresponding to the region of infarction. Thus this agent has the basic properties required for potential use in the assessment and quantitation of free fatty-acid metabolism in the heart in a manner similar to the measurement of glucose metabolism in the brain with 2-[18F]fluoro-3-deoxy-D-glucose.
