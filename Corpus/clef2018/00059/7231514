Scintigraphic localization of pheochromocytoma. We used a new radiopharmaceutical agent, [131I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine ([131I]MIBG), to produce scintigraphic images of pheochromocytomas in eight patients. One day or more after injection, the only normal organ that displayed distinct concentrations of radioactivity was the urinary bladder. The [131I]MIBG was probably concentrated in adrenergic vesicles in tissues where vesicles are numerous, such as pheochromocytomas, the radionuclide was retained for days. The spectrum of pheochromocytomas shown the scintigrams was broad: intra-adrenal and extraadrenal in location, benign and malignant in character, 0.2 to 65 g in weight, and with different hormone patterns in secretion. Tumors in four patients were not detected by computed tomography. In one patient, reoperation was undertaken only because the scintigram located the extra-adrenal tumors and thereby directed the surgeon's exploration. The method offers hope of safe and reliable localization of pheochromocytomas in their many guises.
