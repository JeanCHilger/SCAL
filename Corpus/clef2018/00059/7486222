Increased lung uptake during myocardial scintigraphy improves the detection and localization of coronary artery disease. Increased lung uptake during exercise thallium 201 scanning denotes severe ventricular hypofunction. To assess whether there is any relationship between this finding and the stenosis of a single coronary artery, the authors studied 140 patients (age 57.5 +/- 12 years) with both exercise thallium and coronary angiography within three months. A planar view was acquired for two hundred forty seconds immediately postexercise and prior to the single photon emission computed tomography acquisition. Two identical regions of interest outlining the left ventricle and the right lung in the planar view were used for calculation of the lung uptake, expressed as a lung-to-heart counts ratio. The patients were divided into four angiographic groups: (I) lesions at the left anterior descending (LAD), n = 35 (II) stenosis at the circumflex (CRX), n = 35
