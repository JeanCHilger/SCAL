Iodine-123-labelled fatty acids for myocardial single-photon emission tomography: current status and future perspectives. Renewed interest in the clinical use of iodine-123-labelled fatty acids is currently primarily focused on the use of iodine-123-labelled 15-(p-iodophenyl)pentadecanoic acid (IPPA) and "modified" fatty acid analogues such as 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-R,S-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) which show delayed myocardial clearance, thus permitting single-photon emission tomographic imaging. Interest in the use of BMIPP and similar agents results from the differences which have often been observed in various types of heart disease between regional myocardial uptake patterns of [123I]BMIPP and flow tracer distribution. Although the physiological basis is not completely understood, differences between regional fatty acid and flow tracer distribution may reflect alterations in important parameters of metabolism which can be useful for patient management or therapy planning. These tracers may also represent unique metabolic probes for correlation of energy substrate metabolism with regional myocardial viability. The two agents currently most widely used clinically are 123I-labelled IPPA and BMIPP. While [123I]IPPA is commercially available as a radiopharmaceutical in Europe (Cygne) and Canada (Nordion), multicenter trials are in progress in the United States as a prelude to approval for broad use. [123I]BMIPP was recently introduced as Cardiodine for commercial distribution in Japan (Nihon Medi-Physics, Inc.). [123I]BMIPP is also being used in clinical studies on an institutional approval basis at several institutions in Europe and the United States. In this review, the development of a variety of radioiodinated fatty acids is discussed. The results of clinical trials with [123I]IPPA and [123I]BMIPP are discussed in detail, as are the future prospects for fatty acid imaging.
