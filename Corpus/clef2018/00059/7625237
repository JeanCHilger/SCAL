Cerebral blood flow and post-TIA depression. This study tries to evaluate the hypothesis of an association between severity of post-stroke depression and reduced cerebral blood flow (SPECT Xenon-133).37 patients in the fourth week of post-stroke evolution with RDS criteria of major depression (N = 20) and non-depressed patients (N = 17) were compared in regard to following parameters: values of cerebral blood flow (SPECT Xenon-133), localization of brain lesion (CT Scanner) and quantitative measurement of mood (HDRS, MARDS, BDI), functional ability (Barthel, Karnofsky), cognitive function (MMSE, WPT) and neurological function (Orgogozo's Scale).Post-stroke major depression is more frequent (NS) in left and anterior lesions. We also demonstrated a significant association between total brain hypoperfusion and 1) severity of post-stroke depression, 2) severity of neurologic and functional impairments.these results suggest a relationship between mood and cerebral perfusion following stroke.
