The bisexual brain: sex behavior differences and sex differences in parthenogenetic and sexual lizards. The parthenogenetic lizard Cnemidophorus uniparens alternates in the display of male-like and female-like sexual behavior, providing a unique opportunity for determining the neuronal circuits subserving gender-typical sexual behavior within a single sex. Here we report a 6-fold greater [14C]2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose uptake in the medial preoptic area of C. uniparens displaying male-like behavior in comparison with C. uniparens displaying female-like receptivity. The ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus showed greater 2DG accumulation in receptive C. uniparens than in courting C. uniparens. When a related sexual species (C. inornatus) was compared to the unisexual species, the anterior hypothalamus in C. inornatus males exhibited significantly greater activity.
