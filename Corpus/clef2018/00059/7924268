Predictor-corrector with cubic spline method for spectrum estimation in Compton scatter correction of SPECT. In single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), Compton scattered photons degrade image contrast and cause erroneous regional activity quantification. A predictor-corrector and cubic spline (PCCS) method for the compensation of Compton scatter in SPECT is proposed. Using spectral information recorded at four energy windows, the PCCS method estimates scatter counts at each window and constructs the scatter spectrum with cubic spline interpolation. We have shown in simulated noise-free situations that this method provides accurate estimation of scatter fractions. A scatter correction employing PCCS method can be implemented on many existing SPECT systems without hardware modification and complicated calibration.
