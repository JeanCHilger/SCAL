Validation of a reference method for correlation of anatomic and functional brain images. We describe a reference device that provides accurate correlations between anatomic and functional brain images. The reference device, which generates fiduciary reference points on sequential scan planes, is positioned adjacent to the orbitomeatal line of the subject, and held in place by a framework anchored to the external auditory meatus. The reference system was tested on 17 subjects undergoing Tc-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (Tc-99m-HM-PAO) brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and cranial computed tomography (CT) scans. The centers of the caudate nuclei, thalami, brain stem, and cerebellar vermis were identified independently on CT and SPECT. The average difference +/- 1 sd between structure locations (x, y, and z) on SPECT and CT were calculated as 1.86 +/- 1.5, 2.16 +/- 1.4, and 1.83 +/- 1.9 mm, respectively. The relevance of the method to clinical applications is illustrated by the localization of a recurrent viable glioma and an epileptogenic focus. This reference system provides an accurate, rapid, and noninvasive patient-specific method for the correlation of brain structure with brain function.
