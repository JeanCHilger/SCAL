SPECT with HMPAO compared to PET with FDG in Huntington disease. It is the aim of this study to compare the performance of 99mTc-d,l-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) SPECT with that of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET in detecting striatal dysfunction as it occurs in Huntington disease (HD).For the determination of regional cerebral glucose consumption, the PET camera PC-4096 was used the cerebral uptake of HMPAO was measured using the three-head SPECT camera TRIAD. Eight patients with manifest HD, seven subjects at risk for HD, and nine normal individuals were included in the study. In both modalities data evaluation was performed using caudate-to-whole-slice (C/S) ratios. The patients' data were compared to 95% confidence intervals determined in the nine controls.The PET and SPECT C/S values correlated significantly (n = 24 r = 0.87With use of a multidetector camera, HMPAO-SPECT comes near the performance of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of striatal dysfunction as it occurs in HD.
