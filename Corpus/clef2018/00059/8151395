Myocardial perfusion imaging with technetium-99m-teboroxime. Technetium-99m-teboroxime is a myocardial perfusion imaging radiotracer that, although not widely used in clinical practice, has the potential to provide valuable diagnostic information. Teboroxime's high myocardial extraction and rapid in vivo myocardial clearance make stress/rest studies possible using very short imaging protocols. In addition, differential washout of 99mTc-teboroxime produces defect filling on early delayed images in a high percentage of patients, potentially eliminating the need for a second rest injection. Finally, because of its rapid myocardial clearance, serial injections of 99mTc-teboroxime in an acute myocardial infarction (MI) setting can provide information on infarct vessel patency based on defect size and can help document the success or failure of reperfusion therapy.
