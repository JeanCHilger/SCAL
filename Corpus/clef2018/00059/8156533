Automatic detection of intracranial contours in MR images. Segmentation of the intracranial cavity in medical images is valuable in several research areas such as the quantitative analysis of normal and abnormal brain tissues, the registration of different imaging modalities (MRI, PET, CT) based on surface models of the brain, and the rendering of volume data. Because the manual delineation of the brain contour in the images can be demanding and error prone, an automatic procedure to perform this task is desirable. We have developed and tested a robust method that permits the automatic detection of the intracranial contour in transverse MR images. The method is described and its performance evaluated.
