The psychology of human-pet relations and their significance for the veterinarian. The veterinarian's situation in society is characterized 1. by increasingly high demands on the quantity and quality of the service required of him, 2. by deficiencies in basic psychological knowledge of compliance behaviour as an interaction process, 3. the increasing discrepancies between educational qualification and the occupational image demanded of him, 4. by deficiencies in knowledge about the significance of pets for prophylactic, educational and therapeutic purposes.1. Provided a positive man-pet-relationship exists, it is proved that dogs contribute to the prevention or reduction of everyday hassles, and help to develop an active way of overcoming problems. 2. Dogs are attractive co-educators for children this is particularly true of only children and children who are alone all day because both parents work, as well as children from broken homes. Dogs prevent boredom, loneliness, fearfulness and "help" to solve conflict situations with parents. 3. Where old people--especially those living alone--are concerned, dogs have a prophylactic function with regard to age-related risk factors.
