Sensitivity of immunoscintigraphy in malignant melanoma of the choroid. Between June, 1988 and May, 1991 30 patients with clinically suspected malignant melanoma were examined in succession by means of immunoscintigraphy and the 225.28 S antibody (tagged with Tc-99m). Retrospectively, the results showed a sensitivity of over 70% by SPECT examination. Positive accumulation of the antibody within the suspected melanoma gives reason to believe that this degree of accuracy can be improved by comparative application of unspecific, radioactively tagged proteins. In the absence of accumulation within clinically, and in particular echographically, confirmed malignant melanoma treatment should be performed.
