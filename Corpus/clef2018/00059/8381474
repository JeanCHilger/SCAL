Iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy in preoperative and postoperative evaluation of paragangliomas: comparison with CT and MRI. Iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy, transmission computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were used to evaluate 36 patients with clinically suspected functioning paragangliomas. The patients were divided into two groups. In Group 1 (n = 21), studied before surgery, patients mainly had benign adrenal disease. In Group 2 (n = 15), studied after surgery, patients frequently had malignant or extra-adrenal tumors. In Group 1, transmission computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were more sensitive (100% for both) than MIBG scintigraphy (82%), which, however, was the most specific (100%). In Group 2, MIBG scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging were more sensitive (83% for both) than transmission computed tomography (75%), but MIBG was again the most specific (100%). Thus, all three were complementary modalities for localizing paragangliomas both preoperatively and postoperatively. MIBG imaging is indicated for both groups but it is especially recommended for postsurgical patients with recurrence because the disease is often malignant or extra-adrenal.
