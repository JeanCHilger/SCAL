Correlation of 99Tcm-sestamibi SPECT with coronary angiography in general hospital practice. One hundred and twenty-eight patients had a stress test with sestamibi injection and a coronarography within 2 months of the sestamibi study. Sestamibi studies were reconstructed using Hanning 0.65 and Wiener 1.0 filters the latter improved the results significantly (P < 0.05). Significant correlations were found between sestamibi and coronarography: the sensitivity was 0.967 and the specificity was 0.711. Thus sestamibi is a very good compound, with excellent imaging quality, which is very sensitive for mild defects, even more sensitive than coronarography. Thorough studies of discrepancies show that they could be explained by reductions in coronary flow or myocardial reserve, even when the large epicardial vessels are disease free as occurs in various coronary involvements. A follow-up of positive patients with sestamibi and negative coronarography is absolutely necessary since this group of patients represents a 'risk' group. Moreover, sestamibi single photon emission computed tomographic accuracy is highly dependent on filter choice.
