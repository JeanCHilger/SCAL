Value of SPECT imaging of the thoracolumbar spine in cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of SPECT bone imaging in targeting the precise location of vertebral abnormalities to ascertain whether such knowledge would help in differentiating between metastatic and benign lesions. SPECT images of the thoracolumbar spine in 50 patients were correlated with plain x-rays, CT, MRI, PET, and bone scans and 6-month clinical follow-ups. SPECT images revealed 110 lesions, 35 of which were metastases. Twenty-four of 25 lesions involving the vertebral body with extension into posterior elements were metastases, as well as 10 of 39 lesions found in the vertebral body and 1 of 4 found in the spinous process. All lesions limited to the anterior aspect of the vertebral body (13/13), facet joints (23/23), and intervertebral disk space (6/6) were benign. In conclusion, SPECT imaging of the thoracolumbar spine is helpful in determining the precise anatomic location of vertebral abnormalities, and knowledge of the location can be used to determine whether these abnormalities in cancer patients are benign entities or metastases.
