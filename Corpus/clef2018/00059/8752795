Predictive value of low dose dobutamine transesophageal echocardiography and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for recovery of regional left ventricular function after successful revascularization. This study was designed to assess the predictive value of myocardial viability diagnosed by dobutamine transesophageal echocardiography and fluorine (F)-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for left ventricular functional recovery after revascularization in patients with chronic left ventricular dysfunction.The identification of akinetic but viable myocardium is of particular importance for the selection of patients with a compromised left ventricle who will benefit from coronary revascularization.Multiplane rest and dobutamine transesophageal echocardiography (dobutamine, 5 and 10 microg/min per kg) studies and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic studies at rest were performed in 2 patients with 1) previous myocardial infarction and regional akinesia, 2) a stenosed infarct-related coronary artery, and 3) a patent infarct-related vessel after revascularization. A basally akinetic segment was considered viable by transesophageal echocardiography if dobutamine-induced contractile reserve could be observed. Viability by positron emission tomography was defined as F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake > or = 50% of the maximal uptake in a region with normal wall motion. Recovery of regional left ventricular function 4 to 6 months after revascularization was diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiography if > or = 50% of segments akinetic at baseline had improved wall thickening.Dobutamine transesophageal echocardiography identified viable infarct regions in 25 (59%) of 42 patients, and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in 30 (71%) of 42 patients, yielding diagnostic agreement in 86% of patients. Sensitivity and specificity for prediction of left ventricular functional recovery in individual patients was 92% and 88%, respectively, for dobutamine transesophageal echocardiography versus 96% and 69% for F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Segments remaining akinetic after revascularization had a significantly lower (p < 0.001) F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (48 +/- 15%) than that (73 +/- 15%) of segments with recovery of regional left ventricular function.Both dobutamine transesophageal echocardiography and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography were highly sensitive in predicting functional recovery of chronically kinetic or dyskinetic myocardium after successful revascularization. Thus, dobutamine transesophageal echocardiography is a clinically valuable alternative to F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for assessing residual viability and predicting functional recovery after revascularization.
