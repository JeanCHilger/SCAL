Perfusion-MVO2 mismatch during inotropic stress in CAD patients with normal contractile function. With the use of[11C]acetate, positron emission tomography (PET) permits exploration of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and oxidative metabolism (MVo2) coupling. PET imaging was performed at rest and under dobutamine infusion in 8 normal subjects and 10 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with significant single-vessel left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis (> 70%) and normal regional left contractile function at rest. Resting MBF and MVo2 were similar in remote and LAD regions of normal subjects and patients. During dobutamine infusion, MBF and myocardial flow reserve were lower in LAD regions of patients compared with remote regions (MBF: 1.49 +/- 0.42 and 2.06 +/- 0.57 ml.g-1.min-1, P < 0.01 reserve: 1.73 +/- 0.59 and 2.14 +/- 0.47, P < 0.01, respectively), whereas MVo2 expressed as kmono (an index of MVo2) and metabolic reserve were similar (kmono: 0.106 +/- 0.021 vs. 0.107 +/- 0.017 min-1
