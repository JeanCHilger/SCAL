Evaluation of 99mTc-ECD SPECT for the detection of brain tumor: comparison with 201TI SPECT. For the evaluation of brain tumor (n = 15), we performed both dynamic and static 99mTc-ECD (ECD) SPECT studies 201Tl SPECT was also used for comparison with the results of ECD SPECT. Dynamic ECD SPECT was obtained following the injection of 600 MBq of ECD. Five min after the injection of ECD, static ECD SPECT was performed. 201Tl SPECT was obtained 10 min after the injection of 74MBq. Abnormal uptake was recognized in 7 of 15 tumors with dynamic ECD: 5 of 7 meningiomas, 1 of 1 glioblastoma and 1 of 1 astrocytoma. However, no abnormal uptake was seen in 3 of 3 benign tumors (1 low grade astrocytoma, 1 hemangioma, 1 cranio-pharyngioma) and in 2 of 2 brain metastases. In contrast abnormal uptake was seen in 11 of 15 tumors with 201Tl:7 of 7 meningiomas 2 of 2 brain metastases, 1 of 1 glioblastoma and 1 of 1 craniopharyngioma. No abnormal uptake was seen in 3 of 3 benign tumors (1 hemangioma and 2 low grade astrocytomas). Equivocal uptake was seen in 1 low grade astrocytoma with dynamic ECD and 201Tl. The mechanism of the accumulation of dynamic ECD to brain tumor is unclear. However, it may reflect not only blood flow, but also metabolism.
