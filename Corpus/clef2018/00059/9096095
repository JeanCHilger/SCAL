Non-invasive grading of primary brain tumours: results of a comparative study between SPET with 123I-alpha-methyl tyrosine and PET with 18F-deoxyglucose. Use of iodine-123-alpha-methyl tyrosine (123I-IMT) allows investigation of the amino acid transport rate in gliomas. It was the aim of this study to compare the value of measurement of glucose metabolism with that of measurement of 123I-IMT uptake for the non-invasive grading of brain tumours. The study population comprised 23 patients with histopathologically proven primary brain tumours 14 had high-grade gliomas, and nine low-grade brain neoplasms. Glucose metabolism was studied using an ECAT EXACT 47 positron emission tomography (PET) camera and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)
