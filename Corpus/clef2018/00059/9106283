The functional anatomy of verbal initiation and suppression using the Hayling Test. This study utilised positron emission tomography (PET) to identify the cortical areas involved in verbal initiation and suppression in normal subjects whilst performing a sentence completion test (the Hayling Test). In the first condition (response initiation) subjects were required to complete a sentence from which the last word was omitted, whereas in the second condition (response suppression) subjects were asked to complete a sentence with a word which made no sense in the context of the sentence. Subjects were also required to perform a control task in which they had to read out the last word of given sentences. Compared to the control task, response initiation was associated with left-sided activation of the frontal operculum, inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and the right anterior cingulate gyrus, whereas response suppression was associated with left frontal operculum, inferior frontal gyrus and right anterior cingulate gyrus activation. The difference in activation between the two conditions of the Hayling Test lay in the increased activation of the left middle temporal gyrus and the left inferior frontal gyrus during response initiation.
