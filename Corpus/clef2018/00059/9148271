123I-alpha-methyltyrosine scintigraphy in malignant melanoma. The aim of the study was to evaluate the ranking of the scintigraphy with L-3-123I-alpha-methyltyrosine (123I-AMT) in metastasized melanoma.26 metastases and one primary tumor of a malignant melanoma in six patients were examined with 123I-AMT whole-body scintigraphy and SPECT. Positron Emission Tomography with 2-18F-fluoro-2-desoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) was used as the golden standard.With 123I-AMT-SPECT 8/10 metastases in the thorax > 1.6 cm were detected (ratio T/NT 1.2-1.8), metastases < 1.6 cm were not detectable with SPECT. In 123I-AMT whole-body scintigraphy not one lesion showed a positive tumor uptake.In single cases 123I-AMT scintigraphy can be helpful in staging of malignant melanoma.
