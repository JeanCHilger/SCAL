Effects of 8h of eucapnic and poikilocapnic hypoxia on middle cerebral artery velocity and heart rate in humans. This study examines the effects of prolonged hypoxia, with and without control of end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (PET,CO2), on the intensity-weighted mean velocity of blood flow in the middle cerebral artery (VIWM) and on heart rate (HR). Specifically, the time course of the responses, their reversibility with brief periods of hyperoxia and the recovery phase following prolonged hypoxia were all investigated. Twelve subjects were studied, of whom nine provided satisfactory data. A purpose-built chamber was used for the prolonged control of the end-tidal gases, and an end-tidal forcing system was used for generating the brief variations in end-tidal gases. Three 16 h protocols were employed: (1) 8 h eucapnic (average PET,CO2 = 39 mmHg) hypoxia (end-tidal O2 partial pressure, PET,O2 = 55 mmHg) followed by 8 h eucapnic euoxia (PET,O2 = 100 mmHg) (2) 8 h poikilocapnic (average PET,CO2 4 mmHg below eucapnia) hypoxia (PET,O2 = 55 mmHg) followed by 8 h poikilocapnic euoxia (PET,O2 = 100 mmHg)
