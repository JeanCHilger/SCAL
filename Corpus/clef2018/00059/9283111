Whole-body kinetics and dosimetry of L-3--123I-iodo-alpha-methyltyrosine. The synthetic amino acid L-3--123I-iodo-alpha-methyltyrosine (IMT) is currently under clinical evaluation as a single-photon emission tomography (SPET) tracer of amino acid uptake in brain tumours. So far, dosimetric data in respect of IMT are not available. Therefore we investigated the whole-body distribution of IMT in six patients with cerebral gliomas and the radiation doses were estimated. Whole-body scans were acquired at 1.5, 3 and 5 h after i.v. injection of 370-550 MBq IMT. The bladder was voided prior to each scan and the radioactivity excreted in the urine was measured. Based on the MIRD-11 method and the updated MIRDOSE3, the mean absorbed doses for various organs and the effective dose were calculated from geometric means of the anterior and posterior whole-body scans using seven source organs and the residence time. IMT was predominantly excreted by the kidneys (52.8%+/-11.5% at 1.5 h p.i., 63.0%+/-15.7% at 3 h p.i. and 74.6%+/-9.8% at 5 h p.i.). No organ system other than the urinary tract showed significant retention of the tracer. Early whole-body scans revealed slightly increased tracer uptake in the liver and in the bowel. Highest absorbed doses were found for the urinary bladder wall (0.047 mGy/MBq), the kidneys (0.010 mGy/MBq), the lower large intestinal wall (0.011 mGy/MBq) and the upper large intestinal wall (0.008 mGy/MBq). The effective dose according to ICRP 60 was estimated to be 0.0073 mSv/MBq for adults. This leads to an effective dose of 3.65 mSv in a typical brain SPET study using 500 MBq IMT. The MIRDOSE3 scheme yielded similar results. Thus, in spite of the relatively high tracer dose required for optimal brain scanning, radiation exposure in SPET studies with IMT is in the normal range of routine nuclear medicine investigations.
