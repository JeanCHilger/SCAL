ApoE, Alzheimer's disease, and recovery from brain stress. Apolipoprotein E (APOE, gene ApoE, protein) is the major genetic susceptibility locus for the common forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are three common polymorphisms in the population: epsilon 2, epsilon 3, and epsilon 4. The inheritance of each dose of epsilon 4 increases the risk and lowers the age of onset distribution for AD
