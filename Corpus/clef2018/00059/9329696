Decreased brain glucose metabolism in microvessels from patients with Alzheimer's disease. We studied brain glucose metabolism in patients with Alzheimer's disease and age-matched controls in vivo by PET and assessed brain glucose utilization and the phosphorylation constant K3 for hexokinase. In addition we determined in vitro the binding of 2DG and measured its phosphorylation to 2DG-phosphate in cerebral microvessels obtained at autopsy from subjects with Alzheimer's disease and age-matched controls. In patients with Alzheimer's disease we found a marked decrease in the kinetic constant K3 for the hexokinase, and a marked decrease in the overall metabolism of glucose in our PET studies in microvessels there was a marked decrease in the affinity of 2DG and a decrease in hexokinase activity. Alzheimer's disease may be related to a complex alteration in brain glucose metabolism.
