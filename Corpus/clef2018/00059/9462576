Comparison of technetium-99m tetrofosmin and thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging for detection of myocardial perfusion defects in patients with coronary artery disease. We compared dipyridamole technetium-99m (Tc-99m) tetrofosmin and thallium-201 (Tl-201) single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging with respect to the detection rate of perfusion abnormalities in 26 patients with angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD).Experimental studies have shown that myocardial extraction of Tc-99m tetrofosmin is lower than that of Tl-201 at high flow rates, resulting in less severe defects with vasodilator stress. It is uncertain whether this results in a lower sensitivity than Tl-201 for detecting coronary stenoses with vasodilator stress in patients.Twenty-six patients with CAD underwent both dipyridamole Tl-201 and Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT. Tomographic images were scored for initial defects and the presence of reversibility. Defect magnitude was computer quantitated.Of the 26 patients, 25 had defects on both Tl-201 and Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT images. Of 340 segments analyzed, 102 had defects by Tl-201 and 92 by Tc-99m tetrofosmin (p = NS). Whereas Tl-201 detected 27 fixed defects in 12 patients, Tc-99m tetrofosmin identified 37 fixed defects in 14 patients (p = NS). In contrast, Tl-201 identified more reversible and partially reversible defects than did Tc-99m tetrofosmin (89 vs. 55, p = 0.002). The average defect magnitude (percent normal) was similar for defects concordantly graded as fixed (38 +/- 3.0% for Tl-201 vs. 42 +/- 4% [mean +/- SEM] for Tc-99m tetrofosmin, p = NS). The average defect magnitude for defects concordantly graded as completely reversible was significantly more severe on Tl-201 than on Tc-99m tetrofosmin (49 +/- 3% vs. 58 +/- 3%) SPECT images. A significantly greater defect magnitude for Tl-201 was also found for defects concordantly classified as partly reversible (30 +/- 4% for Tl-201 vs. 45 +/- 5% for Tc-99m tetrofosmin).With dipyridamole stress, 1) at least one defect was seen on both Tl-201 and Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT images 2) Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT identified fewer reversible defects than did Tl-201, but showed a similar number of fixed defects
