The central nervous system control of micturition in cats and humans. Recent findings concerning the central control of micturition in cats are compared to findings obtained from dynamic imaging studies in humans. In the cat, three areas in the brainstem and diencephalon are specifically implicated in the control of micturition: (1) Barrington's nucleus or the pontine micturition center in the dorsomedial pontine tegmentum directly excites bladder motoneurons and indirectly inhibits, via inhibitory interneurons in the medial sacral cord, urethral sphincter motoneurons (2) the periaqueductal grey receiving bladder filling information
