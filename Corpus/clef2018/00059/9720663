Transcapillary transport of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) in isolated rat heart. A better understanding of transcapillary transport for tracer metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is desirable for development of tracer kinetic models that yield meaningful estimates of neuronal uptake function from tissue radioactivity time courses. This study utilized a multiple-indicator approach in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts to define transport mechanisms and determine the capillary permeability-surface area (PSc) over a broad range of flow (F). Multiple injections within the same heart at different flows allowed characterization of the PSc/F relationship within the same heart. The coefficient of variation of E for multiple injections within the same hearts at constant flow was 6 +/- 2% (3 to 6 injections in 9 hearts). In 10 hearts (4 to 6 injections per heart), flow was varied between 2.0-16.5 mL/min. PSc was found to be nearly proportional to flow in each heart (r = 0.88 +/- 0.14 slope = 0.23 +/- 0.10
