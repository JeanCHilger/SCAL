11C]NNC 22-0215, a metabolically stable dopamine D1 radioligand for PE. NNC 22-0215 has been found to be a metabolically stable dopamine D1 antagonist with high affinity and selectivity for D1 receptors in vitro. We prepared [11C]NNC 22-0215 with a specific radioactivity of about 50 GBq/micromol at time of administration. In PET experiments with [11C]NNC 22-0215 there was a rapid uptake of radioactivity in the cynomolgus monkey brain (1.8% of total radioactivity injected). Radioactivity accumulated most markedly in the striatum and the neocortex. The striatum to cerebellum ratio was about 4, with specific binding that remained at a plateau level from 50 min to 100 min after injection. Binding in the striatum and neocortex was markedly displaced by SCH 23390, whereas binding in the cerebellum was not reduced. Metabolite studies showed that about 80% of the radioactivity in the monkey plasma represented unchanged radioligand 30 min after injection. The rate of metabolism in monkey plasma in vivo was also determined for a series of structurally related 11C-labelled benzazepines, previously used as dopamine D1 receptor ligands for PET. Results indicate a significantly slower rate of metabolism for [11C]NNC 22-0215 than for any of the previously labelled benzazepines. Thus [11C]NNC 22-0215 has potential for imaging of selective binding to the dopamine D1 receptors in the human brain with high count rates at time of equilibrium.
