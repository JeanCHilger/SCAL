Dual isotope F-18 FDG and Tc-99m RBC imaging for lung cancer. To produce fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) images with markers for normal organs and large blood vessels in patients with suspected lung cancer.Dual isotope SPECT images were made using F-18 FDG- and Tc-99m-labeled autologous red cells.FDG-positive lesions are localized in relation to major structures when they are viewed in a fused rotating three-dimensional display or in cross sections.Tc-99m red cell and FDG fusion imaging provides relative location information for lung tumors.
