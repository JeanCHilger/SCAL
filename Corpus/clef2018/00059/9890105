Evaluation of patients with CNS involvement in SLE. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may present with a wide array of neuropsychiatric (NP) clinical features. This may either be a primary manifestation of SLE, the result of a complication of the disease or its therapy, or a concurrent disease process. As there is no single diagnostic gold standard for NP-SLE, the assessment of individual patients is heavily dependent upon clinical evaluation in addition to information from studies of autoantibodies, brain structure and function. Despite their lack of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, these tests frequently provide information that can be used to support or refute the clinical impression. They may also provide a basis for the prospective evaluation of the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in individual patients with NP-SLE.
