Optimum threshold values of 201Tl SPET in the determination of the left ventricular border and extent of myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to determine the optimum threshold value of the left ventricular border and the extent of myocardial infarction using quantitative 201Tl single photon emission tomography (SPET). We used the unfolded map method to determine the size of the left ventricle and the extent of myocardial infarction in 10 patients, because it has been shown to be superior to the conventional polar map method. The relative differences in the size of the left ventricle and extent of infarction between 201Tl SPET and post-mortem examination were calculated. The optimum threshold value was determined when the relative difference = 0%. There was an excellent correlation between scintigraphic and post-mortem left ventricular size at a threshold value of 53% (r = 0.91, P < 0.001) an excellent correlation was also observed between scintigraphic and post-mortem infarct size at a threshold value of 55% (r = 0.93, P < 0.03). The optimum threshold value in determining left ventricular size using 201Tl SPET is 53% and that in determining infarct size is 55%.
