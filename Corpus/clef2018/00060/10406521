A simple and fast method to estimate peritoneal membrane transport characteristics using dialysate sodium concentration. The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) is widely used to classify a patient's peritoneal transport characteristics. However, PET is laborious and the prediction of fluid removal based on PET is generally poor. It is believed that osmosis by glucose occurs partially through transcellular water channels, resulting in sieving of sodium and decrease of dialysate sodium concentration when using hypertonic glucose dialysate.In this study, we investigated the possibility of using dialysate sodium concentration to classify the patient's peritoneal transport characteristics.A 6-hour dwell study with frequent dialysate and plasma sampling was performed in 46 patients using 2 L of 3.86% glucose dialysate with 131I-albumin as an intraperitoneal volume (IPV) marker. The peritoneal transport of sodium, creatinine, glucose, and fluid was evaluated.The dialysate sodium concentration at 240 min (D(Na240)) significantly correlated with D/P creatinine (r = 0.76, p < 0.001) and D/D0 glucose (r = -0.83, p < 0.001) at 240 min of the dwell (better than dialysate sodium concentration at any other time of the dwell). DNa240 also significantly correlated with IPV at 240 min of the dwell (r = -0.61, p < 0.001)(better than D/P creatinine and D/D0 glucose). There were significant correlations between D(Na240) and the sodium-sieving coefficient (r = 0.71, p < 0.001) and the diffusive mass transfer coefficient for sodium (r = 0.50, p < 0.001). When using D(Na240) to divide the patients into four groups, as in the PET method, no significant difference was found between the two methods.Using 3.86% glucose solution, D(Na240) can be used instead of D/P creatinine to classify patients into different transport groups. D(Na240) provides a better prediction of peritoneal fluid transport and reflects both the diffusive and convective transport properties of the membrane. As only one dialysate sample (and no blood sample) is needed, D(Na240) may offer important clinical advantages compared with PET.
