F-18 FDG PET for detection of occult primary tumor in patients with lymphatic metastases of the neck region. The occult primary tumor remains an important diagnostic problem in patients with lymph node metastases despite a large variety of imaging modalities. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of F-18-FDG-positron-emission-tomography (PET) in these patients.The study group included a total of 28 patients aged 39 to 84 years with cervical lymph node metastases of a histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma (n = 24) or an undifferentiated carcinoma (n = 4). All patients received 370 MBq F-18-FDG intravenously, and whole-body images were acquired at 60 min p.i. with an ECAT EXACT 47 (921) (Siemens, CTI). All lesions were evaluated either by histology or by CT/MRI.In 12 patients PET did not reveal suspected tumorous lesions. In contrast in 16/28 patients PET showed focal tracer accumulations corresponding to potential primary tumor sites located in the lungs (n = 7), in the region of the tonsilla palatina (n = 5), in the submandibular gland (n = 1), in the nasopharynx (n = 1), in the larynx (n = 1), or at the base of the tongue (n = 1). In nine out of these 16 patients, the primary was confirmed in the lungs in 5 patients, in the larynx, at the base of the tongue, in the nasopharynx, and the tonsilla palatina in one patient each, respectively. Moreover, in 6 out of 16 patients, PET was false-positive. One patient refused further evaluation of PET findings.In approximately one third of all patients, PET detected the primary tumor site, which significantly influenced further therapeutic procedures. Thus, F-18-FDG-PET may be a valuable diagnostic tool in the detection of the primary tumor in patients with cervical lymph node metastases.
