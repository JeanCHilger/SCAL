Decreased striatal dopamine transporter density in JNCL patients with parkinsonian symptoms. To explore whether striatal dopamine transporters are involved in juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL) with extrapyramidal signs.Seventeen patients with JNCL entered the study (mean age, 15 years age range, 10 to 31 years). For clinical evaluation, the authors used the motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). For studying the density of dopamine transporters in the striatum, they employed iodine-123-labeled 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl) tropane as a SPECT tracer. The SPECT images were evaluated visually, and tracer accumulation was semiquantified from transverse slices as striatum-to-cerebellum activity ratios. MRI (1.5-T) signal intensities of the striatum were measured and compared with those of the thalamus.The mean UPDRS score was 20 (range, 2 to 41). On SPECT, the mean striatum-to-cerebellum uptake ratio was lower in patients than in control subjects (3.1 +/- 0.6 versus 6.8 +/- 1.0 p < 0.001), with the decrease being more pronounced in the putamen than in the caudate nucleus. On MRI, the mean striatum-to-thalamus signal intensity ratio was higher in patients than in control subjects (1.14 +/- 0.02 versus 1.08 +/- 0.02The observed decrease in the striatal dopamine transporter density in JNCL offers a rational basis for a trial of dopaminergic drugs in this disease.
