Myocardial laser revascularization: the controversy and the data. The clinical and experimental data relevant to the theoretical mechanisms and clinical results of laser myocardial revascularization are reviewed. Both transmyocardial and percutaneous approaches are considered. Both types result in a reduction in anginal symptoms in patients refractory to conventional therapy and are likely to act through common pathways. The proximate mechanisms for the transmyocardial revascularization effect most likely relate to myocardial inflammation, secondary stimulation of growth factors, and denervation of the myocardium.
