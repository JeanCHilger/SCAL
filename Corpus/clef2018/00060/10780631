The motor vehicle collision injury syndrome. The objective of this study was to examine the central nervous system changes that may occur after acceleration/deceleration injuries in motor vehicle accidents.Occupants of motor vehicles involved in a collision often develop a disabling syndrome consisting of head, neck, and back pain impaired short-term memory and concentrationThe current literature on the biomechanics of head injury and the associated brain imaging findings in minor head injury are reviewed. A summary of some of the biochemical sequelae of strain injury to the brain is also provided, with an emphasis on the changes in energy metabolism and excitatory amino acid release.Early intervention to arrest the injury-induced metabolic cascade, and treatment with agents that activate cerebral metabolism may mitigate the symptoms of this injury syndrome.
