Excitation functions of 120Te(d,xn)121,120m,gI reactions from threshold up to 13.5 MeV: comparative studies on the production of 120gI. Excitation functions of the nuclear reactions 120Te(d,xn)121,120m,gI were measured for the first time from their respective thresholds up to 13.5 MeV. Thin samples prepared by electrolytic deposition of 99.0% enriched 120Te on Ti-backing were used. Integral yields of 121,120m,gI were calculated from the measured cross section data. A comparison of the 122Te(p,3n)-, 120Te(p,n)- and 120Te(d,2n)-processes for the production of 120gI is given. The 120Te(d,2n)-process is unsuitable for production purposes since the yield of 120gI is very low and the level of 121I impurity very high. The choice lies either on the 122Te(p,3n)- or the 120Te(p,n)-reaction and is governed by the available proton energy and the financial resources for procuring the enriched target material.
