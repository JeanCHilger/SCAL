Occurrence of Cryptococcus spp. in excreta of pigeons and pet birds. In pooled samples of faeces from 25 pet bird flocks in Thuringia, a high rate of contamination with Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans was found. The prevalence of Cr. neoformans in the bird-breeding establishments correlated with the numbers of the different pet bird species in these flocks. The differentiation between varieties of Cr. neoformans by means of proline assimilation and canavanine resistance detection as well as with the aid of Cr. neoformans factor sera, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fingerprinting, sequencing of PCR products as well as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed uniform results which also corresponded to the serological differentiation between serovars A and D. A predominance of serovar A could be observed among the pet bird breeding flocks. This corresponded to the frequency distribution of serovars A and D in cases of human diseases in Germany. In 50% of the samples of pigeon excreta examined (n = 30) in Innsbruck (Austria), Cryptococcus albidus could be isolated but not Cr. neoformans. However, this Cryptococcus species is of minor pathogenetic importance for man. Cryptococcus albidus may be clearly distinguished from Cr. neoformans by means of microbiological methods, PCR and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
