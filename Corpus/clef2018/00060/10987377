Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis. The histological features of cortical tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis (TS) were studied by the proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).The subjects were 4 children, mean age of 10 years, with clear evidence of tubers on MRI and SPECT. Four age-matched control children served as control subjects. Spectra were acquired over the tuber using short TE.The myoinositol/creatine ratios in the tubers of TS patients were significantly increased compared with those of the control subjects (P < 0.02). The NAA/creatine ratios in the tubers of patients were significantly decreased (P < 0.02).The decrease of NAA/creatine ratios in the tubers of patients was considered to reflect a reduction of cranial neurons. The increase of myoinositol/creatine ratios in the tubers was thought to reflect an increase of glial cells. Proton MRS might play a role in estimation of histological changes in the neurological diseases.
