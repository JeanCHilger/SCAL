Effect of coronary artery bypass surgery on myocardial perfusion and ejection fraction response to inotropic stimulation in patients without improvement in resting ejection fraction. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on myocardial perfusion and left ventricular (LV) contractile reserve in patients with reduced ejection fraction (EF). We studied 57 patients (age 59 +/- 8 years, 46 men and 11 women) with EF < or = 40% referred for CABG with dobutamine (up to 40 microg/kg/min) stress-reinjection thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography, and radionuclide ventriculography at rest and at low-dose dobutamine before and 3 months after CABG. An increase in resting EF > or = 5% occurred in 12 patients (group A) after CABG (EF 34% before and 46% after CABG), whereas no increase occurred in the remaining 45 patients (group B) (EF 34% before and 32% after CABG). A significant increase in EF from rest to low-dose dobutamine radionuclide ventriculography occurred before and after CABG. The magnitude of increase was more significant after than before CABG in group A (12% vs 7%) as well as in group B (13% vs 7%, both p <0.001). Patients in both groups had a significant reduction in stress, rest, and ischemic perfusion scores after CABG. However, the percentage of reduction in resting perfusion defect score was more significant in group A than in group B (60% vs 30%, respectively, p <0.01). It is concluded that CABG induces a significant improvement in resting myocardial perfusion and EF response to inotropic stimulation, even in the absence of improved EF at rest. Patients without improvement in resting EF after CABG have mild improvement in resting myocardial perfusion that may be sufficient to increase EF after CABG during inotropic stimulation, but not at rest. We describe the myocardium with these characteristics as "the reactive myocardium."
