Evaluation of chemotherapy response in primary bone tumors with F-18 FDG positron emission tomography compared with histologically assessed tumor necrosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of positron emission tomography using F-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG PET) to assess the chemotherapy response of primary osseous tumors compared with the degree of necrosis determined histologically.Seventeen patients with primary bone tumors (11 osteosarcomas, 6 Ewing's sarcomas) were examined using FDG PET and planar bone scintigraphy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and before surgery. Tumor response was classified histologically according to Salzer-Kuntschik (grades I-II: good response grades IV-VI: poor response). In both imaging methods, quantification was performed using tumor to nontumor ratios (T:NT).Histologically, 15 patients were classified as having good responses (grade I, n = 1 grade II, n = 6FDG PET seems to be a promising tool for evaluating the response of primary osseous tumors to chemotherapy. In this preliminary study, FDG PET was superior to planar bone scintigraphy.
