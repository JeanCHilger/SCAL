Positron emission tomography and low-dose dobutamine echocardiography in the prediction of postrevascularization improvement in left ventricular function and exercise parameters. We studied the value of low-dose dobutamine echocardiography (LDDE) and positron emission tomography (PET) in predicting improvement of left ventricular function and exercise parameters after revascularization.Forty-six consecutive patients with ischemic heart disease and an ejection fraction (EF) of 35% +/- 7% were included. Before revascularization, the patients underwent exercise testing and myocardial viability testing by LDDE and fluoride 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose PET. Six months after revascularization they underwent coronary angiography to study graft patency, and echocardiographic examination and the exercise test were repeated.In the prediction of the presence or absence of improved postrevascularization function in left ventricular regions with patent grafts, PET was more sensitive than LDDE (42/52 regions [81%] vs 27/52 regions [51%], P <.01), whereas LDDE was more specific than PET (187/209 regions [89%] vs 118/209 regions [56%], P <.001). Improvement of regional myocardial dysfunction was found in 19 patients, but their global left ventricular function did not improve significantly (EF 34% +/- 6% and 36% +/- 7%). In the remaining 27 patients with irreversible dysfunction, EF decreased (EF 36% +/- 7% vs 32% +/- 8%, P <.05). Among patients with reversible myocardial dysfunction, the rate pressure product (RPP) increased after revascularization (19,522 +/- 5474 vs 26,190 +/- 5610 mm Hg/min, P <.01), whereas the RPP did not change in patients with irreversible myocardial dysfunction (21,546 +/- 5450 and 22,774 +/- 8249 mm Hg/min). The number of PET viable segments was a predictor of the postoperative increase in the RPP in univariate (P <.04) and multivariate analyses (P <.001). In contrast, LDDE did not bear any prognostic information about improvement in the RPP.This study confirms earlier findings of higher sensitivity and lower specificity of PET compared with LDDE in predicting improvement of regional left ventricular function after revascularization. However, the feasibility of predicting postrevascularization improvement of exercise parameters seems unique for PET. The potential prognostic value of this finding needs further investigation.
