Automated three-dimensional quantification of myocardial perfusion and brain SPECT. To allow automated and objective reading of nuclear medicine tomography, we have developed a set of tools for clinical analysis of myocardial perfusion tomography (PERFIT) and Brain SPECT/PET (BRASS). We exploit algorithms for image registration and use three-dimensional (3D) "normal models" for individual patient comparisons to composite datasets on a "voxel-by-voxel basis" in order to automatically determine the statistically significant abnormalities. A multistage, 3D iterative inter-subject registration of patient images to normal templates is applied, including automated masking of the external activity before final fit. In separate projects, the software has been applied to the analysis of myocardial perfusion SPECT, as well as brain SPECT and PET data. Automatic reading was consistent with visual analysis it can be applied to the whole spectrum of clinical images, and aid physicians in the daily interpretation of tomographic nuclear medicine images.
