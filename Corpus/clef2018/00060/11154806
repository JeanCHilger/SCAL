Relative sparing of the parietal cortex in cerebellar ataxia documented by positron emission tomography. With the intention to assess remote effects of cerebellar dysfunction, 23 patients with inherited or idiopathic cerebellar ataxia were studied with positron emission tomography (PET) and 2[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). Eight patients (group 1) suffered from early onset cerebellar ataxia (EOCA, age of symptom onset <20 years), nine patients (group 2) from late onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA, symptom onset between the ages of 20 and 50), and six patients (group 3) experienced symptom onset beyond the age of 50 years. The pattern of cerebral glucose metabolism in cerebellar ataxia was compared to the results in a control group of 16 healthy subjects. In all patients, a reduction in relative (EOCA, group 1) or absolute (LOCA, groups 2 and 3) values of regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMR(glu)) occurred in both cerebellar hemispheres as well as the vermis and both dentate nuclei. In patients from all groups presenting with a clinical syndrome of pure cerebellar ataxia, impairment of regional glucose metabolism also extended to the pontine and brainstem regions. In contrast to this infratentorial reduction of rCMR(glu) in all patients, in those with LOCA, a significant relative increase in rCMR(glu) was present in distinct supratentorial cortical regions, namely the cuneus, the pre-cuneus and the gyrus supramarginalis in the patients of group 2. In group 3, this significant relative increase in rCMR(glu) was restricted to the cuneus. Thus, FDG-PET in patients suffering from cerebellar ataxia shows distinct patterns of altered glucose metabolism which exceed pure cerebellar impairment. Most importantly, FDG-PET yields insight into the influence of cerebellar disease on supratentorial glucose metabolism and documents impairment of supratentorial neuronal function with relative sparing of the parietal cortex.
