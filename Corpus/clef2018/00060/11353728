Increased frontal [(18)F]fluorodopa uptake in early Parkinson's disease: sex differences in the prefrontal cortex. Previous imaging studies in Parkinson's disease have focused mainly on the striatum, a region with very high dopaminergic activity. Using modern high-sensitivity 3D [(18)F]fluorodopa (Fdopa)-PET, mesocortical monoamine projections can be studied. To study the frontal monoaminergic system in unmedicated early Parkinson's disease in vivo, we examined 20 early Parkinson's disease patients (10 women, 10 men) and 16 healthy subjects (nine women, seven men) with 3D Fdopa-PET, using standard region-of-interest-based analysis with MRI co-registration. Women with Parkinson's disease had 87% higher Fdopa uptake in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (area 46) compared with men with Parkinson's disease, whereas there was no sex difference in the control group (sex x disease interaction, P = 0.03). The uptake in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was 82% higher in men with Parkinson's disease and 219% higher in women with Parkinson's disease compared with control groups (effect of disease, P < 0.0001). Also in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and in the medial frontal cortex, early Parkinson's disease patients had significantly (18-94%) higher Fdopa uptake compared with healthy controls. In the putamen, both men and women with Parkinson's disease had a significantly lower (27-46%) uptake compared with healthy controls. These results indicate that frontal monoaminergic activity is increased and that there is a sex difference in the prefrontal monoaminergic system in early Parkinson's disease. The reported sex difference may be linked to clinical sex differences in the symptoms and treatment response in Parkinson's disease.
