Imaging of the dopaminergic system in parkinsonism with SPET. Parkinsonism is a feature of various neurodegenerative diseases. Since it is well known that the dopaminergic system plays a major role in parkinsonism, numerous reports have focused on the assessment of the dopaminergic system in vivo. While the use of positron emission tomography (PET) for routine application is still hampered by its limited availability, single photon emission tomography (SPET) has been shown to deliver comparable results to PET in clinical settings. In recent years SPET investigations of the dopamine transporter and of the dopamine D2-like receptors have provided valuable information about the pre- and postsynaptic dopaminergic system in parkinsonism. This article briefly reviews the literature dealing with SPET imaging in parkinsonism and specifically addresses the ligands used, the methodology applied, and the current major clinical applications.
