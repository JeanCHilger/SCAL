Nuclear medicine in the preoperative evaluation of epilepsy. The clinical usefulness of nuclear medicine in the preoperative evaluation of epilepsy is highlighted with regard to non-lesional temporal lobe epilepsy, extratemporal epilepsy, bitemporal interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and in dual pathology and cortical dysgenesis. Ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) shows good sensitivities in the correct lateralization of an electroencephalogram-defined epileptic focus in lesional and, to a lesser extent, non-lesional epilepsy. Positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose or 11C-flumazenil gives a good detection rate of the seizure onset zone in non-lesional cases and extratemporal epilepsy. The investigation of patients with bitemporal IEDs can confirm the existence of bitemporal seizure onset. For patients with a dual pathology or cortical dysgenesis nuclear medicine offers the opportunity to delineate the existence or extension of abnormalities possibly responsible for the seizure disorder.
