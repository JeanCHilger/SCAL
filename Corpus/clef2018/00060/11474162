Can pre-treatment with beta-agonists reduce stress test time and the use of atropine in dobutamine stress testing? To determine whether the use of inhaled beta-agonists decreases the duration of dobutamine stress testing (DAS), reduces the amount of dobutamine infused and decreases the use of atropine.34 patients on beta-agonists (group A) (mean age 65 +/- 8 years) and 32 patients not on beta-agonists or beta-blockers (group B) (mean age 65 +/- 10 years) undergoing DAS with SPECT were enrolled.The time of infusion of dobutamine in group A was 6.41 +/- 1.58 min and in group B was 9.77 +/- 3.60 min (p < 0.001). The amount of dobutamine infused was 10.64 +/- 5 mg in group A and 19.20 +/- 8 mg in group B (p < 0.001). In group A, 2 of 34 patients and 18 of 32 patients in group B needed atropine to reach peak HR (p < 0.001).Patients on short acting beta-agonists require smaller amounts of dobutamine with a shorter infusion time during DAS, and lesser use of side-effect prone atropine.
