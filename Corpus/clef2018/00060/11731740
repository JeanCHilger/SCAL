Propofol EEG burst suppression in carotid endarterectomy. The results of randomized trials indicate that carotid endarterectomy, performed with a low morbidity-mortality perioperative risk, is the best therapeutic option both for patients with high-grade symptomatic and asymptomatic stenosis. Since the main operative risk is represented by embolic or hemodynamic cerebral ischemia, it appears necessary to maintain an adequate intraoperative cerebral blood flow and to carry out a meticulous endarterectomy.On the basis of these considerations we prospectively studied a series of 100 consecutive patients operated on for high-grade carotid stenosis, by using a protocol based on: 1) an accurate selection of patients for surgery 2) meticulous surgical technique without any shuntIn this series there have been one postoperative death due to myocardial infarction and one major stroke.We think that this protocol can significantly minimize risks of endarterectomy and probably maximize the benefits of surgery, also in patients with asymptomatic high-grade carotid stenosis.
