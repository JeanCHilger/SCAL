Gene expression tomography. Gene expression tomography, or GET, is a new method to increase the speed of three-dimensional (3-D) gene expression analysis in the brain. The name is evocative of the method's dual foundations in high-throughput gene expression analysis and computerized tomographic image reconstruction, familiar from techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and X-ray computerized tomography (CT). In GET, brain slices are taken using a cryostat in conjunction with axial rotation about independent axes to create a series of "views" of the brain. Gene expression information obtained from the axially rotated views can then be used to recreate 3-D gene expression patterns. GET was used to successfully reconstruct images of tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression in the mouse brain, using both RNase protection and real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (QRT-PCR). A Monte-Carlo analysis confirmed the good quality of the GET image reconstruction. By speeding acquisition of gene expression patterns, GET may help improve our understanding of the genomics of the brain in both health and disease.
