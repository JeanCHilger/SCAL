The relationship between 99mTc-HMPAO brain SPECT and the scores of real life rating scale in autistic children. Childhood autism is a developmental disability of unknown origin with probable multiple etiologies. The purpose of this study was to compare the changes of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in autistic and non-autistic controls, and to determine the relationship between rCBF on 99mTc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) brain SPECT and the scores of the Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale (RLRS), IQ levels, and age of autistic children. Eighteen autistic children (four girls, 14 boys mean age: 6.13 +/- 1.99 years) and 11 non-autistic controls (five girls, six boys, mean age: 6.5 +/- 3.39 years) were examined using 99mTc-HMPAO brain SPECT. All the children satisfying DSM-IV criteria for autistic disorder were taken into evaluation, and scored by the Ritvo-Freeman RLRS. IQ levels of these children were determined by Goodenough IQ test. Six cortical regions of interest (ROIs
