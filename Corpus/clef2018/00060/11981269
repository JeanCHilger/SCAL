Testicular cancer. Testicular cancer remains a major success story in the realm of solid tumors. Although testicular cancer is highly treatable and curable, there are still many young men who succumb to the disease. Over the past year, important data regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of testicular cancer have been reported. The significance of genetic and molecular alterations, such as i12p and epidermal growth factor receptor expression, remain at the forefront of research. However surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy are still the main treatment modalities. Attempts to limit chemotherapy and surgery while preserving cure rates are promising. The contribution of long-term platinum retention to the well-documented risk of late toxicity is unknown but provides a specific avenue for research. New tumor markers, such as lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme-1, may provide a greater risk stratification. Positron emission tomography imaging may reduce the need for surgical resection posttherapy and provide a more comprehensive means of observation.
