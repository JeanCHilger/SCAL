New routes to N-alkylated cyclic sulfamidates. BOC- and dibenzosuberyl-protected chiral and hindered cyclic sulfamidates ([1,2,3]-oxathiazolidine-2,2-dioxides) were synthesized and subsequently deprotected using trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting crystalline sulfamidates were then used in several alkylation reactions involving benzyl bromide and alcohols in a versatile route to cyclic sulfamidates with differing N-alkyl substituents.
