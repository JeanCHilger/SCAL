Adequate patient selection for coronary revascularization: an overview of current methods used in daily clinical practice. Widely used non-invasive stress modalities, like exercise ECG, MPS and stress-echocardiography, are the tests of first choice for the diagnosis of CAD. It has been shown in numerous studies that non-invasive assessment of perfusion abnormalities is an adequate strategy for risk stratification. Moreover, non-invasive stress testing should be performed before a diagnostic cardiac catheterization to document the presence of myocardial ischemia, as a prerequisite for coronary revascularization. Coronary angiography is the gold standard for identifying CAD however this technique is limited in assessing functional severity of coronary narrowings ('illusion of luminology'
