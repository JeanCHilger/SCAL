Regional cerebral blood flow profiles of shunt-responder in idiopathic chronic hydrocephalus--a 15-O-water PET-study. To find out if regional characteristics of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVR) may indicate shunt response in idiopathic chronic hydrocephalus. 11 patients with idiopathic chronic hydrocephalus (65 +/- 13 yrs) were followed-up within a year after shunting. Patients were classified into clinical responder (n = 5) and non-responder (n = 6) according to Stein and Langfitt. All patients had measurement of CBF and CVR with dynamic 15-O-water PET (Siemens ECAT 951/31) before and after application of acetazolamide (1 g). Regional differences between outcome groups were analysed with "statistical Parametric Mapping" (SPM99b Wellcome Department, London, UK). Group differences were regarded as significant, when uncorrected p-value on voxel and on cluster level were p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively. Regarding CBF distribution there was significantly reduced CBF in the frontobasal cortex in responder compared to non-responder (cluster level p = 0.026). In CVR, a variety of cortical regions showed significant decreases compared with non-responder: also in frontobasal cortex (on cluster level p = 0.009). However, most significant reductions were found in temporodorsal and limbic cortical regions (on cluster level p < 0.001). Preoperative hemodynamics displayed a regional profile of reduced CBF and CVR in patients with shunt improvement. Prospective studies for determining the accuracy of regional blood flow characteristics for outcome prediction are warranted.
