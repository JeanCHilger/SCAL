Neuropsychological sequels to changes in global cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reserve capacity after shunt treatment in chronic hydrocephalus--a quantitative PET-study. To study relationship of neuropsychological deficits in chronic hydrocephalus before and after shunting with dynamics in cerebral blood flow. In 27 patients (65 +/- 13 yrs) with idiopathic chronic hydrocephalus 11 selected neuropsychological tests, providing a wide range of psychomotor functions, were performed before, one week (early) and 7 months (late) after shunting. Parallel global cortical blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVR) were determined by dynamic 15-O-water PET studies (Siemens ECAT 951/31) before and after application of acetazolamide (1 g). Test raw data and changes after treatment were compared with global and regional blood flow values by polynomial regression. No relationship of test profiles with hemodynamics before surgery was found. After one week, improvement of gait was related to an increase in cerebrovascular reserve capacity (p = 0.05). After 7 months changes in mental tests were related to changes in hemodynamics: again increases in CVR were significantly related to improvements in visual attention and verbal memory (p < 0.01). Early improvement of hemodynamic reserve was related to improvement in gait, whereas mental improvement was particularly related to increases in global CVR at later periods after shunting. These results indicate that neurological sequels in idiopathic chronic hydrocephalus after shunting may actually depend on consecutive improvement of cerebral hemodynamics.
