In vivo receptor assay with multiple ligand concentrations: an equilibrium approach. The ligand-receptor binding potential determined by PET studies at high ligand-specific radioactivity reflects both the receptor density and ligand-receptor affinity. This ambiguity has been resolved by various methods based on the administration of multiple unlabeled ligand concentrations. The authors aimed to implement and refine an approach to multiple ligand concentration receptor assay that combined maximum simplicity and a minimum of assumptions and model dependence that would nonetheless reliably distinguish density from affinity effects. The approach uses administration by bolus followed by infusion to obtain a true equilibrium between bound ligand and the other components of the ligand concentration, and does not require measurements of ligand in blood plasma. Four approaches to the optimization of the desired density and affinity parameters from the measured equilibrium data were implemented and compared in the analysis of raclopride studies performed in both normal control and MPTP-lesioned nonhuman primates. The authors conclude that the method is simple enough for routine use and yet reliable enough to apply in ongoing studies of both chronic and acute drug effects in the dopamine system.
