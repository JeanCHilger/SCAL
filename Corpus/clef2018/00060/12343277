International migration in the context of the Netherlands. The author reviews the literature on international migration concerning the Netherlands.  Aspects of the Dutch situation are discussed, including the relatively low percentage of resident foreigners, their significant contribution to the country's population growth, and their relatively low level of employment.  "The author favours immigration of highly qualified individuals for social, economic and psychological reasons, more economic cooperation with countries of origin, as well as a more stringent policy of integration, in the context of a more active and well considered immigration policy."
