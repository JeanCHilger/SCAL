Analytic and iterative reconstruction algorithms in SPECT. Images of the inside of the human body can be obtained noninvasively using tomographic acquisition and processing techniques. In particular, these techniques are commonly used to obtain images of a gamma-emitter distribution after its administration in the human body. The reconstructed images are obtained given a set of their projections, acquired using rotating gamma cameras. A general overview of analytic and iterative methods of reconstruction in SPECT is presented with a special focus on filter backprojection (FBP), conjugate gradient, maximum likelihood expectation maximization, and maximum a posteriori expectation maximization algorithms. The FBP algorithm is faster than iterative algorithms, with the latter providing a framework for accurately modeling the emission and detection processes.
