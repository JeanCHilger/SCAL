Effect of attenuation correction and scatter compensation on the 99mTc-MIBI myocardial perfusion spect in patients without coronary artery disease. Attenuation correction (AC) and scatter compensation (SC) techniques are recent developments of myocardial perfusion SPECT. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of AC + SC on the myocardial distribution of 99mTc-MIBI in a population without coronary artery disease.A multiarray of Gd-153 linear sources was used for simultaneous transmission/emission 99mTc-MIBI myocardial perfusion SPECT in 27 patients without coronary artery disease. A visual analysis and polar map quantification was performed. Changes between non-corrected (NC) and corrected (AC + SC) studies were compared.AC + SC produced an increase in liver activity and better visualization of the right ventricle. Intestinal activity increased in six patients. Myocardial homogeneity was increased by AC + SC. No differences by gender were observed after AC + SC. In females AC + SC led to a decrease of uptake in the anterior wall, apex and apical segments of the lateral wall and septum, and an increase in the inferior wall. In males AC + SC caused an increase of uptake in the inferior wall and in the basal segments of septum and a decrease of uptake in apex and apical segments of anterior and lateral walls. AC + SC generated false defects in the anterior wall of five patients.Our results show the usefulness of AC + SC for compensating the interferences produced by attenuation on the myocardial distribution of 99mTc-MIBI. Because AC + SC may introduce false defects, it must not be applied to normal perfused myocardium.
