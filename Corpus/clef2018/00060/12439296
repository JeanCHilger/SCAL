Current status of imaging in pancreatic diseases. Recent technological developments in multidetector CT allow pancreatic imaging in a single breath-hold, which is especially valuable in obtaining isotropic three-dimensional reformations that improve our ability to provide accurate preoperative vascular mapping. Advanced MR technology allows faster imaging of pancreas, thus facilitating MR cholangiopancreatography. Use of tissue-specific MR contrast agents, endoscopic ultrasound, and positron emission tomography (PET) in pancreatic imaging has evolved considerably. This review article discusses the roles of CT, MR, endoscopic ultrasound, and PET imaging in the pancreas.
