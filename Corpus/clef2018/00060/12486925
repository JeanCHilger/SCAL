Cerebral blood flow changes associated with intracerebral hemorrhage. Recent advances have furthered our understanding of changes in CBF after ICH. Recent evidence from experimental and clinical studies has not supported the role of CBF changes in the pathogenesis of neuronal injury. A better understanding of these changes in ICH has modified the basis for formulating treatment strategies and developing innovative therapies.
