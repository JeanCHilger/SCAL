Evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics with perfusion MRI in childhood moyamoya disease. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the role of perfusion MRI and to compare the findings with those of conventional imaging in childhood moyamoya disease (MMD). Perfusion MRI was performed preoperatively on 13 cases of childhood MMD. Based on the perfusion MRI findings, patients were classified into four groups: those with normal regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and time to peak (TTP) (group 1, n = 2) those with normal rCBV and delayed TTP (group 2, n = 1)
