SPECT scans for monitoring response to pleconaril therapy in chronic enteroviral meningoencephalitis. Chronic enteroviral meningoencephalitis (CEMA) is a rare complication of immunodeficient individuals and may present as insidious intellectual deterioration. Diagnosis requires isolation or PCR identification of enterovirus from the CSF. Pleconaril, a novel anti-picornaviral compound is available on a compassionate release basis to treat patients with potentially life threatening enteroviral infection. Non-invasive neuroimaging is an important new technique for both the diagnosis of encephalitis and as an objective assessment of response to treatment. We report two immunodeficient patients, one with common variable immunodeficiency and one with HIV, with an insidious presentation of CEMA. In both patients, perfusion single photon emission tomography scans were effective in monitoring treatment, correlating with clinical and virological response to pleconaril.
