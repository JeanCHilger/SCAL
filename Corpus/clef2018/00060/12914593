Different corticostriatal patterns of L-DOPA utilization in patients with untreated schizophrenia and patients treated with classical antipsychotics or clozapine. Positron emission tomography (PET) has been shown to be of great importance in elucidating the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs. In psychotic patients L-[11C]DOPA PET has been used to demonstrate some differences in dopaminergic activity compared with that in healthy volunteers. Ten healthy volunteers were investigated with PET and L-[11C]DOPA. Ten drug-free patients with psychosis, nine stable schizophrenics treated with clozapine, and nine stable patients treated with classical antipsychotics were also investigated with L-[11C]DOPA. Principal-component analysis was employed for the analysis of L-[11C]DOPA Ki values across a number of corticostriatal brain regions. These data revealed a significant three-component model with clear-cut separation between healthy controls and patients with unmedicated schizophrenia. Stable optimal treatment with either classical neuroleptics or clozapine partially, albeit differentially, reversed the aberrant patterns seen in drug-free schizophrenia. It can thus be concluded that schizophrenia is associated with abnormal patterns of L-[11C]DOPA utilization in corticostriatal systems. Treatment with clozapine or classical neuroleptics induces partial, albeit differential, normalization of the abnormal patterns seen in untreated schizophrenia.
