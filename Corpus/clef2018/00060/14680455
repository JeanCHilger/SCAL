9th annual meeting of the Eating Disorders Research Society. The application of modern neurobiological probes to the field of eating disorders has yielded new and exciting insights into the underlying mechanisms and causes of these devastating conditions. Findings from neuroimaging studies and genetic investigations have further confirmed and expanded our understanding of the role of the serotonin system in anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa. In addition, reduced regional cerebral blood flow in the temporal lobes and related brain structures have been identified in patients with AN, even after recovery. These data may hold promise for the development of more effective treatment strategies for these often chronic and refractory conditions. Results of reported treatment studies demonstrate the role and effectiveness of psychotherapy for AN and 'eating disorder not otherwise specified' two eating disorders for which there is a paucity of empirically based treatments. Finally, more results from open studies of atypical antipsychotic medications in the treatment of AN are encouraging.
