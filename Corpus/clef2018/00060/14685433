A study on protozoan cysts, helminth eggs and larvae in pacifiers. Due to the high prevalence of enteroparasitoses among Brazilian children and the possible involvement of objects in carrying these diseases, a study was conducted to investigate the presence of protozoan cysts, larvae and helminth eggs in pacifiers.Over the period of March to December of 1993, 86 pacifiers of zero to seven-year-old children resident in Vila Promessa, a suburb in Alfenas, MG, were examined. The investigation of cysts, larvae and eggs was made by the microscopic exam of the sediment obtained from centrifuging the liquid resulting from washing the pacifiers. The results were evaluated by employing the percentile analysis. Along with the examination of the pacifiers, an interview was carried out with the people responsible for the children whose pacifiers were examined, aiming at detecting how much was known about the transmission of intestinal parasitoses and the proper hygiene of pacifiers.Among the 86 pacifiers examined, 10 were found to be contaminated (11.63%) and presenting eggs of Ascaris lumbricoides, Enterobius vermicularis, Trichuris trichiura, Taenia sp and Ancylostomatidae larvae.Pacifiers were found to be an important means of transmitting intestinal parasites in the age range studied what makes it a need to set a proper and persistent sanitary policy in fighting intestinal parasitoses.
