18FDG PET in the management of malignant lymphoma. To study the role and prospect of 18FDG PET imaging in patients with malignant lymphoma.Forty-four patients (73 studies) with malignant lymphoma underwent 18FDG PET imaging. Final diagnoses were proved histopathologically. Images obtained were analyzed using visual and semiquantitative analysis (SUV).Either nodal or extranodal tumor foci showed high 18FDG uptake. 18FDG PET led to correct diagnosis in 5 of 6 cases except 1 false negative case. PET imaging changed the staging in 4 of 6 cases pretherapeutically. Of the 16 cases in which either residual tumor mass or suspicious recurrence suggested by other imaging modalities, 18FDG PET confirmed relapse in 5, detected more lesions in 2 and showed no evidence of active tumor mass in 9. For the 3 patients with comparison between pre- or post-treatment PET imaging and 16 patients who only underwent post-treatment PET follow-up studies, therapeutic response was correctly evaluated.18FDG PET is a valuable non-invasive metabolic imaging modality in facilitating diagnosis and staging, evaluating therapeutic response, assessing clinical outcome and predicting prognosis in patients with lymphoma.
