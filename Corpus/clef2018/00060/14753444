Cerebral blood flow index image as a simple indicator for the fate of acute ischemic lesion. To evaluate the feasibility of utilizing cerebral blood flow (CBF) index images, we attempted to investigate 1) whether CBF index images can reveal the resulting infracted area, 2) whether the CBF index can correlate other modality (SPECT).DWI and DPI were obtained in 17 patients within 12 hours of stroke onset and follow up MRI. On three DPI delivered images, namely relative regional cerebral blood volume (rrCBV), uncorrected mean transit time (MTTu) and CBF index images, correlations between initial lesion volume of and follow up infarction volume of three images and rCBF images delivered with singular value decomposition (SVD) methods were assessed. Then 99mTc-ECD SPECT was taken immediately after MRI to correlate to MRI data.Among the three images, lesion volume of CBF index images against follow up infarct volume had the highest correlation (r = 0.995) to a linear fit and the slope was closest to 1.0 (0.91) and had identical accuracy to the regression coefficient of rCBF images. CBF index well correlated to SPECT delivered CBF.CBF index images can accurately predict final infarct volume. Evaluating CBF index images together with DWI can guide the initial assessment in the acute stage of cerebral ischemia.
