Adequacy and nutrition in pediatric peritoneal dialysis. Outcomes for pediatric peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are closely related to dialysis adequacy and nutrition, which need to be measured frequently using a number of laboratory parameters. Although the critical meaning of adequacy and nutrition in the long-term prognosis of dialyzed children is well-documented, PD prescriptions are still largely empirical. Our objective was to evaluate nutritional and dialytic parameters in PD children (urea, creatinine, and albumin excretion in dialysate and urine, and daily protein intake) to measure peritoneal equilibration test (PET) results, Kt/V, normalized equivalent of protein nitrogen appearance (nPNA) and nitrogen balance
