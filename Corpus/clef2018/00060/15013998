Prevalence of Bartonella clarridgeiae and Bartonella henselae in domestic cats from France and detection of the organisms in erythrocytes by immunofluorescence. The prevalence of Bartonella infection in a pet cat population from France was found to be 8.1% (8 of 99 cats). The intraerythrocytic location of Bartonella clarridgeiae is shown for the first time, and we show that immunofluorescence detection of the organism in erythrocytes correlates with the number of bacteria in blood.
