3-Pyridyl ethers as SPECT radioligands for imaging nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. To develop a suitable single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) radioligand for neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) that displays faster in vivo kinetics than 5-[123I]iodo-A-85380, we synthesised the radioiodinated analogue of A-84543. 5-[123I]Iodo-A-84543 was prepared by electrophilic iododestannylation in a modest yield of 23%. In the baboon brain, 5-[123I]iodo-A-85380 displayed a profile consistent with the known distribution of nAChRs, however, 5-[123I]iodo-A-84543 displayed a homogenous uptake with no preferential localisation in regions known to contain nAChRs. To examine the effect of halogen substitution on the 3-pyridyl ether, A-84543, the 5-chloro, 5-bromo and 5-iodo analogues were synthesised and evaluated with respect to nAChR binding. In vitro binding data revealed that halogen substitution at the 5-position of A-84543 was not well tolerated with an increase in halogen size resulting in lower binding towards nAChRs. The 5-chloro analogue 4 displayed highest affinity, Ki =1.3 nM, compared to the 5-bromo and 5-iodo compounds, 5 Ki =3.3 nM and 3 Ki =40.8 nM, respectively. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that 5-[123I]iodo-A-84543 is not suitable for the study of nAChRs in vivo using SPECT.
