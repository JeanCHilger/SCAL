Non-small cell lung cancer: evaluation of pleural abnormalities on CT scans with 18F FDG PET. To evaluate the accuracy of fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in differentiation of pleural malignancy and cancer-unrelated pleural disease in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pleural abnormalities at computed tomography (CT).In 92 patients, pleural abnormalities were detected at contrast material-enhanced thoracic CT, which was performed for newly diagnosed NSCLC (n = 41) or restaging (n = 51). CT findings were negative for pleural malignancy when pleural effusion with attenuation of 10 HU or less and/or rib fractures with no evidence of pathologic fracture were present findings were indeterminate when pleural effusion with attenuation greater than 10 HU and/or solid pleural abnormalities without osseous destruction of the chest wall were presentIn detection of pleural malignancies, CT findings were indeterminate in 65 (71%) patients and true-negative in 27 (29%). Respective sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of FDG PET in detection of pleural malignancies were 100%, 71%, 63%, 100%, and 80% and those of CT and FDG PET combined, 100%, 76%, 67%, 100%, and 84%.Findings suggest that a negative FDG PET scan for indeterminate pleural abnormalities at CT indicates a benign character, while positive findings on an FDG PET scan are sensitive for malignancy.
