Effects of cardiac resynchronization therapy on myocardial perfusion reserve. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a relatively new treatment strategy for patients with heart failure and mechanical asynchrony. Reported effects of CRT on regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) are conflicting, and effects on hyperemic MBF are scarce. The aim of the present study was to assess serial changes of MBF and MBF reserve in patients receiving a biventricular pacemaker.Fourteen patients with heart failure (NYHA class III or IV left ventricular ejection fraction <35%), QRS width >120 ms, and sinus rhythm were studied (mean age, 58+/-10 yearsResting MBF is unaltered by CRT despite an increase in left ventricular function. However, the distribution pattern of resting MBF becomes more homogeneous. Hyperemic MBF and consequently MBF reserve are enhanced by CRT.
