Prevalence of wheeze among preschool children in Basra governonate, southern Iraq. A community-based survey was carried out in Basra governorate, Iraq, to estimate the prevalence of wheeze among children under 5 years old and to identify possible risk factors. It was found that 15.8% of the 424 preschool children enrolled in the study had a history of wheeze. More wheezy children lived in the city (16.3%) than in the rural area (15.0%). Family history of asthma in first-degree relatives was significantly associated with wheeze (44.8% of children with wheeze versus 15.1% without wheeze). Other household factors--parents' low educational level, formula or supplemental feeding as a baby, overcrowding, smoking at home, pet ownership and using kerosene--were associated with wheeze, but the results were not statistically significant. The role of environmental factors and feeding patterns needs to be further evaluated.
