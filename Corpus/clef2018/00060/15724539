Performance of a block detector PET scanner in imaging non-pure positron emitters--modelling and experimental validation with 124I. The key performance measures of resolution, count rate, sensitivity and scatter fraction are predicted for a dedicated BGO block detector patient PET scanner (GE Advance) in 2D mode for imaging with the non-pure positron-emitting radionuclides 124I, 55Co, 61Cu, 62Cu, 64Cu and 76Br. Model calculations including parameters of the scanner, decay characteristics of the radionuclides and measured parameters in imaging the pure positron-emitter 18F are used to predict performance according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) NU 2-1994 criteria. Predictions are tested with measurements made using 124I and show that, in comparison with 18F, resolution degrades by 1.2 mm radially and tangentially throughout the field-of-view (prediction: 1.2 mm), count-rate performance reduces considerably and in close accordance with calculations, sensitivity decreases to 23.4% of that with 18F (prediction: 22.9%) and measured scatter fraction increases from 10.0% to 14.5% (prediction: 14.7%). Model predictions are expected to be equally accurate for other radionuclides and may be extended to similar scanners. Although performance is worse with 124I than 18F, imaging is not precluded in 2D mode. The viability of 124I imaging and performance in a clinical context compared with 18F is illustrated with images of a patient with recurrent thyroid cancer acquired using both [124I]-sodium iodide and [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose.
