Carcinoid tumors of the lung and multimodal therapy. To report our experience with bronchial carcinoids.From January 1990 to March 2003 we treated 42 such patients, 30 females and 12 males. All patients underwent preoperative total body computed tomography (CT), total body In-111 octreotide scintigraphy, and SPECT of the thorax, with evaluation of serum levels of CEA, CgA, NSE, and urinary 5-HIAA. Diagnosis was obtained in 28 patients with fibre-optic bronchoscopy and in 14 patients with CT-guided trans-thoracic needle biopsy.There were 26 typical and 16 atypical carcinoids. 30 lobectomies, 5 bilobectomies, 6 wedge resections, and 1 pneumonectomy were carried out. The 3-year and the 5-year survival rates in the typical and atypical carcinoid groups were 100 % and 96 % vs. 81 % and 68 %, respectively (p < 0.001).Long-term survival is based on histological completeness of surgical treatment. Octreotide scintigraphy and SPECT document N (1) and N (2) precisely.
