Central-type benzodiazepine receptors and epileptogenesis: basic mechanisms and clinical validity. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A/benzodiazepine receptors (BZRs) play an important inhibitory role in epileptogenesis. [123I]Iomazenil (123I-IMZ) is a specific ligand for central-type (or neuronal-type) BNRs and is available for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in brain disorders. We demonstrated alterations of central-type BZRs in human focal epilepsies and their experimental models.We examined interictal 123I-IMZ SPECT in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE n = 19) with hippocampal sclerosis and neocortical epilepsy with focal cortical dysplasia (NE-CDIn MTLE patients, the epileptogenic hippocampus often showed decreases in both 123I-IMZ and 123I-IMP SPECT. Consistent with those, marked reduction of 125I-IMZ binding was observed in hippocampal CA1-3 regions of the kainate model, which clearly paralleled pyramidal neuronal loss. In contrast, 125I-IMZ binding was increased in the dentate gyrus at 1 month but returned to the normal level at 3-6 months, when frequent spontaneous seizures appeared. The amygdala-kindling model demonstrated similar increases in 125I-IMZ binding in the dentate gyrus without any changes in other brain regions. In NE-CD patients, the epileptogenic foci showed decreased 123I-IMZ binding with relatively normal 123I-IMP SPECT. 125I-IMZ binding also was decreased in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus (areas CA1, 2, and 4), and caudate/putamen of the in-utero irradiation model.These results indicate that central-type BZRs neuroimaging is useful for detection of epileptogenic foci, but their alterations differ between epilepsy subtypes and time-courses.
