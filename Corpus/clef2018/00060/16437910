Positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose in gastro-entero-pancreatic tumors: diagnostic role and prognostic implications. From November 1994 to November 2004, seventy-seven patients with neuroendocrine gastro-entero-pancreatic tumor (71% pancreatic) were investigated with 18-fluorine-deoxi-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). PET results were compared with CT-scan, MRI and octreoscan scintigraphy and clinico-pathologic features of patients and survival. Overall PET sensitivity was 57% 78% of malignant tumors, 67% of borderline and 17% of benign tumors were detected by FDG-PET. No duodenal tumor was detected by PET scan. Only 16% of primary less than 2 cm in size was localized. In 16% of cases PET scan provided new information able to change therapeutic management. In PET positive patients the addictive information obtained by PET scan when compared with octreoscan, MRI and CT scan were respectively 50% more, 26% more and 30% more. In malignant neuroendocrine tumors PET positivity was related to short survival. No patient with malignant tumor died for disease progression in the follow-up when PET was negative, while 13/35 PET positive patients died (p <0.003). FDG-PET proved to be a second line technique in neuroendocrine digestive tumors. PET results improve clinical staging of disease and is related to survival in malignant cases
