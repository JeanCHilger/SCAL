Multimodal treatment of gastric MALT lymphoma: our experience. Primary gastric lymphoma (PGL) is rare, but its incidence is increasing. It represents 52% of all extranodal GI tract lymphomas. The majority of PGLs are B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas or a high grade, diffuse, large cell lymphoma. The development of gastric mucosa associated lymphoid tissue is dependent on Helicobacter pylori infection. From January 2000 to February 2004, 10 patients were observed in the Unit of Surgical Oncology at Morgagni-Pierantoni Hospital in Forl√¨ (6 F, 4 M), mean age was 68.3 (range, 45-86). Diagnosis was made in all patients by endoscopy and biopsies of gastric mucosa, US endoscopy and TC-PET. According to the Ann-Arbor classification modified by Musshoff, 6 patients were stage IE(1), 1 IE(2), 1 IIIE. 2 IV. Four and two patients underwent distal or total gastrectomy. respectively. Chemotherapy was performed in three patients, RT in one patient. Complete remission was observed in patients submitted to surgery and chemotherapy alone. No mortality and morbidity were observed. The treatment of LGP is not standardized yet. The role of surgery in the treatment of primary gastric lymphoma has been recently re-evaluated. Traditionally surgical treatment was aggressive, more recently radical gastrectomy is disputed and considered unnecessary. Conservative surgery and combined treatment is considered more appropriate for localized gastric lymphoma.
