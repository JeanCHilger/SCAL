Early positron emission tomography (PET) restaging: a predictive final response in Hodgkin's disease patients. It is important to distinguish between responders to standard treatment and non-responders Hodgkin's disease (HD) patients.Between June 2003-September 2004, in our institute, 40 newly-diagnosed patients with advanced stage HD were consecutively treated with ABVD chemotherapy for six cycles. All these patients underwent staging/restaging: computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) at time 0, PET after two cycles, CT and PET after four and six cycles.After two cycles (PET-2), the PET was negative in 28/40 (70%), positive in 8/40 (20%), and minimal residual uptake (MRU) was present in the remaining four (10%) patients. After treatment, among eight patients who were PET-2+, seven showed refractory disease and one had relapse after 3 months. All four patients with MRU at the PET-2 became PET- during the further four cycles and, after treatment, three were in complete response (CR) and one relapsed after 5 months. All 28 PET negative patients at the PET-2 remained PET negative and all of them were in CR after treatment.The PET use for early (after two cycles) response assessment in HD patients is a significant step forward and has the potential to help physicians make crucial decisions about further treatment.
