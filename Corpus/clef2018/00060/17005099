Cerebellar lesions in tuberous sclerosis complex: neurobehavioral and neuroimaging correlates. We assessed the structural and functional imaging features of cerebellar lesions and their neurobehavioral correlates in a large cohort of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. A consecutive series of 78 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies with [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and alpha-[(11)C]methyl-l-tryptophan (AMT) as part of their evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Neurobehavioral assessment included the Gilliam Autism Rating Scales (GARS) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS). Twenty-one patients (27%) had cerebellar lesions (10 boys mean age 9 +/- 8 years
