Current trends in functional imaging of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. Most pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas should be evaluated with anatomical imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) followed by functional imaging (nuclear medicine modalities). Functional imaging assures that the tumor is indeed a pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma and enables more thorough localization, especially detecting as many lesions as possible (in particular for metastatic disease). Functional imaging for pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas, can use radiolabeled ligands specific for pathways of synthesis, metabolism, and inactivation of catecholamines or nonspecific ligands. In an overview of the available nuclear medicine modalities, we summarize the accumulated experience and recommend when functional imaging should be applied to patients with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma.
