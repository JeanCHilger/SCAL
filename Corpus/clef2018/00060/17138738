NEMA NU 2-2001 performance measurements of an LYSO-based PET/CT system in 2D and 3D acquisition modes. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) NU 2-2001 performance measurements were conducted on the Discovery RX, a whole-body PET/CT system under development by GE Healthcare. The PET scanner uses 4.2 x 6.3 x 30 mm lutetium yttrium orthosilicate (LYSO) crystals grouped in 9 x 6 blocks. There are 24 rings with 630 crystals per ring and the ring diameter is 88.6 cm. The transaxial and axial fields of view are 70.0 and 15.7 cm, respectively. The scanner has retractable septa and can operate in both 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) modes. 2D acquisitions use ring differences of +/-4 for direct and +/-5 for cross slices 3D acquisitions use a ring difference of 23. The coincident window width is 6.5 ns and the energy window is 425-650 keV. Other than the detectors, the system uses the same hardware and software as a Discovery ST. The CT scanner is a 16-slice LightSpeedPerformance measurements of sensitivity, spatial resolution, image quality, scatter fraction and counting rate performance, and image quality were obtained using NEMA methodology.The system sensitivity in 2D and 3D was measured as 1.7 cps/kBq and 7.3 cps/kBq, respectively. The transaxial resolution for 2D (3D) was 5.1 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) (5.0 mm) at 1 cm from gantry center and the radial and tangential resolutions were 5.9 mm (5.9 mm) and 5.1 mm (5.2 mm) at 10 cm, respectively. The axial resolution for 2D (3D) was 4.8 mm FWHM (5.8 mm) and 6.3 mm (6.5 mm) at 1 cm and 10 cm from gantry center, respectively. The scatter fraction was 13.1% and 31.8% in 2D and 3D. The peak noise equivalent count rate (NECR) was 155 kcps at 92.1 kBq/mL in 2D and 117.7 kcps at 21.7 kBq/mL in 3D for a noise-free estimation of randoms. The contrast of the 22, 17, 13, and 10 mm hot spheres in the image quality phantom in 2D (3D) were 74.6% (72.4%), 56.7% (59.5%), 46.2% (44.6%), and 17.9% (18.0%), respectively.The Discovery RX is a scanner that possesses high NECR, low scatter fraction, and good spatial resolution characteristics.
