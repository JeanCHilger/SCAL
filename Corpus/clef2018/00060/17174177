Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiomyopathy and the most common cause of cardiac death in young athletes in the U.S. Noninvasive imaging plays an important role in detecting the disease, understanding its pathophysiology, and selecting as well as guiding appropriate therapy.
