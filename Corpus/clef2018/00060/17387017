A kit method for the high level synthesis of [211At]MABG. meta-[(211)At]Astatobenzylguanidine ([(211)At]MABG), an analogue of meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) labeled with the alpha-emitter (211)At, targets the norepinephrine transporter. Because MABG has been shown to have excellent characteristics in preclinical studies, it has been considered to be a promising targeted radiotherapeutic for the treatment of tumors such as micrometastatic neuroblastoma that overexpress the norepinephrine transporter. To facilitate clinical evaluation of this agent, a convenient method for the high level synthesis of [(211)At]MABG that is adaptable for kit formulation has been developed. A tin precursor anchored to a solid-support was treated with a methanolic solution of (211)At in the presence of a mixture of H(2)O(2)/HOAc as the oxidant [(211)At]MABG was isolated by simple solid-phase extraction. By using C-18 solid-phase extraction, the radiochemical yield from 25 batches was 63+/-13%
