Diagnosis of maxillofacial tumor with L-3-[18f]-fluoro-alpha-methyltyrosine (FMT) PET: a comparative study with FDG-PET. To compare L-3-[18F]-fluoro-a-methyltyrosine (FMT)-positron emission tomography (PET) and 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-PET in the differential diagnosis of maxillofacial tumors.This study included 36 patients (16 males, 20 females 31-90 years old) with untreated malignant tumors (34 squamous cell carcinoma, one mucoepidermoid carcinoma, one rhabdomyosarcoma) and seven patients (five males, two femalesThe mean SUV of the malignant lesions were significantly higher than those of the benign lesions in both FMT-PET (2.62 +/- 1.58 vs. 1.20 +/- 0.30, p < 0.01) and FDG-PET (9.17 +/- 5.06 vs. 3.14 +/- 1.34, p < 0.01). A positive correlation (r = 0.567, p < 0.0001, n = 46) was noted between FMT and FDG. ROC analysis revealed that there was no statistically significant difference in SUVs between FMT and FDG for differentiating malignant tumors. In 27 of 36 patients, FMT-PET had better contrast of malignant tumor visualization to the surrounding normal structures by visual assessment (p < 0.005, binomial proportion test).Differential diagnosis of FMT-PET based on the uptake in maxillofacial tumors is equivalent to FDG-PET. However, the contrast of FMT uptake between maxillofacial tumors and the surrounding normal structures is higher than that of FDG, indicating the possibility of accurate diagnosis of maxillofacial tumors by FMT-PET.
