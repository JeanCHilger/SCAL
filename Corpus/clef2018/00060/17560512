Advances in metabolic imaging for surgical oncology. This review focuses on several aspects of molecular imaging. First, current positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scanner technology and several novel imaging techniques that are being developed are briefly discussed. Next, current clinical indications for (18)F FDG PET and PET/CT that are relevant to the surgical oncologist are discussed. Finally, advances in molecular imaging that may herald the next generation of PET radiotracers beyond (18)F FDG are reviewed.
