The use of imaging in the diagnosis and staging of hepatobiliary malignancies. This review addresses the optimal use of imaging in the diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning of patients with hepatobiliary neoplasms. We focus on primary liver cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma as well as extrahepatic biliary tract malignancies, including hilar cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer. In each section, we provide an overview of the staging requirements for each disease followed by a discussion of various imaging modalities that can be used to optimally stage the disease and plan therapy.
