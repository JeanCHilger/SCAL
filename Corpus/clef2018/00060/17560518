Contemporary imaging for colorectal cancer. With improvements in therapy for colorectal cancer, accurate imaging has taken on an increased significance. Preoperative diagnosis of metastatic disease helps identify patients who could undergo combined resection or might benefit from systemic therapy before surgery. Accurate imaging of rectal cancer is critical in evaluating locally advanced disease treatable by combined modality therapy, including chemoradiation and surgery. Postoperative imaging enhances identification of recurrent disease that might be amenable to salvage surgery.
