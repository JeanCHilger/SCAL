Peripheral artery tonometry demonstrates altered endothelial function in children with type 1 diabetes. To assess the ability of reactive hyperemia-peripheral artery tonometry (RH-PAT) to serve as a surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D).Forty-four children with T1D [age 14.6 +/- 2.7 yr duration of diabetes 6.01 +/- 4 yrChildren with T1D had endothelial dysfunction as evidenced by lower mean RH-PAT scores (1.63 +/- 0.5) when compared with children without diabetes (mean RH-PAT score 1.95 +/- 0.3) (p = 0.01). Repeat RH-PAT scores were predicted by initial RH-PAT scores (p = 0.0025). Mean intrapatient standard deviation of RH-PAT score was 0.261 and mean coefficient of variation was 14.8. Variations in RH-PAT score were not explained by differences in glucose, HbA1c, BMI, systolic BP, diastolic BP, or lipids.Although larger validation studies are required, RH-PAT is a promising non-invasive technique to assess endothelial function in children with T1D. Non-invasive measures of endothelial dysfunction may provide the additional risk stratification data needed to justify more aggressive primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in children with T1D.
