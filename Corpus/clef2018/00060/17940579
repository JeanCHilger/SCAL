Study on neuroreceptor imaging with radionuclide tracing in vivo. Neuroreceptor imaging with radionuclide tracing in vivo has been greatly developed recently. Distribution, density, and activity of receptors in the brain can be visualized by the radioligands labeled for emission computed tomography (ECT), including PET (positron emission tomography) and SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography). The functional and quantitative imaging for several receptors, such as dopamine receptors, serotonin receptors, cholinergic receptors, benzodiazepine receptors, and opioid receptors, has clinical importance. The preparation of receptor imaging agents, foundation of the physio-mathematical model, and the development of nuclear medicine instruments are the main points. In the present review, we will concentrate on introducing the development of brain receptor imaging.
