Change of cerebral metabolism rate of glucose of cerebral white matter in Alzheimer's disease: a study with statistical parametric mapping software. To study the change of cerebral metabolism rate of glucose (CMRglc) of cerebral white matter in Alzheimer's Disease.Positron emission tomography (PET) was performed on 13 AD patients, 6 with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and 7 without BPSD, and 10 healthy controls. The regional cerebral metabolism of glucose (rCMRglc) of some brain regions and nuclei were detected.(1) The rCMRglc of the cerebral white matter decreased extensively in the AD patients, especially in the right frontal lobe, superior gyrus of the left frontal lobe (P = 0.001). (2) The rCMRglc of subcortical white matter of the left medial prefrontal lobe and the left cuneus of occipital lobe increased in the AD patients. (3) The levels of rCMRglc of the subcortical white matter of both side middle occipital lobe, left cuneus of occipital lobe, right inferior parietal lobule, left fusiform gyrus of temporal lobe and the left medial prefrontal lobe were all significantly higher in the AD patients with BPSD than in those without BPSD (P = 0.001). While the levels of rCMRglc of the subcortical white matter of both side paracentral lobule, right superior and middle frontal lobe, and left superior temporal lobe were all significantly lower in the AD patients with BPSD than in those without BPSD (all P = 0.001).There is diffuse abnormal rCMRglc in the cerebral white matter in the AD patients: the rCMRglc decreases in the frontal-temporal-occipital association area, and the rCMRglc of the medial prefrontal lobe and cuneus of occipital lobe increases. BPSD is correlated with the abnormal metabolism of related cerebral regions.
