Performance of QPET, a high-resolution 3D PET imaging system for small volumes. QPET is a positron imaging system developed at Queen's University for high-resolution, 3D imaging of small volumes it includes a pair of planar gamma-ray detectors 25.4 cm square, which rotate about a central axis with a quasi-cylindrical geometry. The authors describe the performance of this system. Basic characteristics of the detectors are evaluated: a spatial sampling of 1 mm, a quantum efficiency of 9.3% (for 511 keV gamma rays with normal incidence), and a time resolution of 88 ns. Models are developed to characterize the system deadtime and the sensitivity in terms of the noise-equivalent counting rate. With an 8 cm diameter spherical source, the noise-equivalent counting rate reaches a maximum at just over 3 kcps for an activity concentration of 2 muCi/cc
