A Regularizing Method for Quantitative SPECT Reconstruction. The problem of successive transverse plane reconstruction in single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) is modeled in its more general form, which implies the definition of emission tomographic operators (ETO's) for which an analytical solution can be derived. The properties of the attenuated tomographic operator (ATO) are described and discussed, including the attenuation which is distributed on the reconstruction domain. For this particular operator, a regularizing method (RIM) is proposed, for which it is demonstrated and tested with simulation studies that a filtered, accurate solution can be extracted for the tomographic images as obtained using a single photon emission tomograph based on a rotating gamma camera in clinical use.
