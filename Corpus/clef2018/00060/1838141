Dynamic SPECT in two healthy volunteers to determine the optimal time for in vivo D2 dopamine receptor imaging with 123I-IBZM using the rotating gamma camera. Dynamic SPECT was performed in two healthy male volunteers with a single slice brain dedicated camera (Strichman Medical Equipment 810, first study) and a rotating gamma camera (Siemens Dual Rota ZLC37, second study) to obtain information about the optimal imaging time for the dopamine D2 receptor specific ligand 123I-(S)-(-)-2-hydroxy-3-iodo-6-methoxy-N[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl) methyl]-benzamide (123I-IBZM). Count rates in the basal ganglia and in several cerebral cortical regions were used to define specific and aspecific binding, respectively. On the basis of the first study, 90-150 min seemed the optimal time for rotating gamma camera 123I-IBZM-SPECT. On the basis of the second study the optimal period was considered to be 60-120 min. It is recommended to apply the same imaging time after injection in a protocol to all patients and volunteers as otherwise a comparison may not be reliable.
