SPECT imaging of dopamine D2 receptors with 123I-IBZM: initial experience in controls and patients with Parkinson's syndrome and Wilson's disease. 123I-(S-)-2-hydroxy-3-iodo-6-methoxy-N[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl) methyl]-benzamide (123I-IBZM) is a highly selective CNS D2 dopamine receptor ligand suitable for SPECT. This study reports on IBZM-SPECT findings in 60 patients including eight controls and 52 patients presenting with disorders of the dopaminergic system, including idiopathic Parkinson's syndrome (IPS) (n = 18), Parkinson's syndromes of other aetiology (PS) (n = 24) and Wilson's disease (n = 10). SPECT was performed 2 h p.i. of 185 MBq 123I-IBZM. For semiquantitative evaluation basal ganglia to frontal cortex ratios (BG/FC ratios) were calculated. In controls BG/FC ratios of 1.55 +/- 0.05 S.D. were observed. Findings in IPS patients (BG/FC ratio: 1.51 +/- 0.05) were not different from controls. In PS patients striatal IBZM binding (BG/FC ratio: 1.35 +/- 0.11) was significantly (P less than 0.001) lower compared to the control and IPS groups. Asymptomatic patients with Wilson's disease presented normal IBZM binding. In those with neurologic symptoms IBZM fixation was markedly reduced. IBZM-SPECT has shown to be a suitable means for in vivo imaging of striatal dopamine D2 receptors in controls and various disorders of the dopaminergic system. Our preliminary data suggest that IBZM-SPECT is potentially useful for discriminating between IPS and PS (sensitivity: 100% specificity: 83%). In patients with Wilson's disease IBZM accumulation seems to correlate with the presence of neurologic symptoms.
