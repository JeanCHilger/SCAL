Prediction and diagnosis of bone metastases in well-differentiated gastro-entero-pancreatic endocrine cancer: a prospective comparison of whole body magnetic resonance imaging and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. Our purpose was to compare the sensitivity of whole body (WB) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) for the diagnosis of bone metastases (BMs) in patients with well-differentiated gastro-entero-pancreatic endocrine cancer (WD-GEP-EC) and to determine predictive factors of BM.WB-MRI and SRS were prospectively performed in 79 patients with bronchial (11), thymic (five), gastric (two), duodeno-pancreatic (24), ileal (26), colic (one), or unknown primary (10) WD-GEP-EC.A total of 36 patients (46%) had 333 BMs involving 119 skeletal segments. WB-MRI and SRS were equally sensitive for detecting patients with BM (86 vs. 81% P = 0.56), with 33% of the patients diagnosed with only one procedure. WB-MRI detected more BMs than SRS (80 vs. 57%We recommend bone staging with SRS and spine MRI in all patients with bronchial-thymic or unknown primary WD-GEP-EC. In case of duodeno-pancreatic or ileal primary, bone imaging may be restricted to patients with liver metastases.
