The first experience in monitoring the cerebral vascular autoregulation in the acute period of severe brain injury. The paper presents the first experience in monitoring the pressure reactivity index (Prx) of cerebral vascular autoregulation in a group of patients with severe brain injury. This autoregulation index along with the monitored parameters of intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) allows the outcome to be predicted in brain injury: the outcome is poor at a Prx of > 0.2. The continuous estimation of the autoregulation index makes it possible to determine the optimum CPP value for each patient and to timely diagnose decompensation of cerebral vascular autoregulation, which is of importance in selecting treatment policy.
