Positron emission tomography for modeling pathophysiological processes in vivo. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful tool for imaging and quantifying (patho)physiological processes in the human body. PET has been successfully used for staging diseases and evaluating response to treatment. Furthermore, PET may contribute to drug development and individualized treatment planning. This article reviews the use of several PET tracers in drug development and their clinical application in the fields of neurology, oncology and cardiology.
