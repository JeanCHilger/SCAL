Staging imagenology in coronary syndromes. For the physician, it should stand out very clearly that the clinical and rationale analysis of the symptoms observed in every patient suffering from stable chronic ischemic cardiopathy (SCIC) or acute coronary ischemic syndrome (ACIS), are the starting point to apply the available resources in imagenology, in order to apply in an optimized and sequential manner to stratify, without forgetting its inherent limitations, or identify its risk. This approach may be based on the ethics, with special emphasis on the patient economy, which may promote the use of indissoluble medical principles regarding never damaging, but improving, the survival. SCIC and ACIS prevalence is still very high in its actually recognized clinical-pathological avenues.
