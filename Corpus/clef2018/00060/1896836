Fish and their significance from the international and Swiss viewpoints. In landlocked countries, the role of fish is often poorly known and/or propagated. In many countries fish represent the biggest and qualitatively most valuable protein source (24% of the worldwide available animal protein) for human consumption. At present the economic significance of the production and trade of fish is already very high. However, according to FAO, the future demand of proteins can only be covered by a considerable expansion of the aquaculture production, in particular because of a stagnated fish catch and a continuous reduction of the agricultural production. The ideational value of ornamental fish appears obvious however pet fish keeping represents also a value worth of many millions US dollars worldwide. Finally the importance of fish will not only increase for economic, but certainly also for ecological reasons, because it is well established as an incorruptible bioindicator of our environment.
