Comparison of antiviral activity between FeIFN-omega and FeIFN-alpha. Both IFN-omega and IFN-alpha belong to type I interferon and have antiviral, antiproliferative, immunomodulatory activities, but their bioactivities are usually different. FeIFN-omega gene was amplified by PCR. FeIFN-alpha gene was synthesized based on the published sequences of GenBank. Then the two types of feline interferon genes were subcloned into the pET-His vector, and expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3). Recombinant interferons were purified by affinity chromatography with immobilized nickel chelating NTA (Ni-NTA) and their antiviral activity was estimated according to the ability of IFNs to inhibit the cytopathic effects (CPE) of virus on cells. Results showed that the antiviral activities against various viruses of FeIFN-omega were higher than those of FeIFN-alpha. Against H9N2 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) and canine distemper virus (CDV), the antiviral activities of FeIFN-omega were 160 folds and 4 folds higher than those of FeIFN-alpha.
