18F-FDG uptake and EGFR mutations in patients with non-small cell lung cancer: a single-institution retrospective analysis. This retrospective study was performed to evaluate a possible association between the presence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and the standardized uptake value (SUV) of (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose ((18)F-FDG) uptake in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We included 100 patients who were tested for EGFR mutations by direct sequencing of resected tissues and who underwent preoperative positron emission tomography/computed tomography at the time of diagnosis. The maximum SUV by the primary tumor was chosen for further analysis. EGFR mutations in exons 19 and 21 were detected in 21 NSCLC patients (21%). EGFR mutations were more frequent in never-smokers than ever-smokers (35% versus 11% P=0.003), in adenocarcinomas than non-adenocarcinomas (34% versus 6%
