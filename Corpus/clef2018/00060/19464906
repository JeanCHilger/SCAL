Preoperative intrathoracic lymph node staging in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer: accuracy of integrated positron emission tomography and computed tomography. To evaluate the accuracy of integrated positron emission tomography with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and computed tomography (PET/CT) in preoperative intrathoracic lymph node staging in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to ascertain the role of invasive staging in verifying positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) results.Retrospective, single institution study of consecutive patients with suspected or pathologically proven, potentially resectable NSCLC undergoing integrated PET/CT scanning in the same PET centre. Lymph node staging was pathologically confirmed on tissue specimens obtained at mediastinoscopy and/or thoracotomy. Statistical evaluation of PET/CT results was performed on a per-patient and per-nodal-station bases.A total of 1001 nodal stations (723 mediastinal, 148 hilar and 130 intrapulmonary) were evaluated in 159 patients. Nodes were positive for malignancy in 48 (30.2%) out of 159 patients (N1=17 N2=30Our data show that integrated PET/CT provides high specificity but low sensitivity and accuracy in intrathoracic nodal staging of NSCLC patients and underscore the continued need for surgical staging.
