Autoimmune limbic encephalitis. Autoimmune limbic encephalitis (LE) can arise both by paraneoplastic and non-paraneoplastic mechanisms. Patients with LE usually have a subacute onset of memory impairment, disorientation and agitation, but can also develop seizures, hallucinations and sleep disturbance. The following investigations may aid the diagnosis: analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and neuronal antibodies in the serum and CSF. Neuronal antibodies are sometimes, but not always, pathogenic. Autoimmune LE may respond to corticosteroids, intravenous IgG (IVIG) or plasma exchange. The cornerstone of paraneoplastic LE therapy is resection of the tumour and/or oncological treatment. Several differential diagnoses must be excluded, among them herpes simplex encephalitis.
