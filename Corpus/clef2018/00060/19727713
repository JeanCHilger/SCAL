Unifying the predictive value of pretransplant FDG PET in patients with lymphoma: a review and meta-analysis of published trials. The predictive value of (18)F-FDG PET in patients with relapsing/refractory lymphoma who are receiving high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation(ASCT) remains a matter of debate. Seminal reports on pretransplant ASCT indicated an adverse prognosis in patients with positive FDG PET scans. The lack of a uniform outcome measure along with the mixed histologies in various studies have hampered efforts to quantify this prognostic value.A MEDLINE review of published trials up to April 2009 identified 16 studies involving pretransplant FDG PET scans in lymphoma. Where progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were set as themain outcome measures, time-to-event data analysis was used to calculate the overall prognostic value of a pretransplant FDG-PET scan.Pooled survival data from seven eligible studies suggested a worse PFS in patients with a positive FDG PET study (HR 3.23, 95% CI 2.14 to 4.87). The OS pooled from six eligible studies was also significantly worse among patients with a positive FDG PET study (HR 4.53, 95%CI 2.50 to 8.22). No statistically significant heterogeneity was observed between studies for either outcome.Despite the documented clinical heterogeneity between studies, meta-analysis data confirmed the prognostic impact of pretransplant FDG PET in patients with lymphoma and provided a uniform measure of the association for both progression and survival after ASCT.
