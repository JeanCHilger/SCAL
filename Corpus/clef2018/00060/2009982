Risk factors for intra-operative neurological deficit during carotid endarterectomy. Although embolism is considered to be the major cause of intra-operative neurological deficit (IOND) during carotid endarterectomy, the possibility that patients may vary in susceptibility to ischaemic damage following minor embolisation or falls in cerebral perfusion pressure is rarely considered. A prospective study was undertaken in 60 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy to identify risk factors for IOND. The hypothesis was that patients with impaired cerebral vascular reserve (CVR) may be more vulnerable to intra-operative emboli or falls in cerebral perfusion pressure than normal subjects. Recent work using Positron Emission Tomography has indicated that the best index of CVR is the ratio of cerebral blood flow to cerebral blood volume, which is another expression for the reciprocal of mean cerebral transit time (MCTT). In this study, a new isotopic method of quantifying MCTT was used to identify patients with impaired CVR. Six patients (10%) recovered from anaesthesia with an IOND, only one of which was disabling. Significant risk factors for IOND were: (i) age over 65 years (Odds Ratio 13.0 (95%CI 1.4-121), p = 0.013) (ii) a residual neurological deficit prior to operation (Odds Ratio 7.0 (95%CE 1.1-43), p = 0.038)
