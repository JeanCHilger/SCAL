Synthesis and evaluation of 2-pyridylbenzothiazole, 2-pyridylbenzoxazole and 2-pyridylbenzofuran derivatives as 11C-PET imaging agents for beta-amyloid plaques. The syntheses and SAR of new series of beta-amyloid binding agents are reported. The effort to optimize signal-to-background ratios for these ligands are described. Compounds 8, 21 and 30 displayed desirable lipophilicity and pharmacokinetic properties. Compounds 8 and 21 were evaluated with in vitro autoradiographic studies and in vivo in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. It is shown that it was possible to increase the signal-to-background ratios compared to PIB 1, as demonstrated by compounds 8 and 21.
