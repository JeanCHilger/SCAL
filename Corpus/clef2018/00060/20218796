A single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) study of regional cerebral blood flow in bipolar disorder. Data on functional imaging of bipolar disorder (BD) utilizing single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) is limited. This study assessed regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), using (99m)Tc-ECD SPECT, among patients with BD, with mania (N=10) or depression (N=10), compared with 10 patients with unipolar depression and 10 normal controls. Regions of interest were analysed using a semi-automatic brain quantification programme. Compared to controls, patients with mania had significantly reduced perfusion mainly in the left frontal area, also in the left anterior cingulate and parietal cortices those with bipolar depression had significantly lowered rCBF principally in the anterior temporal regions bilaterally, as well as the left parietal area. Patients with unipolar depression had significantly lowered perfusion than controls in most of the regions examined, chiefly in the anterior temporal and frontal cortices bilaterally
