Regional brain metabolic correlates of self-reported depression severity contrasted with clinician ratings. We compared brain-map correlations of relative cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMRglu) with psychopathologic factors derived from the self-rated Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and factors from the clinician-rated Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) factors, seeking an anatomic basis for differences in self and clinician ratings.[(18)F]-FDG Positron Emission Tomography generated rCMRglu, SPM-estimated, voxel-level, brain correlation maps with BDI factor scores and HDRS factor scores in medication-free major depressive disorder.Regional brain correlates of BDI are more extensive than HDRS, even when adjusting for variance accounted for by the HDRS. Factors comprising the BDI were associated with distinct cortical and subcortical regions. The degree of overlap in factor correlation brain maps is explained by the variance shared by BDI and HDRS factor scores.Self and clinician-rated aspects of depression have common and distinct neuroanatomic correlates that reflect correlations between rating scales, but correlations between glucose metabolism and self-rated depression were anatomically more extensive in this sample. Findings highlight the importance and biological underpinnings of these subjective features of major depression.
