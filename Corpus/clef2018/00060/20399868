Imaging the effects of genetic polymorphisms on radioligand binding in the living human brain: A review on genetic neuroreceptor imaging of monoaminergic systems in psychiatry. Imaging genetics is a research field that describes the impact of genetic risk variants on brain structure and function. While magnetic resonance based imaging techniques are able to provide complex information on a system level, positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) allow for determination of distribution and density of single receptor molecules in the human brain. Major psychiatric disorders are highly heritable, and have been associated with a dysregulation in brain dopamine and serotonin systems. Understanding the role of genetic polymorphisms within these neurotransmitter systems on brain phenotype is essential. This review tries to cover the literature on the impact of gene variants implicated in psychiatric disorders on serotonin, dopamine, and MAO-A radioligand binding in living humans. The majority of PET and SPECT studies investigated the role of polymorphisms within genes coding for the serotonin and dopamine transporters, the serotonin 1A receptor, and the dopamine D2 receptor on G protein coupled receptors or transporter proteins critically involved in serotonin or dopamine neurotransmission. Other studies investigated the impact of variants in genes for monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) or brain derived neurotrophic factor on monoamine transporters, receptors, or MAO-A activity. Two main findings in healthy subjects emerge from the current literature: one is an increased binding of the selective ligand [(11)C]DASB to serotonin transporters in subjects homozygous for the triallelic 5-HTTLPR LA allele. The other one is decreased binding of the radioligand [(11)C]raclopride to dopamine D2 receptors in D2 Taq1 A1 allele carriers. Other findings reported are highly interesting but require independent replication.
