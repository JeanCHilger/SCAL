Proposal for standardization of 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) cardiac sympathetic imaging by the EANM Cardiovascular Committee and the European Council of Nuclear Cardiology. This proposal for standardization of (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (iobenguane, MIBG) cardiac sympathetic imaging includes recommendations for patient information and preparation, radiopharmaceutical, injected activities and dosimetry, image acquisition, quality control, reconstruction methods, attenuation, scatter and collimator response compensation, data analysis and interpretation, reports, and image display. The recommendations are based on evidence coming from original or scientific studies whenever possible and as far as possible reflect the current state-of-the-art in cardiac MIBG imaging. The recommendations are designed to assist in the practice of performing, interpreting and reporting cardiac sympathetic imaging. The proposed standardization does not include clinical indications, benefits or drawbacks of cardiac sympathetic imaging, and does not address cost benefits or cost effectiveness however, clinical settings of potential utility are mentioned. Standardization of MIBG cardiac sympathetic imaging should contribute to increasing its clinical applicability and integration into current nuclear cardiology practice.
