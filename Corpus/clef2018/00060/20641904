 Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a T-cell growth factor secreted by T lymphocytes (1). It stimulates the growth and differentiation of T cells, B cells, NK cells, LAK cells, monocytes, macrophages, and oligodendrocytes (2-4). High-affinity receptors are expressed mainly on activated T cells and macrophages (5), which infiltrate tumors, inflammatory tissues, and autoimmune tissues (6). Peripheral blood cells normally express very low levels of IL-2 receptor (7).
