Coronary artery phenotypes in subjects with negative myocardial perfusion imaging and typical angina pectoris. Limited data are available on coronary lesion morphology for patients with false-negative radionuclide findings together with typical angina symptoms.The study group consisted of 25 subjects with a negative pharmacological thallium (Tl)-201 single-photon emission computed tomography perfusion imaging study but typical angina symptoms and coronary artery disease (CAD) confirmed by coronary angiography. The control group included 690 subjects with a positive pharmacological Tl-201 single-photon emission computed tomography study and CAD.The study group showed a significantly older and higher female ratio than the control group. Significant differences were found between the 2 groups in the presence of current smoking status and hypertension. A noticeably higher percentage of positive metabolic syndrome ratio, number of metabolic syndrome components, high waist-to-hip ratio percentage and high waist circumference percentage in the study group. The study group was noticeably lower in mean numbers of culprit vessel involvement and mean lesion numbers than the control group. There were more individuals with type A classification and a lower proportion of complex stenoses--which contain type B2 and C lesions--in the study group than in the control group. The study group had significantly fewer calcified stenoses and complex morphology stenoses--the latter of which include lesion morphologies with chronic total occlusion, diffuse and calcification--than the control group.For the high probability of CAD lesions that requires interventional therapy, patients with negative myocardial scintigraphy but typical angina symptoms would be beneficial to intensive medical treatment and coronary study.
