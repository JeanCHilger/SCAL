Long-term follow up of cervical cancer patients with unexplained squamous cell carcinoma antigen elevation after post-therapy surveillance using positron emission tomography. We aimed to define the long-term follow-up results in cervical cancer patients with unexplained squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) elevation (negative conventional imaging studies, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) after definitive treatment using positron emission tomography (PET).Of the 27 women with unexplained SCC-Ag elevation, 13 died or were alive with disease (12 PET true-positive, one PET false-negative) in our previous report. In this study, we reported long-term follow-up results for all the 14 patients remaining cancer-free at cut-off of our previous analysis (seven with true-negative PET and two with false-positive PET, and five with true-positive PET having received successful curative salvage therapy).The seven patients with true-negative PET studies remained recurrence-free (median follow up, 70 months range, 11-84). Two patients had pelvic inflammatory diseaseCystitis or pelvic inflammatory disease may cause unexplained elevation of SCC-Ag after definitive treatment. A negative PET study usually indicates absence of disease. PET is a useful tool to identify curable recurrences, especially when SCC-Ag < 4 ng/mL.
