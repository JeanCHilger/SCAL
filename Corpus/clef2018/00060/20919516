Screening criteria for breast cancer. Breast cancer screening constitutes an integral part of surgical practice for many surgeons and is an important tool in the war against breast cancer. Among many modalities, mammography plays a central role, with MRI now being increasingly used for women with high risk for breast cancer. Current guidelines for screening are in the process of evolution as more scientific knowledge is gained. The challenge lies in developing cost-effective methods to reach the maximum number of the population at risk.
