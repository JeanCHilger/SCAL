Carbon-11-Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography imaging of amyloid deposition in presenilin 1 mutation carriers. (11)Carbon-Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography studies have suggested early and prominent amyloid deposition in the striatum in presenilin 1 mutation carriers. This cross-sectional study examines the (11)Carbon-Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography imaging profiles of presymptomatic and mildly affected (mini-mental state examination â‰¥ 20) carriers of seven presenilin 1 mutations, comparing them with groups of controls and symptomatic sporadic Alzheimer's disease cases. Parametric ratio images representing (11)Carbon-Pittsburgh compound B retention from 60 to 90 min were created using the pons as a reference region and nine regions of interest were studied. We confirmed that increased amyloid load may be detected in presymptomatic presenilin 1 mutation carriers with (11)Carbon-Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography and that the pattern of retention is heterogeneous. Comparison of presenilin 1 and sporadic Alzheimer's disease groups revealed significantly greater thalamic retention in the presenilin 1 group and significantly greater frontotemporal retention in the sporadic Alzheimer's disease group. A few individuals with presenilin 1 mutations showed increased cerebellar (11)Carbon-Pittsburgh compound B retention suggesting that this region may not be as suitable a reference region in familial Alzheimer's disease.
