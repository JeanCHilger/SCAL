Comparison of In-111 granulocytes and Tc-99m albumin colloid for bone marrow scintigraphy by the use of quantitative SPECT imaging. A comparison of In-111 oxinate labeled autologous granulocytes and Tc-99m albumin colloid for bone marrow scintigraphy is reported. The aim of this report was to determine if the intense uptake in the liver and spleen with nano-sized colloids, which hampers the evaluation of the skeletal parts surrounding the liver, is reduced by the use of radiolabeled granulocytes. This study is based on a retrospective analysis of 19 abdominal tomographic examinations with In-111 granulocytes performed to detect septic foci. After correction for attenuation and scattering of photons was performed, the uptake in the bone marrow of the lumbar spine was seen to be related to the liver, spleen, and tissue background activity. The results in this study were compared with corresponding data from 20 normal liver/spleen tomographic examinations performed with Tc-99m nanocolloid, which is routinely used for bone marrow scintigraphy. The bone marrow/liver activity ratio for granulocytes varied, but it exceeded the corresponding mean ratio for colloid in all examinations. The mean values for granulocyte uptake 3 and 20 hours after injection was, respectively, about 6 and almost 10 times higher than were those for colloid. The activity ratios between bone marrow and spleen as well as between bone marrow and tissue background was not improved and or may even have been reduced by the use of granulocytes. It is suggested that granulocytes labeled in vitro by Tc-99m hexamethylpropylene amineoxime (HMPAO) or in vivo by monoclonal antigranulocyte antibodies may provide techniques for improved bone marrow imaging.
