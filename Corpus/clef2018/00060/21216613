Role of prosthetic conduits in coronary artery bypass grafting. Prosthetic grafts are required for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) when the availability of suitable autologous conduits is limited. The ideal cardiovascular bypass graft requires a broad range of characteristics including strength, viscoelasticity, biocompatibility, blood compatibility and biostability. Many alternative conduits have been developed and used in the past, but most of them have failed, except in rare instances. This review aims to analyse the current status of their use and prospects for the future.
