Prostate cancer: 1HMRS-DCEMR at 3T versus [(18)F]choline PET/CT in the detection of local prostate cancer recurrence in men with biochemical progression after radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP). This study compares proton magnetic resonancespectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) combined techniques at 3T magnet versus [(18)F]choline PET/computed tomography (CT) in the detection of local prostate cancer recurrence in patients with biochemical progression after radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP).84 consecutive patients at high risk of local recurrence underwent combined 1HMRSI-DCEMR and 18-Fcholine- PET/CT. MR scan protocol included turbo spin echo (TSE) T2-weighted sequences in the axial, sagittal and coronal planes three-dimensional (3D) chemical shift imaging (CSI) sequences with spectral/spatial pulses optimized for quantitative detection of choline and citrateIn Group A combined 1H-MRSI and DCE-MRI showed a sensitivity of 92%, a specificity of 75% (PPV 96%) while PET-CT examination showed a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity of 50% (PPV 88%) in identifying local recurrence. The accuracy of MRI was 89% while PET-CT showed an accuracy of 60%. Areas under the ROC curve (AUC) values for MR and PET-CT were 0.833 and 0.562, respectively. In Group B combined 1H-MRSI and DCEMR showed a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 100% (PPV 100%) with accuracy of 94%. PET-CT had a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 33% (PPV 98%) with accuracy of 91%. The AUCs for MR and PET-CT values were 0.971 and 0.837, respectively.The diagnostic accuracy of combined 1HMRSI-DCEMR was higher than PET/CT to identify local prostate cancer recurrence, mostly in patients with low biochemical progression after RRP (0.2-2ng/mL).
