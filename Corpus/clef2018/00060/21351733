Radiosynthesis and biological evaluation of L- and D-S-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)homocysteine for tumor imaging using positron emission tomography. Interest in radiolabeled amino acids for metabolic imaging of cancer and limitations with [(11)C]methionine has prompted the development of a new (18)F-labeled methionine derivative S-(3-[(18)F]fluoropropyl)homocysteine ([(18)F]FPHCys). The L and D enantiomers of [(18)F]FPHCys were prepared from their respective protected S-(3-tosyloxypropyl)homocysteine precursors 1 by [(18)F]fluoride substitution using K(2.2.2) and potassium oxalate, followed by acid hydrolysis on a Tracerlab FX(FN) synthesis module. [(18)F]-L-FPHCys and [(18)F]-D-FPHCys were isolated in 20 Â± 5% radiochemical yield and >98% radiochemical and enantiomeric purity in 65 min. Competitive uptake studies in A375 and HT29 tumor cells suggest that L- and D-[(18)F]FPHCys are taken up by the L-transporter system. [(18)F]-L-FPHCys and [(18)F]-D-FPHCys displayed good stability In Vivo without incorporation into protein at least 2 h postinjection. Biodistribution studies demonstrate good uptake in A375 tumor-bearing rodents with tumor to blood ratios of 3.5 and 5.0 for [(18)F]-L-FPHCys and [(18)F]-D-FPHCys, respectively, at 2 h postinjection.
