Tc-99m SPECT sestamibi for the measurement of infarct size. There are a variety of approaches to assess the efficacy of reperfusion therapy, and myocardial protection, in acute myocardial infarction. This review summarizes the available evidence validating the use of technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for this purpose. Multiple lines of evidence have validated its clinical utility. SPECT sestamibi infarct size has been used as an endpoint in multiple randomized clinical trials. A smaller number of clinical trials have used both early and later imaging with SPECT sestamibi to assess myocardium at risk and myocardial salvage. SPECT sestamibi has a number of limitations which must be recognized. Nevertheless, SPECT sestamibi infarct size is a well-validated measurement with a long track record of performance as an endpoint in multicenter, randomized clinical trials.
