Myocardial perfusion evaluation post percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy by ⁹⁹Tc(m) MIBI SPECT MPI. To evaluate the myocardial perfusion and function in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) before and after percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation (PTSMA).Sixty-eight patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy were included and (99)Tc(m)-MIBI SPECT MPI was applied before and at 1 week after PTSMA, six-month follow-up was finished in 11 patients. Semi quantity and QGS quantity perfusion and function assessment was performed in 17 LV segments.Myocardial perfusion post-PTSMA was significantly reduced in 98% patients, especially in basal anterosepta, basal interseptal, mid-anteroseptal, mid-interseptal and apical septal segments compared with pre-PTSMA (all P < 0.05). Perfusion was significantly increased at 6 months follow-up than at 1 week post-PTSMA but still lower than pre-PTSMA (all P < 0.05). LVEF (evaluated by gated SPECT) was similar before and after the procedure (P > 0.05). Regional wall motion after PTSMA was lower than pre-PTSMA in basal anterior, basal anteroseptal, basal interseptal and basal inferior (P < 0.05). Regional wall thinkening was lower than pre-PTSMA in basal interseptal, mid-anteroseptal, mid-interseptal (P < 0.05).(99)Tc(m) MIBI SPECT can be used to monitor myocardial perfusion post PTSMA in patients with HOCM.
