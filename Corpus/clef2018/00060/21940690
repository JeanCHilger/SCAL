Long-term outcome in children with intractable epilepsy showing bilateral diffuse cortical glucose hypometabolism pattern on positron emission tomography. The objective of this study is to determine the long-term outcome of children with intractable epilepsy who have diffuse cortical hypometabolism on 2-deoxy-2-((18)F)fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans. Seventeen children with intractable epilepsy showing bilateral, diffuse cortical hypometabolism on FDG-PET were followed up through telephone interview from 1 year 4 months to 11 years 4 months (mean: 5 years 7 months Â± 2 years 1 month) after their PET scans. One child succumbed to Sanfilippo disease at age 20 years. Only 2 children were seizure free. Fifty percent had walking difficulties, 56.25% were not toilet trained, all had speech difficulties, 43.75% had behavioral problems, 37.5% had poor eye contact, 75% had socialization difficulties, and 87.5% attended special schools. Three children were found to have genetic causes, including a 4-MB deletion of the mitochondrial genome, MECP2 duplication, and Lafora disease. In conclusion, the long-term outcome in this patient population is poor, and they tend to suffer from genetic/neurodegenerative diseases.
