Longitudinal evolution of compensatory changes in striatal dopamine processing in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disease. Breakdown of compensatory mechanisms influencing putaminal dopamine processing could contribute to the progressive motor symptoms. We studied a cohort of 78 subjects (at baseline) with sporadic Parkinson's disease and 35 healthy controls with multi-tracer positron emission tomography scans to investigate the evolution of adaptive mechanisms influencing striatal dopamine processing in Parkinson's disease progression. Presynaptic dopaminergic integrity was assessed with three radioligands: (i) [(11)C](Â±)dihydrotetrabenazine, to estimate the density of vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (ii) [(11)C]d-threo-methylphenidate, to label the dopamine transporter
