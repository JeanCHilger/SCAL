Synthesis and evaluation of a novel (99m)Tc-labeled bioreductive probe for tumor hypoxia imaging. Tumor hypoxia is closely associated with the malignant progression and/or the high metastatic ability of tumors and often induces resistance to chemo- and/or radiotherapy. Thus, the detection and evaluation of hypoxia is important for the optimization of cancer therapy. We designed a novel (99m)Tc-labeled probe for tumor hypoxia imaging that utilizes bioreductive reactions in hypoxic cells. This probe, which contains a 4-nitrobenzyl ester group, is reduced in hypoxic cells to produce a corresponding carboxylate anion that cannot penetrate cell membranes because of its hydrophilicity and negative charge therefore, it is expected to be trapped inside hypoxic cells. Based on this unique strategy, we synthesized the Technetium-99m ((99m)Tc)-labeled probe (99m)Tc-SD32. The uptake of (99m)Tc-SD32 in tumor cells was investigated under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. (99m)Tc-SD32 showed sufficient accumulation and good retention in hypoxic cells. In addition, we demonstrated that (99m)Tc-SD32 was subjected to bioreduction in hypoxic cells and was trapped as the corresponding carboxylate anion. These results indicated that (99m)Tc-SD32 would be a promising agent for in vivo hypoxia imaging.
