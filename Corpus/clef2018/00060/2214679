Subcloning and trial of expression of the protein kinase catalytic domain of RSV-src gene. The gene of catalytic domain of the protein kinase of RSV-scr was cloned into the BamHI cloning site of translation vector pET-8c which containing T7 RNA polymerase promotor, and transformed BL21 (DE3) pLys S (Studier and Moffatt, 1986). The putative molecular weight of the protein was about 33 kd as evaluated on the basis of its nucleotide size showed the identical mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, yield of protein production was not high, probably, because of its instability in Escherichia coli.
