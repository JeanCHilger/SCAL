PET imaging of tumor growth: not as easy as it looks. Positron emission tomography can be used to image tumor proliferation when combined with appropriate labeled tracers, such as the thymidine analog [(18)F]-3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine. Although thymidine kinase 1 is the principal mechanism of cell trapping, other variables, such as the cellular level of native thymidine, may need to be considered.
