Parasitological stool examination from children without the typical symptoms of parasitic disease. Most parasitic intestinal infestations in humans are sub-clinical and, therefore, they are rarely diagnosed. A number of general, non-specific symptoms of parasitic invasions are often attributed to other diseases. A parasitological examination of feces performed as part of this study confirmed the presence of intestinal parasites in 21.6% of samples. Among the patients who reported 6 different symptoms, the percentage of parasite-positive samples reached 80%. The obtained results suggest that coproscopic tests may establish the diagnosis in unclear cases, particularly in children. Many parasitic invasions are zoonoses and pets owe a reservoir. In view of the above, the results for pet owners and non-pet owners were compared in the study. There was no direct correlation between pet ownership and the incidence of parasitic infections.
