Comparative analysis of multiparametric magnetic resonance and PET-CT in the management of local recurrence after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Our aim was to assess whether multiparametric magnetic resonance and PET-CT can have a role in detecting local recurrence in patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.We reviewed the recent international literature by carrying out a PUBMED search.We critically reviewed 11 recent original studies about the use of PET-CT and 5 recent studies about the use of multiparametric magnetic resonance. PET-CT has not shown significant results in terms of detection rate for local recurrence in patients with low level of PSA. Multiparametric magnetic resonance showed encouraging results to detect local recurrence in patients with low PSA and with small diameter lesions.Currently, most important urological societies do not consider multiparametric magnetic resonance and PET-CT in the follow-up of patients with suspected local recurrence after radical prostatectomy. We can assert that multiparametric magnetic resonance seems to have excellent results in detecting local recurrence in patients submitted to radical prostatectomy and PSA<1.5 ng/ml.
