99mTc-3PRGD2 for integrin receptor imaging of lung cancer: a multicenter study. (99m)Tc-3PRGD2 is a new SPECT tracer targeting integrin α(V)β(3) receptor for detecting tumors, imaging angiogenesis, and evaluating tumor response to therapy. A multicenter study was designed to investigate the efficacy of (99m)Tc-3PRGD2 for the evaluation of patients with lung cancer.Seventy patients (51 men, 19 women mean age ± SD, 63 ± 9 y) with a suspected lung lesion and for whom definite pathologic diagnosis was finally obtained (malignant, n = 58With low (99m)Tc-3PRGD2 background in the lungs and mediastinum, most lung malignancies were prominent on the 1-h images (T/B ratio, 1.65 ± 0.47 for the planar imaging and 2.78 ± 1.52 for SPECT). The T/B ratios were significantly lower in the benign lesions (P < 0.05). The sensitivity was 88% for semiquantitative analysis and could reach 93%-97% in visual analysis when considering the volume effect, necrosis, and metastasis. However, the specificity was only 58%-67%. Most lymph node and bone metastases could also be detected.(99m)Tc-3PRGD2 imaging at 1 h is sensitive for the detection of lung cancer, meriting further investigation of (99m)Tc-3PRGD2 as a novel clinical tracer for integrin receptor imaging.
