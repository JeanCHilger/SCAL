 In developed countries, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects ~1% of the individuals who are ≥65 years old and roughly 30% of those who are ≥80 years of age (2). The disease is characterized by slow deposition of the amyloid beta protein (βA) and formation of neurofibrillary tangles in the memory and cognition regions of the brain, which lead to memory loss and cognitive impairment in the individual (3). The generation of βA from its precursor, the amyloid precursor protein, has been illustrated by Tam and Pasternak (2), and the biochemistry of this protein and the amyloid deposits in AD has been discussed by Masters and Selkoe (4). Because the deposition of βA in the brain starts several years before the symptoms of AD are apparent, detection of the disease at an early stage can assist in the diagnosis, improved monitoring of the disease, and the development of a therapeutic regimen that can slow the advancement of AD (1). Although several drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are available to treat the symptoms of AD, none of these medications prevent the onset and progression of the disease. Imaging probes for use with positron emission tomography (PET) have been evaluated under preclinical conditions for the noninvasive visualization of AD (1), and
