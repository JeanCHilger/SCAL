 The epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2, ErbB2) modulates its activity through a tyrosine kinase signaling pathway and is involved in the development of various cancers, including those of the lung and the breast (1, 2). Overexpression or amplification of the HER2 gene is known to occur in a high percentage of cancer cases (e.g., ~20% of breast cancer (BC)) and predicts a poor prognosis for the patient.
