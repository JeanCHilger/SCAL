Previous pet ownership and Paget's disease. The relationship between pet ownership and Paget's disease (PD) of bone was investigated in 112 patients with PD who were matched with a similar number of community-based controls. There was a significantly increased frequency of dog ownership by patients with PD aged less than 60 years. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that there was a significant age-related increase in risk of PD associated with past or present ownership of either dogs or cats, with younger patients having the greatest risk. These results suggest that slow virus infection of osteoclasts by paramyxoviruses acquired from pets may contribute to the development of Paget's disease in the younger patient.
