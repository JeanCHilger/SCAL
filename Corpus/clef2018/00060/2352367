Quantitative evaluation of myocardial blood flow and myocardial fluoro-deoxyglucose uptake determined by PET before and after aorto-coronary bypass operation in patients with ischemic heart disease. Absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial FDG uptake (MFU) in the fasting state were determined in 5 patients who underwent aorto-coronary bypass operation, using O-15 water, F-18 fluoro-deoxyglucose and dynamic PET before and after the operation. In the patent graft region, MBF was increased from 0.59 +/- 0.17 ml/min/g to 0.77 +/- 0.14 ml/min/g (p less than 0.05). Mean MBF was increased from 0.69 +/- 0.22 ml/min/g to 0.83 +/- 0.18 ml/min/g (p less than 0.05). MFU in the fasting state was significantly decreased in high MFU region compared with low MFU region (p less than 0.005). Quantitative evaluation of MBF and MFU before aorto-coronary bypass operation was quite useful to determine adequate indication of the operation.
