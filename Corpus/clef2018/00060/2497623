Positron emission tomography with 68-Ga-EDTA and computed tomography in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. 26 patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) were investigated with 68-Ga-EDTA and positron emission tomography (PET) in order to evaluate the presence of a blood brain barrier (BBB) disturbance. Only one patient showed a BBB disruption. It is suggested that increased levels of substances with higher molecular weight than 68-Ga-EDTA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are the result of a change in the metabolism of the CSF and the brain tissue caused by a SAH.
