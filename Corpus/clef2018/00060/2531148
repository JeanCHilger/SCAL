A double-injection technique for in vivo measurement of dopamine D2-receptor density in monkeys with 3-(2'-[18F]fluoroethyl)spiperone and dynamic positron emission tomography. Dopamine D2-receptor density in striatum of monkey was measured with 3-(2'-[18F]fluoroethyl)spiperone (FESP) and dynamic positron emission tomography (PET), using a double-injection technique. A first bolus of high specific activity (SA) FESP (5 mCi approximately equal to 1 Ci/mumol) was injected i.v.
