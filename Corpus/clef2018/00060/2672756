A look at 15 years of planar thallium-201 imaging. Extensive experience has been accumulated over the past 15 years regarding planar thallium-201 imaging. Quantitation of technically superior images provides a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CAD. In addition, planar thallium-201 images provide very important prognostic information in different clinical situations. Although single photon emission computerized tomography offers potential theoretical advantages over planar imaging, because of the problems involved in reconstruction, specifically the creation of artifacts, it may not be the ideal imaging modality in all situations. Good quality planar thallium-201 imaging still has an important role in clinical cardiology today.
