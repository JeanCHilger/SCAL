18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET) in aging and dementia. A decade of studie. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming an increasingly important public health problem. The clinical diagnosis of AD continues to be problematic and costly. [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-position emission tomography (FDG-PET) can assist with the diagnosis of AD at an early stage. The utility of FDG-PET in AD may also be extremely useful in the future when objective physiologic monitoring of drug effects and therapy are required.
