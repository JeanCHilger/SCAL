Positron emission tomography and in vivo measurements of tumour perfusion and oxygen utilisation. The advent of positron emission tomography has provided the clinical investigator with a tool for performing noninvasive (patho)-physiological measurements in humans. The method has been used extensively in the study of cerebral and cardiovascular disease. Oncological applications have been described by a more limited number of centres and have mainly concentrated on cerebral tumours. The first part of this review discusses principles of positron emission tomography and requirements for performing quantitative studies. The second part describes results of one of the most important quantitative techniques: the measurement of tumour blood flow and oxygen metabolism.
