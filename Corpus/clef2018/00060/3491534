Tumor localization of the metabolically trapped radiolabeled substrates 2-deoxy-D-glucose and aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid in human melanoma heterotransplants. Analysis of the accumulation of metabolically trapped radiolabeled substrates in normal and malignant tissues may be useful for studying biochemical processes in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET). If labeled with the short-lived, positron-emitting radionuclide carbon-11 (T1/2 = 20.4 min), the glucose analog, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), and the synthetic amino acid, aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid (ACPC), may be useful for studying glucose utilization and amino acid transport in vivo. This study evaluated the biodistribution of the C-14 labeled analogues of these compounds in nude mice bearing human malignant melanoma heterotransplants. The data suggest that both 2-DG and ACPC accumulate in tumor tissue within 45 min.
