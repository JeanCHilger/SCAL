HIPDM single photon emission computed tomography brain imaging in partial onset secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. HIPDM-Single photon emission computed tomography brain imaging was performed during interictal and ictal stages in three patients with complex partial seizures and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In all three patients, interictal studies demonstrated decreased regional cerebral perfusion (rCP) and ictal studies showed increased rCP in the epileptogenic region. The demonstration of focal hyperperfusion by SPECT performed during secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures suggests that rCP in the epileptic focus remains higher than in other cerebral regions during immediate postictal stages, even in secondarily generalized seizures.
