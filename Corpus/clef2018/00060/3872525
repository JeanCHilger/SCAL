The humane society and the human-companion animal bond. Reflections on the broken bond. This article discusses the history of the humane movement and how humane societies facilitate the human-companion animal bond by conducting various animal-protection programs (cruelty prevention, rescues, adoptions, veterinary services, for example) and participating in pet-facilitated therapy programs. Also discussed is the euthanasia of unwanted and unclaimed animals and its effect on animal shelter personnel.
