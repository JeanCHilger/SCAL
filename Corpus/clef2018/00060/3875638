Regional cerebral blood flow assessed by 133Xe inhalation and emission tomography: normal values. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum was measured by single photon emission computed tomography with inhalation of 133Xe in 39 normal volunteers at test. The goal of this study was to assess the normal flow pattern and its variations. Five parallel tomographic slices through the brain were recorded with a resolution element of 1.7 X 1.7 X 2.0 cm (full width at half maximum). The blood flow distribution showed that the predominantly gray matter areas displayed flow approximately double that of the predominantly white matter regions. The CBF distribution was practically symmetrical with a side-to-side difference averaging 1.4 +/- 1.4 ml/100 g/min. This means that a difference exceeding 4.2 ml/100 g/min (approximately 9% of mean CBF) is abnormal with a confidence level of below 5%. The measured average CBF and cerebellar blood flow were 56 +/- 7 and 54 +/- 6 ml/100 g/min (mean +/- 1 SD), respectively. A significant correlation was found between CBF and PCO2, and between CBF and age. Repeat measurements in an additional 30 subjects showed a day-to-day variability of -0.2 +/- 6.4 ml/100 g/min of the difference between the first and the second measurement. This corresponds to random methodological and biological errors of 6.4/square root 2 = 4.6 ml/100 g/min and is a measure of the overall intraindividual variability. Xenon-133 tomography is atraumatic and affords rCBF images free of the superposition artifacts that practically invalidate the nontomographic approaches in the studies of cerebrovascular disease. The rCBF tomograms are blurred, particularly due to Compton scatter. Relative to this factor, the errors caused by local variations in the tissue:blood partition coefficient are less important.
