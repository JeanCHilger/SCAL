Cerebral blood flow in patients with congestive heart failure treated with captopril. The effect of captopril on cerebral blood flow was studied in five patients with severe congestive heart failure and in five control subjects. Cerebral blood flow was measured by inhalation of 133xenon and registration of its uptake and washout from the brain by single photon emission computer tomography. In addition, cerebral (internal jugular) venous oxygen tension was determined in the controls. The measurements were made before and 15, 60, and 180 minutes after a single oral dose of captopril (6.25 mg in patients with congestive heart failure and 25 mg in controls). Despite a marked decrease in blood pressure, cerebral blood flow increased slightly in the patients with severe congestive heart failure. When a correction was applied to take account of a change in arterial carbon dioxide tension, however, cerebral blood flow was unchanged after captopril administration even in patients with the greatest decrease in blood pressure, in whom a decrease in cerebral blood flow might have been expected. In the controls, blood pressure was little affected by captopril, whereas a slight, but not statistically significant, decrease in cerebral blood flow was observed. The cerebral venous oxygen tension decreased concomitantly.
