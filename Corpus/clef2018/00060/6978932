Noninvasive measurement of blood flow, oxygen consumption, and glucose utilization in the same brain regions in man by positron emission tomography: concise communication. Local cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen consumption (CMRO2), and glucose utilization (CMR-Glc) have been measured in three patients by positron emission tomography (PET), together with continuous inhalation of oxygen-15-labeled gases and i.v. injection of [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. In normal brain, the close local coupling between CBF and CMR-Glc, and that between CMRO2 and CMR-Glc, were well demonstrated. The coupling held for the asymptomatic areas and for parts of the affected hemispheres in two patients with cerebral ischemia. In one patient the CBF/CMR-Glc couple, but not the CMRO2/CMR-Glc couple, was disrupted in the acute ischemic core. This preliminary work demonstrates the local quantification of these important functional parameters, and indicates the potential usefulness of studying their pathophysiological interrelationship in brain disease.
