Effect of caffeine on myocardial blood flow at rest and during pharmacological vasodilation. Stress testing with intravenous injection of dipyridamole is frequently used for noninvasive detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) with PET or SPECT. Dietary intake of caffeinated food, beverages or medication might alter both resting and dipyridamole-induced hyperemic blood flow, thereby compromising the diagnostic sensitivity of dipyridamole stress testing.To quantify the effect on myocardial blood flow at rest and during intravenous injection of dipyridamole, 12 healthy volunteers (mean age 27 +/- 6 yr) with low risk for CAD were studied with dynamic PET and a tracer kinetic model for 13N-ammonia after 24 hr of caffeine abstinence and after caffeine intake.Caffeine tended to increase the rate pressure product from 6873 +/- 1494 to 7566 +/- 1102 (p = 0.051), whereas resting myocardial blood flow remained unchanged (0.61 +/- 0.13 versus 0.58 +/- 0.07 ml/g/min, p = ns). The heart rate response to dipyridamole was inversely related to serum caffeine levels. Hyperemic blood flow (2.01 +/- 0.46 versus 1.31 +/- 0.0.38 ml/g/min p < 0.001) and flow reserve (3.4 +/- 0.8 versus 2.3 +/- 0.7Caffeine intake alters the coronary vasomotor tone at rest, which might lower the threshold for ischemic events in patients with CAD. It reduces hyperemic blood flow and flow reserve and the dipyridamole-induced increase in heart rate in a dose-dependent fashion. These findings emphasize the importance of carefully screening patients for intake of caffeinated food, beverages or medication prior to dipyridamole stress testing.
