Effect of aging on myocardial perfusion reserve. Myocardial perfusion reserve (hyperemic divided by basal myocardial blood flow) describes vasodilator responsiveness of coronary-resistive vessels. The effect of aging and gender on myocardial perfusion reserve remains controversial.We studied 56 normal volunteers (21 women, 35 men aged 50 +/- 20 yr, range 21-86 yr) with 15O-water PET to measure myocardial blood flow during basal and hyperemic states with intravenous dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg, n = 46) or adenosine (140 micrograms/kg/min, n = 10). For comparative analysis, patients were grouped according to age: < 30 yr (n = 11), 30-49 yr (n = 18), 50-69 yr (n = 15) and > or = 70 yr (n = 12).Overall, basal flow was 1.00 +/- 0.26 ml/min/g and hyperemic flow was 3.31 +/- 1.38 ml/min/g, resulting in a myocardial perfusion reserve of 3.38 +/- 1.35. There was an increase in basal flow with age (r = 0.45, p < 0.025), although hyperemic flow was only lower in patients > or = 70 yr, causing a significant reduction in myocardial perfusion reserve: 3.54 +/- 0.96 in < 30 yr, 4.23 +/- 1.35 in 30-49 yr, 3.51 +/- 1.21 in 50-69 yr and 1.94 +/- 0.46 in > or = 70 yr (p < 0.05 versus all groups < 70 yr).Myocardial blood flow during basal and hyperemia conditions are roughly comparable up to 60 yr of age. Above this age, there is significant increase in basal flow associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure. Above 70 yr, there is a significant reduction in hyperemic flow, and thus myocardial perfusion reserve independent of hemodynamic response to vasodilator stress.
