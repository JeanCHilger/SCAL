Correlative morphologic and functional imaging for diagnosis, staging and follow up in AIDS: an overview. The immunocompromised patient can be affected by different opportunistic infections and tumors, that can involve all organ systems, and particularly, the central nervous system, the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract. The extreme variability of AIDS presentations requires a specific preparation and cooperation between the different diagnostic imaging specialists and a close collaboration with the clinicians. With AIDS, different morphologic and functional imaging techniques can be used for detection of disease sites, assessment of the extent of the disease and monitoring of disease changes over time and response to treatment. The complexity of AIDS presentations is such that full integration of the complementary information obtained with different techniques could be most useful. Image registration (coregistration, fusion) indicates approaches where precise spatial cross-references are obtained, in order to combine the information acquired with different imaging modalities, in particular by blending morphologic CT/MRI data with functional SPET/PET data. In this paper, an overview of the developments in the field of "image fusion" follows some comments on the results of morphologic and functional assessment of brain, chest and abdominal diseases in the course of AIDS, as illustrative examples of the potential benefits of multimodality image correlation.
