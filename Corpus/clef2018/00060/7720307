I-123 MIBG scintigraphy in adults. A report of clinical experience. Thirty-one adult patients with clinical findings suggestive of pheochromocytoma were studied with I-123 MIBG. All patients had images obtained at 24 and 48 hours. Five patients had abnormal uptake proved to be because of I-123 MIBG avid tumors. The remaining 26 patients had no proven tumors and showed physiologic uptake in various organs. The 24-hour images were of high quality. In all cases, the 48-hour images contributed no significant additional information. Only in 1 patient did the 48-hour image add some certainty. Physiologic uptake was seen in the salivary glands, liver, G.I. tract, and urinary bladder in all patients (100%). Uptake was also observed in the lung and heart (90%), normal adrenal glands (32%), thyroid (29%), spleen (23%) uterus (13%), and neck muscles (6%). The authors' experience indicates that I-123 MIBG gives superior images compared to the previously used I-131 MIBG, that the optimum imaging time for adults is 18-24 hours, and that normal distribution patterns including uterine and neck muscle uptake should be familiar to physicians interpreting the studies.
