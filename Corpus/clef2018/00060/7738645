Thallium-201 SPECT and technetium-99m-phytate subtraction liver imaging in the evaluation of pancreatic cancers. We preliminarily evaluated the usefulness of 201Tl SPECT in the investigation of pancreatic cancers.The subjects included 32 patients with malignant tumors, 16 with benign disorders and 10 controls. SPECT was performed 10 min after the injection of 148-222 MBq of 201Tl subjects had fasted to minimize intestinal activity. In addition, subtracted SPECT using 99mTc-phytate to separate the boundary of abnormal uptake from liver activity was carried out in 14 patients.Thallium-201 did not accumulate in the pancreatic bed of the controls. In contrast, 29 of the 32 patients with malignant tumors showed positive phytate uptake with a sensitivity of 90.6% in the detection of malignancy. Of the 16 benign disorders, only four patients showed abnormal uptake however, the mean value of the lesion-to-hepatic ratio (0.43 +/- 0.06Our results suggest that 201Tl SPECT may have clinical potential in the investigation of pancreatic cancers.
