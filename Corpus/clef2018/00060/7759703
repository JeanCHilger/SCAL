Simultaneous assessment of myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function during transient coronary occlusion. We used technetium-99m sestamibi imaging to evaluate the magnitude of changes in left ventricular function and perfusion and to investigate their interdependence during transient coronary occlusion.Transient coronary occlusion during coronary angioplasty provides a unique opportunity for examining the effects of acute myocardial ischemia on left ventricular function and perfusion.Thirty-five patients with normal left ventricular function underwent first-pass radionuclide angiography with technetium-99m sestamibi using a multicrystal gamma camera during balloon occlusion of a coronary artery. Single-photon tomography was performed 2.1 +/- 1.7 h later. Subsequently, all scans were repeated at rest.The mean size +/- SD of the perfusion defect during coronary occlusion was 23 +/- 18%, with significantly larger defects observed for occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery (39 +/- 20%) than for occlusions of the left circumflex (15 +/- 11%) or right (15 +/- 9%) coronary artery (p < 0.05). The mean change in ejection fraction from recovery to occlusion was -17 +/- 17% and was significantly larger for left anterior descending (-26 +/- 21%) and left circumflex (-15 +/- 11%) than for right (-8 +/- 10%) coronary artery occlusions (p < 0.05). For the entire group, ejection fraction during occlusion correlated significantly with perfusion defect size (r = 0.63, p = 0.0004), whereas the extent of ischemic myocardium correlated with the decrease in ejection fraction (r = 0.69, p = 0.0001). The defects present during occlusion reversed within a few hours.Changes in left ventricular function and perfusion develop pari passu during coronary occlusion and are more severe when the left anterior descending artery is occluded. Although a significant correlation exists between the extent of the perfusion defect and the severity of the decrease in ejection fraction, there is a substantial individual variation with respect to changes in both myocardial perfusion and ventricular function during acute coronary occlusion.
