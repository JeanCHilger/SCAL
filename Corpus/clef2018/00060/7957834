Regional deposition of nebulized hypodense nonisotonic solutions in the human respiratory tract. Deposition of nonisotonic therapeutic and diagnosis aerosols can cause changes in airway fluid composition and bronchoconstriction in sensitive subjects. "Hypodense" aerosols containing a relatively low concentration of droplets in the carrier air were used in the studies of regional deposition of radiolabelled nebulized solutions of hypo- and hypertonic saline, in order to investigate whether the number of droplets per volume of carrier can affect deposition. Solutions with and without 0.5% nedocromil sodium were nebulized in order to examine the effects of a potential modifier of the rates of heat and mass transfer. The deposition was quantified using penetration index (PI) calculated from images obtained by single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in 11 healthy volunteers per study. There was an increase in the penetration index (10.9%, for the saline only 15.5%, for the nedocromil study) of the hypotonic compared to the hypertonic aerosol, although the initial size distribution of both types of aerosols was very similar (mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) 3.7 and 3.8 microns
