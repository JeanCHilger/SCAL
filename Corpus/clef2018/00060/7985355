Behavioural, household, and social problems associated with companion animals: opinions of owners and non-owners. The goal of this investigation was to determine the extent to which owners of companion animals experienced problems with their animals, such as behaviour problems, and to discover their opinion about household problems such as the shedding of hairs and/or feathers. Furthermore, an attempt was made to discover the opinions of owners and non-owners about social problems such as 'companion animals make noise'. The findings are the result of a survey among 871 Dutch respondents. It was found that 43% of all companion animal owners had one or more problems with their animals. Dog and cat owners experienced many problems with the illness and the behaviour of their animals. The higher the income of the owner, the more likely he/she is to have problems with his/her animal's behaviour. Because animals with behaviour problems are a risk group, more should be done to prevent these problems. Owners of companion animals found shedding of hair or feathers the biggest disadvantage of keeping an animal. People in paid employment found cleaning the cage of the animal a bigger nuisance than did people not in paid employment. There were no differences in owner characteristics with regard to the household problems. The opinions of owners of certain species of animals, owners of other species, and non-owners about behavioural traits and the nuisance caused by that species of companion animal differed, which could lead to misunderstandings between these groups.
