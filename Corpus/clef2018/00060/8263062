11C]tropanyl benzilate-binding to muscarinic cholinergic receptors: methodology and kinetic modeling alternative. Quantitative estimation of cerebral muscarinic receptors was investigated with the use of the antagonist [11C]tropanyl benzilate ([11C]TRB) and positron emission tomography (PET). Kinetic modeling alternatives were examined with the goal of identifying an analysis method providing stable receptor measures, yet avoiding biases from inappropriate reductions in model complexity. Dynamic PET scans were performed on six young normal volunteers. Several modeling approaches yielding relative receptor density measures were evaluated: (a) a single "late" scan using relative tracer concentration values (b) a slope estimate from graphic analysis (Patlak plot)
