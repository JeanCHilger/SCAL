Regional cerebral blood flow imaging with 99mTc-bicisate SPECT in asymmetric Parkinson's disease: studies with and without chronic drug therapy. Regional cerebral perfusion was assessed in six patients with asymmetric Parkinson's disease (PD) of mild to moderate severity and in six matched normal subjects using 99mTc-bicisate single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Regional activity was normalized to whole-brain activity. Each subject was studied twice, separated by 15.2 +/- 9.2 and 18.0 +/- 4.8 days in normals and PD patients, respectively. There was low intrasubject scan-rescan variability in normals, with all regions showing an average intrasubject difference in repeat studies of < 3%. In PD patients after chronic oral antiparkinsonian drugs had been withdrawn, as compared with normal subjects, there was increased perfusion in the caudate and lenticular nuclei contralateral to the worst affected extremities. This increased basal ganglia perfusion was attenuated by chronic oral therapy. The clinical relevance of these changes is indicated by the high positive correlation between various measures of clinical PD severity and the lenticular perfusion. These differences in basal ganglia perfusion measured with 99mTc-bicisate SPECT in mild to moderate, asymmetric PD may be secondary to increased metabolic demand resulting from alterations of synaptic activity.
