Clinical applications of positron-emission tomography in cancer. Positron-emission tomography is a unique imaging technique that has shown promise for improving staging, treatment planning, and monitoring of cancer. When used in conjunction with a radioactive glucose analog, positron-emission tomography has proven useful for detecting malignant tissue and quantitating changes in tumor glycolysis during and after treatment. This article reviews the principles of positron-emission tomography and its clinical role in cancer treatment.
