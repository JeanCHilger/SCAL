The dobutamine stress test with thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography and radionuclide angiography: postinfarction study. The purpose of this study was to investigate left ventricular wall motion changes during dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia.Dobutamine is increasingly used as a stress test. It has been assumed that high doses of the drug induce the same changes in contractility as physical exercise. However, some data suggest that ischemic myocardium can respond to dobutamine with an increase in contractility.Sixty-three postinfarction patients twice underwent the dobutamine test (up to 40 micrograms/kg per min) within 1 to 2 days. Thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and gated equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography were performed on each patient at rest and with dobutamine. Both global and regional ejection fractions were quantified. Sixty patients underwent coronary cineangiography within 1 week. The presence of redistribution was correlated with global and regional ejection fraction changes and with coronary lesions.Redistribution was present in 45 patients, and no change or a decrease in global or regional ejection fraction was detected in 22. In the entire group of patients global ejection fraction increased from 46 +/- 12% to 56 +/- 14%. The six patients with triple-vessel disease had a flat (-0.2 +/- 5%) ejection fraction response to dobutamine, whereas the remaining patients had an increase of 11 +/- 7% (p = 0.003). The regional ejection fraction of the hypokinetic area increased from 27 +/- 10% to 41 +/- 19%, showing no change or a decrease in 13 patients. The 44 patients with peri-infarct redistribution had a significantly higher increase in regional ejection fraction than those without redistribution (16.4 +/- 10% vs. 4.7 +/- 17%, p = 0.003). In the patients with peri-infarct redistribution, an inverse linear correlation was found between redistribution score and dobutamine-induced regional ejection fraction change (r = -0.44, p = 0.004).Mild to moderate dobutamine-induced peri-infarct ischemia is compatible with an increase in contractility, whereas severe ischemia induces worsening of wall motion.
