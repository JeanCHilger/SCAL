Comparison of uptake, oxidation and lipid distribution of 17-iodoheptadecanoic acid, 15-(p-iodophenyl)pentadecanoic acid and 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3,3-dimethylpentadecanoic acid in normal canine myocardium. The kinetics of 17-[123I]iodoheptadecanoic acid (IHDA), 15-(p-[125I]iodophenyl)pentadecanoic acid (pIPPA) and 15-(p-[131I]iodophenyl)-3,3-dimethylpentadecanoic acid (DMIPPA) were investigated in normal canine myocardium. After simultaneous intravenous injection, myocardial biopsy specimens and samples of arterial blood were taken over 80 min. IHDA showed the highest myocardial uptake (995 +/- 248 dpm/mg.mCi versus pIPPA: 785 +/- 197 dpm/mg.mCi, ns) and the largest size of oxidation (74% +/- 4% versus pIPPA: 65% +/- 5%, p < 0.05). Myocardial activity of IHDA decreased with a half-time value of 11.2 min (pIPPA: 13.2 min). Phospholipids were the main lipid fraction into which IHDA was incorporated, whereas pIPPA was predominantly incorporated into triacylglycerols. DMIPPA myocardial activity remained constant during the assay period and instead of being oxidized, DMIPPA was mainly incorporated into triacylglycerols (55% +/- 12%). The myocardium-to-blood ratios of DMIPPA were greater than 10:1. The ratios at peak for IHDA and pIPPA were 4.1:1 and 3.9:1, respectively (both p < 0.0001 versus DMIPPA). In conclusion, differences have been found in the myocardial uptake, oxidation and lipid distribution of IHDA, pIPPA and DMIPPA. DMIPPA is a promising tracer for fatty acid uptake studies with single-photon emission computerized tomography because of its prolonged retention and high myocardium-to-blood ratios.
