The release of isoconazole nitrate from different suppository bases: in-vivo release of drug labelled with 99mTc in rabbits. The influence of the suppository bases on the in-vivo release of 99mTc-labelled isoconazole nitrate was investigated. The single-dose vaginal suppository formulations for local treatment of vaginitis were prepared by a fusion method using polyethylene glycols, Witepsol H15, Novata BD and Cremao. Prepared vaginal suppositories containing solid-labelled substance were applied to the vagina of rabbits and at 0, 2 and 24 h after administration, the amounts of radioactivity in the vagina were detected by the SPECT Gamma Camera and the release rates of the drug were calculated. The percent released was found to be in the following order polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 > PEG 4000 > Witepsol > PEG 1500 > Novata BD > Cremao. The results obtained in both in-vitro and in-vivo studies indicated that the vaginal suppository of isoconazole nitrate prepared with polyethylene glycols could confidently be used in therapy.
