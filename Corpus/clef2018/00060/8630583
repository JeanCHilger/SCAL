Noninvasive determination of cardiac output in patients with severe airflow limitation. The noninvasive measurement of cardiac output (Q) by the Indirect Fick CO2-rebreathing technique requires mixed venous P CO2 (P CO2) to be determined by the rebreathing maneuver, and Pa CO2 to be estimated from end-tidal P CO2 (PET CO2). Previous work has suggested that although P CO2 can be determined, Pa CO2 cannot be accurately estimated in patients with significant airflow limitation. Nineteen patients with cystic fibrosis who had severe airflow limitation (%FEV1, 29.3 +/- 7.12 SD) were studied during steady-state exercise at 50% of their measured maximal work capacity. Estimated Pa CO2 was slightly lower than Pa CO2 measured from blood samples obtained from an indwelling arterial catheter (measured: 45.2 +/- 4.92 estimate: 42.7 +/- 5.68 mm Hg). To calculate arterial blood content, the values derived from Pa CO2, pH, hemoglobin (Hb), and O2 saturation were compared with those derived from PET CO2 and O2 saturation, where (1) pH was assumed to be 7.40 and Hb was measured, and (2) pH was assumed to be 7.40 and Hb was assumed to be 15 g/dl (measured mean pH, 7.34
