Factors influencing regional myocardial contractile response to inotropic stimulation. Analysis in humans with stable ischemic heart disease. We hypothesized that the response of a myocardial segment to maximal dobutamine reflects not only maximal blood flow but also tethering, metabolic, and beta-blocker status.Patients with stable ischemic heart disease (n = 27) had positron emission tomographic measurement of blood flow at rest and with adenosine, and echocardiography at rest and with dobutamine. Positron emission tomographic measurement of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose myocardial distribution also was made. Adenosine blood flow in segments that contracted normally at peak dobutamine was similar to that of segments that became hypokinetic (1.06 +/- 0.72 versus 1.02 +/- 0.77 mL.g-1.min-1). Segments that became akinetic failed to augment blood flow (0.68 +/- 0.30 mL.g-1.min-1). Fluorodeoxyglucose-blood flow mismatch was more common in segments with abnormal wall motion at peak dobutamine (24 of 59, 41%) versus those that contracted normally (63 of 269, 23% chi 2, 7.40Augmented contraction at maximal dobutamine depends not only on increased myocardial blood flow but also on tethering, metabolic, and beta-blocker status. Furthermore, impaired flow reserve does not preclude a normal response to maximal dobutamine, since blood flow need not increase greatly to meet demand.
