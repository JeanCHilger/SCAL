Preoperative embolization of gastric arteries for esophageal cancer. We developed a novel treatment of preoperative embolization therapy in an attempt to prevent anastomotic leakage after esophageal resection. We report the results of this new treatment.Preoperative embolization therapy (PET) was performed in 24 cases of esophageal carcinoma. The femoral artery was punctured, and celiac angiography was performed. The left gastric artery and splenic artery underwent embolization. The right gastric artery then underwent embolization at a site beyond the second or third branch to the gastric wall. With a laser flow meter the stomach tissue blood flow was measured before and after construction of the gastric tube, and the change in blood flow was compared.The average decrease in gastric blood flow was 23% in patients with PET and 65% in patients without PET. Twenty-one (88%) of 24 cases maintained more than 50% tissue blood flow in patients with PET and in 1 (8%) of 12 in patients without PET (p < 0.001 by t test). No serious complications occurred.Preoperative embolization therapy is a safe and uncomplicated technique, and tissue blood flow in the stomach was better preserved. This new technique is expected to reduce the frequency of anastomotic leakage after esophageal operation.
