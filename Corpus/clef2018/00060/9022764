Regional body FDG-PET in postoperative recurrent hyperparathyroidism. The use of preoperative imaging studies in patients with persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism after initial operation is generally accepted to improve the success rate and minimize the morbidity from reoperative surgery. The purpose of this study was to define the performance of FDG-PET for the localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue prior to reoperation.Twenty patients with biochemical evidence of recurrent or persistent hyperparathyroidism following previous neck surgery were investigated. Regional body PET imaging of the neck and upper chest (axial field of view 27.5 cm) was acquired 45 min after 5-10 mCi FDG was given intravenously.Subsequent surgery revealed solitary parathyroid adenomas in 14 patients, seven hyperplastic glands in 2 patients, and parathyroid carcinoma in 1 patients. FDG-PET correctly identified 79% (11/14) of the parathyroid adenomas, 29% (2/7) of the hyperplastic glands, and the parathyroid carcinoma. FDG-PET was negative in 79% (30/38) of the surgically identified normal parathyroid glands. Eight false-positive findings led to a positive predictive value of 64%.These preliminary data suggest that regional body FDG-PET is a promising procedure in the evaluation of patients with persistent or recurrent postoperative hyperparathyroidism.
