Noise analysis of MAP-EM algorithms for emission tomography. The ability to theoretically model the propagation of photon noise through PET and SPECT tomographic reconstruction algorithms is crucial in evaluating the reconstructed image quality as a function of parameters of the algorithm. In a previous approach for the important case of the iterative ML-EM (maximum-likelihood-expectation-maximization) algorithm, judicious linearizations were used to model theoretically the propagation of a mean image and a covariance matrix from one iteration to the next. Our analysis extends this approach to the case of MAP (maximum a posteriori)-EM algorithms, where the EM approach incorporates prior terms. We analyse in detail two cases: a MAP-EM algorithm incorporating an independent gamma prior, and a one-step-late (OSL) version of a MAP-EM algorithm incorporating a multivariate Gaussian prior, for which familiar smoothing priors are special cases. To validate our theoretical analyses, we use a Monte Carlo methodology to compare, at each iteration, theoretical estimates of mean and covariance with sample estimates, and show that the theory works well in practical situations where the noise and bias in the reconstructed images do not assume extreme values.
