Intermanual transfer of training: blood flow correlates in the human brain. In a previous study, we found that relearning of a task with one hand might negatively be influenced by previous, opposite hand training of the analogue task, Thut G., et al., Exp. Brain Res., 108 (1996) 321-327. Drawing of a figure with the right hand, following left hand training, was slower than right hand drawing of an unknown figure. These conditions were termed right hand transfer learning (rTL) and right hand original learning (rOL). The present study aimed to identify the cerebral areas associated with these influences by measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 16 right-handed, healthy subjects during rTL and rOL. Positron emission tomography and statistical parametric mapping were used. Compared with rOL, rTL was associated with increased rCBF in the left medial prefrontal cortex and the right prefrontal convexity. Individual rCBF changes in the area homotopic to the right prefrontal convexity furthermore correlated with individual changes in rTL performance. While the smallest rCBF increases were found in subjects with weakest slowing of rTL relative to rOL, highest rCBF increases were present when rTL slowing dominated. Comparisons between rTL and rOL, however, revealed on average no performance differences. Our data suggest that relearning after previous opposite hand training activates neural mechanisms within the prefrontal convexity which might have an inhibitory function but that inhibition does not have to be the net final behavioral result.
