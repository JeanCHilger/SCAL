Exercise-induced oxidative stress in patients during thallium stress testing. Free radical injury is implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease, including atherogenesis and reperfusion/injury. Strenuous physical exercise can cause oxidative stress by several mechanisms, including reperfusion/injury. We hypothesize that exercise-induced lipid peroxidation is greater among those with than those without exercise induced myocardial ischemia.The effect of physical exercise stress testing on plasma malonaldehyde (MDA) levels was compared between patients with (Group A, N = 8) and without (Group B) exercise-induced myocardial ischemia by thallium imaging.Two-way ANOVA was used to compare plasma MDA levels pre- and post-exercise, and paired t-test comparisons were conducted for percent MDA changes between Group A and Group B patients.Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant (P = 0.002) directional difference in response to exercise between the groups' mean plasma MDA levels (Group A increased by 46 +/-12.7 percent, Group B decreased by 16.8+/-4.6 percent).Differences in exercise-induced lipid peroxidation between patients with and without thallium documentation of myocardial ischemia have important implications in the development of clinical markers of coronary artery disease and further research related to atherogenesis.
