Cerebral processes related to visuomotor imagery and generation of simple finger movements studied with positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography was used to compare the functional anatomy of visual imagination and generation of movement. Subjects were asked to generate visual images of their finger movement in response to a preparatory signal. Four conditions were tested: in two, no actual movement was required in the other two, a second signal prompted the subjects to execute the imagined movement. Which movement to imagine was either specified by the preparatory stimulus or freely selected by the subjects. Compared with a rest condition, tasks involving only imagination activated several cortical regions (inferoparietal cortex, presupplementary motor area, anterior cingulate cortex, premotor cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) contralateral to the imagined movement. Tasks involving both imagination and movement additionally increased activity in the ipsilateral cerebellum, thalamus, contralateral anteroparietal, and motor cortex and decreased activity in the inferior frontal cortex. These results support the hypothesis that distinct functional systems are involved in visuomotor imagination and generation of simple finger movements: associative parietofrontal areas are primarily related to visuomotor imagination, with inferior frontal cortex likely engaged in active motor suppression, and primary motor structures contribute mainly to movement execution.
