Construction of a whole body blood flow model for use in positron emission tomography imaging with [15O]water. A whole body blood flow model (WBBFM) was developed and tested using STELLA II, an icon-driven mathematical simulation software package. The WBBFM uses parallel chambers to represent gray and white areas of the brain, body organs such as lungs, heart (right and left halves), injection site, and blood sampling sites. Input values to the WBBFM include organ blood flows, organ volumes, tissue:blood partition coefficients, injected activity, and data acquisition times for a positron emission tomography (PET) camera. Input variables included an injection function (e.g., bolus), and a blood flow function (e.g., transient variations in flow). The kinetic behavior of [15O]water, a freely diffusible radiotracer employed in PET to characterize blood flow was examined by the WBBFM. The physiologic behavior of water in the human body was emulated using the WBBFM and the model's predictive value was verified by comparing calculated results with the following properties of water: diffusibility, tissue:blood partition coefficient of [15O]water, and the mixing of [15O]water with total body water. The WBBFM simulated Kety's autoradiographic method used in the estimation of regional cerebral blood flow by PET using [15O]water. The application of the model to a cognitive activation study paradigm based on Kety's method is presented and its results compared to published literature data. With appropriate modification in the half-life, tissue:blood partition coefficient, and the amount of administered radioactivity, the WBBFM should prove useful as a tool to examine kinetics of other freely diffusible radiotracers used in PET.
