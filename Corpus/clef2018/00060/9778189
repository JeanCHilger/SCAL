Validation of a less-invasive method for measurement of serotonin synthesis rate with alpha-[11C]methyl-tryptophan. We tested in normal human subjects a less invasive method to obtain plasma input function required in the calculation of the brain serotonin synthesis rate measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and alpha-[11C]methyl-tryptophan (alpha-MTrp). The synthesis rates derived with the arterial input function were compared to those derived from venous plasma and venous sinus time-radioactivity curves obtained from dynamic PET images. Dynamic PET images were obtained for the lengths up to 90 minutes after an injection of alpha-MTrp (400 to 800 MBq). Input functions were generated from both artery and vein in three subjects, and from artery only in two subjects. Net unidirectional uptake constants of alpha-MTrp (K* mL/g/min) were calculated in several brain regions graphically using data between 20 and 60 minutes after injection with different input functions. In the five subjects with arterial sampling, we tested two methods for correcting the input functions from the venous samples: (1) normalization to the mean exposure time at 20 minutes from arterial curve
