18F-labeled 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose positron-emission tomography scans for the localization of the epileptogenic foci. The localization of epileptogenic foci that are amenable to curative epilepsy surgery may be accomplished by noninvasive surface electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, clinical observations, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and neuropsychologic tests. Other tests, such as invasive EEG, 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET or PET) scans, and single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans, have also been used at various epilepsy centers to help identify candidates who might benefit from such surgery. Interictal PET scans have demonstrated hypometabolism in areas concordant with the epileptogenic foci indicated by other diagnostic tests such as EEG and MRI. However, PET scans have also shown no abnormality in many patients with EEG-indicated epileptogenic foci in others, the scans have shown abnormal metabolism in areas that were discordant with the epileptogenic foci. Although substitution of the noninvasive PET scan for the invasive EEG recordings would be desirable, the available data were insufficient to determine whether PET scans might serve as a reliable substitute for EEG. A positive PET scan might contribute independent information for identifying the epileptogenic site but could be noncontributory or confusing when hypometabolism is not seen or is seen in presumably normal brain areas. It is not evident from the data in the literature to what extent confirmatory PET scan findings might contribute to the management of patients with complex partial seizures.
