Myocardial blood flow and coronary flow reserve late after anatomical correction of transposition of the great arteries. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) in children late after arterial switch operation (ASO) was investigated quantitatively by positron emission tomography (PET).In children with transposition of the great arteries (TGA), ASO is widely accepted as the management of choice. The long-term patency of coronary arteries after surgical transfer to the neo-aorta, however, remains a concern.Twenty-two normally developed, symptom-free children were investigated by PET with nitrogen-13 ammonia at rest and during adenosine vasodilation 10+/-1 years after ASO. A subgroup of 15 children (9+/-1 years group A) had simple TGA and underwent ASO within 20 days after birth while 7 (13+/-3 yearsResting MBF was not different between groups. After correction for the rate-pressure product as an index of cardiac work, younger children of group A had significantly higher MBF at rest compared to healthy adults (102+/-29 vs. 77+/-6 ml/100 g/min p = 0.012) while flow in group B was not different from the other groups (85+/-22 ml/100 g/minBlood flow measurements suggest decreased coronary reserve in the absence of ischemic symptoms in children late after arterial switch repair of TGA. The global impairment of stress flow dynamics may indicate altered vasoreactivity however, the prognostic significance of these findings needs to be determined.
