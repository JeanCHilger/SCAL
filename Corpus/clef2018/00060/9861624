The discrepancy between 99Tcm-ECD dynamic and static SPET images in patients with ischaemic lesions corresponds to reduced vasoreactivity to acetazolamide. We evaluated 99Tcm-N,N'-(1,2-ethylenediyl)bis-L-cysteine diethyl ester (99Tcm-ECD) dynamic and static SPET (single photon emission tomographic) images to examine 99Tcm-ECD kinetics under ischaemic cerebrovascular conditions. In 20 patients who showed arterial occlusion on magnetic resonance angiography, dynamic (0-10 min) and static (15-35 min) SPET images were acquired after the intravenous administration of 99Tcm-ECD. Thirteen of the patients had focal perfusion deficits that were more evident on the dynamic than on the static images the other seven showed no such discrepancy. In those patients with a mismatch between the dynamic and static images, the extent corresponded to reduced vaso-reactivity to acetazolamide. Based on quantitative analysis of the ratio of tracer uptake in affected to that in unaffected areas, the patients with discrepant findings showed significantly different ratios on the dynamic and static images, whereas those with no such mismatch did not. Our results suggest that dynamic 99Tcm-ECD images provide circulatory information and that static images reflect a filling-in phenomenon of ECD metabolites in ischaemic lesions. 99Tcm-ECD dynamic and static SPET images offer an alternative method of detecting mild perfusion deficits without the need for acetazolamide challenge.
