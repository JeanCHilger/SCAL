Blood flow-metabolism imaging with positron emission tomography in patients with diabetes mellitus for the assessment of reversible left ventricular contractile dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictive accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) blood flow-F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) imaging in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).Positron emission tomography accurately predicts the postrevascularization improvement in left ventricular dysfunction in unselected patients with CAD. In diabetic patients, however, poor myocardial glucose utilization may limit the accuracy of the approach.Forty patients (64+/-10 years old 19 with DM = group IOf 107 vascular territories analyzed, 46 were classified as mismatch, 29 as match and 32 as normal. The FDG image quality, assessed by F-18 myocardium to blood pool activity ratios, and the predictive accuracy were similar in both groups presence of a blood flow/FDG mismatch had a sensitivity of 92% (group I) and 94% (group II) and a specificity of 85% (group I) and 79% (group II) for an improvement in regional left ventricular function. A postrevascularization improvement in global left ventricular function was related to the extent of blood flow/FDG mismatchThe predictive accuracy of blood flow/FDG imaging is maintained in patients with DM when a clinically acceptable study protocol, which guarantees good FDG image quality, is used. The extent of a blood flow/metabolism mismatch is correlated with the magnitude of the postrevascularization improvement in global left ventricular function.
