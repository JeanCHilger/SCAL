Neuroimaging in Closed Head Injury. Closed head injury can be associated with significant neurologic dysfunction. Neuroimaging in this condition consists of conventional techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR), and functional imaging studies such as single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). Whereas CT and MR are sufficient to show the acute concomitants of head trauma such as extra-axial hematomas, contusions, and shear injury, functional brain imaging has been shown to play an important role in management of victims of closed head injury, particularly in the chronic stages. Detection of changes in regional cerebral blood flow associated with brain injury have been found to correlate better with neurological status and prognosis than abnormalities seen by CT or MRI.
