Dopamine imaging markers and predictive mathematical models for progressive degeneration in Parkinson's disease. We conducted PET imaging studies of modulation of dopamine transporter function and MRS studies of neurochemicals in idiopathic primate Parkinson's disease (PD) model induced by long-term, low-dose administration of MPTP. MR spectra showed striking similarities of the control spectrum of the primate and human striatum as well as MPTP-treated primate (six months after cessation of MPTP), and Parkinson's disease patient striatum (68 year old male Hoehn-Yahr scale II
