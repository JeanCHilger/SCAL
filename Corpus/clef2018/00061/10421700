A new generation of polyurethane vascular prostheses: rara avis or ignis fatuus? Three polyurethane (PU) vascular grafts with novel designs were investigated and compared in terms of the microporous structure, reinforcement technology, polymer chemistry, microphase separation, and mechanical properties. The Corvita graft, composed of a poly(carbonate urethane) polymer, displayed a helically wound filament structure with communicating inter-fiber spaces. The reinforced model contained an external PET mesh impregnated with a protein sealant, and displayed good microphase separation, the highest Young's modulus in the longitudinal direction, and the second highest in the radial direction. The Thoratec graft was made of a polyetherurethaneurea with an average micropore size of 15 microns. Silicone was observed on both surfaces of the graft. The Thoratec device displayed a low degree of hydrogen-bonding among the urethane groups and had no well-organized hard-segment domains. Its mechanical strength was superior to that of the Pulse-Tec graft. A solid PU layer underneath the luminal surface precluded any communication between the luminal and adventitial sides. The Pulse-Tec prosthesis was composed of polyetherurethane, with an average micropore size of 28 microns. It offered the highest radial compliance, a high degree of hydrogen-bonding, a narrow molecular weight distribution, and a certain degree of microphase separation. Its tensile strength and hysteresis loss were inferior to those of the other two grafts.
