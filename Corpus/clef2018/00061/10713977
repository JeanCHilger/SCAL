Influence of feeding regimen on body condition in the cat. The influence of feeding regimen on body condition in the cat was studied in a sample of the UK domestic cat population (n = 136). Data were collected by interviewing cat owners and assessing body condition of cats in the owners' homes. Four main factors were identified which were related to body condition. These were, in descending order of significance: neuter status, age, frequency of treat feeding, and ad libitum feeding. Feeding regimen as a risk factor in feline obesity is discussed.
