Diagnostic imaging of malignant lymphoma: current usefulness and limitation. The recent developments of imaging modalities allow us to make a diagnosis of malignant lymphoma, to determine its staging, and to evaluate its response to treatments noninvasively. Especially, CT and MR imagings can visualize almost all organs involved by lymphoma with high spatial and contrast resolutions. However, it is difficult to detect the small diseased lymph nodes and splenic lesions. The tumor viability after treatments can not be accurately evaluated with imaging studies. The coverage of the whole lymph nodes during one examination is not easily achieved, either. The multidetector CT system, fast MR imaging techniques, new MR contrast media, and PET are expected to overcome these difficulties.
