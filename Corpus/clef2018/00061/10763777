Clinical PET imaging with the C-PET camera. Clinical PET studies require a high-performance and user-friendly PET camera. The C-PET camera uses a simple design and a large field of view for these purposes.We describe the camera features, daily quality control, and routine clinical study preparation, performance, processing and presentation from the technologist's perspective.The C-PET camera is used for whole-body cancer, cardiac and brain imaging. It operates clinically near its peak performance. The 25.6-cm axial field of view (FOV), lack of interplane septa and singles transmission capability allow 70 cm of the body to be surveyed in less than 1 h with good image quality. Quality control procedures take 30 min per day. Clinical scans and image processing are menu driven, allowing the technologist to perform several tasks simultaneously. Fully corrected images typically are available for physician review within 1 h of acquisition. The current procedures are outlined.The C-PET camera uses a clinically oriented design for rapid acquisition and presentation of high-quality PET images. Operation is straightforward and user-friendly.
