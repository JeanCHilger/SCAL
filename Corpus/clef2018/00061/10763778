New functional polar maps for estimating regional cardiac function using ECG-gated technetium-99m-tetrofosmin SPECT. The purpose of this work was to develop functional parameters to analyze regional cardiac function using ECG-gated 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT. Our goal was to develop a methodology that used slice thickness correction, the generation of a time-activity curve and a polar map.Fourteen normal patients without evidence of coronary artery disease were studied. One hour after intravenous injection of 740-1110 MBq (20-30 mCi) 99mTc-tetrofosmin, ECG-gated SPECT data were acquired by dividing a cardiac cycle into 12 frames. The SPECT data were reconstructed from 11 of 12 frames into 3 views. The reconstruction of these images was repeated after performing slice thickness correction. Excluding the effect of different apex-to-base lengths at any frame during a cardiac cycle, 10 short-axis images with the same slice thickness were obtained. Each short-axis image was divided by 40 radii into 40 segments. The time-activity curve was generated from the total counts included in each segment plus both neighboring segments. Subsequently the curve fitting was performed using the second Fourier function.From fitted curves and their differentials, we calculated end-systolic count, end-diastolic count, percent count increase, uptake, peak contraction rate, peak distention rate and contraction time.The functional polar maps visually demonstrated regional myocardial function. This method is expected to be helpful for assessing regional cardiac function using 99mTc-tetrofosmin.
