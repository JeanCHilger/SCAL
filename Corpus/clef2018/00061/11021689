LROC analysis of detector-response compensation in SPECT. Localization ROC (LROC) observer studies examined whether detector response compensation (DRC) in ordered-subset, expectation-maximization (OSEM) reconstructions helps in the detection and localization of hot tumors. Simulated gallium (Ga-67) images of the thoracic region were used in the study. The projection data modeled the acquisition of attenuated 93- and 185-keV photons with a medium-energy parallel-hole collimator, but scatter was not modeled. Images were reconstructed with five strategies: 1) OSEM with no DRC 2) OSEM preceded by restoration filtering
