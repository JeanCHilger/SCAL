Relation of regional sympathetic denervation and myocardial perfusion disturbance to wall motion impairment in Chagas' cardiomyopathy. Impairment of sinus node autonomic control and myocardial perfusion disturbances have been described in patients with chronic Chagas' cardiomyopathy. However, it is not clear how these conditions contribute to myocardial damage. In this investigation, iodine-123 (I-123) meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and thallium-201 myocardium segmental uptake were studied in correlation with the severity of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction detected in various phases of Chagas' heart disease. Group I consisted of 12 subjects (43 +/- 4 years, 7 men) with no symptoms and no cardiac involvement on electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiography group II consisted of 13 patients (48 +/- 3 years, 9 men) with abnormal resting ECG and/or echocardiographic segmental abnormalities, and LV ejection fraction of > or = 0.5
