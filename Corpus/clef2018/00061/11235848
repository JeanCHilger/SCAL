Postexercise left ventricular function: a comparative assessment by different noninvasive imaging modalities. The variety of noninvasive imaging modalities now available permits assessment of different aspects of left ventricular function in the postexercise state. Some of these modalities, such as first-pass radionuclide ventriculography, permit a nearly instantaneous assessment of left ventricular function in the early postexercise state. These modalities indicate that most exercise-induced left ventricular wall motion abnormalities resolve quickly after exercise. Resting wall motion abnormalities may also improve in the postexercise period this response indicates the presence of hibernating myocardium capable of improving in response to myocardial revascularization procedures. On the other hand, all imaging techniques indicate that a certain percentage of exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities may persist into the postexercise period, and this finding signifies that severe coronary disease subtends the region of persisting wall motion abnormality. Further, if there is increased left ventricular size after exercise, both extensive and severe coronary disease are present. A conceptual framework for unifying these disparate findings is provided. These results underscore the importance of postexercise imaging in enhancing clinical assessment and imply that there are important technical considerations to contemplate when performing certain tests such as postexercise echocardiography.
