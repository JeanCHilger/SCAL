Exaggerated muscle mechanoreflex control of reflex renal vasoconstriction in heart failure. In heart failure (HF) patients, reflex renal vasoconstriction during exercise is exaggerated. We hypothesized that muscle mechanoreceptor control of renal vasoconstriction is exaggerated in HF. Nineteen HF patients and nineteen controls were enrolled in two exercise protocols: 1) low-level rhythmic handgrip (mechanoreceptors and central command) and 2) involuntary biceps contractions (mechanoreceptors). Renal cortical blood flow was measured by positron emission tomography, and renal cortical vascular resistance (RCVR) was calculated. During rhythmic handgrip, peak RCVR was greater in HF patients compared with controls (37 +/- 1 vs. 27 +/- 1 units P < 0.01). Change in (Delta) RCVR tended to be greater as well but did not reach statistical significance (10 +/- 1 vs. 7 +/- 0.9 units
