Synthesis and characterization of oxidized W(6)S(8)L(6) clusters. Cationic [W(6)S(8)L(6)]PF(6) (L = PEt(3) (3), 4-tert-butylpyridine (4)) clusters were successfully synthesized and isolated for the first time by reacting the corresponding neutral W(6)S(8)L(6) (L = PEt(3) (1), 4-tert-butylpyridine (2)) clusters with [Cp(2)Fe]PF(6) as the oxidant. The products 3 and 4 were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography (only for 3) and shown to be the desired oxidized W(6)S(8) clusters with a metal electron count of 19. Magnetic property studies showed that they are paramagnetic compounds with S = (1)/(2). Their chemical properties and stability are also reported.
