FDG PET of primary benign and malignant bone tumors: standardized uptake value in 52 lesions. To evaluate the standardized uptake value (SUV) of 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) at positron emission tomography (PET) in the differentiation of benign from malignant bone lesions.Fifty-two (19 malignant, 33 benign) primary bone lesions were examined with FDG PET prior to tissue diagnosis. The SUVs were calculated and compared between benign and malignant lesions and among histologic subgroups that included more than four cases.There was a statistically significant difference in SUV between benign (2.18 +/- 1.52 [SD]) and malignant (4.34 +/- 3.19) lesions in total (P =.002). However, giant cell tumors (n = 5 SUV, 4.64 +/- 1.05) showed significantly higher SUV than chondrosarcomas (n = 7Radiologists should be aware of the high accumulation of FDG in some benign bone lesions, especially histiocytic or giant cell-containing lesions. Consideration of histologic subtypes should be included in analysis of SUV at FDG PET of primary bone tumors.
