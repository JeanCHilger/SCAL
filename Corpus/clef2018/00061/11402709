Abdominal ultrasonography in pet guinea pigs. Ultrasonographic examination of 40 pet guinea pigs was performed in the framework of this study. Preparation of the patient for ultrasonography and the examination procedure are described. Normal ultrasonographic findings of the abdominal organs including the liver, spleen, kidney and urinary bladder are presented and illustrated for the first time in this species. Ultrasonography was found to be a useful investigative tool in the diagnosis of abdominal diseases in guinea pigs. In comparison to other diagnostic methods like physical examination including palpation, haematological examination, radiography and diagnostic laparotomy, ultrasonography offers a rapid, non-invasive and reliable means of diagnosing abdominal diseases in this species.
