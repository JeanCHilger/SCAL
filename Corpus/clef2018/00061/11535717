Evaluation of early-stage Parkinson's disease with 99mTc-TRODAT-1 imaging. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a selective loss of dopamine in the striatum. Problems remain in the accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. A 99mTc-labeled tropane derivative that binds to dopamine transporter with high selectivity is [2-[[2-[[[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3,2,1]oct-2-yl]methyl](2-mercaptoethyl)amino]ethyl]amino]ethanethiolato(3-)-N2,N2',S2,S2']oxo-[1R-(exo-exo)] (TRODAT-1). The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential usefulness of 99mTc-TRODAT-1 imaging in the evaluation of patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease.Thirty-four patients with early-stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease were recruited. For all patients, the Parkinson's disease was stage 2 or less as assessed by the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Seventeen age-matched healthy volunteers (8 men, 9 women) served as controls. 99mTc-TRODAT-1 was prepared from a lyophilized kit. Brain SPECT imaging was performed between 165 and 195 min after injection, using a double-head camera equipped with fanbeam collimators. Specific uptake in the striatum and its subregions, including the putamen and caudate nucleus, was calculated and compared with that of the other sides and of healthy volunteers.A continuous reduction in specific striatal uptake of 99mTc-TRODAT-1 with increasing disease severity was found in Parkinson's disease patients (control vs. stage I vs. stage II, 1.98 vs. 1.62 vs. 1.22, respectively, P < 0.01). The changes were magnified by measurement of specific putaminal uptake (control vs. stage I vs. stage II, 1.81 vs. 1.27 vs. 0.94, respectively, P < 0.01). The mean values of specific putaminal uptake contralateral to the more affected limbs were significantly decreased compared with the ipsilateral sides in both stage I and stage II groups (1.02 vs. 1.49 for stage I and 0.73 vs. 1.14 for stage II, P < 0.01). Moreover, a significant loss of putaminal uptake ipsilateral to the symptoms was found in the stage I group compared with the healthy volunteers (1.49 vs. 1.81, P < 0.01). The difference became greater when the posterior putaminal uptakes were compared. No remarkable adverse reactions were found in either healthy volunteers or Parkinson's disease patients during or after imaging.For clinical practice, 99mTc-TRODAT-1 may serve as a useful imaging agent for the early detection of Parkinson's disease.
