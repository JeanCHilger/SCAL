Effects of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, piroxicam, on tumor response, apoptosis, and angiogenesis in a canine model of human invasive urinary bladder cancer. The mechanisms by which cyclooxygenase inhibitors exert antitumor effects are not completely defined but are postulated to involve antiangiogenic effects and induction of apoptosis. In this study, we determined the effects of the cox inhibitor, piroxicam, on tumor response, apoptotic index, proliferative index, cyclooxygenase-2 expression, prostaglandin E(2) concentration, tumor microvessel density, and urine basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations in pet dogs with naturally occurring invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Piroxicam caused reduction in tumor volume in 12 of 18 dogs, and this was strongly associated with induction of apoptosis (Fisher's exact test P < 0.015) and reduction in urine basic fibroblast growth factor concentration.
