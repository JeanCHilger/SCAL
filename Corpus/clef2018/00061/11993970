Rabies antibody testing and the UK Pet Travel Scheme. The Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) commenced on February 28, 2000, allowing pet dogs and cats from named countries to enter the UK without spending six months in quarantine as long as they met specific criteria. Since the start of the scheme to the end of February 2002, more than 45,000 animals have successfully entered the UK under PETS. In this article, Dr Tony Fooks and colleagues consider the results of serological testing under the scheme at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency and look to future developments.
