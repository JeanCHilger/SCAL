The diagnosis of subclinical hepatic encephalopathy. Subclinical hepatic encephalopathy, has been recognized in patients with cirrhosis, irrespectively of its etiology. Patients exhibit different cognitive deficits (in visual-spatial perception, attention, concentration, constructional ability, etc.), which are not detectable during standard neurological examination, but adversely affect daily functioning. The prevalence of this disorder among patients with cirrhosis is estimated to vary from 30 to 84% according to various studies. We presented the pathogenesis of subclinical hepatic encephalopathy. We discussed psychometric tests, which were the most important and sensitive diagnostic tools in this disorder. The significance of the abnormalities in the electrophysiological examination (EEG, visual evoked potentials, P300 wave, event-related potentials) and in computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, single photon emission computed tomography and proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy were presented.
