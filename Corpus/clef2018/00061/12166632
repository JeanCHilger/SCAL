Psychological evaluation test after the use of assisted reproduction techniques. The emotional changes provoked by the use of assisted reproduction techniques (ART) may trigger important psychological reactions. The objective of the present study was to develop a psychological evaluation test (PET-ART) in order to identify the occurrence of psychological problems and to facilitate their treatment.A total of 128 women were submitted to PET-ART of the Center for Human Reproduction, "Sinh√° Junqueira" Maternity Foundation, after application of IVF/ICSI program at least once. The causes of infertility were male-related in 45% of cases, female-related in 48%, and both male- and female-related in 7%. Infertility was primary in 79% of cases and secondary in 21%. The mean age of the women was 34.5 +/- 5.2 years and the mean age of the men was 37.9 +/- 6.8 years. The PET-ART was evaluated using a questionnaire with 15 questions selected in order to detect emotional reactions caused by infertility. The responses were assigned four grades with respect to intensity (1 = mild intensity 2 = medium intensityThe PET-ART identified five questions receiving 50% or more responses of the high/maximum intensity type (sum of the percentages of responses with a score of 3 and 4). The questions were the following: 1--The waiting time before being submitted to a pregnancy test (82.8% of the patients) 2--A negative result of the pregnancy test (77.3% of the patients)The PET-ART was an efficient tool for the identification of women with emotional changes provoked by the application of ART and for the planning of their treatment. However, a general psychological approach was developed for each emotional factor regardless of PET-ART.
