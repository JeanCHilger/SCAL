New therapeutic options of carcinoid syndrome metastatic to the liver. Carcinoid syndrome is a relatively rare disease, generally associated with poor prognosis. Conventional diagnostic and therapeutic methods often prove inadequate and ineffective. New therapeutic options have recently been provided by Radiolabeled long-acting somatostatin analogs (Octreotide), alpha interferon, 131 MIBG and non-pharmacological methods--embolization of the hepatic artery, gene therapy, and combined therapies.
