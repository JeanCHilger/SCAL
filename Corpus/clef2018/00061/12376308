Single photon emission computerized tomography of spongiform leukoencephalopathy heroin addicts: analysis of 10 cases. To investigate the changes in cerebral circulation in heroin addicts with pongiform leukoencephalopathy.Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) was performed in 10 such patients.Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the involved white matter of bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres was obviously reduced. rCBF of temporal lobes, parietal lobes, cerebellar hemispheres and basal ganglion were reduced in varying degrees.As demonstrated by the result of SPECT, rCBF in the white matter of bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres was reduced with partial involvement of the gray matter of heroin addicts with spongiform leukoencephalopathy.
