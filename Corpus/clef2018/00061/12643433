Free right internal thoracic artery composite graft: an option in left anterior descending artery grafting? Myocardial revascularization using bilateral internal thoracic arteries (ITA) decreases the risk of reinterventions and provides potential survival benefit. From May 1996 to April 2000, 1,057 patients underwent myocardial revascularization using skeletonized bilateral ITAs. A free right ITA as a composite graft was used for the left anterior descending artery grafting in 38 (3.6%) cases when the left ITA was not long enough to reach the left anterior descending artery. Operative mortality was 2.6% (1 patient). There was no observable reversible myocardial ischemia on the postoperative thallium single-photon emission computed tomography study. Myocardial revascularization with the use of a skeletonized free right ITA as a composite graft to the left anterior descending artery is an alternative option in cases when an in situ ITA cannot be used.
