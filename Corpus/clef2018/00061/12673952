Biomedical imaging in pharmacology with nuclear medical imaging methodologies: positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The nuclear imaging technologies, positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), have the power to non-invasively obtain dynamic and real-time information on the in vivo behaviors of radiolabeled molecules not only in humans but also in experimental animals. Thus, PET and SPECT can image molecular interactions of biological processes in vivo directly and reveal biological phenomena that are hidden from view. Furthermore, these imaging procedures also can be repeatedly performed before and after interventions, thereby allowing each subject to be used as its own control. In these studies, the radiolabeled compounds used as imaging probes for non-invasive assays of biochemical processes should have defined in vivo behaviors that can provide valuable information on the physiological and pharmacological processes. This paper describes the principle of the nuclear medical imaging systems, rational design of radiolabeled imaging probes, and the application to in vivo investigation of the change of various neurotransmission systems under disease and drug treatment. The efficient utilization of these nuclear medical imaging technologies will accelerate biomedical studies and drug development.
