125I-BMIPP and 18F-FDG uptake in a transgenic mouse model of stunned myocardium. Reported metabolic patterns in myocardial stunning are not uniform. We investigated relative myocardial perfusion, glucose and fatty acid uptake using a technetium-99 hexakis-2-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile (MIBI), fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) and iodine-125 15-(p-iodo-phenyl)-3(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) mixture, in a recently developed transgenic (TR) mouse model which mimics stunned myocardium. Twenty-seven mice - 14 TR and 13 age-matched wild type controls (C) - were divided into four groups: TR-fed, TR-fasted, C-fed and C-fasted. Animals were sacrificed 2 h after injection, tissue samples counted and percent-injected dose/gram tissue (% id/g) calculated for each radioisotope. Tissues were also Folch extracted and 125I incorporation into the various lipid pools (TG, triglycerides DG, diglycerides
