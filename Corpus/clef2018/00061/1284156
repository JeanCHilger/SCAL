Reduction of myocardial ischemia by gallopamil: a dual-isotope study with thallium-201 and iodine-123 phenylpentadecanoic acid. The present study was performed for characterizing the effect of chronic oral treatment with the calcium antagonist gallopamil on regional myocardial perfusion and free fatty acid utilization in poststenotic human myocardium. Twenty-two patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease and stable angina pectoris underwent consecutive dual-isotope studies following simultaneous injection of 80 MBq thallium-201 and 200 MBq iodine-123 phenylpentadecanoic acid (IPPA) during a symptom-limited stress test. Radionuclide studies were performed after 1 week of placebo treatment (baseline), 4 weeks after oral treatment with 50 mg of gallopamil t.i.d. and again after 1 week of double-blind treatment with gallopamil or placebo. As compared to baseline, initial (poststress) uptake of both tracers in poststenotic myocardial segments was significantly improved after 4 weeks of treatment with gallopamil [thallium-201, +9.0% p < 0.001
