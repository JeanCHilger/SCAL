Roles of positron emission tomography with fluorine-18-deoxyglucose in the detection of local recurrent and distant metastatic sarcoma. Sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors comprising approximately 1% of all malignancies. Definitive treatment of sarcoma is surgical resection. However, after surgical removal, 40% to 60% of the patients will develop local or distant recurrence. Therefore, the early detection and treatment of recurrence is an important part of modern sarcoma therapy. Positron emission tomography with fluorine-18-deoxyglucose (FDG-PET) has been highly successful in detecting and staging a variety of malignancies. However, its use in the management of patients with sarcoma is less defined. The purpose of our study was to assess the potential roles of FDG-PET in the detection of local recurrence and distant metastases. In this retrospective study, the images of 33 FDG-PET scans, reports of 29 computed tomography (CT) scans, and 8 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 28 patients were compared with surgical pathology or clinical follow up for at least 6 months. FDG-PET detected all 25 cases of local and distant recurrences with 100% sensitivity. CT was able to detect 18 of the 22 possible cases of recurrent disease, whereas MRI was able to detect 5 of 7 cases of recurrent disease. PET was particularly useful in patients with extensive histories of surgery and radiation therapy, precisely the setting in which CT and MRI have the lowest specificity and sensitivity. In conclusion, FDG-PET was a sensitive test to detect local and distant recurrences of sarcoma and this warrants further investigation.
