PET practice in nuclear pharmacy. PET systems, which are based on many years of work in theoretical and practical physics, provide a window into both normal and disease state biochemical processes not possible by other external imaging techniques. FDG is a workhorse of PET chemistry, helping to visualize the accumulation of glucose in cancer cells. A complex series of steps is involved in [18F]fluoride ion production to make a sterile, injectable solution of FDG. PET and CT scanners are being developed that increase greatly the clinical utility of both technologies.
