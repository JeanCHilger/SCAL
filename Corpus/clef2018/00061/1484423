The usefulness of dipyridamole stress myocardial scintigram as a preoperative test for detecting ischemic heart disease before vascular surgery. We evaluated the usefulness of dipyridamole 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy (DS) for detecting myocardial ischemia in 18 candidate for vascular surgery. DS indicated significant thallium redistribution in 6 patients. Coronary angiography was performed in 5 of these 6 patients and revealed significant coronary artery disease in all patients. As a result, operation was cancelled in 4 patients with severe coronary artery disease. One of these cases died of acute myocardial infarction after being discharged from hospital. One other patient was operated after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Another patient was operated knowing that he had significant but mild coronary artery disease. Subsequently, operations were performed in 14 patients. No serious cardiac event occurred in these 14 patients except one case with T wave inversion without myocardial enzyme elevation. Thus, we concluded that DS was a useful method for detecting ischemic heart disease and prevent cardiac event associated with vascular surgery.
