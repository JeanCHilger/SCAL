Usefulness and limitations of ECG-gated myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (MIBI) in patients with prior myocardial infarction. To evaluate the relationship between regional wall motion and 99mTc-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (MIBI) uptake, ECG-gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc-MIBI was performed in 20 patients with prior myocardial infarction. The left ventricular images at end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) were divided into 39 segments, respectively. Based on circumferential profile analysis, relative uptake (%EDc, %ESc), percent count increase (% delta C), and normalized percent count increase (% delta Cn) were analyzed in each segment and compared with regional wall motion indices assessed by echocardiography and left ventriculography. ECG-gated SPECT with 99mTc-MIBI provided high contrast tomograms of the left ventricular myocardium. %EDc and %ESc showed good correlations with regional wall motion indices. % delta C and % delta Cn, however, showed lower correlations compared with %EDc and %ESc. In conclusion, high-quality left ventricular images were obtained with 99mTc-MIBI ECG-gated SPECT, but quantitative analysis based on only percent count increase (% delta C) have limitations for evaluation of regional wall motion.
