Cognition and 99Tcm-HMPAO SPECT in Parkinson's disease. 99Tcm-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of brain was performed in 43 unselected patients with Parkinson's disease to evaluate whether low cerebral perfusion on SPECT correlated with cognitive impairment in the patients. All patients received neurological, Mini-Mental State Examination and a neuropsychological assessment. Eighteen (41.9%) of the 43 patients were demented. Thirty patients (69.8%) had abnormal SPECT: 17 had perfusion defects in cortical regions, eight in basal ganglia and five in both regions. Of the 22 patients with abnormal cortical perfusion, 15 (68.2%) were demented only three (14.3%) of the 21 patients without cortical defect were demented (P < 0.01). Twelve of the 15 demented patients had low perfusion in the parietal region alone or in parietal and occipital regions. The cortical perfusion defects, present in 22 (51.2%) Parkinson's patients, are highly correlated with cognitive impairment. The pattern of SPECT abnormality in most demented patients with Parkinson's disease is similar to that seen in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that the underlying pathophysiology for dementia in patients with Parkinson's disease may be similar to that in Alzheimer's disease.
