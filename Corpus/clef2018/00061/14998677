Extracorporeal focused ultrasound surgery for treatment of human solid carcinomas: early Chinese clinical experience. The objective of this article is to introduce the early Chinese clinical experience of using extracorporeal focused ultrasound (US) surgery (FUS) for the treatment of solid tumors. From December 1997 to October 2001, a total of 1038 patients with solid tumors underwent FUS ablation in 10 Chinese hospitals. The tumors included primary and metastatic liver cancer, malignant bone tumors, breast cancer, soft tissue sarcomas, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, abdominal and pelvic malignant tumors, uterine myoma, benign breast tumors, hepatic hemangioma and other solid tumors. In this article, pathologic changes in tumors treated with FUS, real-time diagnostic imaging for targeting, monitoring and assessment of results by follow-up images are presented. Early clinical results and complications of the technique are also reported.
