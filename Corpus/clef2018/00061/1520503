Tumor and organ biochemical profiles determined in vivo following uptake of a combination of radiolabeled substrates: potential applications for PET. This paper describes a method which generates an in vivo metabolic profile of tumors and organ tissues derived from the tissue uptake of a combination of radiotracers. Metabolic substrates labeled with carbon-11, a positron-emitting radionuclide (T1/2 = 20.4 min) have been used to probe tumor metabolism in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET). Carbon-11 labeled radiotracers which have been used include alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB), 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), and thymidine (TdR). This paper reports data on the tissue distribution of carbon-14 labeled analogues of AIB, 2-DG, and TdR. Tissue distribution studies were carried out in normal male Copenhagen rats, in rats bearing Dunning R3327G or R3327H prostatic adenocarcinomas, and in tumor rats that have been treated with difluoromethylornithine and methylglyoxal-bisguanylhydrazone, or with diethylstilbestrol. A combination of the tissue distribution data of these radiolabeled agents is used to provide a metabolic description of the state of a tumor or tissue in vivo. This approach to defining a tissue's biochemical profile may be useful for the assessment and prediction of a therapeutic response, even at low tracer concentrations in a tumor, and may be useful in relating the biochemical characteristics of one tissue to that of another.
