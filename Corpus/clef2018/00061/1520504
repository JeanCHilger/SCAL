Detecting coronary artery disease using SPECT imaging: a comparison of thallium-201 and teboroxime. Thirty subjects underwent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging with technetium-99m teboroxime (TEBO). Of these, 26 underwent thallium SPECT imaging and 25 underwent quantitative coronary arteriography (QCA). Twenty-one of the subjects underwent all three studies. SPECT images were reviewed by two independent observers blinded to the clinical data. Stenoses were considered significant if there was a greater than or equal to 50% diameter narrowing as defined by QCA analysis of the coronary arteriograms. The overall sensitivity and specificity was 78% and 78%, respectively, for thallium-201. The overall sensitivity and specificity for teboroxime was 72% and 80%, respectively. The results obtained for these two tracers were not statistically different. Some of the false-positive results obtained from teboroxime imaging appear to have been due to the 10-min acquisition protocol and can be reduced with the use of new software programs using a continuous 3-min acquisition and dipyridamole. Teboroxime's rapid biologic half-life allows completion of SPECT imaging within 60-90 min, compared with the minimum of 4 h required for thallium SPECT imaging.
