Time-course changes of regional cerebral blood flow by SPECT with N-isopropyl-p-[123I]-iodoamphetamine in childhood partial seizures. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with N-isopropyl-p-[123I]-iodoamphetamine was performed twice at different times in 18 children suffering from partial seizures to evaluate the time-course changes of the hemodynamics in the focal region. Comparison of the 2 SPECT images revealed that a decreased regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the first was normalized in 4 cases (22.2%) and contracted in 7 cases (38.9%). The region of decreased blood flow in the second was contralateral to that in the first in 1 case (5.6%) and unchanged in 6 cases (33.3%). Most of the normalized and contracted cases were those in which clinical seizures disappeared and the EEG findings were normalized. In these cases which responded to treatment, the decreased regional CBF was also found to be improved. Repeated SPECT appears to be useful for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy. On the other hand, most of the unchanged cases were those in which clinical seizures were frequent or uncontrolled, or which persistently showed the abnormalities in their EEG. SPECT was considered to reflect well the conditions of the epileptic foci. These results indicate that repeated SPECT for observing the time-course changes of the regional CBF represents a useful technique with can be applied in evaluating the therapeutic efficacy or deciding the time to discontinue treatment and for pathogenetic elucidation of the epileptic foci.
