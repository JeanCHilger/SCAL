Relating fMRI and PET signals to neural activity by means of large-scale neural models. This article reviews the four ways by which large-scale, neurobiologically realistic modeling can be used in conjunction with functional neuroimaging data, especially that obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), to help investigators understand the neural bases for sensorimotor and cognitive functions. The conceptually distinct purposes served are:(1) formulating and implementing specific hypotheses about how neuronal populations mediate a task, which will be illustrated using models of visual and auditory object processing (2) determining how well an experimental design paradigm or analysis method works, which will be illustrated by examining event-related fMRI
