From 3-D positron emission tomography to 3-D positron emission tomography/computed tomography: what did we learn? The recent introduction of combined positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scanners is having a far-reaching effect on the field of medical imaging by bringing functional imaging to the forefront in radiology, oncology and other specialties. The PET/CT scanner is an evolution in technology combining two well-developed imaging modalities: anatomical imaging with CT and functional imaging with PET. The first prototype PET/CT scanner was a consequence of a succession of steps that, in chronological order, included the development of the High Density Avalanche Chamber (HIDAC) PET camera, 3-D PET methodology and the rotating partial-ring tomograph (PRT). The successful completion of each step was a prerequisite to progress to the next phase, and the lessons learned could then be applied to subsequent initiatives. This review will map the milestones from 3-D PET to 3-D PET/CT and assess the role each step played in the development of PET instrumentation over the past two decades.
