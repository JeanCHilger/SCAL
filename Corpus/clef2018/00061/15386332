2-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography imaging is predictive of pathologic response and survival after preoperative chemoradiation in patients with esophageal carcinoma. The current study was performed to assess the value of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in predicting the pathologic response and survival of patients with esophageal carcinoma treated with preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) and tumor resection. Preliminary reports suggest that FDG-PET may be predictive of the response of esophageal carcinoma patients to preoperative CRT.Eighty-three patients with resectable esophageal carcinoma who underwent preoperative CRT and FDG-PET and tumor resection were evaluated for pathologic response to CRT, percent residual tumor, and survival.The majority of patients in the current study were men (74 of 83 patients 89%). Most tumors were adenocarcinomas (73 of 83 tumorsPost-CRT FDG-PET was found to be predictive of pathologic response and survival in patients with esophageal carcinoma who undergo preoperative CRT. Esophagectomy should still be considered even if the post-CRT FDG-PET scan is normal because microscopic residual disease cannot be ruled out.
