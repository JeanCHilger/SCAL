Evaluation of [123I]IBZM pinhole SPECT for the detection of striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability in rats. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and MRI coregistration have been assessed to characterize striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor (D2/D3R) availability in rats following injection of the D2 and D3R radioligand [123I] iodobenzamide ([123I]IBZM). High-resolution SPECT data were obtained with a pinhole collimator. In order to precisely estimate brain regions of low radioligand uptake, SPECT images were coregistered onto a MRI template with high accuracy (maximum mismatch 1.1 mm). To evaluate an adequate dose of radioligand to be administered without exceeding the radioligand-to-receptor occupancy >5% and to define an appropriate time period for image acquisition, three untreated groups of animals received 29.6, 37, and 44.4 MBq of [123I]IBZM and underwent five consecutive SPECT acquisitions lasting 64 min each. Ratio calculations between specific striatal radioligand uptake and nondisplaceable cerebellar uptake revealed a secular equilibrium between 75 and 355 min post-tracer application in all three animal groups. Consequently, since the highest regional uptake values were obtained in the animal group receiving 44.4 MBq [123I]IBZM, this injection dose was considered to be appropriate. Finally, the capacity of the imaging method to detect distinct severity levels of striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor loss was tested in a low, medium, and high dose quinolinic acid (QA) animal model of Huntington's disease. Motor impairment indicative of striatal dysfunction was monitored using amphetamine-induced rotational behavior and locomotor activity. Loss of striatal D2/D3R bearing medium-sized spiny neurons was assessed by DARPP-32 immunohistochemistry and compared to [123I]IBZM binding. Optical density measures of DARPP-32 immunohistochemistry demonstrated QA dose-dependent mild to subtotal unilateral striatal lesions ranging from 29.4% to 96.9% when compared to the nonlesioned side. Linear regression analysis showed that measurements of striatal DARPP-32 optical density and striatal [123I]IBZM uptake of the lesioned side were highly correlated (r2=0.83 P<0.001) whereas correlation with locomotor activity was less tight (r2=0.23
