Spectrum of scintigraphic appearance of liver hemangiomas. Two hundred and twenty five liver hemangiomas in 166 patients were studied with Tc-99m labeled RBC and are the basis for this atlas. All hemangiomas showed various presentations of the perfusion blood pool mismatch, which is the basis for diagnosis. The size of the hemangiomas was the factor that determined the mixing of the Tc-99m RBC with the blood and, hence, the sequence of visualization of the lesion. Hemangiomas may appear as multiple lesions on liver scan and imitate metastases. Ninety-five hemangiomas appeared in 36 patients as multiple focal abnormalities. Hemangiomas are extremely variable in size. They may be huge (31 hemangiomas) and sometimes occupy most of the abdomen. Or they can be very small and are then detected only by SPECT (two cases). Thrombosed large hemangiomas appear as focal defects on Tc-99m RBC.
