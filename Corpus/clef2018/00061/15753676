Clinical value of different responses of serum thyroglobulin to recombinant human thyrotropin in the follow-up of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. In the present study, we examined the clinical value of a differential response of thyroglobulin (Tg) concentration after recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) stimulation (rhTSH Tg testing) and its correlation with (131)I uptake and whole body scanning (rhTSH-WBS) in 104 patients who had previously undergone near total thyroidectomy and (131)I ablation for differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). RhTSH Tg testing was considered negative for rhTSH-Tg < 0.9 ng/mL, low positive for rhTSH-Tg of 1-5 ng/mL and high positive for rhTSHTg > 5 ng/mL. RhTSH Tg testing was negative in 70 patients, one of whom had a lymph-node metastasis, but no (131)I uptake. Seven patients had low positive rhTSH Tg testing and no (131)I uptake, but two of these patients had cervical lymph-node metastases. Twenty-seven patients had high positive rhTSH Tg testing and (131)I uptake was detected in lung, bone, or mediastinum in 11. Imaging techniques (CT, MRI, FDG-PET) documented metastatic disease in 22. In conclusion, our results suggest that any rise in rhTSH-Tg, even at low level, should raise the suspicion of persistent or recurrent DTC. Patients with rhTSH-Tg at high level should be carefully evaluated, since DTC persistence is highly probable. TSH-WBS provides little adjunctive information.
