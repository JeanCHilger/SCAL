Prognostic value of noninvasive stressing modalities in patients with chest pain and normal coronary angiogram. Risk stratification of patients with recurrent chest pain and normal coronary angiogram is a relevant but still definitely unsolved clinical problem. In this article the relative value of mostly used noninvasive stress testing modalities is reviewed. In addition, future perspectives derived from alternative pathophysiological insights and new diagnostic approaches are briefly discussed.
