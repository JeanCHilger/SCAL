Update of nuclear medicine--PET imaging. A new era in nuclear medicine imaging emerged with the recent clinical acceptance of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning. By evaluating the metabolic activity of certain lesions, numerous cancers can now be detected and staged with high sensitivity and specificity. With the further advancements of PET/CT fusion, functional and anatomic detail of lesions can be acquired simultaneously with improved accuracy.
