Characterization of 68Ga-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide kinetics in patients with meningiomas. Because biopsy has a high risk of hemorrhage and the findings of CT and MRI are often ambiguous, especially at the base of the skull, additional methods for the characterization of intracranial tumors are needed. Meningiomas show high expression of the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 and thus offer the possibility of receptor-targeted imaging. We used the somatostatin analog (68)Ga-DOTA-d-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide (DOTA-TOC) labeled with the positron emitter (68)Ga (half-life, 68 min), obtained from a (68)Ge/(68)Ga generator, for PET of these tumors. In contrast to (18)F-FDG, this ligand shows high meningioma-to-background ratios. The aim was to evaluate kinetic parameters in meningiomas before radiotherapy.Dynamic PET scans (3-dimensional mode 28 framesSignificant differences (P < 0.05 t test) between meningiomas and the reference tissue were found for the mean standardized uptake value (10.5 vs.1.3), vB (0.42 vs. 0.11), k2 (0.12 vs. 0.56), k3 (0.024 vs. 0.060), k4 (0.004 vs. 0.080), and RB (0.49 vs. 0.13). Although there was no significant difference for k1 (0.54 vs. 0.40), the ratios k1/k2 (4.50 vs. 0.71) and k3/k4 (6.00 vs. 0.75) were markedly greater in meningiomas than in reference tissue.The high uptake of (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC in meningiomas can be explained by the high values for vB and by the remarkably low values for k2 and k4, leading to significantly greater k1/k2 and k3/k4 ratios and RB in meningiomas than in reference tissue. Thus, pharmacokinetic modeling offers a more detailed analysis of biologic properties of meningiomas. In further studies, these data might serve as a basis for monitoring the somatostatin receptors of meningiomas after radiotherapy.
