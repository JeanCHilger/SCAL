Whole-body 18F-FDG PET in recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the sensitivity and prognostic significance of whole-body (18)F-FDG PET for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients for whom there was a suspicion of recurrence or metastasis by conventional radiologic or clinical findings during their follow-up examinations.Whole-body (18)F-FDG PET examinations were performed on 64 Taiwanese NPC patients (14 female, 50 male mean age +/- SD, 45.8 +/- 13.0 yThe sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of (18)F-FDG PET images in the diagnosis of NPC recurrence or metastases and secondary primary cancers were 92%, 90%, 92%, 90%, and 91%, respectively. Furthermore, the presence of (18)F-FDG hypermetabolism was highly correlated with the survival time of NPC patients.Whole-body (18)F-FDG PET is a sensitive follow-up diagnostic tool for the evaluation of NPC recurrences and metastases. It is also an effective prognostic indicator for NPC patients. To determine the optimized utilization of (18)F-FDG PET in the follow-up for NPC patients, further cost-effectiveness analysis of (18)F-FDG PET in combination with conventional management is necessary.
