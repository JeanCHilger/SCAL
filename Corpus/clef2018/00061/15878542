Vascular PET prostheses surface modification with cyclodextrin coating: development of a new drug delivery system. Cyclodextrins (CDs) are torus shaped cyclic oligosaccharides with a hydrophobic internal cavity and a hydrophilic external surface. We performed and analysed an antibiotic binding on Dacron (polyethyleneterephtalate, PET) vascular grafts, previously coated with CDs based polymers.The CDs coating process was based on the pad-dry-cure method patented in our laboratory. The Dacron prostheses were immersed into a solution containing a polycarboxylic acid, a cyclodextrin and a catalyst, and placed into a thermofixation oven before impregnation with an antibiotic solution (Vancomycin). Biocompatibility tests were performed with L132 human epithelial cells. The antibiotic release in an aqueous medium was assessed by batch type experiments using UV spectroscopy.Viability tests confirmed that the CDs polymers coating the Dacron fibers were not toxic towards L132 cell. Cell proliferation was similar on coated and uncoated grafts. A linear release of Vancomycin was observed over 50 days.Our results demonstrate the feasibility of coating CDs onto vascular Dacron grafts. Biological tests show no toxicity of the different cyclodextrins coated. A linear release of antibiotics was depicted over 50 days, demonstrating that cyclodextrin grafting was an efficient drug delivery system.
