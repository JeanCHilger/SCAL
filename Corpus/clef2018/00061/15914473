Imaging and cancer: research strategy of the American College of Radiology Imaging Network. The American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) is a cooperative group funded by the National Cancer Institute and dedicated to developing and conducting clinical trials of diagnostic imaging and image-guided treatment technologies. ACRIN's six disease site committees are responsible for developing scientific strategies and resultant trials within the framework of ACRIN's five key hypotheses: (a) Screening and early detection with imaging can reduce cancer-specific mortality. (b) Less invasive image-guided therapeutic methods can reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with treating cancer. (c) Molecular-based physiologic and functional imaging can improve the diagnosis and staging of cancer, thus improving treatment. (d) Functional imaging can portray the effectiveness of treatment earlier and more accurately, thus reducing mortality and improving the likelihood of a cure. (e) Informatics and other "smart systems" can improve the evaluation of patients with cancer, thus leading to better and more effective treatments. This article details ACRIN's research strategy according to disease site through the year 2007.
