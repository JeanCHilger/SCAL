Development of Korean standard brain templates. We developed age, gender and ethnic specific brain templates based on MR and Positron-Emission Tomography (PET) images of Korean normal volunteers. Seventy-eight normal right-handed volunteers (M/F=49/29) underwent 3D T1-weighted SPGR MR and F-18-FDG PET scans. For the generation of standard templates, an optimal target brain that has the average global hemispheric shape was selected for each gender. MR images were then spatially normalized by linear transformation to the target brains, and normalization parameters were reapplied to PET images. Subjects were subdivided into 2 groups for each gender: the young/midlife (<55 yr) and the elderly groups. Young and elderly MRI/PET templates were composed by averaging the spatially normalized images. Korean templates showed different shapes and sizes (mean length, width, and height of the brains were 16.5, 14.3 and 12.1 cm for man, and 15.6, 13.5 and 11.4 cm for woman) from the template based on Caucasian (18.3, 14.2, and 13.3 cm). MRI and PET templates developed in this study will provide the framework for more accurate stereotactic standardization and anatomical localization.
