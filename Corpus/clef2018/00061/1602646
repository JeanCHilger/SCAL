Evaluation of infantile ventricular tachycardia by 201Tl myocardial SPECT. 201Tl myocardial SPECT findings in infantile ventricular tachycardia (VT) were examined. The subjects were 4 cases of infantile VT subjected exercise-loading 201Tl scintigraphy in 1990. These cases (3 males and 1 female) were aged 11-14 years, being persistent and non-persistent type VT (2 cases each). Echocardiography revealed no abnormal findings in these 4 cases. Exercise-loading was performed by means of sitting ergometer. ECG revealed sinus arrhythmia except for one case which throughout its course of treatment, had already been presenting ventricular extrasystole from before the exercise-loading. Myocardial SPECT revealed persistent defects (anteroseptal wall defects in three case). The above suggests that 201Tl myocardial SPECT enables us to search for etiology of VT, prognosis and the like.
