Validating the DemTect with 18-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography as a sensitive neuropsychological screening test for early alzheimer disease in patients of a memory clinic. The first study to validate the diagnostic value of the DemTect, a short neuropsychological screening test for dementia (8-10 min), using 18-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in patients of a memory clinic.DemTect results were compared to the clinical diagnosis and to FDG-PET as a reference method for the early in vivo detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD).38 patients (age 65.2 +/- 9.8 years, 16 men, 22 women) were investigated using clinical standard examination, FDG-PET, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging. According to NINCDS-ADRDA and Petersen's criteria, 18 patients had dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and 13 patients received the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Compared to the clinical diagnosis, a DemTect cutoff score of < or =11 points demonstrated good sensitivity (83.3%) and specificity (70.0%) for the detection of DAT, whereas the best cutoff score for MCI was < or =13 points with comparable sensitivity (84.6%) and specificity (85.7%). With regard to FDG-PET, the DemTect demonstrated excellent sensitivity (93%) and low specificity (50%) for the detection of AD-typical patterns of cerebral glucose metabolism (cutoff < or =13 points).DemTect is a favorable neuropsychological screening instrument for detecting cognitive dysfunction even in predementia stages of AD. For definite cross-sectional diagnosis, further diagnostic evaluation with higher specificity, e.g. comprehensive neuropsychological examination, FDG-PET or other biomarkers, is necessary.
