Hybrid positron detection and optical coherence tomography system: design, calibration, and experimental validation with rabbit atherosclerotic models. We evaluate the performance of our novel hybrid optical coherence tomography (OCT) and scintillating probe, demonstrate simultaneous OCT imaging and scintillating detection, and validate the system using an atherosclerotic rabbit model. Preliminary data obtained from the rabbit model suggest that our prototype positron probe detects local uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) labeled with 18F positron (beta) radionuclide emitter, and the high-uptake regions correlate with sites of injury and extensive atherosclerosis areas. Preliminary data also suggest that coregistered high-resolution OCT images provide imaging of detailed plaque microstructures, which cannot be resolved by positron detection.
