Studies on the crystallization characteristics of the hard segments in ethylene terephthalate-epsilon-caprolactone copolyesters. The crystallization characteristics of the ethylene terephthalate (ET) hard segments in ethylene terephthalate-epsilon-caprolactone (TCL) copolyesters were studied by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It was found that in TCL copolyesters with high hard segment content, the ET hard segment can crystallize to form the crystals having the similar lattice structure as that of pure poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET). The lamellar thickness and the crystallinity of the ET crystals depend on the ET segment sequence length. As the segment sequence length decreases, the lamellar thickness and the crystallinity decrease.
