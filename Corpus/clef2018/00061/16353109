Two regioisomeric and exclusively selective Hg(II) sensor molecules composed of a naphthalimide fluorophore and an o-phenylenediamine derived triamide receptor. This communication presents two regioisomeric fluorescent PET Hg(II) sensors RS, which contain a novel o-phenylenediamine based triamide receptor RS could be used to detect Hg(II) with exclusive selectivity, high fluorescence enhancement, and fast and reversible response in a neutral buffered aqueous solution.
