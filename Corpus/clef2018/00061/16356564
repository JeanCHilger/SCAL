The relationship between variables of 123-I-metaiodobenzylguanidine cardiac imaging and clinical status of the patients with diastolic heart failure. The status of cardiac sympathetic nerve activity in patients with diastolic heart failure has not been fully understood. 123-I-metaiodobenzylguanidine cardiac images are valuable for evaluating cardiac sympathetic nerve activity.We obtained 123-I-metaiodobenzylguanidine cardiac images from 34 consecutive patients with moderate heart failure and an ejection fraction of > or = 45%.The decay-corrected washout rate of 123-I-metaiodobenzylguanidine correlated with each plasma concentration of brain natriuretic peptide (standardized correlation coefficient=0.305, p<0.05), New York Heart Association functional class (standardized correlation coefficient=0.364, p<0.02), and exercise capacity (standardized correlation coefficient=-0.388, p<0.04). A multiple regression analysis revealed that the washout rate independently predicted plasma concentration of brain natriuretic peptide (standardized regression coefficient=0.367, p<0.02). In a univariate regression, the washout rate did not significantly correlate with the presence of ischemic heart disease (p=0.254) in a multivariate regression, the presence of ischemic heart disease did not predict the washout rate. For the 14 patients with sinus rhythm, there was a marginal negative correlation between the E/A velocity ratio of the transmitral flow and washout rate (standardized correlation coefficient=-0.518, p<0.07).In diastolic heart failure, cardiac sympathetic nerve activity increases proportionally to severity of the disease.
