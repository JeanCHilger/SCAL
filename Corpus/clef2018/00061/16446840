Fluorinase mediated C-(18)F bond formation, an enzymatic tool for PET labelling. The fluorinase enzyme from S. cattleya is applied as a catalyst for the efficient incorporation of [18F]-fluoride into [18F]-5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyadenosine, [18F]-5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyinosine and [18F]-5-fluoro-5-deoxyribose for positron emission tomography (PET) applications.
