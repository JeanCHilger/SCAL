Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and brain perfusion imaging in Parkinson's disease. Few imaging studies investigated frontal dysfunctions in Parkinson's disease.We investigated relationships between Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and brain perfusion in patients with non-demented Parkinson's disease.Patients were divided into two groups according to WCST score: (1) CA (number of category achieved)<or=2 or (2) CA>or=3. We performed three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection and volume of interest analysis using (123)I-IMP scintigraphy.Hypoperfusions of the bilateral posterior cingulate, rostrodorsal prefrontal, and left frontopolar cortices were shown in CA<or=2 group, with the left cingulate and right rostrodorsal prefrontal cortices showing prominent hypoperfusion. CA and PE (perseverative errors) scores significantly correlated with perfusion of the left posterior cingulate cortex. PE score also correlated with perfusion of the right rostrodorsal prefrontal cortex.Data indicated participations of various regions in task achievement. Careful interpretation of WCST scores is required.
