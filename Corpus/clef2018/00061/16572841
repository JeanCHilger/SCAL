Prokaryotic expression of functional PTEN in Escherichia coli and preparation of polyclonal antibody. PTEN, a dual-specificity phosphatase, exerts its tumor-suppressive effects through the inhibition of cell cycle progression and cell immigration, therefore could be an important candidate for tumor-suppression. As study on prokaryotic expression of PTEN and its anti-tumor functions has not been reported, the present study aims at an efficient expression of functional PTEN in Escherichia coli and the investigation of its tumor-suppression activity. PTEN cDNA cloned in our lab previously was recombined into prokaryotic expression vector pET-44a(+) to construct pET-PTEN (pEP) and pET-Nus-PTEN (pENP). PTEN was fused with 6 x His tag in pEP, and with Nus in pENP, which could be useful for a stable and soluble expression. The recombinant vectors were transformed into both BL21 (DE3) (BL) and Rosetta-gami (DE3) pLysS (RG). The former is a normal expression host while the latter is optimized for expression of eukaryotic genes and folding of target proteins. On the induction of 0.5mmol/L IPTG, 55kD and 118kD specific protein bands were observed, corresponding to His-PTEN and Nus-PTEN fusion proteins, respectively. Western blot analysis showed the recombinant fusion proteins could react with PTEN polyclonal antibody. The recombinant HTEN was expressed both in soluble fraction and inclusion body. Higher expression levels of recombinant PTEN were obtained in BL (His-PTEN: 10.3% NusA-PTEN: 18.7%), whereas the higher percentages of soluble recombinant proteins were observed in RG (His-PTEN: 4.7%
