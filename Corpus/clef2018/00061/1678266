Difference in in vivo receptor binding between [3H]N-methylspiperone and [3H]raclopride in reserpine-treated mouse brain. The in vivo binding of [3H]N-methylspiperone (NMSP) and [3H]raclopride was compared in mice treated with reserpine (5 mg/kg, 24 hr prior to the tracer injection). With both radioligands, selective accumulation of radioactivity in the striatum following intravenous injection was observed, whereas a relatively low accumulation and a rapid decline in radioactivity in the cerebellum was seen. Reserpine significantly decreased [3H]NMSP binding in vivo, however it increased [3H]raclopride binding. By compartment model analysis, it was found that the decrease in [3H]NMSP binding was primarily due to the decrease in the association rate (K3) and the increase in [3H]raclopride was due to the decrease in the dissociation rate (K4) in vivo. As both Kd and Bmax of dopamine D2 receptors have been reported to be unaltered by reserpine, these results suggested that some unknown factors except Kd and Bmax which influence on in vivo binding of receptors might be changed by reserpine. These results revealed that it is of importance to measure kinetics of ligand-receptor binding in vivo rather than static analysis. These two different types of radioligands can be combined to reveal functional roles of dopamine receptor in vivo, especially in the study of the human brain with positron emission tomography (PET).
