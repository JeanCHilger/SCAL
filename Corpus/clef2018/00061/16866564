Development of a combined microPET-MR system. As evidenced by the success of PET-CT, there are many benefits from combining imaging modalities into a single scanner. The combination of PET and MR offers potential advantages over PET-CT, including improved soft tissue contrast, access to the multiplicity of contrast mechanisms available to MR, simultaneous imaging and fast MR sequences for motion correction. In addition, PET-MR is more suitable than PET-CT for cancer screening due to the elimination of the radiation dose from CT. A key issue associated with combining PET and MR is the fact that the performance of the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) used in conventional PET detectors is degraded in the magnetic field required for MR. Two approaches have been adopted to circumvent that issue: retention of conventional, magnetic field-sensitive PMT-based PET detectors by modification of other features of the MR or PET system, or the use of new, magnetic field-insensitive devices in the PET detectors including avalanche photo-diodes (APDs) and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). Taking the former approach, we are assembling a modified microPET Focus 120 within a gap in a novel, 1T superconducting magnet. The PMTs are located in a low magnetic field (approximately 30mT) through a combination of magnet design and the use of fiber optic 'bundles'. Two main features of the modified PET system have been tested, namely the effect of using long fiber optic bundles in the PET detector, and the impact of magnetic field upon the performance of the position sensitive PMTs. The design of a modified microPET-MR system for small animal imaging is completed, and assembly and testing is underway.
