Proposals for the revision of radiation protection measures for doses up to 222 MBq iodine-131 for whole body scintiscan for the detection of metastatic lesions. The goal of this study was to estimate the necessary period of time, required for radiation protection instructions to be followed by patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) after total thyroidectomy who are given iodine-131 ((131)I) for a whole body scintiscan (WBS) in relation to the instructions of the European Commission and the ICRP. In order to estimate and evaluate the dose received by the family members and the general public, we have studied 30 patients and were given a dose of 92-222 MBq of (131)I for a diagnostic WBS. The patients studied were four men with mean age+/-standard deviation (M+/-SD)=55+/-6 y and 26 women with: M+/-SD=47+/-14 y. Dose rate measurements were carried out at the Nuclear Medicine Department of the AHEPA University Hospital 1 h after the patients had received the (131)I dose and 48 h later when they returned to the hospital for the WBS. The calculated doses received by the in-living relatives of the patients and by the general public, assuming that radiation protection measures were applied for 2d, ranged between 76-640 microSv and 22-171 microSv respectively. In conclusion, the results of this study, compared to the dose constraints suggested by the European Commission, indicate that the duration of radiation protection guidelines for patients receiving (131)I for diagnostic purposes could be reduced to only two days without any potential risk to family members or to members of the public. The case of children of the immediate family environment, aged less than 3 y, was not investigated in this study.
