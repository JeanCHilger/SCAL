Age- and transgene-related changes in regional cerebral metabolism in PSAPP mice. In parallel to imaging studies in humans with Alzheimer's disease (AD), we have mapped brain metabolic activity in transgenic mouse models of AD. Our aim in both is to provide new surrogate markers of progression to help clarify disease mechanisms and rapidly screen candidate therapeutics. Since previous findings of preferential reductions in posterior cingulate glucose metabolism may have been confounded by morphological abnormalities in previously studied "PDAPP" transgenic mice, we first assessed hippocampal and callosal anatomy in PSAPP (PS1xAPP) mice, another transgenic mouse model of AD, and found no major abnormalities. We then used fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) autoradiography in older and younger PSAPP and wildtype mice to assess the functional state of 56 regions-of-interest across group, age and increasing amyloid load. Reductions in FDG uptake in aged transgenic mice, with significant interactions between group and age, were found in retrosplenial cingulate gyrus, found to be metabolically affected in persons affected by or at risk for AD, and in brain regions known to participate with retrosplenial cingulate in networks contributing to spatial learning deficits found in these animals. Like patients with AD, PSAPP mice have age-related metabolic reductions in posterior cingulate cortex, a finding that does not appear to be related to morphological abnormalities. If longitudinal studies support these progressive and preferential reductions in retrosplenial metabolism in PSAPP mice, these reductions could provide an indicator of disease progression, help bridge the gap between human and animal studies of AD, and aid in clarification of disease mechanisms and screening of promising treatments.
