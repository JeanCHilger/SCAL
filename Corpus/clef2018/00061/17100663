Exposure to microbial components and allergens in population studies: a comparison of two house dust collection methods applied by participants and fieldworkers. Dust collection by study participants instead of fieldworkers would be a practical and cost-effective alternative in large-scale population studies estimating exposure to indoor allergens and microbial agents. We aimed to compare dust weights and biological agent levels in house dust samples taken by study participants with nylon socks, with those in samples taken by fieldworkers using the sampling nozzle of the Allergology Laboratory Copenhagen (ALK). In homes of 216 children, parents and fieldworkers collected house dust within the same year. Dust samples were analyzed for levels of allergens, endotoxin, (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans and fungal extracellular polysaccharides (EPS). Socks appeared to yield less dust from mattresses at relatively low dust amounts and more dust at high dust amounts than ALK samples. Correlations between the methods ranged from 0.47-0.64 for microbial agents and 0.64-0.87 for mite and pet allergens. Cat allergen levels were two-fold lower and endotoxin levels three-fold higher in socks than in ALK samples. Levels of allergens and microbial agents in sock samples taken by study participants are moderately to highly correlated to levels in ALK samples taken by fieldworkers. Absolute levels may differ, probably because of differences in the method rather than in the person who performed the sampling. Practical Implications Dust collection by participants is a reliable and practical option for allergen and microbial agent exposure assessment. Absolute levels of biological agents are not (always) comparable between studies using different dust collection methods, even when expressed per gram dust, because of potential differences in particle-size constitution of the collected dust.
