Brain blood flow SPET imaging in heroin abusers. To assess whether chronic heroin abuse may generate vascular central nervous deficits, we studied the profile of vascular alterations in 17 heroin addicts (14 males mean age 31 years, range 23-39 years and 3 females mean age 33 years, range 30-35 years) before and, in one of them, 10 weeks after an ultra-rapid heroin detoxification. Using the functional technique of single-photon emission tomography (SPET) with 740 MBq of (99m)Tc-hexametazine (HMPAO) and computational brain-mapping techniques by means of a Talairach analysis, we determined the pattern of vascular brain alterations associated with chronic heroin abuse. Compared with controls, subjects who had used heroin chronically showed a decrease of global brain perfusion that was more significant in the frontal cortex-mainly in orbito-frontal regions, as well as in the occipital and temporal lobes. All patients showed marked asymmetric perfusion of the basal ganglia and the majority of them showed also an asymmetric perfusion of cerebellum. In addition, there were small activated areas dispersed in the occipital lobe (3 of 17) and apex region (4 of 17). In conclusion, decreased perfusion in heroin addicts was found in regions involved in the control of attention, motor speed, memory and visual-spatial processing. The prefrontal cortex is involved in decision making and inhibitory control, processes disturbed in heroin addicts who have stopped heroin consumption. A reduction in regional perfusion may reflect ongoing subtle neurocognitive deficits, which are consistent with the maintenance of asymmetry of the basal nuclei.
