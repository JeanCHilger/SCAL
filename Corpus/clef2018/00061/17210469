Infrared-based module for the synthesis of 68Ga-labeled radiotracers. Generator-produced positron emission tomography tracers have gained much attention recently due to favorable imaging characteristics, accessibility and affordability. The focus of this study was to design and validate a semiautomated module for 68Ga-labeled chemistry utilizing infrared-based heating for rapid control of thermal cycle.A prototype module was built and installed in our laboratory. DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetra-azacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetra-acetic acid) was manually labeled (10-1000 nmol) with 68Ga to optimize synthesis conditions. For automation, 250 nmol of DOTA was labeled with 68Ga with reaction times of 5 min (n=5), 10 min (n=5) and 20 min (n=6). A dose calibrator and radio-thin-layer chromatography were used to access the product yield and quality of both manual and automated syntheses.A semiautomated 68Ga synthesis module was developed. The system showed that software control could be used to drive a multistep radiochemical synthesis and to produce 68Ga-DOTA with >95% radiochemical purity, similar to that in manual synthesis. The device also showed that for a short reaction time of 5 min, decay-corrected radioactive yields of >70% could be achieved. The total synthesis was as short as 22 min, including 6-8 min for HCl evaporation. The temperature and pressure profiles of the process were consistent.We demonstrated the use of a commercially available 68Ga/68Ge generator with a semiautomated module to successfully label the bifunctional chelator DOTA with 68Ga. Further investigation with different 68Ga-labeled bioconjugates is warranted to demonstrate the usefulness of the module as a tool for tracer development and imaging research.
