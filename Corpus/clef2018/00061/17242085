Acupuncture of LI-4 in anesthetized healthy humans decreases cerebral blood flow in the putamen measured with positron emission tomography. To minimize the influence of exogenous factors, 13 volunteers were anesthetized with sevoflurane 1 MAC while exposed to manual acupuncture stimulation of LI-4 (Group 1, n = 7) or a placebo point in the space between the third and fourth metacarpals (Group II, n = 6). During anesthesia (baseline) and anesthesia + acupuncture, one H2(15)O scan was performed, respectively. Group I demonstrated a significant decrease in regional cerebral blood flow in the right medial frontal gyrus (20%) and in the left putamen (17%). In Group II regional cerebral blood flow was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus (22%) in the putamen no significant changes were observed. These data suggest that needle penetration of the skin affects the medial frontal gyrus, whereas acupuncture of LI-4 influences the putamen.
