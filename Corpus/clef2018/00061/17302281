Molecular imaging of psychiatric disorders. Positron emission tomography (PET) techniques have made it possible to measure changes in target molecular in living human brain. PET can be used to investigate various brain functions such as receptors, transporters, enzymes and various biochemical pathways therefore, it could be a powerful tool for molecular imaging of psychiatric disorders. Since dopamine is an important molecule for pathophysiology of schizophrenia, we reviewed in vivo imaging studies focusing on dopaminergic transmission in schizophrenia. Dopamine D2 receptor occupancy by antipsychotics and it' s time-course have been measured using PET. This approach can provide in vivo pharmacological evidences of antipsychotics and establish the rational therapeutic strategy. PET is a powerful tool not only in the field of brain research but also drug discovery.
