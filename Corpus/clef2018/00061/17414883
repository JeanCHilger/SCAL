The role of FDG PET in the management of lymphoma: what is the evidence base? [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) is playing an increasing role in the management of both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, offering potential advantages in the accuracy of disease assessment at a number of points in the management pathway. This review evaluates the current level of confidence in the use of PET technology in (1) initial staging, (2) the assessment of early response to chemotherapy, (3) the assessment of residual masses at completion of initial treatment, (4) follow-up, and (5) radiotherapy planning.
