Early therapeutic response assessment by (18)FDG-positron emission tomography during chemotherapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: isolated residual positivity involving bone is not usually a predictor of subsequent treatment failure. Residual 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) - positron emission tomography (PET) positivity during treatment of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBLC) prospectively identifies a subgroup at high likelihood of subsequent treatment failure. A single institution clinical audit of FDG-PET performance for this indication was undertaken for patients with DLBCL treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy. Of 45 eligible patients, 14 (31%) were PET-positive after a median of three chemotherapy cycles (range 1 - 5), of which 10 (71%) progressed at a median of 6.5 months. An interim positive PET was a statistically significant adverse prognostic factor for treatment failure (P < 0.0001, log-rank analysis) with a hazard ratio for a positive interim-treatment PET of 9 (95% confidence interval = 4 - 55) and positive predictive value of 71% and negative predictive value of 90%. Notably, four patients with low-grade FDG-avidity limited to sites previously involved by biopsy-proven osseous lymphoma, remain progression-free (median follow-up 62 months). Low-grade FDG-avidity on interim restaging at sites of bone involvement by DLBCL at diagnosis, appears to be less predictive of disease progression than residual nodal or extra-nodal soft tissue abnormality by PET.
