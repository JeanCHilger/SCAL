Synthesis and testing of a binary catalytic system for imaging of signal amplification in vivo. We report a binary targeted enzymatic system that is composed of two covalent monoclonal antibody conjugates for specific labeling of cellular targets in vivo. The system utilizes low-molecular weight peroxidase-reducing substrates synthesized by linking 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) with DTPA (5HT-DTPA) for magnetic resonance and radionuclide imaging or with Cy5.5 for near-infrared optical imaging. Initially, the conjugation reaction conditions were optimized to achieve a low level of antiepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody (EMD 72000) modification with the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of 4-hydrazinonicotinate acetone hydrazone (SANH), yielding mAb-HNH conjugate. The resultant modified antibodies were incubated with the periodate-oxidized peroxidase (HRP) or 4-formylbenzoyl-conjugated glucose oxidase (GO), followed by the purification of the resultant mAb-enzyme conjugates by size-exclusion HPLC. The conjugates were further characterized by electrophoresis and were tested by cross-titration on A431 EGFR+ squamous carcinoma or SW620 adenocarcinoma cells (negative control). The conjugates at the optimized concentration ratios were further tested using near-infrared fluorescence microscopy in the presence of Cy5.5 monocarboxy-5-hydroxytryptamide. Further in vitro experiments demonstrated that (1) antibody binding was specific and could be inhibited by free antibody (2) both antibody conjugates exhibited high enzymatic activity after the binding to the cells
