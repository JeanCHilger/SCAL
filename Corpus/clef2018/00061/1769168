Quantitative assessment of cerebral blood flow in partial epilepsy using Xe-133 inhalation and SPECT. The Xe-133 inhalation method was used to study rCBF in 12 patients with partial epilepsy during the interictal phase. SPECT images evidenced a focal CBF defect in 10 out of 12 patients, while quantitative analysis showed CBF abnormalities in all the patients. The focal CBF defect corresponded to the site of EEG abnormalities in nine patients. Additional low-flow areas beyond the EEG focus were found. Five patients presented a significant CBF decrease in the cerebellar hemisphere contralateral to the EEG focus. In five patients with unilateral EEG abnormalities, a CBF reduction was found in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere, mirror to the EEG focus. Finally, a widespread CBF decrease involving one or both cerebral hemispheres was observed in seven patients. Global and rCBF values were not correlated with age, duration of disease, frequency of seizures, secondary generalization, or specific therapy. SPECT may be useful in evaluating EEG epileptic foci, and quantitative SPECT allows the detection of functional effects of the epileptic focus on anatomically connected remote areas, probably due to the decrease of afferent inputs (diaschisis phenomenon).
