Non-invasive imaging correlates with histological and molecular characteristics of an osteosarcoma model: application for early detection and follow-up of MDR phenotype. In an orthotopic rat osteosarcoma model, histological and molecular findings were compared with the results of non-invasive imaging methods to assess disease progression at the primary site, the pattern of metastatic dissemination and the chemoresistance phenotype.Primary tumor engraftment, vascularization, growth and metastatic spread were evaluated using 18FDG tomoscintigraphy. Bone neoformation in the primary tumor and metastasis was determined using 18FNa confirmed by classical histological studies. Chemoresistance phenotype was assessed by analysis of MDR1 and MRP1 genes expression compared to 99mTc MIBI imaging.99mTc MIBI imaging correlated with the overexpression of the MDR1 and MRP1 genes. 18FDG, 18FNa and 99mTc tomoscintigraphies revealed that the pattern of vascularization, bone neoformation and hematogeneous metastatic dissemination in our animal model mimics its human counterpart.Multimodality, non-invasive imaging is a valid surrogate marker of histological and molecular characteristics in an orthotopic osteosarcoma model in immunocompetent rats it allows extensive in vivo follow-up of osteosarcoma, including longitudinal analysis of chemoresistance.
