The FDG/PET methodology for early detection of disease onset: a statistical model. The development of appropriate statistical methodologies for neuroimaging studies is dependent upon the research question of interest. Often studies are analyzed with techniques that may not be appropriate for the research question but are accepted owing to convention, familiarity, or apparent statistical sophistication. Neuroimaging data are particularly complex owing to (a) the high number of potential dependent variables (i.e., regions of interest) coupled with the practical limitations on sample size (b) the known physical properties of scanners (e.g., resolution) interacting with the intricate and variable structure of the human brain
