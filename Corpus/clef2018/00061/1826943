PET studies of [18F]methyl-MK-801, a potential NMDA receptor complex radioligand. Using positron emission tomography (PET), the potential of 18F-labelled fluoro-methyl-MK-801([18F]FMM) as a radioligand for in vivo studies of the NMDA receptor complex was investigated in baboons. In baseline conditions, there was a slight differential retention of [18F]FMM in cerebral cortex and striatum relative to cerebellum, compatible with specific binding. However, neither pretreatment with pharmacological doses of MK-801 or phencyclidine, nor severe, transient brain hypoxia, were able to clearly alter [18]FMM brain regional kinetics, indicating limited usefulness of this radioligand for in vivo PET investigations of the NMDA receptor.
