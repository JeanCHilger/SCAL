Brain tumor perfusion: comparison of dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging using T1, T2, and T2* contrast, pulsed arterial spin labeling, and H2(15)O positron emission tomography. Different techniques for measuring of perfusion are clinically available, but these are usually applied to healthy brain tissue.Five different techniques were used here in 12 patients with brain tumors to investigate the impact of tumor vascularization on the perfusion signal: three qualitative dynamic contrast-enhanced/susceptibility-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI/DSC-MRI) techniques exploiting T(1), T(2), T(2)(*) contrast, and two quantitative techniques, pulsed arterial spin labeling (PASL) and H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography (H(2)(15)O-PET).In a first approximation, a linear correlation was found between all five imaging modalities regarding the perfusion signal of both, normal brain tissue and tumor. The estimated values for tumor perfusion differed significantly between the techniques (1=methodical mean in arbitrary units): PASL: 0.83, H(2)(15)O-PET: 0.62, T(1)-DCE: 1.73, T(2)-DCE: 0.69, T(2)(*)-DSC: 0.89.The tumor perfusion values, determined with different techniques are not comparable. The T(2)(*)-DSC, here applied with contrast agent presaturation of extravascular space, and PASL depict median perfusion most reliably.
