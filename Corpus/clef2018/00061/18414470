Gene expression profiling may improve diagnosis in patients with carcinoma of unknown primary. Carcinomas of unknown primary (CUP) represent between 3 and 10% of malignancies. Treatment with nonspecific chemotherapy is commonly unhelpful and the median survival is between 3 and 6 months. Gene expression microarray (GEM) analysis has demonstrated that molecular signatures can aid in tumour classification and propose foster primaries. In this study, we demonstrate the clinical utility of a diagnostic gene expression profiling tool and discuss its potential implications for patient management strategies. Paraffin tumour samples from 21 cases of 'true' CUP patients in whom standard investigation had failed to determine a primary site of malignancy were investigated using diagnostic gene profiling. The results were reviewed in the context of histology and clinical history. Classification of tumour origin using the GEM method confirmed the clinicians' suspicion in 16 out of 21 cases. There was a clinical/GEM inconsistency in 4 out of 21 patients and a pathological/GEM inconsistency in 1 patient. The improved diagnoses by the GEM method would have influenced the management in 12 out of 21 cases. Genomic profiling and cancer classification tools represent a promising analytical approach to assist with the management of CUP patients. We propose that GEM diagnosis be considered when the primary clinical algorithm has failed to provide a diagnosis.
