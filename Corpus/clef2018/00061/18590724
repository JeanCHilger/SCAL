Enhancement of active shuttle avoidance response by the NO-cGMP-PKG activator YC-1. Although much has been learned about the role of the amygdala in Pavlovian fear conditioning, relatively little is known about the signaling pathway involved in the acquisition of an active avoidance reaction. The aim of this study is to investigate the potentiating effects of the NO-guanylate cyclase activator YC-1 on learning and memory of shuttle avoidance test in rats. YC-1 enhanced the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in amygdala through NO-cGMP-PKG-ERK pathway and the increase of BDNF expression. The Western blot and PCR methods were used to examine the signaling pathways involved in fear memory. It was found that YC-1 increased the avoidance responses during learning period and the memory retention lasted longer than one week. The enhancement of learning behavior by YC-1 was antagonized by intracerebroventricular injection of NOS inhibitor l-NAME, PKG inhibitor Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS and MEK inhibitor PD98059, indicating that NO-cGMP-PKG and ERK pathways are involved in the learning potentiating action of YC-1. In addition, YC-1 increased the activation of ERK and Akt 30 min after Day-1 training in amygdala. YC-1 also potentiated the expression of BDNF and CREB in response to fear memory test. Taken together, these findings suggest that NO-cGMP-PKG-ERK signaling pathway is involved in the action of YC-1 in enhancing the fear memory.
