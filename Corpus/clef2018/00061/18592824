Characterization of the duration from onset of asthma symptoms to asthma disease. Little is known about factors associated with progression of childhood asthma from onset of symptoms to index date determined by medical records.To determine the duration between the onset of asthma symptoms to index date of asthma (ie, time when one met the criteria for asthma) and associated factors.Study participants came from a sample of 839 healthy children, aged 5 to 12 years, who had participated in a previous study. Comprehensive medical record reviews were conducted to determine first documentation of asthma symptoms and index date of asthma. Factors were evaluated for an association with the duration from onset of asthma symptoms to index date of asthma.Of the study sample, 222 children met the criteria for asthma and had an available onset date of asthma symptoms. The median ages at onset of asthma symptoms and the index date were 5.6 and 7.6 years, respectively. The median duration between onset of asthma symptoms and index date was 2.9 months, and the mean was 17.2 months. There was a tendency for patients with a pet at home (P = .047), exercise-induced symptoms (P = .04), younger age at symptom onset (P = .05), and more severe asthma (P = .05) to have a shorter duration from onset of symptoms to index date.The duration from onset of asthma symptoms to index date of asthma varies significantly depending on host and environmental factors. It does not necessarily correlate with commonly recognized risk factors for incidence or severity of asthma.
