A case of thyrotoxicosis with chorea: association with anti-phospholipid antibody. We report a case of thyrotoxicosis associated with chorea and detectable anti-phospholipid antibodies in which a structural abnormality could not be detected on routine imaging but cerebral perfusion single photon emission computed tomography scans suggested a reversible alteration of basal ganglia perfusion. The pathophysiological mechanisms of phospholipid antibody causing chorea in thyrotoxicosis are discussed.
