Brain tumour recurrence: brain single-photon emission computerized tomography, PET and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Recurrence is a frequent clinical problem in the follow-up of brain tumours. Single-photon emission computerized tomography, positron emission tomography (PET) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) represent significant diagnostic options to investigate recurrence. Many authors studied the separate and associate significance of these modalities in investigating relapsing brain tumours. In this study, the current role and the perspectives of these functional diagnostic tools are presented, evidencing the valuable results provided by their association. Finally, future development of new radiopharmaceuticals and advanced MRS technique can reliably contribute to improve the diagnostic process of recurrent brain neoplasms.
