Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of cardiac sarcoidosis: an Australian single-centre experience. Cardiac involvement in systemic sarcoidosis is common however, current diagnostic tools are imprecise. Recognition of cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) is important as it has a relatively poor prognosis. Gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (Gad-CMR) is emerging as an excellent technique in determining the presence of and extent to which cardiac muscle is affected by sarcoidosis.A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients with biopsy-proven systemic sarcoidosis referred for Gad-CMR scanning to evaluate potential cardiac involvement. All patients also underwent an electrocardiogram, Holter monitor and echocardiography. Gallium-67 radionuclide investigation, positron emission tomography and cardiac biopsy were ordered at the discretion of the treating physician.Eleven of the 20 patients had Gad-CMR images supportive of the diagnosis of CS. Eight of these 11 patients met the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare (JMHW) criteria for the diagnosis of CS three abnormal Gad-CME scans consistent with diagnosis of CS were seen in patients who did not meet JMHW criteria. No patients with normal Gad-CMR scan met JMHW criteria for CS.These findings suggest that Gad-CMR is potentially superior to the JMHW criteria in the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis.
