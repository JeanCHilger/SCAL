Diagnostic value of FDG-PET in recurrent colorectal carcinoma: a meta-analysis. Accurate detection of recurrent colorectal carcinoma remains a diagnostic challenge. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic value of Positron emission tomography (PET) using fluor-18-deoxyglucose (FDG) in recurrent colorectal carcinoma with a meta-analysis. All the published studies in English relating the diagnostic value of FDG-PET in the detection of recurrent colorectal carcinoma were collected. Methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated. Pooled sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio and SROC (summary receiver operating characteristic curves) were obtained by the statistical software. Twenty-seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for FDG-PET detecting distant metastasis or whole body involvement in recurrent colorectal carcinoma were 0.91 (95% CI 0.88-0.92) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for FDG-PET detecting hepatic metastasis were 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.98) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.97-0.99). The pooled sensitivity and specificity for pelvic metastasis or local regional recurrence were 0.94 (95% CI 0.91-0.97) and 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.96). FDG-PET is valuable for the assessment of recurrent colorectal carcinoma.
