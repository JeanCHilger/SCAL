Excimer laser chemical ammonia patterning on PET film. Laser is a promising technique used for biopolymer surface modification with micro and/or nano features. In this work, a 193 nm excimer laser was used for poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) surfaces chemical patterning. The ablation threshold of the PET film used in the experiments was 62 mJ/cm(2) measured before surface modification. Surface chemical patterning was performed by irradiating PET film in a vacuum chamber filled with ammonia at the flux of 10, 15, 20, 25 ml/min. Roughness of the surface characterized by profilometry showed that there were no significant observed change after modification comparing original film. But the hydrophilicity of the surface increased after patterning and a minimum water contact angle was obtained at the gas flux of 20 ml/min. FT-IR/ATR results showed the distinct amino absorption bands presented at 3352 cm(-1)and 1613 cm(-1) after modification and XPS binding energies of C(1s) at 285.5 eV and N(1s) at 399.0 eV verified the existence of C-N bond formation on the PET film surface. Tof-SIMS ions mapping used to identify the amine containing fragments corroborates that amino grafting mainly happened inside the laser irradiation area of the PET surface. A hypothesized radical reaction mechanism proposes that the collision between radicals in ammonia and on the PET surface caused by the incident laser provokes the grafting of amino groups.
