Selection criteria for peritonectomy with hyperthermic intraoperative chemotherapy (HIPEC) in peritoneal carcinomatosis. Cytoreductive peritonectomy with hyperthermic intraoperative chemotherapy (HIPEC) is an established therapy for patients with gastrointestinal, gynaecological metastasised peritoneal carcinomatosis as well as primary peritoneal carcinomatous tumours.On the basis of a literature review and our personal experience, selection criteria for peritonectomy are discussed.Computed tomography (CT) scans and diagnostic laparoscopy are not sufficient for the diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis. The combination of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and CT seems to be the most reliable diagnostic imaging method. In our institution, all patients undergo PET / CT prior to peritonectomy.The PET / CT scan may play an important role in forecasting the operability of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis.
