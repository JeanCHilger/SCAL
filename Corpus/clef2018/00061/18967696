Complexation and fluorescence behavior of 9,10-bis[bis(beta-hydroxyethyl)aminomethyl]anthracene. 9,10-Bis[bis(beta-hydroxyethyl)aminomethyl]anthracene (1) showed weak emission, suggesting that photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from amine group to excited anthracene occur. The PET fluoroionophore (1) was found to display unique photophysical properties in the presence of the guest metal cations in H(2)OCH(3)OH (1:1, v/v). Complexation of 1 with guest metal cations increased the fluorescence intensity.
