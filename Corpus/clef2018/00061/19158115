Cognitive function and 99mTc-ECD brain SPECT are significantly correlated in patients with primary Sjogren syndrome: a case-control study. To assess subclinical central nervous system (CNS) involvement in primary Sj√∂gren syndrome (pSS), by comparing standard brain MRI, in-depth neuropsychological testing and (99m)Tc-ECD brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of patients with pSS with matched controls.10 women (<55 years old), with pSS defined using European-American criteria, presence of anti-SSA and/or anti-SSB antibodies and no history of neurological involvement were prospectively investigated, and compared with 10 age- and sex-matched controls. All subjects underwent, within 1 month, brain MRI, neuropsychological testing, including overall evaluation and focal cognitive function assessment, and (99m)Tc-ECD brain SPECT.(99m)Tc-ECD brain SPECT abnormalities were significantly more common in patients with pSS (10/10) than controls (2/10 p<0.05). Cognitive dysfunctions, mainly expressed as executive and visuospatial disorders, were also significantly more common in patients with pSS (8/10) than controls (0/10Neuropsychological testing and (99m)Tc-ECD brain SPECT seem to be the most sensitive tools to detect subclinical CNS dysfunction in pSS. The strong correlation between cortical hypoperfusion in (99m)Tc-ECD brain SPECT and cognitive dysfunction suggests an organic aetiology of CNS dysfunction in pSS. These data should be confirmed in a larger study.
