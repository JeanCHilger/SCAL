Analysis and fabrication of a prism film with roll-to-roll fabrication process. A prism-based brightness enhancement film (BEF), has been investigated through computer-aided optical analysis and experiments in this study. The prism film was fabricated on a 100 microm thick PET film substrate using roll-to-roll (R2R) process with UV curable resins of different refractive indices. The results from both optical analysis and experiments showed that resins with higher refractive indices have better on-axis luminous gain. The prism structures fabricated on the substrate achieved a replication rate of 97.54% in this study. Compared with the 3M BEF, the prism films developed in this study are improved in on-axis luminous gains when the refractive index of the resin is higher than 1.53.
