Comparison of CT, PET, and PET/CT for staging of patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The aim was to investigate the potential impact of positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) as compared to PET and CT on the staging of patients with indolent lymphoma.PET/CTs from 45 patients with indolent lymphoma undergoing staging or restaging were studied. Clinical follow-up, additional imaging, and histology served as the gold standard.PET/CT correctly diagnosed 92 nodal regions as positive for lymphomatous involvement and 458 as disease free vs 68 and 449 for PET and 64 and 459 for CT, respectively. The respective sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies were 99%, 100%, and 99.8% for PET/CT, 68%, 97.5%, and 92.2% for PET, and 70%, 100%, and 94.7% for CT. PET/CT performed significantly better than PET (p < 0.001 for sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy) and CT (p < 0.001 for sensitivity and accuracy). PET/CT also correctly identified significantly more extra-nodal lesions (22) than CT (14) and PET (nine).PET/CT provides significantly more accurate information compared to PET and CT for the staging and re-staging of patients with indolent lymphoma.
