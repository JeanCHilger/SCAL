The evolution of nuclear medicine and the musculoskeletal system. This article reviews the evolution of nuclear medicine in the evaluation of the musculoskeletal system over the past hundred years, from autoradiography and Geiger counters and rectilinear scanners to sophisticated imaging devices that provide both functional and morphological information. Initially synonymous with bone scanning, radionuclide evaluation of musculoskeletal disorders now includes gallium, labeled leukocytes, FDG, and fluourine-18, indications and applications of which are reviewed.
