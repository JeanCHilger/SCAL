Molecular imaging of prostate cancer with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET. Prostate cancer poses a major public health problem, particularly in the US and Europe, where it constitutes the most common type of malignancy among men, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers. The disease is characterized by a wide spectrum of biological and clinical phenotypes, and its evaluation by imaging remains a challenge in view of this heterogeneity. Imaging in prostate cancer can be used in the initial diagnosis of the primary tumor, to determine the occurrence and extent of any extracapsular spread, for guidance in delivery and evaluation of local therapy in organ-confined disease, in locoregional lymph node staging, to detect locally recurrent and metastatic disease in biochemical relapse, to predict and assess tumor response to systemic therapy or salvage therapy, and in disease prognostication (in terms of the length of time taken for castrate-sensitive disease to become refractory to hormones and overall patient survival). Evidence from animal-based translational and human-based clinical studies points to a potential and emerging role for PET, using F-fluorodeoxyglucose as a radiotracer, in the imaging evaluation of prostate cancer.
