Contributions of nuclear medicine to the therapy of malignant tumors. The diagnostic and therapeutic application of radionuclides in oncology has led to an increased efficiency in the treatment of malignant tumors. Regarding diagnosis, measuring metabolic reactions in tumor tissue, especially by positron emission tomography, opened the potential for assaying tumor response to different treatment modalities and thus eventually for tailoring effective treatment of a given tumor in the individual patient. Regarding treatment, attention is given to the choice of the radionuclide for optimal deposition of the desired radiation in tumor cells avoiding exposure of normal cells in this context microdosimetric considerations are essential with respect to beta-emitters, alpha-emitters, the Auger-effect and neutron capture therapy. Examples of therapeutic uses of radionuclides in the inorganic form are 131-I for thyroid cancer and 32-P for polycythemia vera
