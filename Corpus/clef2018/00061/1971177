Syntheses of [123I]-, [125I]- and unlabelled (S)-3-iodo-5,6-dimethoxy-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]salicylamide (NCQ 298), selective ligands for the study of dopamine D-2 receptors. The salicylamide NCQ 298, (S)-3-iodo-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-5,6-dimethoxysalicylami de (4), binds with a high affinity and selectivity to central dopamine D-2 receptors. In the present paper the synthesis of NCQ 298 and the efficient labelling both with 123I and 125I are described. The unlabelled NCQ 298 was synthesized by iodination of (S)-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-2,5,6-trimethoxybenzamide followed by demethylation with boron tribromide, which produced 4 and the regioisomer 5 in a ratio of 82:18. The two isomeric salicylamides were separated by radial chromatography and tested for their abilities to inhibit the binding of [3H]raclopride to rat striatal membranes in vitro in relation to some representative salicylamides. The 5,6-dimethoxysalicylamide 4 (NCQ 298) was found to be considerably more active than the corresponding 6-methoxysalicylamide 10 (FLA 961 or IBZM). The radioligands [123I]NCQ 298 and [125I]NCQ 298 were prepared in a carrier-free form from the corresponding desiodo compound by the chloramine-T protocol and isolated by semipreparative HPLC. The total radiochemical yields of [123I]NCQ 298 and [125I]NCQ 298 (based on [123I]- and [125I]iodide and decay-corrected) were 88% and 93%, respectively, with a radiochemical purity of greater than 99%. [125I]NCQ 298 will be studied to evaluate its potential as a radioligand in studies requiring a high specific activity, selectivity and high potency to label dopamine D-2 receptors. [123I]NCQ 298 has potential as a radioligand for the in vivo examination of central dopamine D-2 receptors in human brain by Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT).
