New imaging techniques for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. No imaging modality has yet been proven to reliably differentiate simple hepatic steatosis from steatohepatitis. This review focuses on the predominant non-nuclear imaging modalities available to clinicians at the present time. The key feature of the techniques outlined in this review that demonstrate the most interesting results have one thing in common: imaging is not performed in a passive manner but is undertaken as a method to investigate functional differences between simple hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis based upon the current working model for pathogenesis and progression. The purpose of this article is to review the strengths and weakness of current clinical and experimental imaging modalities for noninvasive detection of NAFLD, with an emphasis on NASH.
