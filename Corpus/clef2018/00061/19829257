Prediction of residual disease of spine infection using F-18 FDG PET/CT. Prospective study.To determine whether F-18 fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-18 FDG PET/CT) follow-up imaging after treatment in patients with spinal infection (SI) could provide useful prognostic information and determine the residual SI.There are seldom data on the capability of follow-up imaging methods to predict residual disease and treatment efficacy in patients with SI.Thirty patients with SI underwent F-18 FDG PET/CT at initial and during follow-up. From F-18 FDG PET/CT, quantitative indexes were obtained. The residual SI was determined by the presence of preoperative symptoms, hematological infection marker, and radiologic findings.The SUVmax were significantly declined after treatment in both of residual (2.85 +/- 1.17 vs. 2.06 +/- 1.03 P < 0.0001) and nonresidual SI (4.31 +/- 2.07 vs. 1.44 +/- 0.46F-18 FDG PET/CT is useful for discrimination of residual and nonresidual SI after treatment. Among the various quantitative indexes, %deltaSUVmax is a potent predictor of residual SI in the current study.
