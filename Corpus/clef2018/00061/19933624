18F-FDG PET/CT of transitional cell carcinoma. The objective of this article is to provide a practical illustrated review of PET/CT in the imaging evaluation of transitional cell carcinoma.Local evaluation of the primary tumor in patients with transitional cell carcinoma on PET is often limited by the obscuring effect of excreted FDG, but assessment of metabolic activity may still be possible through close correlation with CT images. PET/CT may also be helpful in the detection of disease outside the bladder at nodal or more distant sites and in the assessment of recurrent disease.
