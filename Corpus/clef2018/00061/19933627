Spectrum of (18)F-FDG PET/CT appearances in peritoneal disease. The objective of our study was to illustrate the spectrum of appearances of peritoneal diseases on (18)F-FDG PET/CT, show the usefulness of fused FDG PET/CT as a diagnostic tool for the peritoneum, and discuss the pitfalls in FDG PET/CT interpretation of peritoneal disease.Malignant and benign diseases may have peritoneal involvement, which can manifest as various imaging patterns on FDG PET/CT. Awareness of these patterns and of potential interpretation issues is important to optimize diagnostic accuracy.
