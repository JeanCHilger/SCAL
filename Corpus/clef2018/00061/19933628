The metabolic spectrum of venous thrombotic disorders found on PET/CT. Thrombotic disorders detected on PET/CT are usually incidental findings and may change the treatment strategy and patient's disease prognosis. The purpose of this article is to present the spectrum of venous thrombotic disorders found on PET/CT.The division of thrombotic disorders into metabolically nonactive and active thrombus may be helpful for differential diagnosis of underlying diseases causing thrombus formation. IV contrast media administration during PET/CT makes it possible to visualize the thrombus itself and helps to distinguish between benign and malignant metabolically active thrombus.
