Molecular detection of Bartonella henselae and Bartonella clarridgeiae in clinical samples of pet cats from Southern Italy. Bartonella henselae is considered an emerging pathogen of veterinary and medical interest that can be occasionally transmitted to humans. Cats are considered to be the only reservoir host for B. henselae. In this study, we used a nested-PCR assay to investigate the prevalence of B.henselae and Bartonella clarridgeiae DNA in peripheral blood samples, fine needle lymph node aspirate specimens and oral swabs from 85 cats in order to develop an easy diagnostic strategy for the selection of infection-free cats that are being considered as pets, especially for immunocompromised patients. Overall, molecular analysis showed that 71 cats (83.5%) tested PCR positive for the presence of B. henselae DNA. PCR amplification of DNA B. henselae produced positive products from lymph node aspirate specimens (62/85 72.9%) similar to those obtained from blood samples (60/85
