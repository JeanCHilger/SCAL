Intraperitoneal catheter placement for pharmacological imaging studies in conscious mice. Imaging studies that use rodents sometimes involve intraperitoneal administration of pharmacological compounds. To facilitate such studies, the authors developed a simple and easily mastered technique for placing an intraperitoneal catheter in a conscious mouse. This technique eliminates the need to remove the animal from the scanner to administer a drug through the intraperitoneal route.
