Assessment of myocardial perfusion and function in victims of scorpion envenomation using gated-SPECT. Cardiogenic shock and acute pulmonary edema are the major causes of death of patients with scorpion envenomation, whose pathophysiological mechanism remains controversial.To investigate the correlation between myocardial perfusion abnormalities and left ventricular contractile function in victims of scorpion envenomation.Fifteen patients underwent ECG-gated myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (gated SPECT) within 72 hours of, and 15 days after scorpion envenomation. Images were analyzed by means of a semi-quantitative visual perfusion score (0 = normal, 4 = absent) and motion score (0 = normal, 4 = akinesia), using the 17-segment model. Summed perfusion (SPS) and summed motion (SMS) scores were calculated for each patient. Ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated by a commercially available software.At baseline, 12 out of the 15 patients presented abnormal myocardial perfusion and contractility. Mean values of SPS, SMS and LVEF were 12.5 A+/- 7.3, 17.0 A+/- 12.8, and 44.6 A+/- 16.0%, respectively. A positive correlation between SPS and SMS (r = 0.68 p = 0.005) and negative correlation between SPS and LVEF (r = -0.75Myocardial perfusion abnormalities are common in scorpion envenomation and correlate topographically with the contractile dysfunction. Recovery of contractility correlates with reversibility of perfusion defects. These findings suggest the participation of myocardial perfusion abnormalities in the pathophysiology of this form of acute ventricular failure.
