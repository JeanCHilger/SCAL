Guidelines for paediatric bone scanning with 99mTc-labelled radiopharmaceuticals and 18F-fluoride. The purpose of these guidelines is to offer nuclear medicine teams a framework that could prove helpful in daily practice. The guidelines include information related to the indications, acquisition, processing and interpretation of bone scans in children, focusing primarily on (99m)Tc-labelled diphosphonate scintigraphy, and also recommendations with regard to the emerging use of PET with (18)F-fluoride.
