 Natural autoantibodies are produced when the immune system recognizes one or more of the body's normal constituents as foreign. These autoantibodies attack the body's own cells, tissues, or organs, leading to systemic autoimmune diseases. Nucleosome-specific anti-nuclear autoantibodies (ANAs) have been found to exhibit anti-tumor activity (1). The nucleosomes targeted by these antibodies are released from the dying tumor cells and bind to the adjacent healthy tumor cells, leading to the formation of ANAs specific to the nucleosomes (2). The nucleosome-specific ANA monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2C5 was found to have anti-tumor activity against a variety of experimental tumor models but showed no recognition of normal cells (1). There was an increased survival rate in cancer patients with elevated levels of serum ANAs (3, 4).
