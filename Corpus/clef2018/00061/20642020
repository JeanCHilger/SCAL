 Estrogens and progestins are endogenous hormones that produce many physiological effects (1). Estrogens act primarily by regulating gene expression. Estrogen receptors (ERs) are found in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells of the female reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, bone, liver, and other tissues, and also in various tissues in men. Estrogens are lipophilic in that they enter the cell passively by diffusion through the cellular membrane. Estrogens bind to ERs that are present in the cytoplasm and the complexes are transported into the nucleus. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Approximately 33% of women who have this disease will die of disseminated breast cancer. The growth of breast epithelial cells is dependent on estrogen stimulation, which induces progestin receptor expression. Two thirds of breast carcinomas express ERs. It has also been established that the ER status of the tumor is an important prognostic indicator in breast cancer (2). Women with ER-positive breast tumors have a better prognosis than women with ER-negative tumors in terms of responsiveness to anti-estrogen treatment. ER content in breast cancer is assessed
