A brain phantom for studying contrast recovery in emission computerized tomography. A brain phantom is described that is characterized by a high anatomical definition and by the possibility of varying the internal contrast with the use of a single radioactive solution. The experimental work was done with a single-photon emission computerized tomographic (SPET) rotating camera. The phantom was used to study the contrast recovery of both the filtered back-projection and an iterative reconstruction algorithm. Moreover, it was also used to find a cross-calibration factor between activity concentrations in the SPET slices and an external reference.
