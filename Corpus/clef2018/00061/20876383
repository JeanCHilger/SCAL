Acceptability of preclinical research on nonhuman primates in reproductive medicine: the patient perspective. The attitude of patients with reproductive disorders regarding the use of nonhuman primates (NHPs) in preclinical reproductive research and its determinants was examined. A survey was conducted on 299 patients with fertility problems and/or endometriosis in a European fertility center (RR = 80%). The main outcome measure was the attitude toward reproductive research on NHPs. In total, 70.6% accept and 29.4% reject NHP research. Factors significantly positively related to acceptance are confidence in researchers and previous pregnancy. Factors significantly negatively related to acceptance include having a pet, membership of a nature organization, vegetarian, and having lived abroad. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first on patients' perspective on NHP research. The majority of the patients accept reproductive research on NHPs. Trust in researchers was the most important positively related factor therefore, researchers are advised to actively try to gain the trust of patients and the public.
