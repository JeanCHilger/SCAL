Positron emission tomography-computed tomography protocols for radiation therapy planning and therapy response assessment. This article covers positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan protocols for radiation therapy planning purposes and therapy response assessment. For radiation therapy planning PET-CT scans, protocols used will depend on the intended use of the PET-CT images in the radiation therapy planning. In general scans are performed on a flat radiation therapy pallet with the patient in the treatment position or closely approximating the treatment position. PET-CT protocols used in radiation therapy planning are typically otherwise very similar to diagnostic protocols. An important component in PET-CT imaging performed for therapy monitoring and assessment is consistency in patient preparation, image acquisition, and imaging processing of the baseline scan and subsequent therapy assessment scans.
