Positron emission tomography-computed tomography reporting in radiation therapy planning and response assessment. Quality reporting in radiology and nuclear medicine has been described in 8 Cs: correctness, completeness, consistency, communication, clarity, confidence, concision, and consultation. The incorporation of all of these elements is necessary for the generation of high-quality, effective reports. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography presents a particular challenge because of the large amount of information contained in a single study, both anatomic and metabolic. In this article, the elements of good reporting will be reviewed with specific attention to positron emission tomography-computed tomography, including specific case examples that demonstrate effective and ineffective reporting styles. The principles of reporting will then be applied specifically to reporting for radiotherapy planning and reporting for response assessment.
