Characterization of physiologic 18F-FDG uptake with PET-CT in dogs. We evaluated the whole body distribution of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) in seven beagle dogs using positron emission tomography/computed tomography. The mean and maximum standard uptake values (SUV) for various tissues were computed. The SUV of the aortic blood pool was 0.65 +/- 0.19. Moderate uptake was present in brain (3.40 +/- 1.01). Mild uptake was present in orbital muscles, soft palate, laryngeal and pharyngeal region, mandibular salivary gland, myocardium, liver, pancreas, kidney, and intestine. 18F-FDG uptake would be normally higher in these tissues because of normal physiologic activity. Mean and maximum SUV values of the eye, skeletal muscle, bone tissue, spleen, adrenal gland, stomach, tongue, gall bladder, and lung were similar to or lower than that of the aortic blood pool. These data provide a normal baseline for comparing pathologic 18F-FDG uptake.
