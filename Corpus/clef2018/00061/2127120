Treatment of refractory Parkinson's disease with adrenal medullary autografts utilizing two-stage surgery. Treatment of refractory PD with autologous adrenal medullary implants utilizing two-stage surgery warrants further investigation. This transplantation technique is associated with prolonged transplant area BBB disruption which may require a change in medical treatment strategies including the withdrawal of peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitors and possible intravenous or intraventricular dopamine therapy. Of 5 patients receiving adrenal medullary transplants, 3 have demonstrated varying degrees of clinical improvement which has persisted for the duration of the study. The positive correlation between clinical outcome and caudate function (i.e., 6-fluorodopa PET scans) suggests a positive influence of the transplantation procedure on the diseased striatum. Whether or not the grafted tissue remains viable for an extended period is currently being investigated utilizing 6-FDG-PET studies. Because of the presence of persistent BBB disruption, we surmise that at least viability of implanted fenestrated adrenal medullary capillaries exists. We conclude that this prolonged leakage is the result of the implanted tissue rather than the cavitation procedure as prolonged BBB disruption was not witnessed in a control group of patients with post-traumatic cerebral contusions or in Parkinson's patients subjected to thalamotomies. Whether two-stage surgery results in increased graft viability, and host neuronal sprouting, leading to prolonged clinical improvement and slowing the progression of PD awaits continued longitudinal (greater than 24 months) studies.
