Extrapleural pneumonectomy with venous confluence resection for stage IVA thymic tumors. We report 4 patients with stage IVA thymic tumors who underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy and thymectomy with venous confluence resection using a temporary percutaneous venous jugular-femoral bypass technique. The superior vena cava was replaced in 2 patients, and the innominate vein was resected in 2 patients. Complete tumor resection was obtained in all patients. There was no 90-day postoperative mortality. One patient died at 6 months postoperatively of an unrelated cause, without recurrent disease, and 3 are alive and disease-free with a follow-up ranging from 19 to 80 months. Extrapleural pneumonectomy can be combined with thymectomy and venous confluence resection for stage IVA thymic tumors.
