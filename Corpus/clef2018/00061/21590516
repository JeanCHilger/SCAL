Enantioselective recognition of tartaric acids with ethynylated carbazole-based chiral bisboronic acid chemosensors with improved response at acidic pH. Chiral bisboronic acid chemosensors based on ethynylated carbazole were prepared. The chiral chemosensors show red-shifted emission than the chemosensors with unsubstituted carbazole fluorophore. a-PET effect was found for the chemosensors, which is different from our previous observation of the d-PET effect for boronic acid chemosensors based on carbazole. Enantioselective recognition of tartaric acids was implicated with these chemosensors. Consecutive fluorescence emission enhancement/diminishment were observed with increasing the concentration of the tartaric acids, which is tentatively assigned to the transition of the binding stoichiometry from 1:1 binding to 1:2 binding. In particularly interesting is the improved fluorescence response at acidic pH for recognition of tartaric acids, which is rarely observed for a-PET chemosensors. We propose that the sensing is due to hybrid mechanism of a-PET/d-PET and conformational restriction upon binding. Our results will be useful for design of chiral boronic acid chemosensors with improved fluorescence response at acidic pH, which are rarely reported.
