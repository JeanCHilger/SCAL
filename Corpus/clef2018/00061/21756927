Synthesis of [¹¹C]PBR06 and [¹⁸F]PBR06 as agents for positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging of the translocator protein (TSPO). The translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is an attractive target for molecular imaging of neuroinflammation and tumor progression. [(18)F]PBR06, a fluorine-18 labeled form of PBR06, is a promising PET TSPO radioligand originally developed at NIMH. [(11)C]PBR06, a carbon-11 labeled form of PBR06, was designed and synthesized for the first time. The standard PBR06 was synthesized from 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde in three steps with 71% overall chemical yield. The radiolabeling precursor desmethyl-PBR06 was synthesized from 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde in five steps with 12% overall chemical yield. The target tracer [(11)C]PBR06 was prepared by O-[(11)C]methylation of desmethyl-PBR06 with [(11)C]CH(3)OTf in CH(3)CN at 80°C under basic condition and isolated by HPLC combined with SPE purification with 40-60% decay corrected radiochemical yield and 222-740 GBq/μmol specific activity at EOB. On the similar grounds, [(18)F]PBR06 was also designed and synthesized. The previously described Br-PBR06 precursor was synthesized from 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde in two steps with 78% overall chemical yield. A new radiolabeling precursor tosyloxy-PBR06, previously undescribed tosylate congener of PBR06, was designed and synthesized from ethyl 2-hydroxyacetate, 4-methylbenzene-1-sulfonyl chloride, and N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxyaniline in four steps with 50% overall chemical yield. [(18)F]PBR06 was prepared by the nucleophilic substitution of either new tosyloxy-PBR06 precursor or known Br-PBR06 precursor in DMSO at 140°C with K[(18)F]F/Kryptofix 2.2.2 for 15 min and HPLC combined with SPE purification in 20-60% decay corrected radiochemical yield, >99% radiochemical purity, 87-95% chemical purity, and 37-222 GBq/μmol specific activity at EOB. Radiosynthesis of [(18)F]PBR06 using new tosylated precursor gave similar radiochemical purity, and higher specific activity, radiochemical yield and chemical purity in comparison with radiosynthesis using bromine precursor.
