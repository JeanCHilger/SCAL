Primary mediastinal DLBCL: evolving biologic understanding and therapeutic strategies. Primary mediastinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a quite rare clinicopathologic entity. Molecular analysis shows it to be distinct from other types of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and some retrospective analyses suggests that it may respond better to third-generation chemotherapy regimens than to the more commonly used CHOP. The addition of rituximab could reduce these differences the role of consolidation with local radiotherapy, which is often used to treat residual mediastinal masses, remains. The real role of FDG-PET scanning requires prospective studies, and it is hoped that this may allow the de-escalation of radiation therapy accordingly to yield reliable prognostic information.
