Is it possible to predict the outcome of radiation therapy of head and neck cancer? Methods for predicting the outcome of radiation treatment are discussed. The correlation of tumour decrease during irradiation with recurrence-free survival is poor. A reliable method for predicting the long-term result of radiation therapy is urgently needed. Methods using flow cytometry, electron microscopy and positron emission tomography with short-lived radiopharmaceuticals are under investigation.
