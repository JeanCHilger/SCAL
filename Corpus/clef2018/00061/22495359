IMP3, NESP55, TTF-1 and CDX2 serve as an immunohistochemical panel in the distinction among small-cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal carcinoid, and pancreatic endocrine tumor metastasized to the liver. Histopathologic distinction among small-cell carcinoma (SCC), pancreatic endocrine tumor (PET), and gastrointestinal carcinoids metastasized to the liver in needle core biopsies can be extremely challenging because of limited material, crush artifact, and lack of detailed clinical history. In this study, a total of 61 surgically resected or biopsied specimens, including 27 SCCs (lung, 17 colon, 1
