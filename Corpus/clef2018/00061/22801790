Importance of SPECT/CT for knee and hip joint prostheses. Complications, such as loosening or infections are common problems after hip or knee arthroplasty.If conventional X-rays are equivocal bone scintigraphy is the classical second-line imaging modality.Single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) offers metabolic and morphologic information in one imaging step and is becoming increasingly more available in larger hospitals.The SPECT/CT procedure is a promising method and is increasingly being used in daily routine to evaluate joint arthroplasty. The additional benefit compared with classical conventional bone scintigraphy has to be evaluated in further prospective studies.In our hospital SPECT/CT regularly gives important additional information regarding prosthetic joint complications.SPECT/CT is increasingly being used as the second step imaging standard modality if conventional X-rays are equivocal.
