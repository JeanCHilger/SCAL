Visual versus computer evaluation of thiopental-induced EEG changes in temporal lobe epilepsy. Thiopental-induced EEG beta activity was analyzed both visually and by computer in 33 patients with complex partial epilepsy. Studies were done in 16 patients with depth electrodes in limbic structures and 17 patients with scalp and sphenoidal electrodes. The percentage of drug-induced change in beta activity was quantified by computer using spectral analysis. The statistical significance of asymmetries between homologous sites in the amount of change was determined. The spatial distribution of significant asymmetries was used for localization and compared with the results of independent visual analysis of the thiopental EEG. Concordance between computer and visual evaluation occurred in 10 of 17 scalp/sphenoidal and 10 of 16 depth electrode tests. The accuracy of visual and computer localization was determined by comparing them with locus of itcal EEG onset, interictal spikes, and positron emission tomography. In scalp/sphenoidal studies, computer analysis indicating asymmetry appeared more likely to correlate with independent clinical criteria than visual analysis. In depth studies the reverse appeared to be true. Scalp/sphenoidal tests yielded positive results in 25-30% of patients whereas depth electrode tests were positive in 50-70% of patients. The results indicate that computer analysis of surface thiopental tests is an accurate and useful supplement to visual evaluation of these tests.
