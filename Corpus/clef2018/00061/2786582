Evaluation of changes in portal collaterals by single photon emission CT: effects of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy. The changes in portal collaterals before and after Endoscopic Injection Sclerotherapy (EIS) for esophageal varices were studied by Single Photon Emission CT (SPECT). SPECT was performed for the intra-abdominal blood pool with 99mTc autologous red blood cells (RBC) in 17 patients with liver cirrhosis before and after EIS. Twenty mCi of 99mTc-RBC labeled by in vivo technique were administered intra-venously and tomographic imaging of the intra-abdominal vascular blood pool was performed as follows. For each subjects, 64 views were obtained over 360 degrees of elliptic rotation at 30 seconds per view. In 15 of 17 patients, blood pool images over coronary vein and/or short gastric vein area were clearly demonstrated on coronary images. In 9 of 15 patients, the pool of coronary vein or short gastric vein was disappeared or decreased after EIS. It is considered that intra-abdominal blood pool SPECT study is clinically useful for following up of hemodynamics of portal collaterals before and after EIS.
