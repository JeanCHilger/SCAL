Analysis of kinetic rate constants in [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose model using a least square fitting package SALS (statistical analysis with least squares). The analysis of kinetic rate constants in the compartment model for [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was undertaken. Four kinetic rate constants were determined with a least square fitting package SALS (Statistical Analysis with Least Squares), using the measured data of 18F activity as a function of time. SALS calculations were found to be easy and quick with high precision. The rate constants and the curves fitted by the k3 and the k4 models were compared in situations with various degree of cerebral glucose metabolism during positron emission tomography (PET) studies. The k4 model in the determination of cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRglu) was much superior than the k3 model in any given situation as it always underestimates the metabolic rate. However, the k3 model produces less variation when the cerebral radioactivity curve shows steady rising pattern.
