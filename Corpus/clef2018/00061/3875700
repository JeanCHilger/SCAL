Detection of femoral head avascular necrosis in adults by SPECT. Twenty-one adult patients with the clinical diagnosis of avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head were examined with radionuclide angiography, planar bone scintigraphy, and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). A final diagnosis of AVN was established for 15 symptomatic patients with a total of 20 involved hips. SPECT and planar bone scintigraphy were considered positive for AVN only if a photopenic bony defect could be identified. Using SPECT bone scintigraphy, 12 of 15 symptomatic patients and 17 of 20 involved hips (sensitivity of 0.85) were correctly identified, whereas with planar imaging only eight of 15 patients and 11 of 20 involved hips were detected. There were no false-positive diagnoses on SPECT or planar bone scintigraphy. In addition, hyperemia in the region of the proximal femoral metaphysis was demonstrated in six of 20 involved hips. It is concluded that by identifying a photopenic defect that is not evident on planar views, SPECT can contribute to the diagnosis of AVN of the femoral head. In addition, metaphyseal hyperemia appears to be a promising new scintigraphic sign of AVN worthy of further investigation.
