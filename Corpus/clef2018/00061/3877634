Tomographic imaging of the human thyroid with a positron camera before and after partial thyroidectomy. A high-density avalanche chamber positron camera was used for tomographic imaging of the human thyroid before and after partial thyroidectomy. Images were made between 6 and 24 h after oral administration of the positron-emitting radionuclide, Na-124I with activities varying between 0.1 and 0.3 mCi before the surgical intervention and with activities between 0.03 and 0.05 mCi following partial thyroidectomy. The results of thyroid imaging performed on 50 patients and their surgical relevance are discussed as an illustration, one typical case is presented. As a consequence of the high spatial resolution of the camera (2.5 mm full width at half maximum), the functional volume of the thyroid may be estimated from the transaxial tomographic sections before and following partial thyroidectomy, correct to about 10%. The thyroid surface, defined by the contours from each transaxial section, may be displayed using three-dimensional shaded-graphics techniques. This new imaging technique makes possible a fully three-dimensional description of the thyroid in vivo and contributes significantly to the surgical follow-up.
