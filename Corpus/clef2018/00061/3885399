Contribution of radionuclide imaging to radiation oncology. Radionuclide imaging has been helpful to oncologists in the initial evaluation and follow-up of patients with primary and metastatic disease. With the introduction of ultrasound and computed tomography, there has been some reduction in the number of radionuclide imaging procedures. These imaging modalities should be used to complement one another. With the introduction of single-photon emission computed tomography in clinical nuclear medicine, there will be a significant improvement in the sensitivity, accuracy, and quantitative ability to detect abnormal lesions. There are intensive efforts in the development of tumor imaging using new agents. Specific antibodies for surface tumor antigens can be labeled with radioisotopes and used as tools for screening primary tumors and metastatic lesions. Therefore, for the present, radionuclide imaging will continue to contribute to clinical oncology.
