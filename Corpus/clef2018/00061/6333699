A study of regional cerebral blood flow and hemodynamics in cerebrovascular diseases by selective continuous infusion of Kr-81m. A tomographic study of regional cerebral blood flow and hemodynamics was performed on 25 patients with cerebrovascular diseases by selective continuous infusion of krypton-81m (Kr-81m). Kr-81m single photon emission computed tomograms were superimposed on X-ray computed tomograms to assess topographically the perfusion of the entire brain. Study of cerebrovascular diseases using this method showed: (1) regional cerebral blood flow change (2) perfusion distribution change
