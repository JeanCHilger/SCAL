The role of positron emission tomography in the assessment of human neurotransplantation. Positron emission tomography (PET) using tracers of the dopaminergic system has been used to measure striatal function in a small number of parkinsonian patients undergoing neurotransplantation procedures. Some postoperative scans have shown an unequivocal increase in presynaptic dopaminergic function at the graft site, providing evidence of graft survival independent of clinical assessment. Combined PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images provide the facility to explore the relationship between graft placement, survival and clinical efficacy.
