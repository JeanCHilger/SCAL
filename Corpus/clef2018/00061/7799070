Quantitative myocardial mapping of perfusion and metabolism using parametric polar map displays in cardiac PET. Most efficacy studies of cardiac PET in demonstrating myocardial ischemia and viability have been performed using one or more transversal static images of the heart. In contrast, in this paper we describe a method of functional imaging of the complete left ventricular myocardium for perfusion with nitrogen-13-ammonia, both at rest and during a dipyridamol stress test, and of glucose metabolism with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG).This was performed by using the data of each of 48 radial segments of 10 short-axis images as tissue data and LV cavity data of three basal planes as blood pool data. The study describes the results of 19 normal volunteers and 36 patients with coronary artery disease. From the data of the normal volunteers a 95% normal confidence interval was calculated for each imaging modality. These intervals were then used to describe the patient data as normal, ischemic or infarcted.The results of analysis of the parametric images was compared with the results of static analysis of the same patient data and found to be less dependant on the detection threshold used.The described method enables the routine application of functional PET imaging of the total myocardium by the semi-automatic construction of parametric flow and metabolism polar maps. It thus provides an increased performance in the diagnosis, quantification and localization of myocardial ischemia and viability over conventional PET imaging.
