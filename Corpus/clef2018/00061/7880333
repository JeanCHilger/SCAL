Technetium-99m HmPAO brain SPECT and outcome of hemispherectomy for intractable seizures. With recent descriptions of the modified hemispherectomies and hemicorticectomy, there has been renewed interest in hemispherectomy for treatment of intractable seizures with hemiparesis. Because long-term outcome remains uncertain, patient selection remains difficult. 99mTc-HmPAO brain SPECT has been a helpful adjunct in the evaluation of epilepsy surgery candidates. We report SPECT scan findings in 7 patients who underwent hemispherectomy and compare these results with scalp EEG findings. Six patients had unilateral SPECT findings and all had a favorable outcome, regardless of surface EEG findings.
