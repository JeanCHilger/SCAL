Altered energy metabolism in Alzheimer's disease. To evaluate the energy metabolic status of Alzheimer's disease, we examined the cerebral arteriovenous differences of glucose, oxygen, lactate, pyruvate, ketone bodies, and free fatty acids and N-isopropyl-p-(123I) iodoamphetamine (IMP) single-photon emission computed tomography in 5 patients with Alzheimer's disease (4 male and 1 female patients mean age of 64.80 +/- 8.47 years). Compared with 5 age matched normal control subjects (4 males and 1 female
