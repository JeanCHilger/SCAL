Molecular surface tailoring of biomaterials via pulsed RF plasma discharges. A pulsed RF plasma glow discharge is employed to demonstrate molecular level controllability of surface film deposits. Molecular composition of plasma deposited films is shown to vary in a significant manner with the RF duty cycle. Three fluorocarbon monomers are used to illustrate the process. All three exhibit a trend towards increased surface CF2 content with decreasing pulsed RF duty cycle, including exclusion of oxygen. Significant variations in carbon-fluorine surface functionalities are obtained over a controllable range of film thickness. Film growth rate measurements reveal the occurrence of surface reactions during significant portions of the off portion of the duty cycle. Albumin adsorption on fluorocarbon-treated PET films is unchanged from PET controls for a 100-fold range of bulk concentrations and 60-fold range of adsorption times. However, increased retention of albumin is observed following incubation with protein-denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate solution, the retention decreasing with increasing bulk concentration of albumin. The increased retention of albumin suggests the treated surfaces may have promise as biocompatible materials.
