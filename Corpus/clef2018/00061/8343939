Myocardial revascularization in patients with compromised left ventricular function. From March 1988 to March 1992, 69 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) were referred to our Institute for surgical decision making. Sixty-nine (8.2%) had LVD. In 39/69 patients we performed the identification of viable myocardium with the use of [18F] FDG/PET in fasting conditions. We divided patients with LVD into 3 groups: Group A (30 patients) operated on without preoperative [18F] FDG/PET, Group B (32 patients) with FDG uptake in akinetic segments, and Group C (7 patients) with no FDG uptake there was no significant difference among the 3 groups in age, sex, CAD, risk factors and ejection fraction EF (Group A: 29.1 +/- 6.6%, range 16-40
