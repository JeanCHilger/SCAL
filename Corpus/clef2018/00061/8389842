Imaging tumor hypoxia and tumor perfusion. Tumor perfusion and oxygenation status have been suggested as factors which may influence treatment outcome in cancer patients. Nuclear medicine assays of tumor perfusion [99mTc-hexamethylpropylenamine oxime (HMPAO)] and tumor hypoxia [123I-iodoazomycin arabinoside (IAZA)] have recently been developed and described. We report on measurements of perfusion and oxygenation status of 27 tumors in 22 patients using these probes. An inverse correlation between tumor uptake of HMPAO and IAZA was measured (p < 0.05), with severe perfusion deficit usually associated with an increased uptake of the hypoxic marker. This trend was observed for limited stage small-cell lung carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck, soft-tissue sarcoma, brain metastases from small-cell lung carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the prostate as a group, but not for glioblastoma multiforme. Whereas each imaging agent can yield information about the physiological status of tumor and normal tissue, the information resulting from their combined use could be important in cancer therapy.
