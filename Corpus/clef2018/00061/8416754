Evaluation of myocardial perfusion defects by means of "bull's eye" images. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of so-called "bull's eye" imaging as a simplified display of tomographic slices in the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD). A total of 64 patients were studied at stress and at rest, by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), either with thallium-201 (201Tl) or with technetium-99m methoxy-isobutyl-isonitril (Tc-MIBI). The myocardial perfusion defects detected by bull's eye image alone and in combination with visual analysis of tomographic images were evaluated in all cases, taking coronary arteriographic results as a gold standard. The overall sensitivity and specificity for detection of CAD were as follows: bull's eye imaging, 100% and 70.8% tomographic imaging (SPECT), 90% and 91.6%. The results of bull's eye imaging and SPECT interpreted together were 96.6% and 83.3%. The regional sensitivity and specificity of bull's eye for individual coronary arteries were: right coronary artery (RCA), 100% and 73.7%
