Experimental models, protocols, and reference values for evaluation of iodinated analogues of glucose. For an iodinated analogue of glucose to be useful for evaluating glucose uptake using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), it must enter the cell via the same transporter as glucose and accumulate within the cell without being degraded. The biological behavior of the iodinated tracer must therefore be similar to that of 2-deoxy-D(-)[1-14C]-glucose (2-DG). In the present study, four experimental models (biodistribution in mouse, isolated rat heart, human erythrocytes in suspension and cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes) have been chosen and protocols have been set up which allow for the examination of small quantities of iodinated analogues of glucose. The uptakes of 2-DG and of L(-)[1-14C]-glucose have been measured in these models to establish reference values which will be compared with uptake values for iodinated analogues of glucose.
