Imaging technologies for radionuclide dosimetry. Targeted radionuclide therapy is becoming an increasingly popular treatment modality as an alternative or as an adjunct to external beam radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The present method of dosimetry based on the MIRD system requires measurements of the concentration of the radionuclide in the target and risk tissues and the effective half-life of the radionuclide in these tissues. Radionuclide imaging techniques including planar scintigraphy, rectilinear scanning, single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography have all been used to provide data from which this information can be obtained. Additionally anatomical imaging has been used to aid these estimates. This paper reviews the application of imaging technology and methodology to radionuclide dosimetry.
