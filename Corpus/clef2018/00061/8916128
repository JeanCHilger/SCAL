Correlation of histopathological factor of brain tumor and high thallium-201 uptake in single photon emission computed tomography. This study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between several histological features and the degree of TI-201 uptake in brain tumors. T1-201 SPECT was performed on 52 patients with intracranial lesions. Histological examinations were carried out to determine the gradation of tumor cell density, vascularization, small-cell density, and matrix loosening, and the presence of necrosis, atypia, mitoses, and endothelial proliferation. The histological findings were classified into three categories. While the early uptake of T1-201 depended on the degree of necrosis of glial tumor, the delayed T1-201 uptake was closely related to the degree of necrosis, tumor cell density, and small-cell density, and may thus be of value for estimating the viability and degree of malignancy of glial tumors. In the non-glial tumors, the early and delayed T1-201 uptakes were closely related to all histological parameters, with the increase of necrosis and vascularization in the tumor tissue being particularly closely related to high uptake levels.
