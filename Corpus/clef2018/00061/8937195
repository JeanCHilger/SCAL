Regional cerebral blood flow and periventricular hyperintensity in silent cerebral infarction--comparison with multi-infarct dementia. In order to investigate relationship between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and the white matter lesions on MRI in silent cerebral infarction, we quantitatively measured rCBF by 123I-IMP autoradiography method (IMP ARG method) and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) in 36 patients with silent cerebral infarction (SCI group), 22 patients with multi-infarct dementia (MID group), and 16 control subjects without periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) and lacunar infarction on MRI (CL group). Regions of interest (ROIs) on rCBF images were set in the frontal (F), temporal (T), parietal (P), occipital (O) cortex, and the cerebral white matter (W). The severity of PVH on MRI T2-weighted image was divided into four grades (grade 0-3). Our results: 1) Though the frequency of hypertension was significantly higher in SCI group and MID group compared with CL group, no significant difference was seen in the mean age among these three groups. 2) rCBF in the white matter and cerebral cortices except the occipital cortex in SCI group was significantly low compared with CL group (gamma CBFSCI/gamma CBFCL: W 0.87, F 0.87, P 0.88, O 0.92). 3) rCBF in the white matter and cerebral cortices, especially in the white matter and frontal cortex, in MID group was significantly low compared with SCI group (gamma CBFMID/gamma CBFCL: W 0.69, F 0.71, T 0.74, P 0.75, O 0.81). 4) The mean grade of PVH in MID group was significantly higher that that in SCI group (SCI 1.1 vs MID 2.5). 5) The severity of PVH was significantly correlated with each rCBF in the white matter and cerebral cortices, especially in the white matter and frontal cortex. Our findings suggest that the quantitative measurement of rCBF by IMP ARG method is useful for the follow-up study in the patients with silent cerebral infarction as well as the evaluation of the severity of PVH on MRI.
