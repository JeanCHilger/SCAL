Three- to five-dimensional biomedical multisensor imaging for the assessment of neurological (dys) function. This report describes techniques and protocols implemented at the Geneva Canton University Hospitals (HUG) for the combination of various biomedical imaging modalities and sensors including electromagnetic tomography, to study, assess, and localize neurological (dys) function. The interest for this combination stems from the broad variety of information brought out by (functional) magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, computed tomography, single-photon emission tomography, positron emission tomography, and electromagnetic tomography. Combining these data allows morphology, metabolism, and function to be studied simultaneously, the complementary nature of the information from these modalities becoming evident when studying pathologies reflected by metabolic or electrophysiologic dysfunctions. Compared with other current multimodality approaches, the one at the HUG is totally compatible with both clinical and research protocols, and efficiently addresses the multidimensional registration and visualization issues. It also smoothly integrates electrophysiology and related data as fully featured modalities.
