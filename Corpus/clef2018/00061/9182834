Chemical characterization and comparative cellular effects of meta-iodobenzyl guanidine and benzyl guanidine. meta-Iodobenzyl guanidine (MIBG) combines the structural properties of the neuron-blocking agents bretylium and guanethidine and is being used increasingly for various clinical applications. Different samples of MIBG were assayed for possible contamination with benzyl guanidine (BG). Fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) analysis showed a prominent but variable m/z 150 signal, corresponding to a protonated BG. The MS/MS fragmentation pattern of these [M + H]+ ions was similar to that obtained from FAB-MS-generated, protonated BG, confirming the proposed molecule and associated structures. RP-HPLC analysis of both guanidines, however, excluded the possibility of contamination of MIBG with BG. It was therefore concluded that the BG signal was an artifact of the FAB-MS procedure. In addition, the importance of the meta-substituted iodine for the biological activity of MIBG was investigated. Three different biochemical and cell-biological properties of MIBG were compared with those of its precursor MIBA and BG. The assays used were: inhibition of the catecholamine "Uptake I" system in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma and PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, and general cytotoxicity in L1210 leukemia cells. Of the drugs tested, MIBG was the most efficient in Uptake I inhibition and was more toxic in survival assays, but as compared with BG it was almost equipotent in inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. These findings contribute to a further elucidation of the mechanism by which MIBG exerts its various actions.
