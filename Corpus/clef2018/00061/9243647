The role of the temporal coding system in the auditory cortex on speech recognition. To elucidate the temporal coding system for speech recognition, we synthesized stimulation sounds which do not contain formant information but do contain temporal information by transforming original sound wave to click sequences. Using this stimulation sound, we performed a recognition test and used PET to examine the cortical activities in normal subjects listening to this sound. The results of the recognition test showed a good perception of the sounds made from sequential speech. The PET study demonstrated significant activation of the superior temporal gyri while listening to the stimulation speech sounds. Our results imply that these stimulation sounds were processed semantically in the auditory cortices. The temporal processing system is thought to make an important contribution to speech recognition.
