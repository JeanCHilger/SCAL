Malignant mucosal melanoma of the head and neck: review of the literature and report of 14 patients. Fortunately, primary malignant mucosal melanoma of the head and neck is a rare entity. A paucity of data elucidating the predictive factors as well as the unpredictable and aggressive biologic behavior of mucosal melanoma compound the vexing clinical situation. This review summarizes what the literature reveals about the epidemiology, patient survival, patterns of local recurrence, and local and distant metastasis of the disease. Over 1000 patients with this disease have been reported. Survivals at 5 and 10 years is 17% and 5%, respectively. Approximately 19% of patients present with lymph node metastasis and another 16% develop lymph node metastases after treatment, whereas 10% present with distant metastasis. Local metastasis does not affect survival this is in sharp contrast with skin melanoma. Over 50% of patients experience local treatment failure, and salvage treatment is effective in only 25% of these cases. Local failure is the harbinger of distant metastases. Patients with nasal mucosal melanoma have a 31% 5-year survival rate, whereas sinus melanoma patients fare poorly, with a 0% rate of 5-year survival.The authors conducted a retrospective review of 14 patients with characteristics similar to those in the literature in terms of outcome.The 5-year survival rate for these patients was 14%. Whole-body positron emission tomography was performed on 3 patients to detect metastatic disease. The patterns of local recurrence, distant metastasis, and survival for these patients were compared with the same data for patients described in the literature.Surgery appears to have the greatest efficacy in the management of mucosal melanoma, although radiation therapy may play an increasingly important role in the future.
