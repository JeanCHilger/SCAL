Brain activation induced by estimation of duration: a PET study. Duration information about a visual stimulus requires processing as do other visual features such as size or intensity. Using positron emission tomography, iterative H215O infusions, and statistical parametric mapping, we investigated the neural correlates of time processing. Nine normal subjects underwent six serial rCBF. Three tasks were studied: (a) A temporal generalization task (D task) in which the subjects had to judge (by pressing one of two keys) whether the duration of the illumination of a green LED was equal to or different from that of a previously presented standard (b) An intensity generalization task (I task) in which the judgment concerned the intensity of the LED
