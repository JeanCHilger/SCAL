Brain activation during cognitive stimulation with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test--a functional MRI study on healthy volunteers and schizophrenics. It has been demonstrated by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) that frontal brain regions are stimulated during performance of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). The WCST is also regarded as one of the standard tests for the assessment of frontal activity in brain imaging studies of schizophrenia. In this study cerebral activation was assessed by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In healthy volunteers WCST stimulation resulted in a right lateralized frontal activation. In 13 chronic schizophrenics on stable neuroleptic medication, a lack of activation in the right prefrontal cortex and--as a trend--an increased left temporal activity during execution of the WCST was noted compared to controls. Since a one-slice technique was used, no information about the activation pattern in adjacent brain regions was obtained. However, as fMRI possesses a superior spatial resolution compared to SPECT and PET, the anatomical localization of the activation effect in the measured slice can be defined more precisely. Beside these methodological considerations, the results are discussed in relation to prior findings of a reduced ability of schizophrenics to coordinate cerebral function.
