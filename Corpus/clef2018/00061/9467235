Use of positron emission tomography (PET) in the assessment of skeletal muscle glucose metabolism. Non invasive imaging techniques, such as, positronemission tomography (PET), contribute to our present knowledge of glucose metabolism. Besides measurements of net glucose metabolism, PET provides insights into complex processes of intracellular glucose metabolism (i.e., glucose transport and phosphorylation) and is also capable to measure muscular blood flow as a possible determinant of glucose metabolism.
