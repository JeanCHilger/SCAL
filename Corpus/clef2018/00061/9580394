Evaluation of left ventricular contraction using heart tomography with technetium 99m tetrofosmin in synchrony with ECG. Correlation with bidimensional echocardiography. Echocardiography is a standard method of evaluating segmental and global left ventricular function in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to determine if segmental and global ventricular function determined from Gated SPECT myocardial imaging adequately coincides with echocardiographic data.We studied 23 patients with ischemic heart disease referred for clinical 99mTc tetrofosmin Gated SPECT imaging. The results were compared with those obtained using a standard rest echocardiographic assessment. Both studies were performed within a 24-48 hour period. Segmental results in both studies were analyzed by semiquantitative visual scoring using a two or three-point grading system and a summed score was obtained to determine global left ventricular function.There was a good segmental score agreement between both techniques for wall motion (77.5% kappa = 0.49) and less for wall thickening (85%Gated SPECT 99mTc tetrofosmin myocardial imaging is a valid method to assess segmental and global left ventricular function and agrees well with echocardiography.
