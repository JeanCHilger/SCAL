Dipyridamole thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography for prediction of perioperative cardiac events in patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans undergoing vascular surgery. The aim of the study was to determine whether or not dipyridamole thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (201Tl-SPECT) has significant additive value for predicting perioperative cardiac events in patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) undergoing vascular surgery. Routine preoperative 201Tl-SPECT was performed in 106 consecutive patients with ASO (age 68+/-8.9 years 91 men and 15 women). The frequency of reversible defects in a clinical high-risk group (n=44) was significantly higher than in a low-risk group (n=62
