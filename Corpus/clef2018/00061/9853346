Detection of lung and chest tumours using 99Tcm-tetrofosmin: comparison with 201Tl. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of 99Tcm-tetrofosmin for detecting tumours of the lungs and adjacent structures and to compare the results with those for 201Tl. In the 18 patients studied, there were 30 lesions in total. Dual-isotope SPET acquisitions were performed 10 min and 3 h after the administration of 99Tcm-tetrofosmin and 201Tl. Image quality and semi-quantitative parameters were evaluated for both tracers. All lesions were detected by the two radiopharmaceuticals on both the early and delayed images. In seven patients, the image quality of 99Tcm-tetrofosmin was better than that of 201Tl. For the detection of metastatic lymph nodes, the delayed 201Tl and the early 99Tcm-tetrofosmin images were superior. No significant difference was observed between the uptake ratios of the two tracers. 99Tcm-tetrofosmin showed significantly (P < 0.001) higher washout than 201Tl from both the lesions and normal lungs, although washout of 201Tl from normal lungs was significantly higher than that from the lesions. In conclusion, 99Tcm-tetrofosmin may be helpful for detecting tumours of the lungs and adjacent structures, but has limited applicability in differentiating between malignant and benign tumours and may not be used instead of 201Tl to detect malignant tumours of the lungs.
