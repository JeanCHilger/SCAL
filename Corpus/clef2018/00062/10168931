Display of coregistered cross-modality images using time-weighted alternation method. Cross-modality coregistration of functional and anatomical images has rapidly grown as the aid for the interpretation of functional images. Various methods have been previously investigated so that the coregistered images can be easily interpreted and realistically visualized. We used the time/intensity-weighted alternation method to display the coregistered images simultaneously. Stereotactic registration was done with two methods. We realized the automated method of alignment using the boundary of head scalp extracted from the sinogram of a PET emission scan and surface-matching algorithm in brain, and the semi-automated method using a paired point-matching algorithm in the chest and abdomen. For the simultaneous display of the stereotactically registered images, rapid switching of the screens were applied on which both images were written with independent color scales. Rapid alternate display of two images, that is synchronized using the monitor scanning process, could induce the fusion of images in the human visual perception system. Also, intensification of an interesting image is possible by weighting the displaying time or global intensities of images with the degree of interest. These techniques could be useful for the interpretation and visualization of the coregistered images.
