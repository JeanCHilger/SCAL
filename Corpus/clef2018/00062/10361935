The benefit of SPECT when added to planar scintigraphy in patients with bone metastases in the spine. This study compared the efficiency of SPECT with planar bone scans in differentiating malignant from benign lesions and in detecting metastases to the spine.Planar scintigraphy and SPECT were performed in 37 patients with low back pain without known malignancy and in 38 patients with confirmed malignancy. The type, location, and intensity of tracer accumulation were compared on the planar and SPECT scans. The malignant or benign nature of lesions was proved by radiologic methods, histologic findings, 6 month follow-up, or all of these.More metastases were detected by SPECT (SPECT, 58 of 64 planar, 42 of 64SPECT of the spine improved the diagnostic accuracy of bone scans when added to a planar scan in patients with known malignancy and clinical suspicion of spinal metastases when the planar scan was borderline abnormal. It helps in differentiating between benign and malignant lesions of the spine.
