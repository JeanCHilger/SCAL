Noninvasive screening for pheochromocytoma in patients with an incidentally discovered adrenal mass: usefulness of provocative test with metoclopramide and 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. Pheochromocytoma accounts for approximately 25% of incidentally discovered adrenal masses. Certain diagnostic procedures (e.g., adrenal arteriography, needle biopsy of an adrenal mass), anesthesia and abdominal surgery may cause a sudden release of catecholamines from a pheochromocytoma and induce paroxysmal attacks of hypertension. In addition, pheochromocytoma is well known to cause unsuspected operating room deaths. Therefore, we must carefully separate this functioning neoplasm from other types of adrenal masses. In this study, we compared the results of noninvasive tests including (1) assay of urinary catecholamines and their metabolites, (2) a provocative pharmacologic test using metoclopramide (MCP test), and (3) 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy to screen for pheochromocytoma in 10 consecutive patients with an incidentally discovered adrenal mass (6 pheochromocytomas and 4 non-functioning adrenocortical adenomas). We measured the 24-hour urinary excretion of catecholamines, metanephrines and vanillyl mandelic acid in all 10 patients 5 were positive, 4 were negative and 1 was false-negative (sensitivity = 83%, specificity = 100%). The MCP test was performed in 7 patients
