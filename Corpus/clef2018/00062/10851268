Fate of 6-deoxy-6-[123I]iodo-D-glucose in normal and diabetic rats. The D-glucose analog 6-deoxy-6-¿123Iĭodo-D-glucose (6-DIG) was recently proposed as a potential tracer for the in vivo characterization of D-glucose transport in distinct cell types. In this study, the validity of such a proposal was investigated in both control and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. 6-DIG was injected intravenously in either control or diabetic rats. The fate of 6-DIG was assessed by scintigraphy of the injected animals, blood and urine sampling, and measurement of tissue radioactivity at the time of sacrifice, 140 min after 6-DIG injection. The half-life for 6-DIG in plasma and its accumulation in kidney and urinary bladder indicated that it was mainly eliminated from the body by glomerular filtration. The urinary elimination of 6-DIG was accelerated, however, in the polyuric diabetic rats. Bile formation also apparently contributed to the clearance of 6-DIG. Its uptake by liver, heart and muscles yielded values lower than blood concentration. The usefulness of 6-DIG as a tracer for D-glucose transport in selected organs in the perspective of clinical application, e.g. by single photon emission computed tomography, requires further investigations.
