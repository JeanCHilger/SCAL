Cerebral activation, hostility, and cardiovascular control during mental stress. Hostility has been established as a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. Putatively pathogenic hemodynamic and neuroendocrine responses to psychological stressors are associated with hostility, but the cerebral effects of hostility and their relationship to these responses are unknown. This pilot study examined cardiovascular and cerebral blood flow responses to stress in subjects with high and low levels of trait hostility.Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) during a control condition and in response to mental arithmetic stress.The stressor was associated with reduced blood flow to the prefrontal cortex, and this reduction was greater in the high hostility subjects.These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that mental arithmetic stress is associated with reduced blood flow to prefrontal cortex, and that trait hostility is associated with a stronger effect.
