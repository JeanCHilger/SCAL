11C]Hyaluronan uptake with positron emission tomography in liver diseas. A hyaluronan-loading test has been developed for assessment of hyaluronan kinetics and applied in patients with liver and joint diseases. This test describes the metabolic process of hyaluronan but cannot define the specific contribution of different organs. A method for labelling of hyaluronan with the short-lived positron-emitting radionuclide 11C has been published and in this study applied in healthy subjects and liver diseases.Positron emission tomography (PET) was used for the regional assessment and quantification of [11C]hyaluronan uptake in three healthy subjects, four patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis, one with alcoholic hepatitis and one with liver steatosis. After intravenous administration of 60 MBq of 11C-labelled hyaluronan, a 55-min PET scan was performed over the liver and plasma radioactivity was analysed. Rate constants describing the transport of the [11C]hyaluronan tracer from plasma to the liver were calculated.High uptake was observed in the liver combined with a rapid elimination of tracer from plasma. The liver uptake rate (k1) was significantly lower in patients (0.018 min-1) than in healthy subjects (0.043 min-1, P = 0.002). The rate constants seem to be related to the severity of the disease as defined by the Child-Pugh score.The study suggests that PET with [11C]hyaluronan could be an accurate method by which to assess liver dysfunction, in conditions where endothelial cell function is impaired. The possibility of quantification over extended portions of the body also opens up possibilities to explore regional differences in liver function and to assess other elimination routes of hyaluronan.
