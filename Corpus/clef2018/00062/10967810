AIDS-related primary CNS lymphoma: a brief review. Primary CNS lymphoma, which has a strong association with Epstein-Barr virus, was increasing in incidence in patients with AIDS before the introduction and widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapy. The diagnostic strategies for primary CNS lymphoma, including contrast-enhanced CT or MRI and brain biopsy, are well established. The use of a combination of diagnostic tools to reduce the need for brain biopsy is currently being evaluated. The clinical outcome with current treatments for primary CNS lymphoma in HIV-infected persons remains relatively discouraging.
