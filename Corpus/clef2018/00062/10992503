Pet toxin from enteroaggregative Escherichia coli produces cellular damage associated with fodrin disruption. Pet toxin is a serine protease from enteroaggregative Escherichia coli which has been described as causing enterotoxic and cytotoxic effects. In this paper we show that Pet produces spectrin and fodrin (nonerythroid spectrin) disruption. Using purified erythrocyte membranes treated with Pet toxin, we observed degradation of alpha- and beta-spectrin chains this effect was dose and time dependent, and a 120-kDa protein fraction was observed as a breakdown product. Spectrin degradation and production of the 120-kDa subproduct were confirmed using specific antibodies against the alpha- and beta-spectrin chains. The same degradation effect was observed in alpha-fodrin from epithelial HEp-2 cells, both in purified cell membranes and in cultured cells which had been held in suspension for 36 h
