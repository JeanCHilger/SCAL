Strategy for the treatment of arteriovenous malformations. The treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is still a challenging problem in the neurosurgical field. The deep-seated AVMs are a definite indication for radiosurgery for the small AVMs and with pre-embolisation for the large AVMs. The superficial AVMs are a good indication for surgery. In the case of small AVMs, surgery alone is a viable option however, in the case of large AVMs, pre-operative embolisation is essential for prevention of NPPB (normal perfusion pressure breakthrough). Embolisation alone cannot be used, except for a small AVM in the non-eloquent cortex. Preoperative embolisation makes surgery easy
