Effects of long-term treatment with verapamil on left ventricular function and myocardial blood flow in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy without overt heart failure. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) abnormalities are present in early stage dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and have been attributed to coronary microvascular abnormalities. The favorable effects of verapamil on coronary microcirculation might indicate its use in early stage DCM. We assessed the safety of long-term combination therapy of verapamil and enalapril and its effects on both left ventricular function and myocardial perfusion compared with enalapril alone in 18 patients with DCM (15 men, 3 women mean age, 50+/-9 years) without overt heart failure (NYHA class I-II). At baseline and after 6 months of randomized treatment with either enalapril (10-20 mg) (nine patients, group 1) or enalapril (10-20 mg) and verapamil (120-240 mg) (nine patients, group 2), left ventricular function was assessed at rest, during handgrip, and during bicycle exercise by equilibrium radionuclide angiography. Mean MBF was measured at rest and after dipyridamole by positron emission tomography (PET) and 13N-ammonia as a flow tracer. At baseline, the two groups had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction at rest, which was further impaired during isometric exercise, but increased at peak bicycle exercise. MBF was similarly reduced in the two groups at rest and during dipyridamole. During treatment, no adverse events occurred in either group. After 6 months there was no significant difference in the main study variables either between the two groups or within each group before and after treatment. Long-term combination therapy with verapamil and enalapril is safe in patients with DCM without overt heart failure. Despite no favorable effect on myocardial perfusion, combined treatment prevented deterioration of left ventricular function, similarly to enalapril alone.
