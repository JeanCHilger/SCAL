Kinetics and mechanism of phosphine autoxidation catalyzed by imidorhenium(V) complexes. The relative binding abilities of PY(3) (PMe(3), PMe(2)Ph, PMePh(2), PPh(3), P(OMe)(3), P(OMe)(2)Ph, PEt(3), P(OEt)(3), P(OEt)Ph(2), and dmpe) toward Re(V) were evaluated. The equilibrium constants for the reactions, MeRe(NAr)(2)[P(OMe)(3)](2) + PY(3) = MeRe(NAr)(2)(PY(3))(2) (1) + P(OMe)(3), decrease in the order PMe(3) > dmpe > PMe(2)Ph > P(OMe)(2)Ph approximately PEt(3) > P(OEt)(3) > PMePh(2) > P(OEt)Ph(2) > PPh(3). Both electronic and steric factors contribute to this trend. The equilibrium constant increases as the basicity of PY(3) increases when the steric demand is the same. However, steric effects play a major role in the coordination, and this is the reason that the affinity of PEt(3) toward Re(V) is less than that of PMe(2)Ph. A mixed-ligand complex, MeRe(NAr)(2)[P(OMe)(3)](PY(3)), was also observed in the course of the stepwise formation of 1. The large coupling constant, (2)J(PP) > or = 491 Hz, between the two phosphorus atoms suggests a trans geometry for the phosphines. Compound 1 catalyzes the oxidation of PY(3) by molecular oxygen. Kinetic studies suggest that the reaction of 1 with O(2) is first-order with respect to [O(2)] and inverse-first-order with respect to [PY(3)]. A mechanism involving a peroxorhenium intermediate MeRe(NAr)(2)(eta(2)-O(2)) is proposed for the catalytic processes. The reactivity of MeRe(NAr)(2)(eta(2)-O(2)) toward triaryl phosphines parallels that of the known compound MeReO(2)(eta(2)-O(2)).
