The perception of available social support is related to reduced cardiovascular reactivity in Phase II cardiac rehabilitation patients. Numerous studies have observed a relationship between social support (SS) and post coronary event survival. Laboratory research suggests one mechanism regulating this relationship may be exaggerated cardiovascular reactivity (CVR). What has not been as well explored is (1) whether the SS-CVR relationship holds up for a heart diseased sample, and (2) whether this relationship is evidenced only in supportive environments or can be found as a function of generalized perception of being socially supported. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of perceived SS and a locally supportive presence to CVR to a speech-induced stressor in post coronary event patients.Forty-one Phase II cardiac rehabilitation patients participated in a research protocol that consisted of BP and HR measurement during two identical affective stress interviews where local support was systematically varied by presence or absence of a friendly small pet dog. Perception of SS was assessed by completion of psychosocial questionnaire packet that included measures of SS, anger expression and pet attachment.Repeated measures ANCOVAs revealed that patients who believed they had greater SS available to them during difficult times exhibited significantly less CVR for MAP (p<.007) and DBP (p<.024). No significant main effects for local support (pet presence) and no interactions between local and perceived support were found.These findings are of interest as they: (a) demonstrate an association between reduced CVR and higher (amounts of) SS in a clinical sample (b) demonstrate this effect in a sample medicated to dampen CV levels and surges
