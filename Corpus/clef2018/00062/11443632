Detection of antibodies to selected human pathogens among wild and pet macaques (Macaca tonkeana) in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Human-to-primate disease transmission can potentially cause significant morbidity and mortality among wild primate populations and thus constitutes an important conservation issue. Our cross-sectional study examines serological evidence of exposure to human pathogens among wild and pet macaques in Sulawesi. Serum samples taken from 11 pet and 15 wild macaques (Macaca tonkeana) were analyzed for antibodies to a panel of viruses commonly encountered in human populations. Antibodies to measles, influenza A, and parainfluenza 1 were detected in sera of both pet and wild macaques. Antibodies to parainfluenza 2 and 3 were found in the sera of wild macaques only. Possible routes of exposure, as well as implications for conservation are discussed.
