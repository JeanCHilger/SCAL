Changes in cerebral glucose metabolism and visuospatial capability in hypogonadal males under testosterone substitution therapy. Genders differ concerning abilities of spatial cognition positive associations of testosterone levels with corresponding scores have been reported, as well. We addressed the question whether there is a testosterone-susceptible area within cerebral structures previously described to be involved in mental rotation. Using F-18-deoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET), we studied cerebral glucose metabolism during a standardized 3-dimensional mental rotation task in 6 right-handed men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism before and under testosterone substitution therapy. Under elevated testosterone levels, enhanced cerebral glucose metabolism during mental rotation was observed in the 4 subjects with improved visuospatial capability. Areas involved were previously demonstrated to be activated by such tasks in eugonadal men.
