Evaluation of clinical value of technetium-99m(V) dimercaptosuccinic acid SPECT in diagnosis of parotid lump. To evaluate the clinical value of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) on classifying parotid lump as benign or malignant before treatment.SPECT images of the parotid region were obtained in forty-five patients with parotid lump before surgery. We used technetium-99m(V) dimercaptosuccinic acid as imaging agent. The results were compared with their pathological diagnoses, clinical examination, and ultrasonography.The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of Tc-99m(V)-DMSA SPECT imaging in determining malignancy of parotid lump were 93.7%, 72.4%, 80.0%, respectively. The uptake ratios of parotid lesions were higher in malignant tumors than benign tumors, cysts, and inflammatory lumps (P < 0.05).It is suggested that Tc-99m (V)-DMSA SPECT can be a useful aided method of preoperative diagnosis of parotid lumps. The uptake ratios can help increase the accuracy of diagnoses. For the benign tumors and inflammatory masses of parotid gland, the diagnoses had some false positives which may be reduced by combined clinical examination and ultrasonography.
