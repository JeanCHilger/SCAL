Prognostic significance of stress tomographic scintigraphy of myocardial perfusion in diabetic patients. To assess the prognostic value of SPECT in patients with diabetes (DM) and without DM.A total of 366 patients (104 women, 262 men) were examined by T1 +/- 201 or Tc-99m-MIBI SPECT of the myocardium. DM was recorded in 149 patients, 217 patients did not suffer from DM. The SPECT findings were classified as normal and abnormal perfusion (fixed or reversible perfusion defect). A serious cardiac event was defined as sudden cardiac death or non-fatal myocardial infarction. Also angina pectoris requiring revascularization was recorded.During the average investigation period of 24 +/- 7 months we recorded in 147 patients with a normal load perfusion only one non-fatal myocardial infarction and the risk of a serious cardiac event was low: 0.3% per annum in the whole group. A significantly higher incidence of a severe cardiac event, 5.9% per year, was recorded in 219 patients with an abnormal finding on SPECT (10 deaths and 16 non-fatal myocardial infarctions, P < 0.01). On comparison of the frequency of serious cardiac events in groups of patients with and without DM no significant difference was found as regards normal load perfusion of the heart muscle (1.1% vs. 0%, P = NS) even in patients with an abnormal SPECT finding (5.8% vs. 6.1, P = NS).SPECT myocardial perfusion makes it possible to stratify the risk in patients with DM similarly as proved previously in non-selected groups. Similarly as in patients without DM normal perfusion in diabetic patients predicts a benign prognosis.
