New tools for coronary risk assessment: what are their advantages and limitations? The concept of risk assessment and reduction, introduced initially by the Framingham Heart Study and refined in other models, forms the cornerstone of preventive cardiology. Risk factor assessment determines the therapeutic strategy, because the intensity of preventive intervention is tailored to the patient's risk of coronary heart disease. The conventional risk factors for coronary heart disease include elevated serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, cigarette smoking, diabetes, vascular disease, menopausal status (women only), and age. Aggressive risk factor reduction, formerly used exclusively in secondary prevention, may be pivotal to optimal patient management in high-risk primary prevention. A number of noninvasive imaging modalities have the potential to measure and to monitor atherosclerosis in asymptomatic individuals and include exercise ECG testing, electron beam computed tomography, magnetic resonance coronary angiography, positron emission tomography, ankle-brachial index, and B-mode ultrasound. Novel serum markers, including C-reactive protein and homocysteine, have the ability to gauge risk in the individual patient. Systemic therapy for risk reduction in primary prevention may be preferable to local therapy (eg, angioplasty and bypass) and may more effectively prevent acute coronary events than these more invasive approaches.
