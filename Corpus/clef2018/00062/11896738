Rhenium bipyridine complexes for the recognition of glucose. Bipyridine ligands containing pendant methyl, amino, and amino-boronic acid groups were synthesized. Coordination complexes of these ligands with rhenium were prepared straightforwardly and in good yield. The fluorescence behavior of the Re complexes was studied as a function of pH and exposure to various concentrations of glucose. The methyl bipyridine complex showed no change in fluorescence with pH, the amino derivative showed a rapid decrease from low pH to neutral, and the amino-boronate derivative showed little change from pH 4 to 10. Fluorescence quenching was observed at high pH as expected on the basis of a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) signaling mechanism. This behavior can be explained on the basis of the first oxidation and reduction potentials of these complexes. Glucose testing showed a significant dependence on the solvent system used. In pure methanol, the rhenium boronate complex exhibited a 55% fluorescence intensity increase upon increasing glucose concentration from 0 to 400 mg/dL. However, in 50 vol % methanol/phosphate buffered saline, none of the complexes showed significant response in the glucose range of physiological interest.
