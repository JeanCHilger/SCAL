Cloning and expression of spinach glycolate oxidase in Escherichia coli. The cDNA coding spinach glycolate oxidase (GO) was amplified by RT-PCR using the total RNA of spinach leaves as the template, and was cloned into cloning vector pMD18-T. After the DNA sequence was determined, the go gene was subcloned into E. coli expression vector pBV220, pET-22b(+), pTIG-Trx and pThioHisC. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3) (pTIG-Trx-GO) and E. coli BL21 (DE3) (pET-22b(+)-GO) expressed the predicted 38 kD glycolate oxidase, and the enzyme activity was also detected.
