The neural networks of music. Recent neuropsychological, transcranial Doppler sonographic, positron emission tomographic and functional nuclear magnetic resonance studies have indicated that musical perception is not dependent on the right hemisphere but on neural networks corresponding to the fundamental components of music in both hemispheres. In the brain there is no centre for music. Musicians have cerebral characteristics, anatomical as well as functional, which are correlated with the age at which they began their musical studies. This argues for cortical reorganization as a result of musical training. Whether these characteristics are to be ascribed to cortical plasticity alone, or to an innate structural property, or to both, remains an open question, however. Investigation of chromosomal defects, biochemical abnormalities and morphological features of congenital and degenerative brain diseases can provide further insight into the cerebral substrate of musicality.
