Protein kinase G activation of K(ATP) channels in human-cultured prostatic stromal cells. In this study, we identify and investigate the role of protein kinase G (PKG) in cells cultured from human prostatic stroma. Cells were used for immunocytochemistry, contractility or K(+) fluorescent imaging studies. All cultured prostatic stromal cells showed PKG immunostaining. Phorbol 12,13 diacetate (PDA, 1 microM) elicited contractions from human-cultured prostatic stromal cells that could be blocked by both the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, nifedipine (3 microM), and the protein kinase C inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (1 microM). The nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP, molar pIC(50) 5.16+/-0.17) and the cGMP-phosphodiesterase inhibitor, zaprinast (50 microM), inhibited PDA (1 microM)-induced contractions. The PKG activator beta-phenyl-1, N(2)-ethenoguanosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (PET-cGMP, molar pIC(50) 6.96 +/- 0.25) also inhibited PDA (1 microM)-induced contractions. Glibenclamide (10 microM) and Rp-8-Br-cGMPS (5 microM), but not iberiotoxin (100 nM) or Rp-cAMP (5 microM), reversed this inhibition. In human-cultured prostatic stromal cells loaded with the K(+) fluorescent indicator, 1,3-Benzenedicarboxylic acid, 4,4'-[1,4,10,13-tetraoxa-7,16-diazacyclooctadecane-7,16-diylbis(5-methoxy-6,2-benzofurandiyl)]bis-, tetrakis [(acetyloxy) methyl] ester (PBFI), PET-cGMP (300 nM) caused a reduction in intracellular K(+) that was blocked by glibenclamide (10 microM) and Rp-8-Br-cGMPS (5 microM), but not by iberiotoxin (100 nM). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that, in human-cultured prostatic stromal cells, PKG inhibits contractility through the activation of K(ATP) channels.
