Nuclear imaging is more sensitive for the detection of viable myocardium than dobutamine echocardiography. Intact perfusion, preserved metabolism of free fatty acids and glucose, and the presence of contractile reserve have been used as markers of viable myocardium. However, not all viable myocardium may exhibit all these characteristics. Accordingly, these features were evaluated in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. Fourteen patients with chronic ischaemic heart disease and depressed left ventricular function (LVEF 34+/-10%) perfusion was evaluated by early resting 201Tl single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), fatty acid utilization by 15-p-[123I]iodophenyl-3-(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid SPECT, glucose utilization by 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose SPECT and contractile reserve (CR) by dobutamine echocardiography. The comparison of the different modalities was restricted to akinetic or dyskinetic myocardium as assessed by resting 2-dimensional echocardiography. For all techniques a 13-segment model was used. Sixty-four of 182 segments (35%) showed akinesia or dyskinesia. Intact perfusion was found in 33/64 (52%) segments. Fatty acid utilization was maintained in 38/64 (59%) segments and glucose utilization was maintained in 38/64 (59%) segments. CR was present in significantly fewer segments: 21 of 64 (33%) (P<0.01 vs glucose and fatty acid utilization). In the 21 segments with preserved CR, perfusion was intact in 16/21 (76%) segments, fatty acid utilization in 19/21 (90%) segments and glucose utilization was preserved in all (100%) segments. Conversely, in the 43 segments without CR, 17 segments (40%) showed intact perfusion, 19 segments (44%) preserved fatty acid utilization and 17 (40%) still showed preserved glucose utilization. Disagreement in segments between the viability markers was caused mainly by segments without CR but preserved perfusion, fatty acid or glucose utilization. The substantial number of segments with preserved glucose and fatty acid utilization but without contractile reserve, suggests an underestimation of myocardial viability by dobutamine echocardiography.
