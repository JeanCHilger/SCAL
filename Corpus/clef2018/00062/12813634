The value of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in differentiation of pancreatic lesions. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a functional imaging modality that is based on the metabolic activity which is higher in most malignant tumors than benign tissues. This short review describes the basics of FDG-PET and gives a discussion of its role in differentiation of focal pancreatic lesions. The diagnostic accuracy in patients with active inflammation or cancer of the pancreas can be improved by dynamic acquisition of focal pancreatic lesions.
