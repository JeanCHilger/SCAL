Somatosensory areas engaged during discrimination of steady pressure, spring strength, and kinesthesia. The aim of this study was to locate neuronal populations in the somatosensory areas engaged during discrimination of differences in: (1) static sustained pressure on the distal phalanx (PRESS) (2) spring strengths (SSTIFF) during active flexion of the right index finger
