Standardized Uptake Values in 2-Deoxy-2-[18F]Fluoro-D-Glucose with Positron Emission Tomography. Clinical Significance of Iterative Reconstruction and Segmented Attenuation Compared with Conventional Filtered Back Projection and Measured Attenuation Correction. To evaluate the clinical significance of differences in 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) lymph node standardized uptake values (SUV) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection using iterative reconstruction with segmented attenuation correction (IR SAC) compared to filtered back-projection with measured attenuation correction (FBP MAC).Seven patients with HIV infection and multiple focal lymph node abnormalities were investigated with whole-body FDG-PET. Mean and maximum SUVs from lymph node regions of interest (n = 961) were compared for quantitative differences between reconstruction techniques.IR MAC resulted in significantly lower mean SUV [0.06 95% (confidence interval (CI)) = 0.04-0.07] and maximum SUV (0.82With our reconstruction parameters, significant differences in mean and maximum SUV values were observed. The magnitude of the mean SUV difference, however, was small. IR SAC is a promising method to accurately quantify standardized uptake values for clinical use.
