Reduction of myocardial 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose uptake artifacts in positron emission tomography using dietary carbohydrate restriction. The use of carbohydrate restriction prior to 2-deoxy-2-[18F] positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) to reduce image artifacts caused by myocardial FDG uptake was investigated.Ninety-six whole-body FDG-PET scans were studied. Dietary intake of the meal prior to scanning was recorded. Coronal and transverse images were assessed visually and scored based on myocardial FDG uptake and the presence of associated image artifacts.Of 49 patients who consumed carbohydrates prior to PET, 14 (28.6%) had a clinically significant image artifact versus only five (10.6%) of 47 patients who did not consume carbohydrates (P = 0.0275). A 3.36 times increased risk (confidence interval 1.00-12.97) for clinically significant image artifacts was calculated for patients who consume carbohydrates in their last meal prior to scanning.With the rising use of FDG-PET in the evaluation of intra-thoracic malignancies, dietary carbohydrate restriction prior to scanning may play a role in increasing lesion detectability and reducing false negative scans.
