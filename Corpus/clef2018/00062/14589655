Neural correlates of dementia: regional brain metabolism (FDG-PET) and the CERAD neuropsychological battery. The present Investigation examined the biological correlates of the cognitive deficits of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias using the neuropsychological assessment battery of the Consortium to Establish a Registry of Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) and positron emission tomography (PET). Resting state cerebral glucose metabolism was measured using the labelled radiotracer, [18F] Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG), in a sample of patients with mild to moderate dementia (n = 66). Specific and predictable relationships were seen between regional brain metabolism (left and right, frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes) and the neuropsychological measures of verbal fluency, constructional praxis, and verbal list learning. On tests of naming and delayed verbal recall only diminished FDG uptake in the left frontal lobe and the left temporal lobe, respectively, approached significance. This study demonstrates the expected relationships between neuropsychological performance and regional cerebral metabolism, thereby providing support for the CERAD battery as a valid measure in the clinical evaluation of dementia and for the use of FDG-PET in brain-behavior studies of dementia.
