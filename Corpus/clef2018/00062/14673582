Assessing dopaminergic function in Parkinson's disease: levodopa kinetic-dynamic modeling and SPECT. Levodopa pharmacokinetic-phamacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling may be able to test the functional integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in Parkinson's disease (PD). [(123)I]-FP-CIT SPECT imaging of striatal dopamine transporters has also been introduced for the evaluation of presynaptic dopaminergic homeostasis. We aimed to assess the intrapatient relation between levodopa PK-PD and SPECT measures of dopaminergic function in PD. Thirty-five PD patients, 1 to 4 on the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale, enrolled in the study. Each patient was examined by levodopa PK-PD modeling and SPECT imaging. Primary measure outcomes were the levodopa half-life in the effect compartment (t1/2(eq)) for PKPD modeling and the ratio of specific to non specific (SP/NSP) tracer striatal uptake for SPECT. Levodopa t1/2(eq) was highly significantly correlated with H&Y scale (r = -0.815, p < 0.0001), Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (r = -0.691, p < 0.0001) and PD symptom duration (r = -0.647, p < 0.0001). SPECT contralateral putamen SP/NSP ratio showed the most significant correlations with clinical indicators of disease severity: H&Y, r = -0.526, p < 0.002 UPDRS, r = -0.523, p < 0.002
