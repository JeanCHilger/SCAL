Acquisition protocol considerations for combined PET/CT imaging. Since its introduction in 1998, dual-modality PET/CT imaging has received great attention in the medical community. For the first time, patients can be examined with both CT and PET in a single examination. A whole-body survey is the standard mode of acquisition. The CT images are used for anatomic reference of the tracer uptake patterns imaged in PET, as well as for attenuation correction of the PET data. The routine use of CT-based attenuation correction and user preferences for the quality and type of the CT examination have led to the introduction of different PET/CT scanning protocols.Two general approaches to PET/CT imaging can be distinguished today. One uses CT as a fast transmission source with little additional information for anatomic labeling. The other uses CT as a fast transmission source as well as a state-of-the-art diagnostic tool to maximize image quality using optimal acquisition parameters together with oral and intravenous contrast agents. Variations of these approaches share common concerns about image artifacts that result from mismatches in respiration and patient positioning between the CT and the PET examinations. Protocol requirements for the more complex radiologic PET/CT scenario also include alternative contrast application schemes or modifications to the attenuation correction procedure to handle CT contrast agents appropriately.High-quality PET/CT studies can be provided routinely with existing PET/CT technology that is used efficiently by trained and motivated technologists and physicians. Only then will the potential diagnostic benefit of this new imaging modality be explored fully.
