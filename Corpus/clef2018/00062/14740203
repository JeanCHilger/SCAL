In vivo amyloid imaging in Alzheimer's disease. Targeted approaches to therapy for Alzheimer's disease have evolved based on detailed understanding of the genetic, molecular biologic, and neuropathologic basis of the disease. Given the potential for greater treatment efficacy in the earlier stages of the disease, the notion of early diagnosis has become more relevant. Current clinical and imaging diagnostic approaches lack reliability in the preclinical and prodromal phases of the disease. We review emerging studies on imaging of the molecular substrate of the disease, most notably the amyloid peptide, which hope to increase early diagnostic efficacy. We offer a brief overview of the demographics, diagnostic criteria, and current imaging tests, followed by a review of amyloid biology and developments in cerebral amyloid imaging yielded by recent in vitro, in vivo and human studies.
