New modalities in detection of recurrent ovarian cancer. The vast majority of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer and subsequently treated with debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy will ultimately relapse. As is the case with primary diagnosis, detection of recurrent ovarian cancer is limited due to lack of sensitivity and specificity. Specific guidelines for surveillance of this disease are controversial, partly because evidence to support such guidelines is scant and partly because the management of identified recurrences continues to be of minimal success. Subsequently, whether early detection actually can make a difference is not necessarily made clear in the literature. However, there are advances in radiological and molecular biology technology that may offer new possibilities in cancer surveillance. This review will outline the latest evidence to address their use in ovarian cancer.Most of the recent literature involving detection of recurrent ovarian cancer addresses the use of positron emission tomography. There are also some data addressing the use of magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography in this arena. Data pertaining to other modalities such as biological markers are limited. Ca-125 is the accepted assay used for ovarian cancer surveillance, but other options are introduced that may hold promise for the future.A review of the recent literature concerning ovarian cancer surveillance techniques offers few new definitive avenues. While radiological technology and discoveries in detection assays are noteworthy, their potential impact on surveillance appears to be minimal at this time. Low sensitivity and specificity, along with expense, continue to be limiting factors.
