No brain perfusion impairment at long-term follow-up in elderly patients treated with electroconvulsive therapy for major depression. No functional neuroimaging study has previously assessed the long-term effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on brain perfusion. In this study, long-term follow-up brain perfusion in elderly patients treated with ECT for severe unipolar major depression was assessed. In 14 elderly major depressed patients who were ECT remitters, 22 elderly major depressed patients who were pharmacological treatment remitters and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, a medication-free brain 9mTc-HMPAO-SPECT was performed after a minimum period of 12 months of euthymia and, in the case of the ECT remitters, at least 12 months after the last ECT session. Brain perfusion ratios in major depressed patients administered ECT were similar to those in major depressed patients receiving pharmacological treatment and in control subjects. This result suggests that elderly patients given ECT for severe unipolar major depression do not suffer brain perfusion abnormalities at long-term follow-up. Our study adds new evidence in favor of the safety of the ECT, particularly in elderly subjects.
