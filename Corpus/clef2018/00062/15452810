Evaluation of maxillary sinus after treatment of midfacial fractures. Maxillary sinuses are the most frequently injured anatomic region of the facial skeleton in midfacial fractures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the patients with maxillary sinus wall fractures using clinical examinations, maxillofacial computed tomography (CT), and cranial bone single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) and to interpret the results of these examinations to evaluate the indications of surgical intervention or drainage for maxillary sinus after maxillary sinus wall fractures.The results of examinations of 15 patients with maxillary sinus fractures who were treated for midfacial fractures were evaluated. Follow-up examinations were performed in the range of 3 to 47 months after surgery (average, 19.8 months). The patients ranged in age from 10 to 45 years, with an average age of 31.6 years. There were 11 male and 4 female patients. Seven patients had Le Fort II fractures, 6 patients had tripod zygomatic fractures, 1 patient had infraorbital fracture, and 1 patient had zygomatic arch fracture. Operative procedure was performed in all cases. To evaluate maxillary sinus after surgery, maxillofacial computed tomography (CT), cranial bone SPECT, and maxillary sinusitis evaluation form were used in all patients.Maxillofacial CT scans were related to sinusitis in 9 patients who had positive complaints for sinusitis. The cranial bone SPECT showed positive uptake at the fractured sites in 8 patients, minimal uptake in 2 patients, and normal uptake in 5 patients.Clinical examination, maxillofacial CT, and cranial bone SPECT are the most reliable methods available today for the diagnosis and follow-up of complications of maxillary sinus fractures.
