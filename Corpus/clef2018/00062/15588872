Results of a phase I study to dose escalate using intensity modulated radiotherapy guided by combined PET/CT imaging with induction chemotherapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) guided by PET/CT imaging with respiratory gating was employed to dose escalate in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), using accelerated fractionation with induction chemotherapies. One patient developed a grade 5 pneumonitis and the study was halted at 84 Gy in 35 fractions.
