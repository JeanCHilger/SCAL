11C-methionine PET, a novel method for measuring regional salivary gland function after radiotherapy of head and neck cancer. Loss of salivary gland function is a distressing side-effect of radiotherapy (RT) for head and neck cancer. The aim of this study was to develop a positron emission tomography (PET) method for measuring regional salivary gland function in the major salivary glands irradiated during RT.Eight head and neck cancer patients were included two were examined before RT and six after parotid sparing RT. Patients were examined by dynamic 11C-methionine PET of the major salivary glands and parotid gland salivary flow measurements. PET data were analysed using a kinetic model of salivary gland 11C-methionine metabolism, in which salivary gland function was quantified by the net metabolic clearance of 11C-methionine, K. Functional voxel-wise images of K were calculated and matched with the CT-dose-plan for comparing regional salivary gland function with the regional radiation dose.Parotid gland K correlated positively with parotid gland salivary flow, indicating that K can be used as an index of salivary gland function. K of parotid and submandibular glands was reduced dependent on the median radiation dose. In one patient, receiving a heterogeneous radiation dose to the parotid glands, regional salivary gland function was inversely correlated to the regional radiation dose.Salivary gland function can be measured by dynamic 11C-methionine PET. The net metabolic clearance of 11C-methionine of salivary glands was reduced dependent on the radiation dose. Dynamic 11C-methionine PET offers a method for studying the individual response of the major salivary glands to irradiation.
