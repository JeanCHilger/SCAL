Volunteers: the value of pet therapy. Volunteers are an integral part of the caregiving team at the 10-bedroom Community Hospice House in New Hampshire. They serve in many capacities. Whether delivering meals, doing laundry, or listening to a patient's reminiscences, volunteers provide companionship and comfort to the patients, as well as their families and friends. Not all of the volunteers, however, are two-legged.
