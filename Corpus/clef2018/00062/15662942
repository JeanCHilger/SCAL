Identifying distinct components in the cerebral treatment of visual sexual information through functional neuroimaging. For now several years, the growing developement of neuroimaging techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) allowed a better understanding of neural processes involved in human emotions and goal-directed behaviors. In particular, several studies are now available on the neural correlates of male sexual arousal. A neurobehavioral model of neural processes involved in sexual arousal has been proposed (Redout√© et al., 2000) comprising: i) a cognitive component ii) an emotional component
