Icodextrin re-absorption varies with age in children on automated peritoneal dialysis. Information on the use of Icodextrin in children remains scarce however, it is believed that the characteristics are similar across all ages. We report the use of Icodextrin in a cohort of pediatric automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) patients younger than those previously reported (n=8, median age of 2.8, range 0.02-17.1 years). Net Icodextrin daytime dwell ultrafiltration was calculated in each patient for every day on therapy as ml/h/m2. Half of the patients showed re-absorption even when reducing Icodextrin dwells from a median of 10 to 6 h. All four patients who re-absorbed the Icodextrin (ranging from -23.7+/-7.5 to -2.5+/-6.0 ml/h/m2) were treated with cyclic nocturnal APD, and three of these four patients were high transporters on the peritoneal equilibration test (PET). Icodextrin fluid removal correlated significantly with age (Spearman rank r=0.8571, P=0.0107). The data suggest that Icodextrin behaves differently in young children.
