Determination of mechanical and electronic shifts for pinhole SPECT using a single point source. The effects of uncompensated electronic and mechanical shifts may compromise the resolution of pinhole single photon emission computed tomography. The resolution degradation due to uncompensated shifts is estimated through simulated data. A method for determining the transverse mechanical and axial electronic shifts is described and evaluated. This method assumes that the tilt of the detector and the radius of rotation (ROR) are previously determined using another method. When this assumption is made, it is possible to determine the rest of the calibration parameters using a single point source. A method that determines the electronic and mechanical shifts as well as the tilt has been previously described this method requires three point sources. It may be reasonable in most circumstances to calibrate tilt much less frequently than the mechanical shifts since the tilt is a property of the scanner whereas the mechanical shift may change every time the collimator is replaced. An alternative method for determining the ROR may also be used. Lastly, we take the view that the transverse electronic shift and the focal length change slowly and find these parameters independently.
