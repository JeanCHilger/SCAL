Radioimmunodetection and therapy of breast cancer. Breast cancer is the second most-common cause of cancer death in women in the United States. Although more than 60% of patients can now be cured by initial treatment, the rest, although perhaps receiving palliation with currently available therapy, will die of their disease. Early detection of micrometastasis and improved treatment strategies are needed. Monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based imaging and tumor targeted therapy holds the potential to impact these problems. The most significant results of systemically administered antibody-based radiopharmaceuticals for detection and targeted therapy (radioimmunotherapy [RIT]) of breast cancer give strong evidence that this potential can be realized. Interest in immunoimaging recently has focused on small mAb modules used with 18F, 64Cu, or 124I to detect minimal disease in breast cancer by positron emission tomography or single-photon emission computed tomography. Reported therapy trials in advanced breast cancer have yielded objective responses and minimal toxicity. These studies have spanned several radionuclides as well as several mAb, fragments and approaches, including dose intensification with bone marrow support combined therapy with other modalities (ie, CM-RIT)
