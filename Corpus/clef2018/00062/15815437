Anesthetic implications for children undergoing computerized tomography-guided stereotactic brain biopsy. Anesthesiologists spend much of their time administering anesthesia to children outside of the operating room, especially for neuroradiological evaluation. Neuroradiological procedures include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography, myelography, pneumoencephalography, and arteriography. Each of these procedures presents a "working environment" that compromises the ability to deliver a safe and well-monitored anesthetic (1). CT-guided stereotactic brain biopsy in children requires two anesthetic locations (2). The stereotactic guidance apparatus renders the airway inaccessible both during CT and during transport to the operating room. We report a case of a child undergoing CT-guided stereotactic brain biopsy to elucidate the anesthetic considerations of this logistically difficult procedure.
