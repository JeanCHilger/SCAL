Comparision of several different peritoneal fibrosis rat models. To compare different types of peritoneal fibrosis models in rats.Thirty-four SD rats were divided into 5 groups: control group (Group 1), normal saline group (Group 2), high glucose group (4.25% peritoneal dialysate, 4.25% PDF, Group 3), high glucose + lipopolysaceharides (LPS) group (4.25% PDF + LPS, Group 4), high glucose + erythromycin group (4.25% PDF + lactobionate erythromycin, Group 5). A 2-hour peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was performed after 5 weeks. Then animals were humanely killed. Dialysate-to-plasma urea ratio (D/ Purea), glucose reabsorption (D2/D0), net ultrafiltration (UF) volume were determined. The level of fibronectin in peritoneal tissues was measured by immunohistochemical method. Peritoneal membrane histology was evaluated by light microscopy.The D2/D0 ratio and net ultrafiltration volume in Groups 3, 4, and 5 were significantly lower than those in Groups 1 and 2 (P < 0.05) . The D/Purea ratio in Groups 3, 4 and 5 were significantly higher than that in Groups 1 and 2 (P < 0. 05 ). The level of fibronectin in Groups 3, 4 and 5 were significantly higher than that in Groups 1 and 2 (P < 0.05 ).Different types of peritoneal fibrosis models in rats has been established. The best model is high clusion glucose + erythromycin.
