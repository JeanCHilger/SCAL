Auditory cortical activation and speech perception in cochlear implant users: effects of implant experience and duration of deafness. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between outcome following cochlear implantation and auditory cortical activation. It also studied the effects of length of implant use and duration of deafness on the auditory cortical activations. Cortical activity resulting from auditory stimulation was measured using [(18)F]FDG positron emission tomography. In a group of 18 experienced adult cochlear implant users, we found a positive correlation between speech perception and activations in both the primary and association auditory cortices. This correlation was present in a subgroup of experienced implant users but absent in a group of new implant users with similar speech perception abilities. There was a significant negative correlation between duration of deafness and auditory cortical activation. This study gives insights into the relationship between implant speech perception and auditory cortical activation and the influence of duration of preceding deafness and implant experience.
