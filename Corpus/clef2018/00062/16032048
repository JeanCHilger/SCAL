Flatulence in pet dogs. The purpose of this study was to obtain information on aspects of dogs' lifestyle and diet that may be related to flatulence, whether the dogs were flatulent or not and if the owners were concerned about flatulence of their pet.The owners of 110 pet dogs were randomly selected from the Massey University clinic tiles and asked to complete a questionnaire relating to their dog's flatulence, lifestyle and diet.Flatulence was detected by 47 owners and occurred more often in less active inside dogs than those exercised more often. No individual food or dietary association was identified. Nineteen of the 47 owners of flatulent dogs would alter their dog's diet if that change would reduce flatulence.Flatulence occurs in pet dogs and most owners accept flatulence and were unconcerned about its consequence.
