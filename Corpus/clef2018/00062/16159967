Comparative effects of valsartan and enalapril on cardiac sympathetic nerve activity and plasma brain natriuretic peptide in patients with congestive heart failure. To evaluate the effects of valsartan on cardiac sympathetic nerve activity, plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration, cardiac function, and symptoms in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) by comparison with those of enalapril.50 patients with CHF (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40%) were randomly assigned to valsartan (80 mg/day n = 25) or enalapril (5 mg/dayIn patients receiving valsartan, TDS decreased from a mean (SD) of 43 (8) to 39 (10) (p < 0.01), H/M ratio increased from 1.70 (0.17) to 1.78 (0.22) (p < 0.05), washout rate decreased from 46 (11)% to 41 (10)% (p < 0.05), and plasma BNP concentration decreased from 237 (180) pg/ml to 143 (93) pg/ml (p < 0.05). In addition, LVEDV decreased from 172 (42) ml to 151 (45) ml (p < 0.05) and LVEF increased from 31 (7)% to 39 (10)% (p < 0.001). However, these parameters did not change significantly in patients receiving enalapril.Plasma BNP concentration and (123)I-MIBG scintigraphic and echocardiographic parameters improved significantly after six months of treatment with valsartan. These findings indicate that valsartan can improve cardiac sympathetic nerve activity and left ventricular performance in patients with CHF.
