MRS algorithm: a new method for searching myocardial region in SPECT myocardial perfusion images. First, the necessity of automatically segmenting myocardium from myocardial SPECT image is discussed in Section 1. To eliminate the influence of the background, the optimal threshold segmentation method modified for the MRS algorithm is explained in Section 2. Then, the image erosion structure is applied to identify the myocardium region and the liver region. The contour tracing method is introduced to extract the myocardial contour. To locate the centriod of the myocardium, the myocardial centriod searching method is developed. The protocol of the MRS algorithm is summarized in Section 6. The performance of the MRS algorithm is investigated and the conclusion is drawn in Section 7. Finally, the importance of the MRS algorithm and the improvement of the MRS algorithm are discussed.
