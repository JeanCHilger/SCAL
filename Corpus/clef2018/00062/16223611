PET/CT in oncology--a major advance. The concept of hardware fusion between positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) has only been introduced commercially in the last 4 years. The advantages of this combined technique over PET alone have become obvious. There is increasing evidence to suggest that PET/CT adds complementary information in staging, re-staging and follow-up in oncology patients, leading to changes in management plans. The present paper is a review of the strengths, weaknesses, current evidence and future directions of this technique.
