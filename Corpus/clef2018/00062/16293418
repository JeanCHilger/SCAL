Preparation of [61Cu]-2-acetylpyridine thiosemicarbazone complex as a possible PET tracer for malignancies. Due to the interesting anti-proliferative properties of copper-thiosemicarbazone complexes, the production of a (61)Cu-labeled thiosemicarbazone, i.e. 2-acetylpyridine thiosemicarbazone (APTS) was investigated. Copper-61 (T(1/2)=3.33 h) was produced via the (64)Zn(p,alpha)(61)Cu nuclear reaction using a natural zinc target irradiated with 22 MeV protons for 500 microAh. The (61)Cu was separated from the irradiated target material by a two-step method and converted to acetate this yielded a final activity of 222 GBq (6.0 Ci), with a radiochemical yield of >95%. The (61)Cu-acetate was mixed with 2-acetylpyridine thiosemicarbazone for 30 min at room temperature to yield [(61)Cu]APTS with a radiochemical yield of more than 80%. Colorimetric methods showed that residual chemical impurities in the product were below the accepted limits. Radio thin layer chromatography (RTLC) showed a radiochemical purity of more than 99% after C(18) column chromatography. A specific activity of about 370-740 MBq/mmol (10-20 Ci/mmol) was obtained. The stability of the final product was checked in the absence and presence of human serum at 37 degrees C for up to 3 h. The partition coefficient of the final complex was also determined.
