Radiosynthesis of (E)-N-(2-[11C]methoxybenzyl)-3-phenyl-acrylamidine, a novel subnanomolar NR2B subtype-selective NMDA receptor antagonist. Recently, a novel series of amidines has been described, exhibiting high NR2B-subtype selective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist activity with nanomolar or subnanomolar affinity. Within the styrylamidine subclass, (E)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-3-phenyl-acrylamidine (1), displayed the highest affinity (Ki=0.7 nM versus [(3)H]ifenprodil) and was considered an appropriate candidate for isotopic labelling with carbon-11 (T(1/2): 20.38 min) at its methoxy group for imaging of NMDA receptors with PET. Derivative 1 has been labelled from the corresponding nor-analogue using [(11)C]methyl triflate and the following experimental conditions : (1) trapping at -10 degrees C of [(11)C]methyl triflate in 300 microL of acetone containing 0.6-0.8 mg of precursor 5 (2.4-3.2 micromol) and 5 microL of a 3M solution of NaOH in water (about 5 eq.) (2) concentration to dryness of the reaction mixture (at 110 degrees C, using a helium stream for 1-2 min)
