Design considerations for PET/CT tomographs. Recent advances in 3D detector technology, signal processing, ergonomics and clinical application software support the increasing acceptance of PET and PET/CT as a diagnostic tool in clinical practice. The GEMINI GXL family of PET/CT tomographs integrates these improvements to offer consistently high quality PET/CT imaging to all patients, regardless of weight and girth, in the shortest possible study times.
