Effects of intracoronary autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells transplantation in patients with anterior myocardial infarction. To investigate the efficacy of intracoronary transfer of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (ABMMNCs) to patients with myocardial infarction (MI) on left ventricular function and myocardial perfusion.Thirty-five patients with MI (> 4 weeks) were enrolled in this prospective, open-labeled study (20 patients in cell transplantation group 15 patients in control group). All patients were treated by standard drug therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Baseline and 3 months follow-up evaluations included complete clinical and laboratory examinations, six minutes walk test, echocardiography, Dual-isotope simultaneous acquisition single photon emission computed tomography (DISA-SPECT) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Baseline parameters were similar between the two groups. NYHA classification and six minutes walk test at 3 months follow-up were also similar between the two groups. However, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) determined by echocardiography and DISA-SPECT was significantly higher regional wall motion measured by echocardiography and cardiac MRI, myocardial viability and myocardial perfusion in the infarct zone assessed by DISA-SPECT were all significantly improved than before transplantation and than that in control group at 3 months follow-up.Our results indicate that intracoronary transplantation of ABMMNCs could improve the left ventricular systolic function and beneficially affect myocardial perfusion up to 3 months post transplantation in patients with myocardial infarction.
