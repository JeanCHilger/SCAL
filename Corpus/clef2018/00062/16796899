Relationship between polymorphisms of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter gene and pulmonary thromboembolism in Chinese Han population. To determine the prevalence of polymorphisms in the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter 4G/5G polymorphisms in Chinese Han population and to investigate whether they are associated with pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE).Samples of peripheral venous blood were collected from 101 patients with PTE diagnosed by high probability of lung ventilation/perfusion scan and/or multi-slice CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) as well as medical history and clinical manifestations, 67 males and 34 females, aged 48 +/- 15, and 101 age and sex-matched healthy controls from the same geographic area as controls. The genome DNA was extracted from the whole blood using potassium iodide-phenol-chloroform method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), and sequence analysis were used to screen the single nucleotide polymorphisms and the genotype distribution of -675 4G/5G located in the promoter region of the PAI-1 gene.The frequencies of the allele 4G of PAI-1 gene in the controls were 0.495, significantly lower than in the PTE patients (0.733, chi(2) = 24.060, P < 0.01). The frequencies of the allele 5G of PAI-1 gene in the controls were 0.505, significantly higher than that in the PET patients. The genotype frequency of 4G4G of the PET patients was 57.4%, significantly higher than that of the controls (30.7%, P = 0.000). The genotype frequencies of 4G5G and 5G5G of the PET patients were 31.7% and 10.9% respectively, not significantly different from those of the controls (37.6 and 31.7% respectively). The presence of 4G allele of PAI-1 gene was found to be a greater risk factor for PTE. In comparison with the controls, the OR of 4G4G + 4G5G, 4G4G, and 4G5G in the PET patients were 3.794 (1.786 - 8.060), 5.443 (2.416 - 12.260), and 2.450 (1.067 - 5.623) respectively with the P values of 0.001, 0.000, and 0.035 respectively.The 4G/5G and 4G/4G genotypes are associated with the pathogenesis of PET.T.
