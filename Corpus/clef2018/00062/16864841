Identification of subgroups in amnestic mild cognitive impairment. The DMS48 is a visual recognition memory test designed to detect memory changes in early Alzheimer disease (AD). Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) who succeeded on this task exhibited frontal hypoperfusion on SPECT. In contrast, failure was associated with temporomesial and temporoparietal hypoperfusion, a pattern usually described in the early stages of AD. It may possible to detect patients at high risk for AD within a population of aMCI.
