Cardiac [123I]metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy for vascular Parkinsonism. The purpose of our study was to prospectively evaluate cardiac [(123)I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake in patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD) who develop clinical symptoms of vascular Parkinsonism (VP). A total of 19 consecutive patients who developed Parkinsonism during the course of their CVD were enrolled in the study 16 age-matched subjects, and 30 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were also evaluated with cardiac MIBG uptake. MIBG uptake was assessed using the ratio of the heart to the upper mediastinum (H/M) according to planar scintigraphic data. The mean H/M ratio was significantly higher in patients with VP than in those with PD (2.28 +/- 0.41 vs. 1.27 +/- 0.13
