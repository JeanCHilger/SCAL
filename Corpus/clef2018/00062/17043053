Takayasu's arteritis--recent advances in imaging offer promise. Takayasu's arteritis (TA), a rare large vessel vasculitis of unknown aetiology, remains a difficult disease to manage with diagnosis often delayed until the late occlusive stage when irreversible vascular damage has occurred. Recent studies suggest that non-invasive imaging modalities including magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) allow diagnosis of TA earlier in the disease course than standard angiography and provide a means for monitoring disease activity. Choice of appropriate therapy for TA is limited by a lack of evidence and a combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs is most commonly used. Novel therapeutic approaches such as the use of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors and drug-eluting arterial stents show promise for improving the prognosis in severe disease. In addition, strict management of traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension and lifestyle factors is mandatory to minimize secondary cardiovascular complications, which are the major cause of death in this disease.
