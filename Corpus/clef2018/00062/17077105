Subthalamic stimulation modulates cortical control of urinary bladder in Parkinson's disease. Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective therapy for off-period motor symptoms and dyskinesias in advanced Parkinson's disease. Clinical studies have shown that STN-DBS also ameliorates urinary bladder function in Parkinson's disease patients by delaying the first desire to void and increasing bladder capacity. This study aimed at investigating the effect of STN-DBS on the neural mechanisms underlying cerebral bladder control. Using PET to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), 11 patients with bilateral STN-DBS were studied during urodynamic bladder filling in STN-DBS ON and OFF condition. A filled bladder led to a significant increase of rCBF in the anterior cingulate cortex, which was further enhanced during STN-DBS OFF. A significant interaction between bladder state and STN-DBS was observed in lateral frontal cortex with increased rCBF when the bladder was filled during STN-DBS OFF. The data suggest that STN-DBS ameliorates bladder dysfunction and that this modulation may result from facilitated processing of afferent bladder information.
