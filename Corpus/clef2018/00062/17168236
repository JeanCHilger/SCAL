Diagnosis and staging of carcinoma of the pancreas (I). Carcinoma of the pancreas is a neoplasm with a poor prognosis that is diagnosed in the advanced stages in most patients. Given that surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for this disease, it is of the utmost importance to appropriately select the group of patients with initial stage pancreatic tumors that have not extended and can therefore be resected. Several different imaging techniques can be used for this purpose: ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), as well as the recent additions of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and positron emission tomography (PET). Other techniques, such as laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography, also play a role in the diagnosis and staging of these patients. Continual technological developments in each of the above-mentioned techniques have led to reiterated updates in the scientific literature throughout the last two decades. This review aims to evaluate each of these techniques and present diagnostic algorithms reflected in the literature in order to achieve the greatest diagnostic accuracy in determining the extent of the disease so that unnecessary surgery can be avoided in cases not susceptible to resection.
