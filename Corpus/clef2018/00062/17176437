Production, characterization, and applications of two novel monoclonal antibodies against human interleukin-28A. Interleukin-28A (IL-28A) is a novel cytokine discovered in recent years and has been shown to have antiviral activity. In this study, IL-28A complementary DNA was inserted into prokaryotic expression vector pET-44 Ek/LIC. The Nus-S-His-tagged IL-28A fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) in the soluble fraction. The fusion protein was purified by S-protein agarose affinity chromatography, and the fusion tag was removed from recombinant IL-28A by cleavage with thrombin. To prepare specific monoclonal antibody against human IL-28A, BALB/c mice were immunized with IL-28A, and hybridoma cell lines were obtained by fusing mouse spleen cells with myeloma NS-1 cells. Two strains of hybridoma cells, which produced the anti-human IL-28A antibodies 1B9 and 4B5 were obtained. They are IgM isotype and working in western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In the present study, it was shown for the first time that human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with interferon-alpha and poly(I:C) express IL-28A protein assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining techniques. Immunohistochemistry showed that macrophage-like cells in colon and lung tissue and alveolar epithelial cells in lung tissue contain IL-28A, indicating a novel mechanism for both cell types to carry out their antivirus or antitumor functions.
