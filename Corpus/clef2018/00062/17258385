Detection rate and operating time required for gamma probe-guided sentinel lymph node resection after injection of technetium-99m nanocolloid into the prostate with and without preoperative imaging. To investigate the usefulness of presurgical image fusion of three-dimensional single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) for detecting primary prostatic lymphatic landing sites (sentinel lymph nodes [SLNs]) using an intraoperative gamma probe in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for organ-confined prostate cancer after intraprostatic (99m)Tc-nanocolloid injection.In 15 patients the surgeon was unaware of the preoperative SPECT/CT/MRI fusion imaging results. In 21 patients the surgeon was supported by the preoperative SPECT/CT/MRI images. Selective SLN resection was followed by an extended backup pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) and radical prostatectomy.In the group of 15 patients (gamma probe-guided SLN search only) presurgical SPECT/CT/MRI identified 137 SLNs (median of 10/patient range: 2-19) and a total of 135 SLNs (median of 8/patientPreoperative SPECT/CT/MRI is highly reliable to detect nonmetastatic sentinel nodes of the prostate. The operating time for SPECT/CT/MRI-supported SLN resection is significantly reduced compared to SLN resection guided by gamma probe alone. Both procedures take significantly longer than routine extended PLND.
