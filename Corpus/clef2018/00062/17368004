Stereoselective neuroimaging in vivo. Stereoselectivity is a basic property of many neuronal processes due to the spatial features of molecules involved in neurotransmission. Today, neuroimaging procedures are available for studying stereoselectivity in the living brain. Mirror-image radiotracers are the molecular tools that are used, together with single photon emission tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), for studying stereoselective neuronal mechanisms. This review presents the findings obtained in those studies of cholinergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, glutamatergic, opioid, cannabinoid, and second messenger neurotransmission.
