Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy using 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma. Several new somatostatin analogues have been developed for the diagnosis and therapy of different tumours. Since somatostatin receptors are often over-expressed in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), the aim of our study was to evaluate the utility of scintigraphy with the somatostatin analogue (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC in MTC in comparison with other diagnostic techniques.Forty-five patients with MTC, aged 14-83 years, were investigated. Scintigraphy using (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC (Tektrotyd) was performed 2 and 4 h post injection of 740 MBq (20 mCi) of the tracer. Other imaging techniques were also applied and analysed in individual cases (ultrasonography, computed tomography, (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA, (131)I-MIBG, (99m)Tc-MDP, (111)In-DTPA-octreotide and (18)F-FDG-PET) and compared with (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC.In group 1 (eight patients before thyroidectomy), uptake of the tracer was found in the primary tumours. In group 2 (six patients with remission), a false positive result was found in one patient in the remaining five patients, no pathological foci were visualised. In group 3 (31 patients with post-surgical hypercalcitoninaemia), scintigraphy was true positive in 23 patients (74.2%): uptake in the thyroid bed was found in five patients, in the lymph nodes in 18 and in bone metastases in four. Using (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy, the overall sensitivity was 79.5%, specificity 83.3%, accuracy 80.0%, positive predictive value 96.9% and negative predictive value 38.5%.(99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC is clinically useful for scintigraphy in the follow-up of patients with MTC. It can be used in clinical practice for preoperative evaluation, for localisation of local recurrence or distant metastases and particularly for therapy decision making.
