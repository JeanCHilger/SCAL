Myocardial contractility evaluation by radionuclide 4D-tomoventriculography in patients with ischemic heart disease. To estimate the capabilities of the new technique radionuclide 4D-tomoventriculography (4D-RTVG) versus conventional methods, such as radionuclide equilibrium ventriculography (REVG), ECG-synchronized single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), and echocardiography (EchoCG), in the evaluation of systolic and diastolic dysfunction in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).The study included 29 patients (19 males and 10 females) aged 43 to 66 years who had CHD. The diagnosis of CHD was established on the basis of coronary angiographic findings when the signs of coronary atherosclerosis were found. All the patients underwent 4D-RTVG, REVG, myocardial ECG-synchronized SPECT, and Echo CG.There was a strong correlation of the values obtained by 4D-RTVG versus REVG and EchoCG when ejection fraction and left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume and the indices reflecting LV blood filling and ejection velocity were estimated. The correlation between the values provided by 4D-RTVG and myocardial ECG-synchronized SPECT females was slightly weaker.The findings suggest that 4D-RTVG is highly reliable in evaluating both LV systolic and diastolic functions. That fact the technique is easy-to-use and mini-invasive shows that it may be clinically applied.
