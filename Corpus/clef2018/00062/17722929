Nanosized (mu12-Pt)Pd164-xPtx(CO)72(PPh3)20 (x approximately 7) containing Pt-centered four-shell 165-atom Pd-Pt core with unprecedented intershell bridging carbonyl ligands: comparative analysis of icosahedral shell-growth patterns with geometrically related Pd145(CO)x(PEt3)30 (x approximately 60) containing capped three-shell Pd145 core. Presented herein are the preparation and crystallographic/microanalytical/magnetic/spectroscopic characterization of the Pt-centered four-shell 165-atom Pd-Pt cluster, (mu(12)-Pt)Pd(164-x)Pt(x)(CO)(72)(PPh(3))(20) (x approximately 7), 1, that replaces the geometrically related capped three-shell icosahedral Pd(145) cluster, Pd(145)(CO)(x)(PEt(3))(30) (x approximately 60), 2, as the largest crystallographically determined discrete transition metal cluster with direct metal-metal bonding. A detailed comparison of their shell-growth patterns gives rise to important stereochemical implications concerning completely unexpected structural dissimilarities as well as similarities and provides new insight concerning possible synthetic approaches for generation of multi-shell metal clusters. 1 was reproducibly prepared in small yields (<10%) from the reaction of Pd(10)(CO)(12)(PPh(3))(6) with Pt(CO)(2)(PPh(3))(2). Its 165-atom metal-core geometry and 20 PPh(3) and 72 CO ligands were established from a low-temperature (100 K) CCD X-ray diffraction study. The well-determined crystal structure is attributed largely to 1 possessing cubic T(h) (2/m3) site symmetry, which is the highest crystallographic subgroup of the noncrystallographic pseudo-icosahedral I(h) (2/m35) symmetry. The "full" four-shell Pd-Pt anatomy of 1 consists of: (a) shell 1 with the centered (mu(12)-Pt) atom encapsulated by the 12-atom icosahedral Pt(x)Pd(12-x) cage, x = 1.2(3) (b) shell 2 with the 42-atom nu(2) icosahedral Pt(x)Pd(42-x) cage, x = 3.5(5)
