Neuroimaging of language and aphasia after stroke. Over the past 25 years, neuroimaging techniques have advanced rapidly. These techniques, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography, have improved our understanding of the relationships of language, language disorder, and brain language organization. In this article, we review the contribution of these neuroimaging techniques to the fields of brain language function and speech-language disorders after ischemic stroke. We also discuss the future of these techniques in the research and clinical arenas of ischemic stroke and aphasia rehabilitation.
