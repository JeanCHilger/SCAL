SPECT neuroimaging in translational research of CNS disorders. High resolution SPECT imaging is an emerging field and there are only limited studies as yet available in this direction. Still there is continuous effort to achieve better spatial and temporal resolution in order to obtain detailed structural and functional information of different brain regions in small experimental animals. Recently, SPECT imaging system has been used to perform in vivo imaging using specific radioligands to further elucidate the role of dopaminergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic neurotransmission in relation to regional cerebral blood flow in various human CNS disorders and in gene-manipulated mouse models of neurodegeneration. Although in vivo and non-invasive translational research can be performed by high-resolution microPET imaging system, its limited spatial resolution restricts detailed anatomical and functional information of different brain regions involved in disease process. Recently developed NanoSPECT/CT imaging system has a better spatial resolution hence can be used to correlate and confirm microPET imaging data and determine the precise structural and functional anatomy of CNS disorders and their remission. Moreover SPECT imaging system reduces the cost and number of animals and provides detailed information of CNS disorders at the cellular, molecular and genetic level. Furthermore, SPECT system is economical, provides less radiation burden, and can be used to study bio-distribution of newly synthesized radioligands with increased target to non-target ratios, quality control, and clinical applications. It is envisaged that high-resolution SPECT imaging system will further improve in vivo non-invasive translational research on CNS disorders of unknown etiopathogenesis and their treatment in future.
