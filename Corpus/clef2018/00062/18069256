Classification, staging and prognostic indices for multiple myeloma. The monoclonal gammopathies are a group of heterogeneous disorders associated with monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells. The International Myeloma Working Group proposed the new criteria for diagnosis and classification based on routinely available examinations. According to the criteria, symptomatic myeloma requires evidence of an M -protein in serum and urine, bone marrow plasmacytosis and related end -organ damage. The International staging system (ISS) has been described to estimate prognosis using serum beta-2 microglobulin and serum albumin. The Durie/Salmon plus staging system has also been developed by use of PET/MRI imaging. The use of these staging systems will facilitate available prognostic factors may allow better definition of prognosis.
