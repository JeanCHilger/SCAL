Predicting the need for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator using cardiac metaiodobenzylguanidine activity together with plasma natriuretic peptide concentration or left ventricular function. Despite widespread use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), their cost and the fact that only a certain group of patients fully benefits from the devices require appropriate risk stratification of patients. This study investigated whether altered cardiac autonomic function is associated with the occurrence of ICD discharge or lethal cardiac events.Fifty-four ICD-treated patients were prospectively followed after assessment of cardiac metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) activity, quantified as the heart-to-mediastinum ratio (HMR), plasma concentration of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the presence (group A, n = 21) or absence (group B, n = 33) of appropriate ICD discharge during a 15-mo period.Group A had a significantly lower level of MIBG activity and a higher plasma BNP level than did group B. Univariate analysis revealed BNP level, any medication, and late HMR to be significant predictors, and multivariate analysis showed late HMR to be an independent predictor. An HMR of less than 1.95 with a plasma BNP level of more than 187 pg/mL or an LVEF of less than 50% had significantly increased power to predict ICD shock: positive predictive values, 82% (HMR + BNP) and 58% (HMR + LVEF) negative predictive values, 73% (HMR + BNP) and 77% (HMR + LVEF)When combined with plasma BNP concentration or cardiac function, cardiac MIBG activity is closely related to lethal cardiac events and can be used to identify patients who would benefit most from an ICD.
