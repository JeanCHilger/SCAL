Serial changes in left ventricular size after acute myocardial infarction. The prognosis is poor for patients with left ventricular enlargement associated with large infarcts. We studied 78 patients using gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT, to assess left ventricular volumes), right heart catheterization (to measure pulmonary wedge pressure and cardiac output), and conventional planar radionuclide ventriculography (to estimate ejection fraction), 2-6 days, 3-5 weeks, and 5-8 months after their first myocardial infarction. Patients were assigned to a large or small infarct-size group based on creatine kinase analysis. In 37 patients with large infarcts, left ventricular volume increased and was greater than 27% after 5-8 months than after 2-6 days (p less than 0.05). Although ejection fraction remained significantly depressed, stroke volume, which initially declined, was restored as a result of dilation and thus returned to normal by 3-5 weeks, indicating that enlargement of the left ventricle compensated for the loss of contractile myocardium and depression of global ejection fraction. The progressive nature of left ventricular dilation suggested that this process is of major pathophysiologic importance and that it plays an etiologic role in the genesis of heart failure and perhaps of sudden death following myocardial infarction. Dilation preceded hemodynamic deterioration, which became evident on exercise after 5-8 months in patients with large infarcts.
