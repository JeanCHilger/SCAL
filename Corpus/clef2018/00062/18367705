Metabolic abnormalities associated with mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease. To use (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and PET to investigate changes in regional metabolism associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Parkinson disease (PD). Cognitive abnormalities are common in PD. However, little is known about the functional abnormalities that underlie the manifestations of MCI in this disorder.We used FDG PET to measure regional glucose metabolism in patients with PD with multiple-domain MCI (MD-MCI n = 18), with single-domain MCI (SD-MCISPM revealed decreased prefrontal and parietal metabolism (p < 0.001) in MD-MCI relative to N-MCI, as well as an increase in brainstem/cerebellar metabolism (p < 0.001) in this group. In these regions, SD-MCI occupied an intermediate position between the two other groups. PDCP expression was abnormally elevated in the N-, SD-, and MD-MCI groups (p < 0.05), increasing stepwise with worsening cognitive impairment (p < 0.01).Early cognitive decline in Parkinson disease as defined by mild cognitive impairment is associated with discrete regional changes and abnormal metabolic network activity. The quantification of these alterations with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET may allow for the objective assessment of the progression and treatment of this disease manifestation.
