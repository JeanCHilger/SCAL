Comparison of 18F-FDG PET and MRI in assessment of uterine smooth muscle tumors. The purpose of this study was to prospectively determine whether combined MRI and (18)F-FDG PET is more accurate than MRI in assessing nonbenign uterine smooth muscle tumors (USMTs).Seventy patients (mean age, 49+/-10 y range, 28-77 y) suspected of having nonbenign USMTs underwent both MRI and (18)F-FDG PET before surgery. Results were evaluated using receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analyses and the Cochran Q test.The area under the ROC curve for MRI with (18)F-FDG PET was significantly higher than that for MRI (0.97 vs. 0.89, P<0.05). Although multiple comparisons using the Cochran Q test were not significant, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for MRI with (18)F-FDG PET with probable nonbenign USMT cases considered to be positive were higher than those for MRI (93.3% vs. 73.3% 92.7% vs. 85.5%MRI with (18)F-FDG PET is useful in assessing nonbenign USMTs, as compared with MRI.
