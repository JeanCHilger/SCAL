Increased serotonin and dopamine transporter binding in psychotropic medication-naive patients with generalized social anxiety disorder shown by 123I-beta-(4-iodophenyl)-tropane SPECT. There is circumstantial evidence for the involvement of serotonergic and dopaminergic systems in the pathophysiology of social anxiety disorder. In the present study, using SPECT imaging we examined the (123)I-beta-(4-iodophenyl)-tropane binding potential for the serotonin and dopamine transporters in patients with a generalized social anxiety disorder and in age- and sex-matched healthy controls.Twelve psychotropic medication-na√Øve patients with social anxiety disorder, generalized type (5 women and 7 men) and 12 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were studied. Volumes of interest were constructed on MRI-coregistered SPECT scans. Binding ratios were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Possible correlations between binding patterns and symptomatology were assessed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.Significantly higher binding potentials were found for the serotonin in the left and right thalamus of patients. Patients had also a significantly higher binding potential for the dopamine transporter in the striatum.The present study provided direct evidence for abnormalities in both the dopaminergic and the serotonergic systems in patients with generalized social anxiety disorder.
