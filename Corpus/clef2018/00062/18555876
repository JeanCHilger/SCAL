Progressive anarthria: an individual entity. First described 15 years ago, primary progressive anarthria is a focal cortical atrophy defined as a rare progressive impairment of speech associated with orofacial apraxia and leading to mutism with a frontal lobe syndrome. The aim of this study was to analyze clinical and neuropsychological data and results of complementary tests in a series of patients presented with primary progressive anarthria.We, retrospectively, studied five patients with primary progressive anarthria. We particularly analyzed the following parameters: age at onset, age at the diagnostic, disease time from onset to first consultation, the initial orientation, the neuropsychological and clinical data at the first visit, electromyography, brain MRI, and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) findings. Clinical and neuropsychological data were used to monitor disease course.The mean age at onset of symptoms was 75.2+/-5.8 years. Patients were primarily referred to a specialist in memory disease (n=3) or a specialist in motor neuron disease (n=2). The time from onset to first consultation was 11.2+/-3 months. Anarthria was associated with dysexecutive syndrome and sometimes, with impaired comprehension. Electromyography was always normal. Cranial MRI showed temporal or left frontal atrophy (n=3). Spect revealed decreased cerebral blood flow predominating in the left frontal or temporal region (n=4).Long delay for specialist consultation and inadequate initial orientation retard disease diagnosis, leading to severe incapacity. Complementary studies are required to confirm diagnostic and to rule out lateral amyotrophic sclerosis. During the early stages, involvement of the premotor cortex may be considered due to the speech apraxia. Secondary motor orofacial disturbances suggest an extension to the motor cortex. Primary progressive anarthria is a distinct individual entity within the spectrum of focal cortical atrophies.
