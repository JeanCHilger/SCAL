Prognosis after temporal lobe epilepsy surgery: the value of combining predictors. Although several independent predictors of seizure freedom after temporal lobe epilepsy surgery have been identified, their combined predictive value is largely unknown. Using a large database of operated patients, we assessed the combined predictive value of previously reported predictors included in a single multivariable model.The database comprised a cohort of 484 patients who underwent temporal lobe surgery for drug-resistant epilepsy. Good outcome was defined as Engel class 1, one year after surgery. Previously reported independent predictors were tested in this cohort. To be included in our final prediction model, predictors had to show a multivariable p-value of <0.20.The final multivariable model included predictors obtained from the patient's history (absence of tonic-clonic seizures, absence of status epilepticus), magnetic resonance imaging [MRI ipsilateral mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), space occupying lesion], video electroencephalography (EEGWe could only moderately predict seizure freedom after temporal lobe epilepsy surgery. It is particularly difficult to predict who will not become seizure-free after surgery.
