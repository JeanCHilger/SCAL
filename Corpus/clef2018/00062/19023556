Pathological changes of the hypopharynx in the focus of imaging. The spectrum of pathological changes in anatomical sections of the hypopharynx ranges from benign pathologies to hypopharyngeal carcinoma. Beside the clinical status and the endoscopic evaluation performed by ear, nose and throat specialists, imaging techniques play an important role in pre-therapeutic and post-therapeutic diagnostics and in the follow-up of pharyngeal disease patterns, especially for malignant lesions. A conventional x-ray swallow examination, contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as positron emission tomography (PET) and positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) are applied depending on the medical question and disease. Especially in radiological oncology, it is extremely important in regions which are clinically difficult to assess to determine the exact localization and extent of hypopharyngeal pathologies to plan the optimal therapy for the patient. This article demonstrates the radiological appearance of pathological changes of the hypopharynx and discusses in particular the hypopharynx carcinoma in the focus of pre-therapeutic and post-therapeutic imaging.
