Radiospirometry V/Q. Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) of the lungs was used for topographical determination of V/Q ratios in anaesthetized-paralyzed subjects. Ventilation and perfusion were estimated from the distribution of an inhaled aerosol containing a radioactive isotope and injected macroaggregates of human albumin tagged with another isotope. There was a prominent gradient of V/Q ratios in the vertical direction. In the horizontal plane there were marked gradients of both ventilation and perfusion of similar appearance with maxima in central lung regions, resulting in only small gradients of V/Q ratios.
