Physician ownership and use of in-office advanced diagnostic imaging equipment: are IDTF standards a meaningful response to overutilization, quality, and costs? The increase of physician ownership and use of in-office advanced diagnostic imaging equipment (magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and computed axial tomography) has led to concerns about overuse, quality, and increased costs. The requirement that a physician or non-physician practitioner furnishing diagnostic testing services (1) enroll as an independent diagnostic testing facility (IDTF) for each practice location furnishing these services and (2) comply with the performance standards of 42 C.F.R. section 410.33 would represent a major step toward curbing potential advanced diagnostic imaging self-referral overutilization, improving quality, and lowering costs.
