Cisplatin-based chemotherapy for advanced seminoma: report of 52 cases treated in two institutions. We evaluated an intensified therapeutic strategy in order to optimize treatment outcomes while maintaining acceptable toxicity in patients with advanced seminoma.Fifty-two patients with advanced pure seminoma were retrospectively evaluated. Patients with low-risk advanced seminoma, according to the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group Consensus Classification criteria, had received four cycles of the BEP regimen either in the 5-day or the alternative 3-day schedule, while patients with intermediate-risk advanced seminoma had received four cycles of the IBEP regimen.Forty-two patients (80.7%) had testicular seminoma while ten patients (19.3%) presented with primary extragonadal (mediastinal or retroperitoneal) tumor. Forty-seven (90.8%) patients belonged to the low-risk group and five patients (9.2%) to the intermediate-risk group. Treatment-related toxicity was moderate, with febrile neutropenia being the most prevalent (13.5%). Twenty patients (38.5%) achieved a complete response to chemotherapy. Twenty-three from the remaining 32 patients had residual masses more than 3 cm and were submitted to surgery (2 patients), FDG-PET scan (8 patients) or surveillance (13 patients). After 69 months of follow-up there were three recurrences that were successfully treated with high-dose or salvage chemotherapy. No death by any cause was recorded.Intensified cisplatin-based chemotherapy for patients with advanced seminoma does not confer evidence of superiority over radiotherapy alone or the standard BEP regimen. Patients with low-volume abdominal disease (clinical stage IIA and IIB) can be cured by four cycles of BEP instead of radiotherapy at the cost of a substantial increase in chemotherapy exposure and the resulting toxicity.
