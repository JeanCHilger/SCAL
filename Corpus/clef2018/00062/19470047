Myocardial perfusion is preserved in patients with psoriasis without clinically evident cardiovascular disease. Psoriasis is associated with a premature atherosclerosis due to the chronic inflammatory process. To evaluate the effect of disease process on myocardial perfusion, we planned to perform 99mTc-MIBI myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with psoriasis.The study group consisted of 28 psoriasis patients (17 men, 11 women), aged 18-76 years, and mean age 41.2 +/- 14.1 years. The patients were selected among those who were older than 18 years and longer than 10 years of disease duration with more than two times of systemic treatment. All patients underwent 99mTc-MIBI myocardial perfusion SPECT with the same day protocol.We detected various risk factors including smoking habits in 7, family history of cardiovascular disease in 4, hypertension in 1, hyperlipidemia in 9 patients. We completed myocardial perfusion SPECT for each patient and found normal perfusion pattern in SPECT images.We detected that myocardial perfusion is preserved in the patients with psoriasis. The majority of acute heart attacks are caused by noncritical coronary stenosis and this may be an explanation for increased cardiovascular risk in these patients despite normal coronary perfusion.
