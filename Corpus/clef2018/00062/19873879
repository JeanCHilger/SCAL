Construction of immune library of murine immunoglobulin genes and screening of single-chain Fv-antibodies specific to diphtheria toxin B subunit. The aim of this work was to obtain the panel of recombinant single-chain Fv-antibodies against diphtheria toxin B subunit, the main diagnostic and pathogenic antigen of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. For this purpose we have constructed the immune library of murine immunoglobulin genes. A number of scFv specific to diphtheria toxin B subunit were acquired from the obtained library after one round of selection by phage-display. ScFv encoding DNA-fragments of eight clones were subcloned into plasmid pET-22b(+). It was shown that selected scFv were highly specific to diphtheria toxin B subunit, with affinity constant for different clones ranged from 10(7) to 10(9) M(-1).
