Catalysis of fluorine addition to double bond: an improvement of method for synthesis of (18)F PET agents. Catalysis for reaction of electrophilic fluorine addition to a fluorinated double bond is described. The presence of small amounts of iodine, bromine, or boron trifluoride increases an overall product yield and degree of fluorine incorporation, making the reaction a more efficient method for preparation of (18)F positron emission tomography agents. A possible mechanism of catalytic action of iodine is discussed.
