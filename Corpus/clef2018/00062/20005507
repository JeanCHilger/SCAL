Maternal and neonatal morbidities associated with obstructive sleep apnea complicating pregnancy. The objective of the study was to estimate the maternal and neonatal morbidities associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy.Women delivering between 2000-2008 with confirmed OSA in an academic center were included. Normal-weight and obese controls were randomly selected at a 2:1 ratio. Maternal and neonatal morbidities were compared between the groups. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate maternal morbidity and preterm birth (PTB).The analysis included 57 pregnancies complicated by OSA. Compared with normal-weight (n = 114) controls, OSA patients had more preeclampsia (PET) (19.3% vs 7.0% P = .02) and PTB (29.8% vs 12.3%Pregnancies complicated by OSA are at increased risk for preeclampsia, medical complications, and indicated PTB.
