Selective manipulation of ICT and PET Processes in styryl-Bodipy derivatives: applications in molecular logic and fluorescence sensing of metal ions. Remarkably versatile chemistry of Bodipy dyes allows the design and straightforward synthesis of multivalent-multitopic derivatives, which, with judicious selection of metal ion-ligand pairs based on known affinities, affords control and manipulation of photoinduced electron transfer and internal charge transfer processes as desired. We have demonstrated that metal ions acting as modulators (or inputs, in digital design parlance) can generate absorbance changes in accordance with the operation of a half-adder. In addition, an AND logic gate in the emission mode was delivered using a different binucleating arrangement of ligands. A molecular equivalent of a three-input AND logic gate was also obtained exploiting differential binding affinities of metal ions for different ligands. The results suggest that different metal ions can be used as nonannihilating inputs, selectively targeting various ligands incorporated within a single fluorophore, and with careful design, diverse photophysical processes can be selectively modulated, resulting in a range of signals, useful in molecular logic design, and offering an enticing potential for multianalyte chemosensors.
