Preoperative [18F]FDG PET/CT maximum standardized uptake value predicts recurrence of uterine cervical cancer. To determine if preoperative [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT imaging has prognostic significance in patients with uterine cervical cancer.Patients with FIGO stage IB to IIA cervical cancer were imaged with integrated FDG PET/CT before radical surgery. The relationship between the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) of FDG in the primary tumour during PET/CT and recurrence was examined.Included in the study were 75 patients. Medical records including clinical data, treatment modalities, and treatment results were retrospectively reviewed. The median duration of follow-up was 13 months (range 3 to 58 months) after treatment. Median preoperative SUV(max) values in the primary tumours were significantly higher in patients with higher FIGO stages (p = 0.0149), pelvic lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0068), parametrial involvement (p = 0.0002), large (>4 cm) tumour size (p = 0.0022), presence of lymphovascular space invasion (p = 0.0055), and deep cervical stromal invasion (p < 0.0001). In univariate analysis, lymph node metastasis, parametrial invasion, presence of lymphovascular space invasion, and preoperative SUV(max) (uncategorized values) in the primary tumour were significantly associated with recurrence. However, in multivariate analysis, preoperative SUV(max) (p = 0.014, HR 1.178, 95% CI 1.034-1.342), age (p = 0.021, HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.772-0.980), and parametrial involvement (p = 0.040, HR 27.974, 95% CI 1.156-677.043) by primary tumour were significantly associated with recurrence.Preoperative FDG uptake by the primary tumour showed a significant association with recurrence in patients with uterine cervical cancer.
