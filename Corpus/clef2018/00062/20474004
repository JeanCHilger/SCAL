Preoperative estimation of remnant hepatic function using fusion images obtained by (99m)Tc-labelled galactosyl-human serum albumin liver scintigraphy and computed tomography. Assessment of hepatic functional reserve is important in hepatic resection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) analysis in the preoperative estimation of remnant liver function in liver surgery.One hundred and one patients undergoing hepatic resection for liver tumours were studied. Seventeen patients had preoperative percutaneous transhepatic portal vein embolization (PTPE). Function of the hepatic remnant was estimated before surgery using radioactivity in fusion images of both liver single-photon emission computed tomography and computed tomography scans using (99m)Tc-labelled diethylene triamine penta-acetate-galactosyl-human serum albumin.All three patients with an ASGP-R concentration below 400 nmol/l and preoperative total amount of receptor in the future remnant liver (R0-remnant) of less than 53.0 nmol per liver died. Two patients with chronic hepatitis and R0-remnant values between 53.0 and 65.0 nmol per liver and a receptor concentration lower than 600 nmol/l developed liver dysfunction. The incidence of liver failure decreased inversely with increasing R0-remnant value.A combination of receptor concentration and the amount of hepatic receptor in the future liver remnant as detected on fusion images is useful in evaluating the risk of postoperative liver failure.
