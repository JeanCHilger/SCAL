A non-local means approach for PET image denoising. Denoising is an important issue for medical image processing. Based on the analysis of the Non-local means algorithm recently reported by Buades A, et al. in international journals we herein propose adapting it for PET image denoising. Experimental de-noising results for real clinical PET images show that Non-local means method is superior to median filtering and wiener filtering methods and it can suppress noise in PET images effectively and preserve important details of structure for diagnosis.
