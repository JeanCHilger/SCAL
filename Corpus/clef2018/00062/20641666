 Melanoma is one of the most deadly cancers in the United States. Although it accounts for only 4% of all skin cancer cases, melanoma is associated with ~79% of skin cancer–related deaths (1-3). The prognosis and the patient’s survival depend heavily on the clinical stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis (4, 5). The 10-year survival rate for stage I melanoma patients is 90–97%, but only 3% for stage IV melanoma patients. Early detection and accurate assessment of the metastases remain the keys for improved outcome and disease-free survival. Unfortunately, the pattern of melanoma spread is often unpredictable, and conventional imaging with chest radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging provides limited value for accurate staging and quantification of the disease burden (6, 7).
