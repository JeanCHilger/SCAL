Clinical value of PET with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and L-methyl-11C-methionine for diagnosis of recurrent brain tumor and radiation injury. We studied 15 patients clinically suspected to have recurrent brain tumor or radiation injury, using positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) and L-methyl-11C-methionine (11C-Met). PET with 11C-Met (Met-PET) clearly delineated the extent of recurrent brain tumor as focal areas of increased accumulation of 11C-Met, and was useful for early detection of recurrent brain tumor. PET with 18FDG (FDG-PET) showed focal 18FDG-hypermetabolism in one patient with malignant transformation of low grade glioma, and demonstrated its usefulness for evaluation of malignant transformation. 18FDG-hypometabolism was observed in all patients with radiation injury, but was also found in one patient with recurrent malignant brain tumor. 11C-Met uptake in 3 patients with radiation injury was similar to that of the normal cortical tissue. FDG-PET can be used to initially exclude recurrent brain tumor which is seen as 18FDG-hypermetabolism. The combined use of Met-PET in addition to FDG-PET can improve the accuracy of differentiation of recurrent brain tumor with 18FDG-hypometabolism from radiation injury.
