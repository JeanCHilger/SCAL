Disseminated idiopathic myofasciitis in ferrets. First described in 2003, disseminated idiopathic myofasciitis (DIM) has emerged as a new disease in young, domestic ferrets. DIM is a severe inflammatory condition that affects primarily muscles and surrounding connective tissues. The disease is characterized by rapid onset of clinical signs, high fever, neutrophilic leukocytosis, and general lack of response to therapeutic intervention. Until recently DIM was considered fatal, but a few surviving ferrets indicate there may be an effective treatment protocol. DIM is suspected to be an immune-mediated disease, but the etiopathogenesis is not known. This article reviews clinical and pathologic findings in DIM patients, covers recommended diagnostic procedures and clinical management of ferrets with DIM, and discusses potential etiologies for this newly recognized disease in ferrets.
