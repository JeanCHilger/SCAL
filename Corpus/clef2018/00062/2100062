The role of isotope methods in evaluating the left ventricular function. Cardiac angioscintigraphy is a non-invasive, reproducible and reliable technique used to obtain a number of cardiac function parameters, the most important of which is left ventricular ejection fraction. Methodologically, the examination is simple. Fourier's analysis (a mathematical decomposition of ventricular mechanics) provides additional information on some abnormalities and is particularly useful in segmental kinetics studies and in the topographical diagnosis of cardiac rhythm disorders. The technique is indicated mainly for prognostic evaluation and follow-up of patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) cardiac scintigraphy makes it possible to evaluate the reuptake of noradrenaline by neurons, which represents the inactivation pathway of adrenergic neurotransmission and is the principal factor of noradrenaline extraction. MIBG scintigraphy is an indirect way of evaluating left ventricular function in congestive heart failure, as suggested by the results of studies showing correlations between MIBG uptake, left ventricular function indices and disease severity as judged on the basis of evolutive parameters.
