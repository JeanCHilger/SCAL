Prediction of (89)Zr production using the Monte Carlo code FLUKA. The widely used Monte Carlo simulation code FLUKA has been utilized to prototype a solid target for the production of (89)Zr by irradiation of a metallic (89)Y target foil in a 16.5MeV proton biomedical cyclotron, through the reaction (89)Y(p, n)(89)Zr. Simulations were performed with and without an Al energy degrader. In the setup of the geometry of the target, state of the art support tools, like SimpleGeo, were used for accurate, detailed modeling. The results permitted a quick assessment of all possible radionuclidic contaminants and confirmed that the use of an energy degrader avoids production of the most important impurity, (88)Zr. The estimated value for the activity produced in one hour of irradiation at 20μA is 384 ± 42MBq this is encouraging, indicating possible production of clinically significant amounts of activity with the relatively simple target setup adopted. Initial experimental tests gave results in excellent agreement with simulations, confirming the usefulness and accuracy of FLUKA as a tool for the design and optimization of targets for the production of PET radionuclides.
