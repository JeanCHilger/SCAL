Comparison of single time-point [111-In] pentetreotide SPECT/CT with dual time-point imaging of neuroendocrine tumors. to determine whether single time-point single-photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT/CT) somatostatin receptor imaging can replace traditional dual time-point planar and SPECT somatostatin receptor scintigraphy for evaluation of neuroendocrine tumors.twenty-four patients (9 males, 15 females mean age: 56 yearsInterobserver agreement was excellent (κ = 0.86) for single time-point imaging, and good (κ = 0.56) with dual time-point imaging. After consensus review, single time-point imaging identified pathologic lesions in 11 of 12 subjects with diagnosis of NET at follow-up, and in 0 of 12 subjects without NET (sensitivity 92% specificity 100%). Dual time-point imaging performed similarly, but missed an additional NET case (sensitivity 83%[111-In] pentetreotide SPECT/CT imaging at 24 hours identifies pathologic disease sites and distinguishes physiologic activity equally well compared to traditional strategies using 2 imaging days. Routine use of SPECT/CT will allow single time-point imaging without loss of diagnostic accuracy, enhancing patient convenience, and clinical throughput.
