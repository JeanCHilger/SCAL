Productivity of nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists. Work relative value units are only one consideration of the total work output of a nuclear medicine physician or radiologist. It is also important to consider methodological issues with the relative value units. Other important issues are how much work the individual does in areas such as administration, volunteering in societies, research, developing new protocols, introducing new studies, and various teaching activities. The quality of the work done by the physician is also important.
