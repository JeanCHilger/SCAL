Diagnosis of seizure disorders. The author addresses the diagnosis of seizure disorders by discussing clinical features of the different types of seizures, including generalized tonic-clonic, absence, myoclonic, partial complex seizures, and non-epileptic or "pseudoseizures." She also discusses the use of appropriate laboratory tests, electroencephalography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomographic scanning. The rationale of and approach to treatment of these conditions with some of the common anticonvulsant drugs (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenobarbital, and primidone) is provided.
