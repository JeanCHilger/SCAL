New and emerging imaging techniques for mapping brain circuitry. This article provides a survey of major methodological and analytic developments in the use of functional neuroimaging to study complex structural and functional brain activity and connectivity, including data analysis methods devised to distill network properties from high-dimensional and multimodal datasets. The goal of this survey is to provide those in the broader neuroscientific community with an understanding of these developments sufficient to facilitate an informed reading of the literature, and a thoughtful approach to their use in the investigation of questions in their own areas of interest. Practical methodological considerations for assessing and designing functional neuroimaging studies are provided, as are examples of the types of questions that can be addressed by various techniques.
