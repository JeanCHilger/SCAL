Locoregional and distant failure following image-guided stereotactic body radiation for early-stage primary lung cancer. To report our institutional experience using image-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for early stage lung cancer, including an analysis into factors associated with nodal and distant failures (NF, DF).Forty-eight patients with early-stage primary lung cancer were treated with image-guided SBRT between 2007 and 2009. Median prescription dose was 48 Gy in 4 fractions. Toxicity was graded according to the NCI CTCAE v3.0 scale.Local failure was detected in two lesions and actuarial 24-month local control was 95%. At 24 months, the cumulative incidence of NF was 6%, and DF was 29%. Larger lesions (>3 cm) and younger age (<70 years) were the only factors found to be significantly correlated with increased DF (p=0.005 and p=0.015, respectively). A single grade â‰¥ 3 toxicity was observed. After adjusting for age and lesion size, distant failure was significantly associated with a poorer OS (Cox regression, p=0.0059).Image-guided SBRT can produce excellent LC rates with minimal toxicity. Distant failure was a major determinant of OS and the most common pattern of failure, indicating a potential role for systemic therapy in younger patients with large lesions.
