Role of functional imaging in the management of lymphoma. 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -positron emission tomography (PET), and more recently PET/computed tomography (CT), is the most sensitive and specific imaging technique currently available for patients with lymphoma. Nevertheless, despite being increasingly used in pretreatment assessment, midtreatment evaluation of response, post-treatment restaging, and surveillance during follow-up of patients with lymphoma, its impact on clinical outcome in most clinical situations remains to be confirmed. PET/CT provides its greatest clinical benefit in the post-treatment evaluation of Hodgkin's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma however, the role of metabolic imaging in other indications and in other histologies remains to be demonstrated. Ongoing risk-adapted studies will hopefully provide evidence for clinical improvement on the basis of altering treatment as a result of interim PET results. Efforts are ongoing to better standardize the conduct and interpretation of FDG-PET scans. FDG-PET has the potential to improve lymphoma patient management
