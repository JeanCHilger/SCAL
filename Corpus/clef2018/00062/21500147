Aorto-enteric fistula: an interdisciplinary practical approach. Aorto-enteric fistulas (AEF) are a rare but often -fatal complication. The primary diagnosis of AEF remains difficult. Computed tomography and FDG-PET / CT (fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography) are the diagnostic tools of choice. Therapy consists of an urgent individual interdisciplinary surgical approach with primary axillo-femoral bypass and secondary prosthesis explantation or in situ replacement and consecutive bowel resection. Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is reserved for primary -aorto-enteric fistulas in patients without signs of infection or in emergency cases as a bridging meth-od. A systematic review of the literature from 1990 to 2009 was performed by medline -research (pubmed) to analyse diagnostic and treatment strategies for aorto-enteric fistulas. A practical, interdisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm was created in accordance with the analysed results.
