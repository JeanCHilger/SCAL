Evaluation of optimal acquisition duration or injected activity for pediatric 18F-FDG PET/CT. Pediatric (18)F-FDG dosing and acquisition durations are generally based on coarse extrapolation from adult guidelines. This study sought to determine whether shorter acquisition durations or a lower (18)F-FDG injected activity could be used for pediatric (18)F-FDG PET/CT examinations while maintaining diagnostic utility. Reduction of overall scan time potentially reduces motion artifacts, improves patient comfort, and decreases length of sedation. Alternatively, decreased (18)F-FDG dose minimizes radiation risk.Fourteen whole-body (18)F-FDG PET/CT examinations were performed on 13 patients (weight, 13-109 kg age range, 1-23 y) with a weight-based injected activity (5.3 MBq/kg [0.144 mCi/kg]), fixed acquisition durations (3 min/field of view [FOV] if < 22 kg, 5 min/FOV if > 22 kg), and list-mode acquisition. For each examination, the list-mode data were truncated to form multiple datasets with shorter acquisition durations down to a minimum of 1 min/FOV (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min/FOV data were formed from single 5 min/FOV acquisition). Fifty-six image volumes were generated, randomized, and reviewed in a masked manner with corresponding CT image volumes by 5 radiologists. Overall, subjective adequacy and objective lesion detection accuracy by body region were evaluated.All examinations with maximum acquisition duration were graded as adequate and were used as the reference standard for detection accuracy. For patients less than 22 kg, 1 of the 3 PET/CT examinations was graded as inadequate for clinical tasks when acquisition duration was reduced to 2 min/FOV, and all examinations were graded as inadequate when reduced to 1 min/FOV. For patients more than 22 kg, all 3-5 min/FOV studies were graded as adequate, and 2 of the 9 studies were graded as inadequate for 2 min/FOV studies. Lesion detection accuracy was perfect for acquisition times between 3 min/FOV and 5 min/FOV for all regions of the body. However, lesion detection became less accurate when imaging acquisition time was reduced more than 40%.Evaluation of image volumes generated from simulated shorter acquisition durations suggests that imaging times for larger patients (>22 kg) can be reduced from 5 min/FOV to 3 min/FOV without a loss of diagnostic utility. Using decreased acquisition times as a surrogate for (18)F-FDG dose, (18)F-FDG dose can be reduced by approximately 40% when all patients were scanned for 5 min/FOV.
