Methoxymethyl (MOM) group nitrogen protection of pyrimidines bearing C-6 acyclic side-chains. Novel N-methoxymethylated (MOM) pyrimidine (4-13) and pyrimidine-2,4-diones (15-17) nucleoside mimetics in which an isobutyl side-chain is attached at the C-6 position of the pyrimidine moiety were synthesized. Synthetic methods via O-persilylated or N-anionic uracil derivatives have been evaluated for the synthesis of N-1- and/or N-3-MOM pyrimidine derivatives with C-6 acyclic side-chains. A synthetic approach using an activated N-anionic pyrimidine derivative afforded the desired N,N-1,3-diMOM and N-1-MOM pyrimidines 4 and 5 in good yield. Introduction of fluorine into the side-chain was performed with DAST as the fluorinating reagent to give a N,N-1,3-diMOM pyrimidine 13 with a 1-fluoro-3-hydroxyisobutyl moiety at C-6. Conformational study of the monotritylated N-1-MOM pyrimidine 12 by the use of the NOE experiments revealed the predominant conformation of the compound to be one where the hydroxymethyl group in the C-6 side-chain is close to the N-1-MOM moiety, while the OMTr is in proximity to the CH(3)-5 group. Contrary to this no NOE enhancements between the N-1-MOM group and hydroxymethyl or fluoromethyl protons in 13 were observed, which suggested a nonrestricted rotation along the C-6 side-chain. Fluorinated N,N-1,3-diMOM pyrimidine 13 emerged as a model compound for development of tracer molecules for non-invasive imaging of gene expression using positron emission tomography (PET).
