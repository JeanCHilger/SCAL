NMR determination of free gallium(III) ions in aqueous solutions of Ga complexes, "cold" analogs of PET/SPECT tracers. Ga complexes are widely used as radiopharmaceuticals for PET or SPECT imaging and as therapeutic agents. At physiological pH, free gallium(III) ions can stably exist as soluble gallate [Ga(OH)(4) ](-) , a nephrotoxic compound whose presence should be avoided. Any Ga complex, therefore, should be carefully checked for the absence of gallate before use. Here we show that (71) Ga NMR is a useful tool to rapidly detect the presence of gallate in aqueous solutions of Ga complexes and to follow the purification steps of the Ga complex solutions.
