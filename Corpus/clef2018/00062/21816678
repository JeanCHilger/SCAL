Clinical presentation and diagnosis of uterine sarcoma, including imaging. Uterine sarcomas are uncommon tumours from mesenchymal elements. They are thought to arise primarily from endometrial stroma and uterine muscle, respectively. When endometrial stroma undergoes malignant transformation, it might be accompanied by a malignant epithelial component. Thus, malignant mesenchymal uterine tumours comprise leiomyosarcoma, endometrial stromal sarcoma, undifferentiated uterine sarcoma and carcinosarcoma. In this chapter, we discusses preoperative presentation, diagnosis and current progress in different imaging modalities, including ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance image and positron emission tomography scan. We summarise advances in new technology, which might improve preoperative detection and enhance referral to gynaecologic oncologists for optimal staging surgery and treatment.
