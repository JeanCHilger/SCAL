Nitroimidazole radiopharmaceuticals in bioimaging: part I: synthesis and imaging applications. The paper is review on synthesis of nitroimidazole radiosensitizers useful in imaging of tumor cells. Nitroimidazole compounds are radiolabeled probes for specific use in imaging such as 18F for positron emission tomography 99mTc for single photon emission computed tomography
