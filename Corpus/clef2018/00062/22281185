Fluorinated ﾎ認508-CFTR correctors and potentiators for PET imaging. (19)F-modified bithiazole correctors and phenylglycine potentiators of the ﾎ認508-CFTR chloride channel were synthesized and their function assayed in cells expressing human ﾎ認508-CFTR and a halide-sensitive fluorescent protein. Fluorine was incorporated into each scaffold using prosthetic groups for future biodistribution imaging studies using positron emission tomography (PET). The ﾎ認508-CFTR corrector and potentiator potencies of the fluorinated analogs were comparable to or better than those of the original compounds.
