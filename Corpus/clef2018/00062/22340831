Targeted metabolic imaging to improve the management of heart disease. Tracer techniques are powerful methods for assessing rates of biological processes in vivo. A case in point is intermediary metabolism of energy providing substrates, a central feature of every living cell. In the heart, the tight coupling between metabolism and contractile function offers an opportunity for the simultaneous assessment of cardiac performance at different levels in vivo: coronary flow, myocardial perfusion, oxygen delivery, metabolism, and contraction. Noninvasive imaging techniques used to identify the metabolic footprints of either normal or perturbed cardiac function are discussed.
