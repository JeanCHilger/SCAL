Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor polylactic acid-polyethylene glycol-poly-L-Lys/gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid nanoparticles Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) maps information about tissues spatially and functionally. Protons (hydrogen nuclei) are widely used to create images because of their abundance in water molecules, which comprise >80% of most soft tissues. The contrast of proton MRI images depends mainly on the density of nuclear proton spins, the relaxation times of the nuclear magnetization (T1, longitudinal T2, transverse), the magnetic environment of the tissues, and the blood flow to the tissues. However, insufficient contrast between normal and diseased tissues requires the use of contrast agents. Most contrast agents affect the T1 and T2 relaxation times of the surrounding nuclei, mainly the protons of water. T2* is the spinâ€“spin relaxation time composed of variations from molecular interactions and intrinsic magnetic heterogeneities of tissues in the magnetic field (1). Cross-linked iron oxide and other iron oxide formulations affect T2 primarily and lead to a decreased signal. On the other hand, paramagnetic T1 agents such as gadolinium (Gd
