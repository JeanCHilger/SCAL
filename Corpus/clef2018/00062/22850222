Prediction of treatment outcomes in patients with chest wall sarcoma: evaluation with PET/CT. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic implications of (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography in patients with chest wall sarcoma.Positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans of 42 patients (mean age: 46 years) with chest wall sarcomas were analyzed. Pathologic confirmation was obtained by surgical specimens in all patients. Tumor grade assessed by Ki-67 (MIB-1) immunohistochemical analysis and expression of glucose transporter protein 1 were compared with a maximum standardized uptake value. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted for estimates of overall and event-free survivals.The median maximum standardized uptake value of the tumor was 10.2 and the median MIB-1 index of the tumor was 32.5%. Glucose transporter protein 1 expression was found in 29 patients (69%). Univariate analyses revealed that surgery, chemotherapy, MIB-1 labeling index (cut-off 32.5%), MIB-1 grade, glucose transporter protein 1 expression and maximum standardized uptake value were possible predictors for overall and event-free survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that surgery (hazard ratio, 4.852 P = 0.017), maximum standardized uptake value (hazard ratio, 3.077(18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography allows the prediction of prognosis after treatment in patients with chest wall sarcoma and may be useful in selecting high-risk patients for more risk-adapted treatments.
