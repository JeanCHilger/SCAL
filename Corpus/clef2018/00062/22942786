Late Recurrences of Thyroid Carcinoma 24 Years after a Complete Remission: When Monitoring Should be Stopped? Renal metastases from thyroid carcinoma are very rare, late recurrences of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) are not reported in literature and there is no universal recommendation for optimum duration of follow-up of thyroid carcinoma. We present herein a case of late renal recurrence of follicular variant PTC (FV-PTC). This study is a case report of renal metastasis revealing a late recurrence of FV-PTC. An 81-year-old woman with previously treated FV-PTC 24 years ago by total thyroidectomy, lymph nodes dissection and radioiodine therapy presented with sudden gross-hematuria. Computerized tomography scan (CT-scan) revealed a 70-mm right renal mass and histological diagnosis after nephrectomy demonstrated recurrence of FV-PTC with a positive thyroglobulin immunostaining. Despite of (131)I-radioiodine therapy postoperatively, the serum thyroglobulin (Tg) increased and positron emission tomography combined to CT-scan showed 4 years later, an abdominal lymph node and distant metastases. Now the patient is alive but her general condition is too poor for systemic adjuvant therapy. This case illustrates the need of prolonged follow-up after surgery of high-risk FV-PTC.
