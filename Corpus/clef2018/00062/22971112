Fluorescent polymer nanoparticle for selective sensing of intracellular hydrogen peroxide. Fluorescent boronate-modified polyacrylonitrile (BPAN) nanoparticles of 50 nm diameter were fabricated for use as a selective H(2)O(2) sensor. The fluorescence intensity changed and an emission peak shifted when BPAN nanoparticles selectively interacted with H(2)O(2), relative to other reactive oxygen species (ROS). The BPAN nanoparticles undergo photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between a Schiff base moiety and boronate, which enhances the fluorescence and makes the nanoparticles suitable for selective ROS recognition. We demonstrate the use of these nanoparticles as a detector of endogenous H(2)O(2) produced in living cells. The representative features of the fluorescent BPAN nanoparticles that make them particularly attractive for H(2)O(2) and ROS detection are the following: they are easily synthesized as PET sensors they exhibit a characteristic emission peak and peak shift that distinguishes reaction with H(2)O(2) from other ROS
