Anxiety and cerebral cortical metabolism in normal persons. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was administered to 43 normal volunteers immediately before and after a positron emission tomography (PET) procedure with [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG). High trait-anxious individuals had significantly higher state (situational) anxiety associated with the PET scan procedure than did low trait-anxious persons. State anxiety decreased significantly for all respondents following the PET scan procedure. No significant relationships between global or regional cortical metabolic rates and state anxiety were observed. The direct cortical metabolic effects of heightened anxiety in the scan setting, should they exist, are likely obscured in the normal variance of the 18F-FDG method.
