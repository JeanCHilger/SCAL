The effectiveness of a prenatal education programme for the prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis. A 10 min education programme was developed which, if effective in changing the behaviour of pregnant women, would eliminate or greatly reduce the risk of congenital toxoplasmosis. It was taught in 26 randomly selected (case) prenatal classes offered to women early in their pregnancy. The remaining 26 (control) classes received routine class material which did not mention toxoplasmosis. A questionnaire was administered to all women prior to this early class (pre-test) and again after the last prenatal class, held just prior to delivery (post-test). Changes in pet, food and personal hygiene behaviour between the pre- and post-test were determined and a score calculated by adding points for change towards those behaviours recommended in the programme and subtracting points for change in the opposite direction. Cat owners in case classes had a significantly higher score in pet hygiene behaviour than those in control classes (P less than 0.05). No significant difference was found between the food or personal hygiene scores of women in case and control classes, possibly because of low power. However, although behaviours did not differ on the pre-test, women in case classes had significantly better cooking methods for roast beef and hamburger on the post-test (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01 respectively). It is concluded that this programme is effective and should be offered to all women in order to reduce congenital toxoplasmosis incidence.
