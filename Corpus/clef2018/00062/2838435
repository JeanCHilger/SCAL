Synthesis of radiotracers for studying muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the living human brain using positron emission tomography: [11C]dexetimide and [11C]levetimide. Dexetimide (Fig. 1a), a potent muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist, and levetimide (Fig. 1b), its pharmacologically inactive enantiomer, were labeled with 11C for non-invasive in vivo studies of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the human brain using positron emission tomography. The syntheses were completed in approximately 32 min using [alpha-11C]benzyl iodide as the precursor. The synthesis, purification, characterization and determination of specific activity are presented and discussed.
