Relation between tissue nature and (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose kinetics evaluated by dynamic positron emission tomography in human brain tumors. Using dynamic positron emission tomographic (PET) scans, kinetic rate constants in the (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) model and glucose consumption rate were measured in human brain tumors. In the tumor tissue, all rate constants were higher on the average in the glioma grade IV and the non-glial tumor groups. The k*3 showed wide deviation in the glioma grade IV group. Discrepancy was found between the k*3 and the glucose consumption rate in several cases. The k*1 correlated with the neovascularity in tumors confirmed at angiography. Analysis of the rate constants might be useful for interpreting tumor nature and predicting its malignancy.
