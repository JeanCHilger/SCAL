Single photon emission computed tomography of brain tumors with 201TIC1. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 201TIC1 was performed in 27 patients with brain tumors. Findings on SPECT were compared with those on planar images, computed tomography (CT) and, in 4 cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). At SPECT the tumors were shown as areas with higher accumulation of the tracers than the surrounding brain tissue in 24 cases and a better discrimination was obtained than in planar images. Deep-seated lesions were especially visualized. In some cases SPECT defined lesions that were not clearly delineated on CT or MRI. SPECT with 201TlCl can be of clinical use in the diagnosis of brain tumors.
