Positron emission tomography in patients with a primary intracerebral hematoma. Using positron emission tomography, the regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and oxygen consumption (CMRO2) were studied in 21 patients with hypertensive intracerebral hematomas. The study showed a very localized decrease of CBF and CMRO2 around a hematoma, and revealed in two cases (9.1%) distinct luxury perfusion around it. There was diffuse reduction of CBF with increased OEF in hematomas larger than 4.5 cm in diameter. The results suggested that surgical evacuation should be considered for hematomas with a diameter exceeding 4.5 cm.
