Dopaminergic and benzodiazepine receptors studied in vivo by PET. Using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and specific radioligands, dopaminergic D2 (DA-D2 receptors) and benzodiazepine receptors (BZ-receptors) were studied in living animals during normal and pathological conditions. In vivo characterization of both receptors was performed using two highly specific antagonists namely: 11C-Ro 15 1788 for BZ-receptors and 76 Br-Bromospiperone for DA-D2 receptors. Changes in 11c-Ro 15 1788 specific binding to BZ-receptors were observed during convulsive seizures. After MPTP treatment, a decrease in the 76 Br-Bromospiperone striatal specific binding was observed, correlated with the establishment of a Parkinson-like syndrome.
