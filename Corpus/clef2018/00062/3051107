Nuclear medical differentiation of focal lesions of the liver. Radio-colloid scintigraphy, hepatobiliary scintigraphy and blood pool scanning with tagged red blood cells are well-established methods of nuclear medicine for the differential diagnosis of hepatic lesions. Hepatic hemangiomas and focal nodular hyperplasia can be differentiated in over 90% of cases. The sensitivity of single-photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) in the detection of liver masses greater than 2 cm diameter is 92%-98%.
