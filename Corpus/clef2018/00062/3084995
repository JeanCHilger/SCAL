Neuroimaging in refractory partial seizures: comparison of PET, CT, and MRI. We compared the results of x-ray CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F 2-deoxyglucose in 36 patients with partial seizures. Seventeen patients had localized epileptic discharges on surface EEG. MRI showed an abnormality in 9, CT in 4, and PET in 13 of 14 patients who had the test. Nineteen patients had nonlocalizing EEG discharges. MRI showed an abnormality in 11, CT in 10, and PET in 8 of 12. MRI is more sensitive than CT in detecting structural lesions underlying PET hypometabolism.
