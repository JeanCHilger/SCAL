Survey of expectations among clients of three small animal clinics. A questionnaire completed by 319 clients of 3 small animal clinics asked what clients expected and what they received in their interaction with the veterinarian. The survey emphasized communication and rapport established by the veterinarian. Client satisfaction was more highly correlated with how the owner was treated than how the pet was treated.
