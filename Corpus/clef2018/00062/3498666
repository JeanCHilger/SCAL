Local cerebral metabolic changes in acute ischemic strokes. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies with 18F deoxyglucose were completed in 35 patients with acute ischemic strokes. Twelve cases were studied within 72 h, 23 between 4 and 14 days. Results indicate the functional and prognostic significance of early tomography studies of metabolism, and anticipate possible use of metabolic imaging in the evaluation of treatment.
