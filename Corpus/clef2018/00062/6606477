A comparison between 180 degrees and 360 degrees data reconstruction in single photon emission computed tomography of the liver and spleen. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the liver and spleen has been studied using a GE400T/STAR rotating gamma camera/computer system. We have compared section image contrast, in both phantom and patient studies, produced by 180 degrees and 360 degrees reconstructions of data from a full 360 degrees data acquisition. There is little difference in overall image quality between the two reconstruction modalities. Quantitatively, however, appropriate 180 degrees reconstructions significantly improve lesion contrast in both organs by as much as a factor of two. In all cases studied, the values of image contrast achieved when the 180 degrees arc of reconstruction was centred about the region of interest were higher than the values obtained from the 360 degrees reconstructions. These results are shown to be independent of the corrections made for photon attenuation. Clinically this technique may prove useful in clarifying the presence or absence of disease, particularly in equivocal cases where lesions have poor contrast or are small in size. An extended clinical trial of the technique is now in progress.
