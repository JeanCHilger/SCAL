Real-time analysis of liposomal trafficking in tumor-bearing mice by use of positron emission tomography. Long-circulating liposomes are known to accumulate passively in tumor tissues of tumor-bearing animals. To evaluate the in vivo behavior of such liposomes, we investigated the real-time liposomal trafficking by a non-invasive method using position emission tomography (PET). Liposomes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and palmityl-D-glucuronide (PGlcUA) in a molar ratio of 4:4:1 were prepared in the presence of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([2-18F]FDG). [2-18F]FDG-labeled liposomes sized by extrusion through a filter with various-sized pores were administered to mice bearing Meth A sarcoma, and a PET scan was performed for 120 min. Small-sized, long-circulating liposomes (100 nm in diameter) constructed with PGlcUA tended to accumulate in the tumor tissues. On the contrary, control liposomes (100 nm in diameter) containing dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol instead of PGlcUA accumulated in the liver. Large-sized PGlcUA-containing liposomes (> 300 nm) also accumulated in the liver, as well as in the spleen. Time-activity curves indicated that the small long-circulating liposomes (< 200 nm) transiently accumulated in the liver right after the injection but that the accumulation there decreased time-dependently. These data suggest that, although the majority of small long-circulating liposomes remain in the bloodstream, some extravasate once into the interstitial spaces in the liver re-enter the bloodstream again, and finally accumulate in the tumor tissues. This PET technique might be useful for studying real-time liposomal trafficking and for tumor imaging.
