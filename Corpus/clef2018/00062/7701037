Temporal glucose metabolism in borderline personality disorder. The pathophysiology of borderline personality disorder (BPD) is obscure. Underlying organic factors such as epilepsy are suspected because clinical characteristics of the syndrome are similar to some manifestations of patients with complex partial seizures (CPS). Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) reveals hypometabolism in the area surrounding epileptic foci. To test the epilepsy hypothesis in BPD, we have explored 10 patients with BPD and compared them with 15 control subjects using PET with FDG. We conclude that PET provides no metabolic indication of temporal lobe epilepsy in BPD.
