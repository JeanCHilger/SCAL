Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in central nervous system tumors: role of blood-brain barrier permeability. Somatostatin receptors are expressed in meningiomas and low-grade gliomas, raising the hope that scintigraphy with 111In-DTPA-D-Phe1-octreotide might be helpful in the in vivo localization, differential diagnosis and postoperative/postradiotherapy brain tumor follow-up.Indium-111-DTPA-D-Phe1-octreotide scintigraphy and brain scintigraphy using 99mTc-DTPA as a nonspecific tracer for blood-brain barrier integrity were simultaneously performed in 60 patients with CNS tumors using dual-isotope acquisition mode SPECT. For 23 patients, the scintigraphic findings were also compared with in vitro somatostatin receptor autoradiography of surgical biopsy specimens.In meningiomas (located outside the blood-brain barrier), the somatostatin receptor scan showed all tumors and scintigraphic signal intensity correlating with in vitro SSR density positive in all meningiomas. Less contrast was seen on 99mTc-DTPA scans. In all tumors inside the blood-brain barrier, the 111In-DTPA-D-Phe1-octreotide scan visualized the tumors with a disrupted blood-brain barrier, as seen by 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy. Discrepancies, however, were observed between somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and in vitro receptor autoradiography.Combined somatostatin receptor and 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy may be helpful for noninvasive differentiation between meningiomas and other CNS tumors. False-negative scans were observed as a result of shielding by the intact blood-brain barrier. Interpretation of negative and positive somatostatin receptor scans in CNS tumors must therefore be done with caution.
