Relationship between striatal glucose consumption and copper excretion in patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine. In 12 patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine (DPA), the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose consumption of the lentiform and caudate nucleus was analysed using the 18Fluorodeoxyglucose method and correlated with the clinical symptoms of the patients, the ceruloplasmin level, the serum level of free copper and the 24-h copper excretion. The more copper was eliminated, the higher was the basal ganglia glucose consumption. On the other hand, in seven patients who had been treated for more than 7 years a significant decline of the basal ganglia glucose consumption was observed, suggesting too low a maintenance dose of DPA.
