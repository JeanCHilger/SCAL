Using myocardial perfusion tomography to estimate infarct size and to determine prognostic value in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Single-photon emission computerized tomography with Tc-99m-MIBI was used to measure the infarct size in 41 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), among them 11 patients (accounting for 27%) were dead or recurred with perfusion defect > 31% in 6 cases including 3 deaths and 2 recurrences. The perfusion defect was between 11%-30% in 12 patients, including one death and two recurrences. The perfusion defect was 10% in 23 patients, including 3 with recurrence. During the period from 6 months to 2 years following-up, the total death and patients with recurrence were 11/41 (27%) cases. The results showed that the prognosis of patients with AMI was closely related to the size of myocardial perfusion defect, and those with perfusion defect > 31% had a poorer prognosis.
