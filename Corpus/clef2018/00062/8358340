N-(2-hydroxybenzyl)-omega-amino carbonic acids and their derivatives as tools for biochemical and biophysical investigations. We propose N-(2-hydroxybenzyl)-omega-amino carbonic acids (An) as multifunctional probes for fatty acid metabolism studies. Multifunctionality could be achieved by introduction of different isotopes into An molecule. Deuteration of An results in probes for 2H-NMR membrane studies. Introduction of radioactive iodine and bromine isotopes into An gives diagnosticums for gamma-tomography and PET. AnI and AnBr are fluorescence quenchers usable for membrane studies. This multifunctionality of An derivatives is valuable because they participate in such metabolic pathways of fatty acids as beta-oxidation and inclusion into lipids. They can also inhibit natural FA oxidation.
