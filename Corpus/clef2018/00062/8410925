Meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scanning in the diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma. During the period 1984-90, meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scans were performed in 23 patients with suspected phaeochromocytoma seen at the Hammersmith Hospital. Sixteen patients had a histologically proven phaeochromocytoma and in 14 of these patients the tumour was demonstrated by abnormal uptake of MIBG. Seven patients did not have a phaeochromocytoma and in all of these the MIBG scan was negative. These findings gave the procedure a sensitivity of 87.5% with a specificity of 100% positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 77.7%, respectively. MIBG scanning is an extremely valuable technique in the management of patients with suspected phaeochromocytoma but is best employed to localise a tumour which has been confirmed biochemically.
