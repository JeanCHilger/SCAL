Clinical trials in the Alzheimer's disease: evaluation of the therapeutic response. The strategy, as regards the layout of any clinical study on Alzheimer's disease (AD) which aspires to an evaluation of the therapeutical efficiency of a drug, must take as its starting point a clear specification of the criteria of improvement and of how such criteria are to be quantified. The measuring instruments of therapeutical efficiency can be divided into two main groups: instruments for analysing the biological parameters of the illness and instruments which analyse functional efficiency. Between the latter, there are three types of basic tools: 1. Tests which allow psychopathological clinical changes to be evaluated, such as a complete neuropsychological examination, an analysis of the global clinical impression, and a cognitive mini-test 2. Psychometric tests which allow certain parameters to be quantified, such as, for example, the IQ co-efficient
