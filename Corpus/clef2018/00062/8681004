In vivo assessment of neurotransmitter system in cardiovascular diseases. Clinical issues. Cardiac neurotransmitter systems, especially the adrenergic receptor pathway, are impaired in heart diseases. In patients with heart failure, these abnormalities contribute to arrhythmogenesis and to progression of cardiac dysfunction. The use of MIBG with single photon imaging has provided useful information on the mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias, and on the causes of death in patients with heart failure or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It has been suggested as a prognostic indicator in patients with heart failure. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) now allows us to obtain noninvasively the quantitative determination of regional receptor density and affinity in humans as well as innervation integrity and functioning. These measurements are based upon the synthesis of a radioligand, usually either a selective receptor antagonist or a false neurotransmitter labeled with a positron-emitting radioisotope. Mathematical compartmental models are fitted to activity-versus-time curves obtained during saturation or displacement experiments in order to calculate the rate constants and the receptor density in the myocardium. PET has only recently begun to be applied to the study of cardiac physiology and disease. PET and SPECT cardiac neuroimaging techniques are able to demonstrate the physiological regulation of receptors, and to provide the possibility of studying regional abnormalities of cardiac neurotransmission, especially in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Furthermore these non invasive techniques could be useful in exploring the alteration of neurotransmission in the early stage of heart disease and could allow repeated scintigraphic examinations in order to evaluate the effects of cardiac medications.
