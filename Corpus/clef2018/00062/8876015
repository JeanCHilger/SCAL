Striatal dopamine D2 receptor quantification and superior temporal gyrus: volume determination in 14 chronic schizophrenic subjects. Chronic schizophrenic (n = 14) and normal subjects (n = 15) were studied with resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Two PET scans were carried out to estimate caudate dopamine D2 receptor densities. MRI was used to measure the volume of the superior temporal gyrus. Average striatal D2 receptor density (Bmax) was significantly higher in the schizophrenic group than in the normal group. Average left superior temporal gyral volume was significantly smaller in the schizophrenic group than in the normal group, and the same tendency was found for the right superior temporal gyrus. Thus, the main finding of this combined analysis of functional and structural neuroimaging techniques was an inverse relationship between reduced superior temporal gyral volume and elevated striatal D2 receptor Bmax values. These preliminary findings require confirmation in larger groups of patients and control subjects.
