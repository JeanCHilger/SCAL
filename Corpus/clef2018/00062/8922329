PTCA in angulated segments: effects of balloon material, balloon length, and inflation sequence on straightening forces in an in vitro model. We sought to determine the effect of balloon material, balloon length, and inflation sequence on the straightening forces generated during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in angulated segments. Using an in vitro model consisting of a curved channel (3/4" radius) with a displaceable pressure sensor, we examined four different balloon materials: compliant (POC), semicompliant (PE600 and Duralyn), and noncompliant (PET), two balloon lengths (20 mm and 40 mm), and two inflation sequences (rapid and slow) with continuous recording of straightening force during each balloon inflation. Three balloons were tested for each combination of materials, length, and inflation sequence. Long balloons exerted significantly lower straightening forces. There were significantly higher straightening forces with noncompliant, particularly short, balloons. Varying the inflation sequence had no significant effect. For PTCA in angulated segments: (1) long balloons produce lower straightening force, (2) noncompliant balloons produce higher straightening force, particularly with short balloons, and (3) varying the inflation sequence has no significant effect on straightening force.
