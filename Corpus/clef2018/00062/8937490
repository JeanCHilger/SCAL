Clinical usefulness of 123I-BMIPP (beta-methyl iodophenyl pentadecanoic (acid) myocardial SPECT in patients with hematological malignancies with adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy. In order to investigate myocardial lipid metabolism in patients receiving chemotherapy regimens containing adriamycin (ADR) for hematological malignancies, 123I-beta-methyl iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) myocardial SPECT was performed. Thirty-two patients with hematological malignancies received a mean total ADR dose of 245 mg/m2 (range: 0-550 mg/m2). A polar map based on data from 8 normal individuals was used to calculate the extent score (representing the area of decreased uptake) and the severity score (representing the severity of defects) in the patients given ADR. 1) There was a significant association between the total ADR dose and the extent and severity scores. 2) The left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly associated with the extent and severity scores. 3) The two scores were also significantly associated with the washout rate of 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG). These results suggest that 123I-BMIPP myocardial scintigraphy reflects dysfunction of the myocardial mitochondria and serves as a guide for determining whether administration of ADR should be discontinued or the dose reduced.
