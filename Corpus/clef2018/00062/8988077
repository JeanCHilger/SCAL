Utility of relative cerebral blood volume mapping derived from perfusion magnetic resonance imaging in the routine follow up of brain tumors. It was recently demonstrated that imaging of brain tumors by relative cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps reconstructed from dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) data provide similar diagnostic information compared to positron emission tomography (PET) or 201Tl single-photon emission computerized tomography (201Tl-SPECT) scans. The authors used relative CBV mapping for routine follow-up evaluation of patients with brain tumors and compared its sensitivity to diagnostic MR imaging, 201Tl-SPECT and clinical assessment. Fifty-nine patients were prospectively followed using 191 concomitant studies of dual section relative CBV maps, MR imaging, 201Tl-SPECT, and neurological evaluations. Studies were repeated every 2 to 3 months (median three evaluations/patient). The relative CBV maps were graded as relative CBV 0 to 4, where Grades 3 and 4 are indicative of proliferating tumors (four = rapid leak). There were 44 high-grade and 15 low-grade tumors followed during treatment. During the follow-up period a change in relative CBV grade was observed in 56% of the patients, revealing an increasing grade in 72% of them. The rapid leak phenomenon was detected in 35% of all studies and in 81% of those with a worsening relative CBV grade. Tumor progression was detected earlier by relative CBV maps as follows: earlier than MR imaging in 32% of the studies (earlier by a median of 4.5 months p < 0.01)
