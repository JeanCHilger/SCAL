Immunohistochemical detection of advanced glycosylation end-products in the peritoneum and its possible pathophysiological role in CAPD. It has recently been suggested that advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs) are formed in the peritoneum in patients on CAPD. However, the exact location of AGE accumulation, the relation with the duration of CAPD and its pathophysiological role in CAPD remain unclear. If the peritoneum is glycosylated, it could bring about altered peritoneal function. Therefore, the aim of this study is to clarify the localization of AGEs in the peritoneum in accordance with the duration of CAPD and to examine its relation to the peritoneal permeability. Fifteen non-diabetic patients were divided into three groups (each 5 patients) on the basis of the mean duration (D) of CAPD (Group 1, D = 0 month Group II, D = 34 months
