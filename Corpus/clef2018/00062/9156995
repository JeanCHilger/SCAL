Sociocultural reasons for the pigeon problem. The feeding of animals as a friendly gesture is deeply rooted in man. This behaviour has a negative effect on the Street-pigeons which as a consequence suffer from overpopulation. The problem can only be solved by limiting this feeding. The pigeon-feeders are the cause of the pigeon-problem in our cities. The feeders can by their motivation be classified in various groups. Play-feeders and display-feeders can be recognised. They are more easily to be dealt with than the fanatical pigeon-friends who show a strong emotional attachment to these birds. The pigeon-problem can be overcome if this stubborn group can be taught to change his behaviour. Such a solution would be highly rewarding as great sums of money are spent to remove damages caused by the pigeons to buildings and works of art.
