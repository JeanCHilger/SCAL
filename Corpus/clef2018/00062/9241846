Extension of dry ash atomic absorption and spectrophotometric methods to determination of minerals and phosphorus in soy-based, whey-based, and enteral formulae (modification of AOAC Official Methods 985.35 and 986.24): collaborative study. Eight laboratories participated in a collaborative study of AOAC Official Method 985.35, Minerals in Ready-to-Feed Milk-Based infant Formula and Pet Foods, Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometric Method and 7 laboratories participated in a study of AOAC Official Method 986.24, Phosphorus in Milk-Based infant Formula, Spectrophotometric Method, to extend these methods to infant formulae (other than milk-based) and enteral products. Three ready-to-feed soy-based formulae and 2 soy-based powder formulae were chosen to represent the plant matrix. A whey-based formula and a casein-based enteral formula were also included in the study. Soy formulae containing nearly identical concentrations of particular elements were matched, and an application of the Youden "closely matched pair" approach was used to estimate repeatability parameters. Average reproducibility values were as follows: calcium, 9.3%
