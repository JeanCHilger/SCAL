The acetylcholine releaser linopirdine increases parietal regional cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer's disease. Centrally acting cholinergic drugs have been reported to increase regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as measured by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in brain regions affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). We studied the effects of the acetylcholine releaser linopirdine (LPD) on SPECT rCBF in patients with probable AD. Twenty-four AD patients (12 M, 12 F mean age +/- SD = 68.9 +/- 8.2 years) and 13 healthy controls (8 M, 5 F
