Exercise technetium 99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography late after coronary artery bypass surgery: long-term follow-up. The prognostic value of exercise technetium 99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging in patients with previous bypass surgery is unknown. The aim of our study was to assess the prognostic information obtained with exercise scintigraphy performed for routine follow-up or reappearance of symptoms.We studied 75 patients referred to our Center at a mean of 38 +/- 53 months from the revascularization procedure and prospectively followed them for 38 +/- 24 months.Fifteen patients (20%) had events at follow-up: there were 4 cardiac deaths, 3 nonfatal acute myocardial infarctions, 8 late revascularization procedures (4 percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and 4 repeat bypass surgery). Univariate analysis identified a history of typical angina (p = 0.001), a clinically positive ergometric test (p = 0.009), peak exercise heart rate (p = 0.0003), percentage of maximal predicted heart rate (p = 0.0001), peak exercise double product (p = 0.048), therapy during exercise (p = 0.003), scintigraphic summed reversibility score (i.e., the summation of the segmental differences between stress and rest) (p = 0.014), as significant predictors of events. Three multivariate models were built, with clinical variables (Model 1, chi square 15.97), ergometric variables (Model 2, chi square 19.66), and with scintigraphic variables added to clinical/ergometric variables (Model 3, chi square 31.13). The scintigraphic variable selected in the model as significant predictor of events was the summed reversibility score (p = 0.008).Exercise sestamibi SPECT scintigraphy provides optimal prognostic information after clinical and ergometric parameters in patients with previous bypass surgery.
