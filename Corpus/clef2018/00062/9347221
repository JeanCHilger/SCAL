Aspects of Toxocara epidemiology: human toxocarosis. Toxocarosis is the clinical disease in man caused by infection of zoonotic roundworms of dogs and cats, Toxocara canis and T. cati. In this review the mode of transmission to the human by oral ingestion of Toxocara eggs from the environment is discussed. T. cati seems to play a more important role than generally suggested. Direct contact with animals is not considered a potential risk because embryonation of excreted Toxocara ova requires a minimum of 2 weeks. For the same reason there is no relationship expected between infection and exposure to dogs and cats in the household. Children more frequently have clinical symptoms because of the closer contact with contaminated soil in yards and sandpits, the lack of hygiene, and because of eating dirt. Toxocara larval migration in the body can cause various clinical syndromes. Visceral larva migrans, ocular larva migrans, and covert toxocarosis are described. Serodiagnostic techniques are reliable tools to detect antibodies or antigens. Systemic treatment with anthelmintics is described but can result in hypersensitivity reactions caused by dying larvae. For ocular lesions, laser photocoagulation and corticosteroid therapy are described. Preventive measures consist of preventing contamination of the environment with Toxocara eggs and for education of pet owners and non-pet owners to increase awareness about potential zoonotic hazards. Veterinary practitioners, general practitioners, and public health agencies should therefore provide sufficient information and advice.
