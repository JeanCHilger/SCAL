Radiation dosimetry for indium-111-pentetreotide. We present radiation dose estimates for 111In-pentetreotide.Kinetic data were gathered in 10 subjects at two different sites. A compartmental model was used to fit the data, including retention, in three major organs and excretion.The data were consistent for the subjects at both sites. The organ receiving the highest dose was the kidneys (0.52 mGy/MBq) the effective dose equivalent was 0.1 mSv/MBq, and the effective dose was 0.073 mSv/MBq.The results of this study provide the basis for evaluation of radiation safety of this drug.
