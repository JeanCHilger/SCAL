Imaging of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with Tc-99m MIBI. Differentiation of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) from radiation fibrosis using conventional diagnostic methods can be difficult. The authors prospectively studied patients with NPC to determine the efficacy of Tc-99m MIBI scintigraphy in detecting the primary, residual, and recurrent tumors.The authors performed Tc-99m MIBI SPECT studies of the head and neck and whole-body scans on 21 healthy adult volunteers and 43 patients with NPC before (n = 26) or after (n = 17) radiotherapy. The images were qualitatively assessed by comparing the nasopharyngeal uptake to scalp radioactivity. MIBI uptake index was calculated as a ratio of mean counts per pixel in the normal nasopharynx or tumor to mean counts per pixel in the scalp.There was significantly higher uptake of Tc-99m MIBI by NPC than normal nasopharynx and radiation fibrosis (P < .05). The authors determined the optimum cutoff MIBI uptake index value of 1.3 with a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, a negative predictive value of 96%, and an accuracy of 98% for diagnosing NPC.This study suggests that Tc-99m MIBI SPECT is useful for detecting primary NPC and for differentiating residual or recurrent tumor from radiation fibrosis. The authors propose the cutoff MIBI uptake index value of 1.3 for diagnosing NPC.
