Titanium bone-integrated implants in extraoral facial prosthetic rehabilitation: surgical planning and long-term follow-up. The authors report on their clinical experience in the reconstruction of complex facial deformities using titanium osseo-integrated implants for the retention of soft silicone prostheses. They also evaluate the importance of this surgical technique as a viable alternative to traditional reconstructive procedures using autologous grafts, both in patients with severe osteomuscular defects and corrective surgery of unsuccessful reconstruction operations. The patients who underwent implantation operations were studied by CT 3D and 99m Tc SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography) procedures to evaluate osseo-integration at 3 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 24 months. The study demonstrates that the radiation emission peaks three weeks after surgery with the maximum bone remodeling activity, and after the functional loading of the implants, 3 months after surgery. High uptake past the eight month after surgery has never been detected and must be considered abnormal. SPECT offers the possibility of obtaining a three dimensional reconstruction of the photon emission of selected structures. The use of these nuclear medicine methods in addition to traditional-type radiological procedures introduce new possibilities, although still in the clinical experimentation phase, for the long-term follow-up of the inserted implants in craniofacial rehabilitation.
