Identification, expression, and characterization of the pseudorabies virus DNA-binding protein gene and gene product. The pseudorabies virus (PRV) gene encoding a DNA-binding protein (DBP) was first identified in this study. The DBP gene has an open reading frame of 3531 nucleotides, capable of coding a 1177-amino-acid polypeptide of 125 kDa. The deduced DBP exhibits a conserved zinc-binding motif and a conserved DNA-binding region, suggesting the similar DNA-binding mechanism occurs among alphaherpesviral DBP homologs. To further identify the biochemical properties of PRV DBP, this protein was expressed in Escherichia coli by using a pET expression vector and purified to homogeneity. The PRV DBP binds cooperatively and preferentially to single-stranded DNA with no significant base preference, judged by agarose gel electrophoresis and competitive nitrocellulose filter binding assays. Taken together, these results suggest that PRV DBP may play an important role in PRV DNA replication by binding cooperatively and nonspecifically to single-stranded DNA that is formed during the replication origin unwinding and replication fork movement.
