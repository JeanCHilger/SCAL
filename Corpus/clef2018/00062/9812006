Postoperative uptake of Ga-67 in planar scintigraphy and SPECT after median sternotomy. Surgical alterations after median sternotomy can difficult the interpretation of scintigraphic images with Ga67. To analize the use of Ga67 scintigraphy in this patology, we wanted to know the Ga67 distribution in patients who had suffered median sternotomy. We studied 8 patients in the first month after median sternotomy without infection complication and performed planar images and SPECT. Ga67 showed uptake in liver, spleen and bone. Sternal uptake was greater or lesser than liver uptake but always showed an homogeneous distribution. No mediastinum uptake was observed. Surgical wound showed Ga67 uptake during the first week after sternotomy. To know the <normal> distribution of Ga67 in patients after median sternotomy allows the scan interpretation when we suspect infectous complications.
