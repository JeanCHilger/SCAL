Contribution of planar scintigraphy and SPECT with Ga-67 in the diagnosis of infectious complications after median sternotomy. The prognosis of infections complications after median sternotomy depends of precocious diagnoses and depth extension of infection. We wanted to analyze the use of 67Ga scintigraphy in this pathology, comparing planar studies an SPECT. We studied 22 patients with suspect of infection complication after median sternotomy, the final diagnoses were 5 mediastinitis, 10 osteomyelitis and 7 patients with other pathology. 67Ga scintigraphy diagnosed correctly the 5 mediastinitis, 9 of 10 osteomyelitis and descarted both pathology in the other 7 patients. Planar studies only were able to diagnose correctly 3 of 5 mediastinitis and the another 2 were correctly diagnosed by SPECT. 67Ga scintigraphy is useful in the diagnosis of infection complication after median sternotomy and SPECT is better than planar studies in the diagnosis of mediastinitis.
