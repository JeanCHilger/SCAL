Functional imaging of tremor. We review the insight that has been obtained from positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activation studies on the functional anatomy underlying different forms of tremor. The effects of treatment, both pharmacologic and interventional approaches, on the dysfunctional cerebral systems involved in tremor, also are considered. Finally, we speculate on the neuropharmacologic basis of different types of tremor based on available in vivo PET evidence.
