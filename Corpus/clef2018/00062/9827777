Parieto-occipital cortex activation during self-generated eye movements in the dark. A number of extrastriate visual areas in the parieto-occipital cortex are known from single-cell recordings of the macaque monkey to be involved in the coding of eye-position signals in the brain. These are important for the accurate location of visual objects in extrapersonal space. It can be predicted that these areas will show increased activation during the performance of eye movements at high frequency. In the present study PET and measurements of the regional distribution of cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were used as indirect measures of neural activity. Two independent groups of normal volunteers performed large-amplitude self-generated eye movements in complete darkness, thus removing the confounding effects of visual stimulation on parieto-occipital activation. The first group (group A n = 5) served as a hypothesis-generating group and the second group (group B
