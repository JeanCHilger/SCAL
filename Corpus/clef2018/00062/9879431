Monitoring of response to radiotherapy with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose PET of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. We examined the usefulness of positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) in determining the therapeutic effects of irradiation and chemotherapy on head and neck malignant tumors. Twenty-two patients with head and neck lesions who underwent histological examinations were studied. Squamous cell carcinoma was histologically diagnosed in all cases. Sixteen of them underwent radiotherapy with approximately 40 Gy in combination with carboplatin therapy. The remaining 6 patients underwent radiotherapy alone. After these treatments, 11 underwent surgery. For PET study, each patient was injected with intravenous FDG 185-370 MBq. We evaluated the degree of FDG accumulation using scanned images taken 40-55 min after the injection. We measured the standardized uptake value (SUV), a semiquantative evaluation, ROI activity divided by the dosage per weight of each patient. FDG-PET, CT and MRI were performed twice for each patient, before and after treatment. FDG uptake, but not the tumor size in CT or MRI, was significantly reduced in each patient after the treatment. Therefore, our findings have clearly demonstrated that FDG-PET provides for more valuable therapeutic outcomes than conventional imaging such as CT and MRI. FDG-PET should thus provide a new dimension in the management of head and neck malignant tumors.
