Cognitive and affective dysfunction in MS. Prevalence studies have shown cognitive and affective disorders to be common in multiple sclerosis (MS). Although much is known about the manifestations of such disorders, our knowledge of the cerebral systems involved remains poor. Functional techniques will enable cerebral blood flow to be measured, and sophisticated SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) techniques can provide a clearer picture of the dynamics of cognitive and affective processes in MS. Increased knowledge of these disorders would enable the management and rehabilitation of MS patients to be improved.
