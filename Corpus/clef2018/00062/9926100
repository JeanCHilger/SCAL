5-HT2A receptor blockade in patients with schizophrenia treated with risperidone or clozapine. A SPET study using the novel 5-HT2A ligand 123I-5-I-R-91150. 5-HT2A receptor antagonism may be crucial to the action of atypical antipsychotics. Previous work has related 5-HT2A receptor blockade to clinical efficacy and protection from extrapyramidal side-effects.We developed a SPET imaging protocol for assessing 5-HT2A receptor binding using the selective ligand 123I-5-I-R91150. Six healthy volunteers, five clozapine- and five risperidone-treated subjects with DSM-IV schizophrenia were studied. Multi-slice SPET was performed on each subject.Cortex:cerebellum ratios were significantly lower in both clozapine- and risperidone-treated subjects compared with the healthy volunteers in all cortical regions. There was no difference in occupancy between the two drug-treated groups. No correlation was found between the percentage change in the Global Assessment Scale (GAS) and 5-HT2A receptor binding indices in the drug-treated groups.Clozapine and risperidone potently block 5-HT2A receptors in vivo. The lack of relationship between receptor binding indices and change in GAS suggests that 5-HT2A receptor blockade may be unrelated to clinical improvement. Future studies will substantiate this finding by studying 5-HT2A receptor binding in large groups of patients treated with both typical and novel atypical antipsychotics.
