Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic traumatic epidural haematomas: comparison of the results of surgical and conservative management related to SPECT and neuropsychological tests. Preliminary results. One hundred and thirteen patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic epidural heamatomas treated surgically or conservatively in our department were collected prospectively. Between 3 and 6 months after the head injury a SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) study for evaluation of the three-dimensional cerebral blood flow distribution and extensive neuropsychological tests were performed in 22 patients. The preliminary results of this prospective study have demonstrated that minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic EDHs cause no pathologic SPECT findings and that neuropsychological impairment and duration of the haematoma do not affect the results of conservative management.
