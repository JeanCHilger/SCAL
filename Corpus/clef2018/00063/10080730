Comparison of planar and SPECT scintimammography with 99mTc-sestamibi in the diagnosis of breast carcinoma. To compare results of planar and SPECT breast imaging with 99mTc-MIBI in detecting primary breast cancer.Twenty-six consecutive patients with 34 suspected breast lesions underwent both planar and SPECT scintimammography. Ten minutes after injection of 700 MBq 99mTc-MIBI, 2 prone lateral projections were obtained, followed by a supine anterior projection. Forty minutes after injection, a SPECT study was done. All lesions were operated upon and verified with histopathology.A sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 88% of planar scintimammography in diagnosis of primary breast lesions were achieved. The corresponding values for SPECT were 61% and 64%.The diagnostic accuracy of planar scintimammography was not improved by using SPECT imaging.
