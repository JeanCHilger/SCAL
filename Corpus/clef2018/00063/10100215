Synthesis and in Vivo studies of [C-11]N-methylepibatidine: comparison of the stereoisomers. The carbon-11-labelled nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist N-methylepibatidine was evaluated in vitro and in vivo as a possible positron emission tomography (PET)-tracer for nicotinic receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). The racemic mixture and both enantiomers of N-methylepibatidine were compared. Biodistribution and metabolites for blood and brain of [C-11]N-methylepibatidine were determined in mice. Whole body rat PET data were acquired for both stereoisomers. The regional distribution of the N-methyl-(-)-epibatidine in the brain was determined by a PET scan in a pig. Characteristic differences were found for the in vivo behavior of the stereoisomers of [C-11]N-methylepibatidine.
