Prevalence of rhinitis, pillow type and past and present ownership of furred pets. There has been no previous work investigating the effects of furred pet ownership and pillow type on the risk of developing rhinitis. Recently, unexpected and unexplained associations of asthma with nonfeather pillows have been reported.We developed a questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey to determine whether the past or present ownership of cats or dogs, or the use of nonfeather pillows contributes to the development of seasonal or perennial rhinitis.We surveyed 2555 accompanying friends and relatives of patients attending the outpatients departments at one London hospital in 1996. Individuals with rhinitis were defined as those suffering with three or more symptoms of rhinitis either throughout the year (perennial) or for part of the year (seasonal). Present or childhood ownership of cats or dogs was recorded.A strong association was seen with nonfeather pillow use and both seasonal [odds ratio (OR) 1.85 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43-2.5] and perennial (OR 2.63Feather pillow use and the ownership of furred pets appears unlikely to increase the risk of developing perennial or seasonal rhinitis. In fact, in contrast with currently held views, there is evidence that the use of nonfeather pillows may increase the risk.
