Synthesis of 18F-FDG with FDG MicroLab system: basic studies for clinical application. We synthesized 18F-FDG by using an automated synthetic apparatus "FDG MicroLab" (GE Medical Systems) which produces 18F-FDG by a solid phase 18F-fluorination. Its quality and reproducibility were evaluated in order to assess feasibility of the apparatus for routine clinical production of 18F-FDG. For 5 consecutive 18F-FDG synthesis, target irradiation was carried out at 15 microA for 60 min. 18F-FDG was obtained in 50 min after EOB with an end-of-synthesis yield of 9.34 +/- 1.06 GBq. Radiochemical yield and radiochemical purity were 47 +/- 3% (decay corrected) and 98.0 +/- 0.5%, respectively. Other several quality control parameters tested conformed with "Standards of Compounds Labeled with Positron Nuclides" (RADIOISOTOPES, 44, 1995). Thus, the automated synthetic apparatus "FDG MicroLab" has proven to stably produce 18F-FDG with high yield and high purity. The apparatus is feasible for routine clinical production of 18F-FDG.
