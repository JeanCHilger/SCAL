Pattern of dopaminergic loss in the striatum of humans with MPTP induced parkinsonism. To examine the distribution of striatal dopaminergic function in humans with parkinsonism induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to determine if there is a caudate-putamen gradient as is seen in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.We scanned nine humans exposed to MPTP with parkinsonism ranging from minimal to severe using [(18)F]fluorodopa (FD) and high resolution PET. The results were compared with those of 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and six normal subjects.In the MPTP group there was an equal degree of reduction of dopaminergic function in the caudate and putamen. This was different from the greater putaminal than caudate loss in Parkinson's disease (p<0.001).Parkinson's disease is not caused by transient exposure to MPTP.
