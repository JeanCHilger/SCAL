Measurement of cerebral blood flow volume by extracranial sonography. Measurement of global cerebral blood flow (CBF) using extracranial duplex sonography has been described, but normal values are still lacking. In 85 healthy adults (median age 43.4 years, range 20 to 80 years), CBF was determined by duplex sonographic examination of both internal carotid arteries and vertebral arteries. The mean global CBF was 630+/-97 mL/min. Global CBF declined with age sex did not influence the total CBF. When measurements were repeated, the intraindividual variability was low. This noninvasive sonographic measurement of CBF is reproducible, and values correspond closely to those obtained with positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.
