Neural plasticity detected in short- and long-term cochlear implant users using PET. The interaction of listening to words and watching sign language in short-term and long-term cochlear implant (CI) users who have learned sign language after becoming deaf was measured using PET. In short-term CI users the auditory cortex was inactive while in long-term CI users it was fully activated with the simultaneous presentation of auditory and visual input. The result suggests the possibility that the interference of rival modalities may be diminished with experience and the preference switchover from the visual input to the auditory input could be accomplished by means of the neural plasticity persisting in the mature human auditory cortex.
