Immunization against GnRH in male species (comparative aspects). Active immunization against gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) was recognized in the 1970s as a potential means by which the reproductive system of mammals might be shut down for various practical and clinical reasons. Numerous studies in males have been performed since that time to determine the applicability of the technique as an alternative to surgical removal of the testes. Reasons for such immunocastration include improvement of meat and carcass characteristics for cattle, sheep, goats, and swine improvement in feed efficiency relative to castrates in those same species
