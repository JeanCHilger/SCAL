Chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction: myocardial hibernation?. Hibernating myocardium is a term which covers chronic ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction which is potentially reversible after revascularisation. Hibernating myocardium is classically associated with chronic hypoperfusion responsible for hypocontraction and cellular degeneration. This "classical" conception has been questioned as some workers emphasise that the reduction in coronary reserve responsible for repeated episodes of ischaemia and stunning could be the main causes of myocardial dysfunction. Position emission tomography (PET), and, most of all, myocardial scintigraphy and dobutamine echocardiography are the most commonly used techniques for detecting hibernating myocardium. Their sensitivity is good but the specificity and positive predictive value of dobutamine echocardiography seems to be better than the isotopic techniques. Structural abnormalities of hibernating myocardium and the delay, which is often long, between revascularisation and improvement, may explain some of the discordances between these techniques. Irrespective of the term used, hibernation or chronic ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction with myocardial viability, the reported data is in favour of coronary revascularisation with improved long-term quality of life and reduced mortality in patients with positive viability tests.
