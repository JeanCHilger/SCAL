D2 receptor imaging in neonates using I-123 iodobenzamide brain SPECT. Hypoxic-ischemic injury induces early changes in cerebral energy that later lead to the presence and extension of brain damage and subsequently to severe neurodevelopmental impairments such as the dyskinetic form of cerebral palsy, which is associated with damage to the striatum. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the viability of D2 receptors in the perinatal period using I-123 iodobenzamide brain SPECT and to correlate this with early neurologic status.After obtaining informed parental consent, 12 full-term neonates with hypoxic-ischemic events were included. I-123 iodobenzamide brain SPECT was performed 1 week after birth, corresponding to a gestational age of 39.2+/-1.7 weeks. Images were acquired using a brain-dedicated gamma camera 1 hour after intravenous injection of 30 MBq (0.8 mCi) I-123 iodobenzamide. Magnetic resonance images (T2 weighted sequence: repetition time/echo time: 2,000/30 to 150) of the brains of the same neonates were acquired on the same day.The right and left striatum:cerebellum activity ratios were between 1.28 and 2.25, with the greatest concentration of I-123 iodobenzamide occurring in the striatum area. A tendency of the striatum:cerebellum ratio to decrease was observed as the severity of the perinatal hypoxic-ischemic event increased despite striatal hypersignal on magnetic resonance imaging in only two neonates.This study, which confirms that I-123 iodobenzamide could be used in the neonatal period, shows the biochemical maturation of D2 receptors as early as 1 week after birth and also suggests the deleterious effect of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic events on D2 receptors.
