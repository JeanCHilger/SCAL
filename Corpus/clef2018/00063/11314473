Man-nature-technology. Philosophical considerations of human-animal-relations. Man's position in nature is equivocal. Man is part of nature and through evolution is linked to other living beings. Although an "Animal among Animals", nature has provided him with capabilities that separate him from all living beings in its realm. These comprise the ability for reflection and subsequent moral behavior, but also the gift (and necessity) for using technology to shape and subjugate his natural environment. Based upon this "Dual Nature of Man" the essay focuses on the web of interactions between Man, Nature and Technology. Modern ethics of animal protection argue in favor of extending the principle of equality ("To Each His Own") to include animals as well. However, the principle of equality is a purely formal, heuristic rule for assigning morally just determinations of value. It requires normative padding as far as its content is concerned. Consequently, the content of the principle of equality ought to be more closely determined in keeping with the ideal of humanity.
