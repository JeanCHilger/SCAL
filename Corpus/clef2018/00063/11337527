Automated PET attenuation correction model for functional brain imaging. The failure to compensate for subject motion between attenuation correction scans and emission scans precludes the optimization of functional brain imaging techniques. We have developed an automated method for attenuation correction that compensates for subject motion by deriving each set of correction factors from the corresponding emission study.The technique consists of generation of an estimated skull image by filtered backprojection of the reciprocal of an emission sinogram estimation of the thickness and radius of the skull on profiles extracted from the imageThe difference between the mean squared error for groups A and B was not significant (P>0.8), indicating that model parameters from a small group can be used for other subjects without further fitting. The mean squared error for the automated method was significantly lower than that of the ellipse method (P<0.001). The method reduced emission image variance, resulting in a higher peak Z value in activation images. The elimination of measured transmission scans resulted in a reduction in scan time ( approximately 15 min) and radiation exposure ( approximately 0.5-1.6 mrem).We have developed an automated attenuation correction method that compensates for subject motion between scans, accurately reproduces the characteristics of the head, and eliminates the use of measured transmission data to reduce scan duration, statistical noise propagation, and radiation dose.
