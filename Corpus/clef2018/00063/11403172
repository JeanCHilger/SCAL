Does inadequate exercise lower the accuracy of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy? The predictive accuracy of exercise myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (EMPS) in detecting coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients who fail to achieve an adequate level of exercise is not clear. This investigation was carried out in order to compare the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of EMPS in adequate exercise patients with those in inadequate exercise patients. We have retrospectively compared the results of EMPS with coronary angiography (CAG). One hundred and forty-eight patients with both tests within 6 weeks were included. Adequate exercise was defined as > or = 85% maximally predicted heart rate for age. The overall sensitivity and specificity of EMPS to detect CAD were 92.5% (74/80) and 75%, (51/68), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity in adequate exercise patients were 94.1% (32/34) and 67.6% (23/34), whereas those in inadequate exercise patients were 91.3% (42/46) and 82.4% (28/34). The accuracy was 80.9% (55/68) and 87.5% (70/80), respectively. Patients with inadequate exercise had lower sensitivity but higher specificity of EMPS for detecting CAD, and achieved a higher accuracy than those with adequate exercise.
