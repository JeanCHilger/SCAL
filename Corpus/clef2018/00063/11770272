(18F)-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose PET in imaging of gynecologic cancers. Although gynaecological cancers are not currently part of the clinical indications in the French registration for [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG), various studies indicate in this context a potential clinical benefit of imaging with this radiopharmaceutical and PET, a new imaging modality that can be performed either with a dedicated machine or with a "hybrid" gamma-camera (CDET). The potential indications of FDG-PET in mammary, ovarian or cervical cancers are reviewed according to the diagnostic phase: screening, tumour characterisation, staging, therapeutic follow-up and search for recurrence. By pooling the published results, the accuracy of FDG-PET could be estimated with a reasonable precision in various clinical settings: characterisation of a breast tumour (598/696 = 86%), lymph node invasion in breast cancer (525/602 = 87%), recurrence of breast cancer (114/127 = 90%), characterisation of adnexal masses (130/176 = 78%), recurrence of ovarian cancer (152/172 = 88%), lymph node invasion in cervical cancer (98/103 = 95%). Authors also present original data concerning their experience of recurrence detection with CDET in breast or ovarian cancers. In 44 patients suspicious of recurrence of breast cancer, FDG-CDET sensitivity was 94%, specificity 82% and accuracy 91% in 18 patients suspicious of recurrence of ovarian cancer, specificity, sensitivity and accuracy were 100%. The impact of dedicated PET and CDET examinations performed by our team during year 2000, led, according to 63 forms returned to us, to a modification of stage in 48% of breast cancers, 36% of ovarian cancers, 43% of cervical cancers and above all induced a modification in patients' management in respectively 69%, 64% and 60% of cases, more than the average rate in cancer patients which was 50%. No significant difference was observed between clinical impact of dedicated PET and CDET examinations.
