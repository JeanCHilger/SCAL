Whole-body positron emission tomography using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose for initial staging of patients with Hodgkin's disease. An accurate initial staging of patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) is important for the evaluation of clinical stage and risk factors, which are crucial for the choice of an appropriate treatment. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is useful for detecting active tumor tissue in patients with lymphoproliferative diseases and may contribute to conventional staging methods in patients with HD. Twenty-two patients who presented with newly diagnosed HD underwent conventional staging methods including computed tomography (CT) as well as FDG PET. Lesions apparent in FDG PET and CT were correlated to each other. Seventy-seven lesions were observed either in PET or CT or in both. In 48 (62%) lesions PET and CT were both positive. In 20 (26%) sites, PET was positive and CT negative. Of 22 patients (18%) 4 were upstaged due to these positive PET findings, and as a result one patient received a different therapeutic regimen. PET failed to detect nine (12%) CT-positive sites in six patients. Statistically, these data are reflected by a sensitivity for PET and CT of 88% and 74%, respectively. Specificity of both imaging modalities was 100%. PET can contribute valuable information as an additional staging examination and led to an upstaging in some patients with primary HD. However, PET should not be used as the only imaging modality as it failed to detect CT-positive, active tumor regions in some cases.
