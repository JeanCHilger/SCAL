Ambulatory blood pressure characteristics in normotensive and treated hypertensive older people. The objective of this study was to determine the normal values and characteristics of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and to describe the ABP level of treated hypertensive subjects in an older Finnish population. ABP was measured in 502 randomly selected subjects aged 64 years or over living in a Finnish municipality (mean age 70 years, range 64-87 years). A total of 211 subjects did not have blood pressure (BP) affecting medication. ABP measurements were taken every 30 min for 24 h, and the day- and night-time periods were diary-based. The results were that in untreated subjects, the average office BP was 134/82 +/- 16/9 (s.d.) mm Hg for men and 140/81 +/- 18/8 mm Hg for women. The 24-h average BP was 120/75 +/- 14/8 mm Hg (95th percentile upper limit 145/93 mm Hg) for men and 125/75 +/- 15/7 (95th = 154/89 mm Hg) for women. The daytime averages were 127/78 +/- 12/7 mm Hg (95th = 154/99 mm Hg) and 131/78 +/- 15/7 mm Hg (95th = 158/91 mm Hg) for men and women, respectively. The ABP daytime value of 130/83 mm Hg corresponded best to the office BP value of 140/90 mm Hg. All BP values were significantly higher in the treated hypertensive group compared to the normotensive group. Night-time BP was markedly lower than daytime BP, and no difference in circadian variability was found between the normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Both office and ambulatory BPs were significantly higher in women than in men. This study provides sex-specific normal values for ABP in a 64 to 87-year-old age group. The normal values of ABP were markedly lower than the office BP values. Hypertensives, even when treated, tended to have elevated values.
