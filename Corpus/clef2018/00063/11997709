Cortical areas mediating stereopsis in the human brain: a PET study. Using PET, we investigated the neural substrates of stereodepth perception in humans. The presentation of Julesz-type random-dot stereograms (RDS) produced significant rCBF elevations in Brodmann areas (BA) 18, 19 and 7, all in the right hemisphere. Activation foci were also found in both middle temporal areas (MT). These results demonstrate that, as in primates, cortical area MT and extrastriate areas are central to stereovision and that a network of predominant right hemispheric regions is recruited to meet visuo-spatial processing demands associated with horizontal binocular disparity inputs.
