A computer model of lung morphology to analyze SPECT images. Measurement of the spatial distribution of aerosol deposition in human lungs can be performed using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). To relate deposition patterns to real lung structures, a computer model of the airway network has been developed. Computer simulations are presented that are compatible with the analysis of SPECT images. Computational techniques that are consistent with clinical procedures are used to analyze airways by type and number within transverse slices of the lung volume. The computer models serve as customized templates, which when analyzed alongside gamma scintigraphy images, can assist in the interpretation of human test data.
