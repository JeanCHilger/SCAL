Neuroimaging and the progression of epilepsy. Several lines of evidence can be used to try to answer the question of whether epilepsy is a progressive disease, and whether persistent seizures, or the underlying process itself, cause neuronal injury. The results of clinical studies have been inconclusive. Neuroimaging studies offer a quantitative approach. In patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown volume reductions ipsilateral to the epileptic focus in hippocampal and extrahippocampal regions the former, in cross-sectional studies, increase with increasing epilepsy duration. Other factors associated with increasing hippocampal atrophy include a history of complex or prolonged febrile seizures, and generalized tonic-clonic seizure number. Positron emission tomography (PET) has shown supporting results. However, these studies have been cross-sectional rather than longitudinal. Preliminary results from prospective imaging studies using fluorodeoxyglucose PET and volumetric MRI show that patients with more recent seizure onset are less likely to have hypometabolism or volume loss than those with a long history of epilepsy. Alternate interpretations of these data include a possible progressive effect of epilepsy, or a tendency for patients with structural or functional findings at seizure onset to be more likely to develop uncontrolled epilepsy. In addition to the human studies that have been performed, parallel investigations in animal models using some of the same imaging techniques may help to unravel the factors associated with neuronal injury due to seizures, and aid in interpreting results of clinical studies.
