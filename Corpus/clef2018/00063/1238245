Allergies to animal hair in diseases of the upper respiratory tract (author's transl). Among 214 patients diagnosed in 1972 as being allergic to animal hair, 79 (48 women) were re-examined later. In almost all cases with a positive personal (33) or family history (26) of allergy there was a particularly rapid sensitization. The largest proportion of pathogenic allergens was from guinea pigs (39), cats (17), golden hamsters (11), rabbits (6), horses, dogs and budgerigars (2 each). 14 patients reacted to the main antigen alone in prick or intracutaneous tests, while in all other cases there were cross-reactions, most frequently to epithelium of sheep, cattle or horse. In interpreting intranasal provocation tests with the chief antigen, the degress of rhinorrhoea was particulary reliable (59 subjects). The most effective treatment was complete withdrawal of allergens: of 65 persons who removed their domestic pet or avoided contact with it, 32 were cured at once and a further 19 within about eight weeks. 14 subjects continued to have symptoms, but in half of these there was also house dust allergy, while others had resumed contact with domestic animals.
