Immunohistochemical-scintigraphic correlation of sympathetic cardiac innervation in postischemic left ventricular aneurysms. This study was conceived to explore the correspondence between scintigraphic imaging of the sympathetic innervation of human postischemic left ventricular aneurysms and direct immunohistochemical localization of the nerve fibers in the same area.In 7 patients undergoing left ventricular aneurysmectomy for postischemic ventricular aneurysm, the findings of thallium 201 and metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy were compared with direct immunohistochemical localization of the nerve fibers in the same area. This comparison showed good correspondence between scintigraphic and immunohistochemical data, although scintigraphy failed to detect areas of minimal sympathetic innervation. Moreover, microscopic analysis showed sympathetic nerve fibers with peculiar morphology and distribution in the aneurysmal zone.There is a good correspondence between immunohistochemical and scintigraphic imaging in the detection of sympathetic cardiac nerves in human left ventricular aneurysms a morphologically abnormal sympathetic reinnervation can be found in the aneurysmal area (although denervation can persist in some zones).
