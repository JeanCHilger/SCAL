The mean transit time and functional image in asialoglycoprotein receptor scintigraphy: a novel modality for evaluating the regional dynamic function of hepatocytes. In this study, we attempted to evaluate the regional dynamic function of hepatocytes by introducing unique parameters in (99m)Tc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-galactosyl-human serum albumin (99m)Tc-GSA) scintigraphy. (99m)Tc-GSA scintigraphy provides valuable information for the receptor population density. However, the conventional indices are the results of the analyses of 2 fixed points and, as a result, it is not possible to accurately estimate the regional dynamic function.We performed (99m)Tc-GSA scintigraphy 100 times on a total of 54 pediatric patients. The average age at examination was 7.4 +/- 5.8 y. Ninety-one of the 100 scintigraphy cases were available for this study. We converted the time-activity curve for the liver of (99m)Tc-GSA to a horizontal mirror image curve, and, on the basis of the height-over-area method, calculated the mean transit time (MTT) in each pixel and depicted the functional image as unique parameters, which were thus compared with the conventional indices. For these parameters, we used the time-activity curve for only the liver.The whole liver MTT showed a significant correlation with both the clearance (y = 590.3x + 10.3 r = 0.51The MTT and the functional image enable us to elucidate the regional dynamic function of hepatocytes both quantitatively and visually. In addition, this diagnostic modality can be used at virtually all medical institutions using a modified analytic program already in public use.
