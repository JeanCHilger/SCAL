Relationship between the axially lymph nodes metastases and the bone metastases in patients with the breast cancer. To investigate the relationship between the axially lymph nodes metastases and the bone metastases in patients with the breast cancer.Lymphadenotomy of the axially lymph nodes had been performed on patients with the breast cancer, and the excised axially lymph nodes were observed by pathological examination. All patients underwent postoperatively total bone scan with single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) periodically.Among 292 patients with the breast cancer, the bone metastatic rates of low and high differentiating tumor were 27.3% (6/22) and 45.2% (122/272) respectively, the bone metastatic rates in both tumors had no difference (P > 0.1). The bone metastatic rate was 54.3% (100/184) in patients suffered from the axially lymph nodes metastases, and 25.9% (28/108) in non-metastases patients respectively, the difference of their bone metastatic rates was significant (P < 0.001). The bone metastatic rate was 48.4% (62/128) in patients suffered from the metastases of axially lymph nodes after operation less 2 years, and 67.8% (38/56) after operation more than 2 years respectively, the difference of their bone metastatic rates was not significant (P < 0.5).There is no relationship between the bone matastatic rates and the pathological type of tumor. The bone metastatic rates of patients with the axially lymph nodes metastases are higher than those with non-metastases of axially lymph nodes. In addition, the bone metastatic rates of patients with the axially lymph nodes metastases increase with time prolongation.
