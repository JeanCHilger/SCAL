In-111 DTPA-octreotide scintigraphy for disease detection in metastatic thyroid cancer: comparison with F-18 FDG positron emission tomography and extensive conventional radiographic imaging. The utility of In-111 DTPA octreotide scintigraphy (SRS) for disease detection in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma (TCA) remains controversial. The authors compared the sensitivity of In-111-based SRS, F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), and extensive conventional radiographic imaging (CRI) in this type of cancer.SRS, FDG PET, and CRI were performed concurrently in 21 patients (age, 56.4 +/- 12.9 years) who had aggressive TCA. Concordance rates % of lesion positivity among pairs of different techniques (A and B) were calculated as the ratio of the number of lesions positive with both techniques divided by the sum of the total number of lesions positive with technique A + total number of lesions positive with technique B, which was then multiplied by 200.The combined use of CRI, FDG PET, and SRS resulted in the detection of 105 lesions, presumed to be due to metastatic deposits. Sensitivities for SRS and FDG-PET imaging were 49.5% and 67.6%, respectively. The lesion detection concordance rates were as follows: CRI versus FDG PET, 80.8% CRI versus SRS, 74.2%Although SRS has only moderate sensitivity for disease detection in metastatic TCA, sometimes it can reveal lesions that otherwise would be undetectable by either CRI or FDG-PET imaging.
