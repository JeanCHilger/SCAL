Positron emission and computed X-ray tomography: a coming together. We describe the introduction of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to the investigation of patients with cancer. The first such unit in the UK and its mode of operation is discussed and initial applications shown. Five hundred and thirty-five patients have been scanned with 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose from mid-January 2002 to the end of August 2002. From this initial experience a clear view of the impact of this technology is emerging. It can now be stated that (1) PET/CT does speed up the throughput of patient studies by at least 25% and hence adds to the comfort of patients scanned and (2) PET/CT leads to greater accuracy in the interpretation of data. In view of the routine availability of high quality PET and CT fused maps a significant development in radiotherapy planning is on the horizon. We discuss our experience at present and point to further developments in the near future.
