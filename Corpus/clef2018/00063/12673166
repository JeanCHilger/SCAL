Impaired cardiac response to exercise in post-menopausal women: relationship with peripheral vascular function. Endothelial dysfunction has been demonstrated in post-menopausal women. To assess the relationship between peripheral vascular reserve and cardiac function during exercise in post-menopausal women, 91 subjects, who had no ischaemic findings on myocardial SPECT, were assigned to four groups: pre-menopausal women (n=13), post-menopausal women (n=33), younger men aged < or =50 years (n=10), and older men aged >50 years (n=35). First-pass radionuclide angiography was performed before and during bicycle exercise to calculate ejection fraction (EF) and peripheral vascular resistance (VR). There were no differences in haemodynamic variables among the groups at baseline. The per cent increase in EF=(exercise EF - resting EF)x100/resting EF, and the per cent decrease in VR=(resting VR - exercise VR)x100/resting VR were depressed in the post-menopausal women (0.4+/-2% and 35+/-3%, respectively) compared to the pre-menopausal women (10+/-3% and 47+/-3%, respectively P<0.05 each). Although the age dependent impairment is thought to cause this depression, neither the per cent increase in EF nor the per cent decrease in VR in the older men was significantly different from that in the younger men. Post-menopausal women exhibited depressed cardiac function during exercise, which may be related to the impairment of peripheral vascular function after menopause.
