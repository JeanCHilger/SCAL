Assessment of intermediate stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery with contrast-enhanced transthoracic Doppler echocardiography. Visual or quantitative assessment of coronary angiography may not exactly predict the physiological significance of intermediate (40-70%) coronary stenosis. Coronary flow reserve is a well-established marker of the functional significance of coronary stenosis.The aim of this study was to compare the coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) using contrast-enhanced transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (CE-TTDE) with thallium-201 imaging in assessment of intermediate lesions in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD).A consecutive series of 50 patients with intermediate stenosis in the LAD underwent pharmacological stress thallium-201 imaging and CFVR measured by CE-TTDE.CFVR could be measured in 49 of 50 patients by the present method. A CFVR <2.0 predicted the presence of a stress thallium defect in 12 of 14 patients (agreement=90%, kappa=0.76, P < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of CFVR for stress thallium-201 results were 86 and 91%, respectively. In contrast, significant stenosis (>50% by diameter) showed fair agreement for stress thallium defects (agreement=59%, kappa=0.28, P < 0.05).In the evaluation of intermediate lesions in the LAD, CFVR as assessed by CE-TTDE could accurately predict the presence of ischemia on stress thallium imaging, whereas angiographic stenosis did not yield reliable results.
