Cerebral regions processing first- and higher-order motion in an opposed-direction discrimination task. Using PET, we studied the processing of different types of motion in an opposed-direction discrimination task. We used first-order motion and two types of higher-order motion (presented as moving gratings with stripes defined by flickering texture and kinetic boundaries, respectively). In these experiments, we found that all types of motion activate a common set of cortical regions when comparing a direction discrimination task to a detection of the dimming of the fixation point. This set includes left hV3A, bilateral hMT/V5+ and regions in the middle occipital gyrus, bilateral activations in the posterior and anterior parts of the intraparietal sulcus, bilateral precentral gyrus, medial frontal cortex and regions in the cerebellum. No significant differences were observed between different types of motion, even at low statistical thresholds. From this we conclude that, under our experimental conditions, the same cerebral regions are involved in the processing of first-order and higher-order motion in an opposed-direction discrimination task.
