Cerebral glucose metabolism and early EEG/aEEG in term newborn infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. The objective was to investigate how early electrocortical background pattern, as recorded with amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG), correlates with global and regional cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRgl) measured by positron emission tomography during the subacute phase after birth asphyxia. Nineteen term infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy were investigated. The aEEG background was evaluated at 0-6, 6-12, 12-24, 24-48, and 48-72 h postnatal age, and classified into four categories according to increasing degree of abnormality. The aEEG were also evaluated for sleep-wake cycling and epileptic seizure activity. CMRgl was measured by positron emission tomography with 2-(18F) fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose at a median (range) postnatal age 10 (4-24) d. Increasing degree of abnormality in aEEG correlated significantly with decreasing CMRgl: at 6-12 h (-0.593 0.012) (r value
