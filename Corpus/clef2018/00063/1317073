Prevalence of feline immunodeficiency virus and other retroviral infections in sick cats in Italy. Two hundred and seventy-seven sick pet cats living in Italy were tested for antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen. Overall, 24% of the cats resulted positive for anti-FIV antibody and 18% for FeLV antigen. FIV was isolated from the peripheral mononuclear blood cells of ten out of 15 seropositive cats examined and from one out of eight saliva samples. No FIV isolations were obtained from six serum samples cultured. Feline syncytium forming virus (FeSFV) could be isolated from blood and/or saliva in ten out of 11 FIV seropositive cats examined, in six out of nine FeLV antigen positive cats, in two cats found positive for both infection markers, and in three out of 11 cats negative for both markers. Thus, the probability of isolating FeSFV was enhanced by infection with other exogenous retroviruses.
