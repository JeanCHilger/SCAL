Functional imaging of epileptic foci with PET and SPECT. Functional imaging with PET and SPECT provides valuable information, helping lateralize and localize the site of an epileptogenic focus. SPECT imaging has been somewhat hampered by lower resolution than PET, and the lack of true "metabolic" radiopharmaceuticals, however SPECT perfusion studies may also help localize the seizure focus. At present, PET metabolic imaging with FDG is the most sensitive functional imaging modality for identifying epileptogenic foci. However with the current availability, lower cost and improved visualization, the diagnostic and prognostic efficacy of SPECT should increase.
