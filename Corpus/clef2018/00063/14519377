Chemoreflex control of ventilation is altered during wakefulness in humans with OSA. We hypothesized that patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have a different awake ventilatory response to carbon dioxide above and below eupnea compared with normal. Eight male subjects with OSA and control subjects matched for gender, race, age, height and weight voluntarily hyperventilated during wakefulness to reduce the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PET(CO2)) below 25 mmHg. Subjects were then switched into a rebreathing bag containing a normocapnic (42 mmHg) hypoxic [partial pressure of end tidal oxygen (PET(O2))=50 mmHg (H50)] or hyperoxic [PET(O2)=140 mmHg (H140)] gas mixture. During the trial PET(CO2) increased while PET(O2) was maintained at a constant level. The point at which ventilation and PET(CO2) increased linearly was considered to be the carbon dioxide ventilatory recruitment threshold (VRT(CO2)). Measurements of ventilation and its components (i.e. tidal volume and breathing frequency) were made below this threshold and the slope of the minute ventilation tidal volume or breathing frequency response above the threshold was determined. Four trials for a given oxygen level were completed. The PET(CO2) that demarcated the VRT(CO2) was increased (H(50)=43.43+/-0.92 vs. 41.05+/-0.67
