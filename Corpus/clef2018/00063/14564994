Research in synthesis of bioactive peptide RGD and the method for its grafting on PET surface. The aim of this experiment is to graft synthesizing Arg-Gly-Asp peptides (RGD) on the surface of polymer materials, combine endothelial cells with its special site, enhance the adhesion of endothelial cells on the surface, promote the blood compatibility of the biomaterials. Carboxy group (-COOH) was grafted on the materials surface by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and the RGD serial obtained by liquid phase synthesis was successfully grafted on the disposed materials by chemical reaction. The endothelialization experiment was made also. The grafting results were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and endothelialization was observed using optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results indicated that the method improves the effect of materials endothelialization. The experiment has made successful use of UV grafting and chemical coupling methods to graft bioactive RGD onto PET film surface. This is a new method of grafting bioactive peptide.
