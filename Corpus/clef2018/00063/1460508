c-erbB2 protein overexpression in breast cancer as a target for PET using iodine-124-labeled monoclonal antibodies. ICR 12, one of a panel of rat monoclonal antibodies recognizing the external domain of the human c-erb B2 proto-oncogene product, (Styles, 1990) was chosen as a candidate for radiolabeling with 124I for positron emission tomography of selected patients with breast cancer. By using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), optimal labeling conditions were established using 125I. The labeling efficiency was determined using instant thin-layer chromatography (ITLC) and gel filtration (HPLC). The antibody was then labeled with the positron emitter 124I, and a labeling efficiency of 96% and immunoreactivity of 80%-90% was obtained. The product was stable, with less than 5% of the radiolabel being eluted after six days storage in plasma at 37 degrees C. Immunolocalization studies were performed in athymic mice bearing human breast carcinoma xenografts overexpressing the c-erb B2 gene product using as controls 125I labeled isotype-matched rat antibody, and antigen-negative tumors. Good uptake of 124I-labeled ICR12 was obtained in c-erb B2 expressing tumors (up to 12% injected dose per gram at intervals up to 120 hr), with localization indices of 3.4-6.2. Tumor xenografts of 6 mm diameter were successfully imaged with high resolution at 24, 48 and 120 hr using the RMH/ICR MUP-PET camera. We suggest that 124I-labeled ICR12 is a suitable agent to image and quantify immunolocalization in patients whose tumors overexpress the c-erb B2 proto-oncogene product.
