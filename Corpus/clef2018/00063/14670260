From the municipal dog pound to the pet shelter in Barcelona, Spain. This article aims to present changes in public health policy and services related to pet dogs and cats in the city of Barcelona from 1983 to 2001. Initially the center's activity was limited to the custody and euthanasia of stray animals, serving not only the city but also the rest of the province. With the formulation of a city Plan for Pet Animals, the activities were redirected, concentrating on services within the city limits and stimulating adoption. Participation of both professional and humane organizations was sought, premises were renovated, responsible ownership of animals was promoted, controlled urban colonies of cats were established, and adoptions become the cornerstone of policy, centering the activity of the shelter toward its clients. Changes in the shelter's activity since 1998 reflects a clear decrease in the number of animals retained, as well as in the proportion subjected to euthanasia. This decrease may reflect an improvement in the problem of stray animals. These developments have also resulted in a positive change in the relationship with the media and animal welfare organizations.
