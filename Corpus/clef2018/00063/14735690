Usefulness of thallium-201 SPECT scintimammography to differentiate benign from malignant breast masses in mammographically dense breasts. The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of thallium-201 (Tl-201) single-photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) scintimammography to differentiate benign from malignant breast masses in 32 female Taiwanese patients with indeterminate mammographic probability of malignancy because of mammographically dense breasts. All breast masses were removed, and final histopathological diagnoses were obtained in all cases. The results showed that thallium-201 SPECT scintimammography findings were true-positive in 22 cases, false-positive in 1 case, true-negative in 7 cases, and false-negative in 2 cases. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 91.7%, 87.5%, and 90.6%, respectively, for detecting breast cancer in mammographically dense breasts. In conclusion, thallium-201 SPECT scintimammography is a useful tool for differentiating benign from malignant breast masses in patients with indeterminate mammograms because of mammographically dense breasts.
