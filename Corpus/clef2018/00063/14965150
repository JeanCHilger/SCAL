Deficiencies of product labeling directions for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. To identify potential deficiencies in product labeling (package insert) instructions for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals.Preparation instructions, which include both reconstitution and quality control (QC) directions, as stated in the package inserts were evaluated for all commercially available reconstituted radiopharmaceuticals. Reviews of the package inserts were initially performed by each author, and then all identified deficiencies were compiled and evaluated by all authors. The preparation scenario for each package insert evaluated was based on a centralized nuclear pharmacy operation assuming typical support personnel, standard operating equipment, and workload.The instructions as stated in each package insert for the preparation (including QC) were rated as inadequate if a satisfactory preparation could not be prepared by a nuclear pharmacist or physician when instructions were followed exactly.Identified deficiencies in package insert instructions for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals fell into the following five categories: (1) absent or incomplete directions (especially with regard to QC procedures) (2) restrictive directions (e.g., specific requirement to use designated needles, chromatography solvents, counting devices), (3) inconsistent directions (e.g., different reconstituted volumes for the same final drug product, unworkable expiration times)Manufacturers' directions for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals often contain deficiencies and should be viewed as standard guidance rather than as requirements. Just as physicians are permitted to use U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs for off-label indications, nuclear pharmacists should be allowed to use alternative methods for preparing radiopharmaceuticals, provided those methods have been validated to be as good as the stated directions and that the nuclear pharmacists do not engage in activities that fall outside the normal practice of pharmacy. Manufacturers, FDA, nuclear pharmacists, and nuclear physicians should work together to address identified deficiencies in package insert directions.
