Lithiation of functionalized fluoroquinolines: synthesis of dihalo-2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxamides and in vitro evaluation as NK-3 receptor ligands for medical imaging studies. Fluoroiodo-2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxamides, analogues of NK-3 antagonist SB 223412, were synthesized and evaluated as NK-3 ligands with the aim of developing radioligands suitable for both Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) studies. The key step utilizes metalation directed by the fluorine atom for iodination of the quinoline ring.
