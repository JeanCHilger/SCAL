Longitudinal cerebral perfusion decrease in mild alzheimer's disease revealed by SPECT with statistical parametric mapping method. Fifteen patients with mild Alzheimer's disease received baseline and follow-up technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime SPECT examinations paired with neuropsychological assessments, including the Cognitive Ability Screening Instruments (CASI). The differences between baseline and follow-up SPECT images were analyzed by the voxel-based paired t test of the statistical parametric mapping technique. A simple regression analysis was also conducted to analyze the correlation between CASI sub-scores and both sets of SPECT images. In comparison with baseline images, cerebral perfusion at follow-up was significantly reduced in the left superior and middle temporal gyri, right middle and inferior temporal gyri, and right fusiform gyrus. A significant correlation was demonstrated between the list-generating fluency CASI sub-score and perfusion of the left fusiform gyrus. The visual construction sub-score was significantly correlated with perfusion of the right superior and medial frontal gyri.
