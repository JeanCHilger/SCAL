18F]FDG-PET in patients with Alzheimer's disease: marker of disease sprea. It is not known yet whether temporoparietal glucose hypometabolism in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) reflects disease severity or different subtypes of patients.Twenty-five subjects with mild probable AD [NINCDS-ADRDA criteria age 65.8 +/- 9.3 years (mean +/- SD)Thirteen of 25 patients showed temporoparietal hypometabolism on visual inspection (PET+ age 65.7 +/- 10.7), 12 patients had normal FDG-PET results (PET-Temporoparietal glucose metabolism in patients with very mild AD is a sign of disease spread beyond the temporal lobe. This may aid in establishing objective parameters for future therapeutic studies.
