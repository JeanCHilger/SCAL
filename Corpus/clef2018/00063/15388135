Analysis of potassium spectra with low counting statistics using trapezoidal and library least-squares methods. Potassium spectra with low counting statistics were measured with a NaI detector from a water phantom, simulating a brain, and were analyzed for error propagation in determination of K employing either the Trapezoidal Method or the Library Least-Squares method. We demonstrate, using measured and synthetic spectra, that a smaller error is obtained in the analysis of potassium when using the Library Least-Squares method.
