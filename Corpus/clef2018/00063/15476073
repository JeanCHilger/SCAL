Ischemic cerebrovascular disease in childhood: cognitive assessment of 15 patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate and to compare the cognitive function of children with ischemic cerebrovascular disease (ICVD). Fifteen children, 7 girls and 8 boys, aged 7.9 to 16.1 years, were evaluated by Piaget's clinical method. The control group was composed by fifteen children whose ages, sex and socioeconomic conditions were similar to those of the ICVD group. The cognitive function evaluation of the ICVD group showed that most of the children (10/15) were under their age group. The SPECT was performed on 14 children with ICVD and the results showed that 8/9 children with hypoperfusion presented a poor cognitive estimation and 3/5 children with normal perfusion demonstrated an adequate performance. We conclude that ICVD in childhood may compromise cognition therefore, it needs a follow up of acquisitions during alI the stages of development.
