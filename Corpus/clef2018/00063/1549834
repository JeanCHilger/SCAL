Owner and dog: like seeks like?. The aim of this investigation was to find out whether there are similarities or differences between the personality of the dog owner and the character of his of her dog. Ten owners of four different breeds of dog (40 owners in total) participated in this investigation. Some of the findings indicate resemblances in the character of the owners of certain breeds of dog. However to test the significance of these results more respondents are needed and a uniform character test for the dogs must be used.
