A rational regulatory approach for positron emission tomography imaging probes: from "first in man" to NDA approval and reimbursement. We propose a new regulatory approach for positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging probes, essential tools in today's medicine. Even though the focus of this paper is on positron-emitting labeled probes, it is also justified to extend this proposed regulatory approach to other diagnostic nuclear medicine radiopharmaceuticals. Key aspects of this proposal include: (1) PET molecular imaging probes would be placed in a "no significant risk" category, similar to that category for devices in current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, based on overwhelming scientific evidence that demonstrates their faultless safety profile (2) the FDA-sanctioned Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC) will oversee all diagnostic research with these probes. The newly defined RDRC should approve "first in man" use
