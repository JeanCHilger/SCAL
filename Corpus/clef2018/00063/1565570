L-18F-dopa-PET in Parkinson-plus syndromes for the detection of a disordered presynaptic dopaminergic function. PET examinations using L-18F-DOPA were performed on 14 patients with Parkinsonism-plus syndromes (PPLUS). A rate constant Ki was calculated by a graphical method using an arterial input function. Sequential PET images were obtained and no specific activity was measured both in cortical and cerebellar background regions. These results were compared with those in 20 normal controls and tested for intra- and interobserver variability. All patients with PPLUS showed reduced Ki values with a mean of 0.154 (ml/striatum/min), whereas controls exhibited Ki values with a mean of 0.690 (ml/striatum/min) using cortical background regions. The correlation coefficient was calculated to be r = 0.973 for the intraobserver variability and r = 0.879 for the interobserver variability in controls, and r = 0.989 or = 0.973 in PPLUS, resp. There was no significant difference in the Ki values for cortical and cerebellar background regions (p = 0.1). PET examinations using L-18F-DOPA can reliably assess the extent of nigrostriatal degeneration in vivo. Since this radiotracer binds irreversibly within the striatum PET examinations allow the quantification of a disturbed dopaminergic function which is observer-independent.
