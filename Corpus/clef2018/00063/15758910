18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography has limited sensitivity for colonic adenoma and early stage colon cancer. 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) is used clinically to detect recurrent colon cancer after surgical resection, but the sensitivity of PET for premalignant colon lesions and early stage colon cancer is not well defined.In a prospective study, 45 patients with a total of 58 colonic neoplasms, including premalignant polyps, premalignant, flat lesions, and early stage cancers, were evaluated by PET.The sensitivity of PET for cancer was 62% (8/13). PET detected 100% (7/7) of cancers 2 cm or larger but only 17% (1/6) of cancers smaller than 2 cm. PET detected 23% (3/13) of flat, premalignant lesions 70% (7/10) of protruded, premalignant lesions 3 cm or largerPET has limited sensitivity for flat, premalignant lesions protruded, premalignant lesions smaller than 3 cm
