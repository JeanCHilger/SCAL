Effect of intra-arterial chemotherapy of head and neck tumors on cerebral blood circulation. A combination of Cisplatin and Epirubicin was administered through the external carotid artery system according to a standard protocol as preoperative or palliative therapy in 14 oral cancer patients. With the aim of clarifying the subacute side-effects of this chemotherapy on the intracerebral circulation, rCBF SPECT investigations with 99mTc-HMPAO were performed before and after the cytostatic treatment. The interval between SPECT studies was 24 (SD +/- 12) days. In concordance with the neurological condition, visual assessment of the rCBF SPECT reconstructed transversal slices revealed no perfusion abnormalities and no changes on the follow-up. No significant changes were found in the side activity ratios in 22 regions of each hemisphere (unpaired t-test) in the whole group of patients. It was concluded that within the investigated time interval this highly effective combination of cytostatics administered perfectly through the external carotid artery system causes no serious disturbances in the cerebral circulation in oral cancer cases.
