N-[18F] fluoroethylpiperidin-4ylmethyl acetate, a novel lipophilic acetylcholine analogue for PET measurement of brain acetylcholinesterase activity. The reduction of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the brain has been measured in dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies using (11)C-labeled acetylcholine analogues, N-[(11)C]methylpiperidin-4-yl acetate and propionate, and positron emission tomography (PET). Our aim was to develop an (18)F-labeled acetylcholine analogue useful for brain AChE mapping with PET, since (18)F, with a longer half-life, has advantages over (11)C. In a preliminary study, a series of N-[(14)C]ethylpiperidin-3-yl or -4-ylmethanol esters (acetyl and propionyl esters) were newly designed and evaluated in vitro regarding the reactivity with and specificity to AChE using purified human enzymes, leading to a novel (18)F-labeled acetylcholine analogue, N-[(18)F]fluoroethylpiperidin-4-ylmethyl acetate. In rat experiments, the (18)F-labeled candidate showed desirable properties for PET AChE measurement: high brain uptake of the authentic ester, high AChE specificity, a moderate hydrolysis rate, and low membrane permeability (metabolic trapping) of the metabolite.
