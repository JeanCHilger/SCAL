Orbital gallium-67 scintigraphy in Graves' ophthalmopathy: a disease activity parameter that predicts the therapeutic response to immunosuppressive treatment. In this study, orbital gallium-67 citrate ((67)Ga) scintigraphy was evaluated as a disease activity parameter that can predict the therapeutic response to immunosuppressive treatment in Graves' ophthalmopathy. Orbital scintigraphic analysis was performed on 32 patients demonstrating moderate to severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were obtained 48 hours after intravenous injection of 148 MBq of radioactive (67)Ga complex, and orbit/occipital (O/Occ) ratios were calculated to correct the background activity. Intravenous methylprednisolone was given as immunosuppressive treatment to 24 patients (group 1) and 8 patients were followed up without any treatment and evaluated as controls (group 2). Orbital (67)Ga scintigraphy was repeated in all patients after 6 months to analyze the changes in clinical findings and orbital (67)Ga accumulation. In Group 1, the mean +/- standard deviation (SD) (67)Ga O/Occ ratio of responders (2.23 +/- 0.2, 16 cases) was statistically different from nonresponders (1.49 +/- 0.1, 8 cases, p < 0.001). Additionally, the corticosteroid treatment provided a significant decrease in orbital (67)Ga accumulation in responders (p < 0.001), however, it did not change statistically in nonresponders (p:0.13). In group 2, the patients did not demonstrate clinical improvement and orbital (67)Ga uptake did not change after the follow-up period (p:0.81). The receiver-operator-characteristic curve showed that the best threshold for discriminating responder and nonresponder groups was 1.70 (sensitivity, 94% specificity, 88%). This study demonstrated that orbital (67)Ga scintigraphy may be a useful imaging technique in predicting the therapeutic response to immunosuppressive treatment in Graves' ophthalmopathy.
