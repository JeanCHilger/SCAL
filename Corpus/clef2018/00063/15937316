D2 receptor occupancy during high- and low-dose therapy with the atypical antipsychotic amisulpride: a 123I-iodobenzamide SPECT study. Amisulpride appears to be an effective agent for treating positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia, depending on dose. The aim of this study was to assess striatal dopamine D(2) receptor availability by means of (123)I-iodobenzamide (IBZM) SPECT in patients treated with high and low doses of this atypical antipsychotic drug.Twenty-nine patients (19 men and 10 women, age range, 19-68 y) with schizophrenia treated with high doses (15 patients 400-1,200 mg/dIn all patients treated with amisulpride, specific binding of (123)I-IBZM to D(2) receptors was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than in healthy controls (0.95). Both groups treated with amisulpride differed significantly in specific binding of (123)I-IBZM to dopamine D(2) receptors (0.20 vs. 0.31, P < 0.05). D(2) receptor blockade correlated well with the administered dose of amisulpride and with amisulpride plasma concentration.Our findings suggest that amisulpride treatment leads to a significant occupancy of postsynaptic dopamine D(2) receptors. The blockade of D(2) receptors tends to be significantly lower in patients receiving low-dose amisulpride therapy than in patients receiving high-dose therapy.
