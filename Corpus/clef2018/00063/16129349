Ten things I wish I'd learned at university. To many veterinarians, it may seem that university did not equip or prepare them adequately to deal with exotic animals. In fact, the opposite is true--graduate veterinarians have been trained as problem-solvers and doers. By applying the knowledge and skills learned at University, most veterinarians are more than capable of providing quality medical services to exotic pet owners. Veterinarians wishing to take this further need to accept that they have some learning to do and experience to gain. Those with a true love and affinity for exotic animals will be able to develop their skills and achieve proficiency and competency in one of the most exciting and fast-growing fields of veterinary medicine today.
