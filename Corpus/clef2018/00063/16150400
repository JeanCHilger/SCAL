Imaging in CNS lupus. The diagnosis of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is complex not only on account of the heterogeneous nature of neurological presentation but also because of the difficulty of differentiating lupus-related pathology from other neuropsychiatric diseases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains the gold standard for the non-invasive assessment of NPSLE but there are problems, both with sensitivity and specificity. Both T(2) quantitation and the use of gadolinium have shown promise in differentiating acute from chronic lesions. Nonetheless, the lack of sensitivity of conventional MRI has led to the exploration of other MR-based techniques. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows the measurement of brain metabolites, whereas diffusion weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging allow assessment of white matter structure and integrity. MRS studies in NPSLE have consistently shown a reduction in N-acetyl aspartate (a neuronal marker). Diffusion weighted imaging has had only limited application in lupus and the results to date have shown abnormal diffusivity in lupus patients consistent with inflammation and loss of white matter structure. These techniques remain research tools at this early stage. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have also been explored as functional imaging tools in lupus and both appear to be more sensitive in detecting subtle brain changes in NPSLE but there are issues with specificity which deter their use in the clinical setting.
