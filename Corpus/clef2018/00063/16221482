Conventional and thermophilic aerobic treatability of high strength oily pet food wastewater using membrane-coupled bioreactors. Although thermophilic treatment systems have recently gained considerable interest, limited information exists on the comparative performances of membrane-coupled bioreactors (MBR) at thermophilic and conventional conditions. In this study aerobic MBRs operating at room temperature (20 degrees C) and at lower thermophilic range (45 degrees C) were investigated for the treatment of dissolved air flotation (DAF) pretreated pet food wastewater. The particular wastewater is characterized by oil and grease (O & G) concentrations as high as 6 g/L, COD of 51 g/L, BOD of 16 g/L and volatile fatty acid (VFA) of 8.3 g/L. The performances of the two systems in terms of COD, BOD and O & G removal at varying hydraulic retention time (HRT) are compared. COD removal efficiencies in the thermophilic MBR varied from 75% to 98% and remained constant at 94% in the conventional MBR. The O & G removal efficiencies were 66-86% and 98% in the thermophilic and conventional MBR, respectively. Interestingly, high concentrations of VFA were recorded, equivalent to 50-73% of total COD, in the thermophilic MBR effluent. The observed yield in the thermophilic MBR was 40% of that observed in the conventional MBR.
