Clinical utility of fused 67Ga SPECT/CT scan images in patients with lymphoma. The aim of this work is to show the clinical utility of the fused SPECT 67Ga/CT images in patients with lymphoma.44 patients (22 male) with lymphoma have been studied. 22 with Hodgkin's disease and 22 with non Hodgkin lymphoma. 59 studies were performed (33 thorax-cervical [T], 24 abdomen [A] and 2 skull-cervical area [SC]) with an hybrid gammacamera Millenium VG. We acquire consecutively a whole body scan, a SPECT and a CT, for its fusion with the SPECT, of the affects areas. The images were evaluated by two experts blinded, who classify the contribution of the fusion of images respect to the SPECT like: non changes, it improves the location or changes the extension of the injuries and it changes the staging. Final lesion location was confirmed by a high resolution CT performed within one month.32/59 studies did not change the location or extension of the injuries (20T, 12A), 23/59 studies changed the location or extension of the injuries (12T, 9A and 2 SC) and on 4/59 the change of location induced a change of staging respect to showed by the SPECT.To make fused SPECT 67Ga/CT images in patients with lymphoma allows improving the diagnostic precision in a 46% of the cases, mainly in the abdominal, bone and of the diaphragmatic area studies.
