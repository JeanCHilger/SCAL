The anterior mediastinum: anatomy and imaging procedures. The mediastinum is divided into compartments (anterior, middle, posterior) on the basis of lateral chest radiographs. Several anatomical and radiological classifications of the mediastinum are reported in the literature. Most mediastinal abnormalities are initially suspected following chest radiography the need for further investigation and the most appropriate imaging modality are largely dictated by the tentative diagnosis made on this examination. Although routine chest radiography initiates the evaluation of mediastinal disorders, it is rarely diagnostic: notable exceptions are teeth or bones within a mass, which are diagnostic of a teratoma
