Use of the peritoneal equilibration test in pediatric dialysis patients. The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) has been used in adult peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients to determine PD efficiency and optimal dialysis prescription. To investigate its usefulness in pediatric PD patients, we performed the PET in 10 patients divided into 2 groups: 3 patients less than 2 years of age (group 1) and 7 patients aged 5 to 17 years (group 2). The PET was performed after an overnight dwell by standard protocol with an overnight dialysate sample and 6 dialysate samples during the 4 hour test. Dialysate to plasma (D/P) ratios were calculated for creatinine (Cr), urea, and protein. D/PCr over time was similar in both pediatric groups compared to adults. D/P urea over time was lower in both pediatric groups compared to published adult data. D/P protein over time was markedly increased in both pediatric groups and was highest in the smallest patients. D/P ratios are different in pediatric PD patients compared to adults. In order to be used to assess dialysis efficiency, normal values for the PET test in children need to be established.
