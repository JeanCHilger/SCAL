Treating the right patient at the right time: access to cardiovascular nuclear imaging. Cardiovascular nuclear medicine uses agents labelled with radioisotopes that can be imaged with cameras (single-photon emission tomography [SPECT] or positron emission tomography [PET]) capable of detecting gamma photons to show physiological parameters such as myocardial perfusion, myocardial viability or ventricular function. There is a growing body of literature providing guidelines for the appropriate use of these techniques, but there are little data regarding the appropriate timeframe during which the procedures should be accessed. An expert working group composed of cardiologists and nuclear medicine specialists conducted an Internet search to identify current wait times and recommendations for wait times for a number of cardiac diagnostic tools and procedures, including cardiac catheterization and angioplasty, bypass grafting and vascular surgery. These data were used to estimate appropriate wait times for cardiovascular nuclear medicine procedures. The estimated times were compared with current wait times in each province. Wait time benchmarks were developed for the following: myocardial perfusion with either exercise or pharmacological stress and SPECT or PET imaging myocardial viability assessment with either fluorodeoxyglucose SPECT or PET imaging, or thallium-201 SPECT imaging
