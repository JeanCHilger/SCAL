Miconidin and miconidin methyl ether from Primula obconica Hance: new allergens in an old sensitizer. Several chemical and clinical observations have suggested the presence of at least one more allergen in addition to primin in Primula obconica. The aim of this study was to investigate the allergenicity of the primin precursor miconidin and the related miconidin methyl ether, both isolated from P. obconica. 12 primin-positive persons were patch tested with miconidin 0.01% petrolatum (pet.), miconidin in 96% ethanol incorporated into 0.01% pet., and miconidin methyl ether 1.0% pet. All persons were positive to miconidin 0.01% pet., with the strength of reactions very similar to those of the individual primin reactions, and remained inexplicably negative while testing with miconidin in 96% ethanol and pet., while miconidin methyl ether elicited 7 positive reactions. Although both miconidin and miconidin methyl ether may be allergenic only due to their conversion to primin in the skin, the presence of these substances nevertheless has to be taken into account when assessing the allergenicity of new P. obconica cultivars.
