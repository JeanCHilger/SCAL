Incidental findings on integrated PET/CT that do not accumulate 18F-FDG. The purpose of this study was to report the prevalence of abnormalities that do not show increased 18F-FDG uptake on the CT component of integrated PET/CT in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.Images from all PET/CT studies performed consecutively between April and October 2003 on patients with non-small cell lung cancer were retrospectively reviewed. All abnormalities present on the CT component of the PET/CT scans that did not show abnormally increased 18F-FDG uptake were documented.Three hundred twenty-one patients with non-small cell lung cancer (179 men, 142 women mean age, 67 yearsAmong patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing PET/CT, there is a high prevalence of CT abnormalities that do not show correlative 18F-FDG avidity but that may be clinically important.
