Comparison of the hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate fibers by a hydrolase from Fusarium oxysporum LCH I and Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi. The hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers by two fungal hydrolases was investigated. The hydrolase from a newly isolated Fusarium oxysporum strain (LCH 1) was more efficient in releasing terephthalic acid from PET fibers compared to the enzyme from F. solani f. sp. pisi DSM 62420 when equal amounts of p-nitrophenyl butyrate-hydrolyzing activity were employed. PET fabrics treated under the same conditions with the enzyme from F. oxysporum LCH 1 also showed a considerably higher increase in hydrophilicity compared to fabrics treated with the enzyme from F. solani f. sp. pisi DSM 62420.
