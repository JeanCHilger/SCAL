Comparison of lorazepam [7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-3-hydroxy-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one] occupancy of rat brain gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors measured using in vivo [3H]flumazenil (8-fluoro 5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester) binding and [11C]flumazenil micro-positron emission tomography. The occupancy by lorazepam of the benzodiazepine binding site of rat brain GABA(A) receptors was compared when measured using either in vivo binding of [(3)H]flumazenil (8-fluoro 5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester) in terminal studies or [(11)C]flumazenil binding in anesthetized animals assessed using a small animal positron emission tomography (PET) scanner (micro-PET). In addition, as a bridging study, lorazepam occupancy was measured using [(3)H]flumazenil in vivo binding in rats anesthetized and dosed under micro-PET conditions. Plasma lorazepam concentrations were also determined, and for each occupancy method, the concentration required to produce 50% occupancy (EC(50)) was calculated because this parameter is independent of the route of lorazepam administration. For the in vivo binding assay, lorazepam was dosed orally (0.1-10 mg/kg), whereas for the micro-PET study, lorazepam was given via the i.v. route as a low dose (0.75 mg/kg bolus) and then a high dose (0.5 mg/kg bolus then 0.2 mg/ml infusion). The lorazepam plasma EC(50) in the [(11)C]flumazenil micro-PET study was 96 ng/ml [95% confidence intervals (CIs) = 74-124 ng/ml], which was very similar to the [(3)H]flumazenil micro-PET simulation study (94 ng/ml 95% CI = 63-139 ng/ml), which in turn was comparable with the [(3)H]flumazenil in vivo binding study (134 ng/ml
