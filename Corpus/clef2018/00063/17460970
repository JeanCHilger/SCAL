Comparative trial of efficacy of trimethasidine MB and 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrasine) propionate dihydrate in chronic heart failure. To study efficacy of the myocardial cytoprotector trimethasidine MB and metabolic drug 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrasine) propionate dihydrate (3-TMHP) in the treatment of chronic cardiac failure (CCF).Sixty-five patients with CCF after myocardial infarction (> 6 months) with left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF) <40% were randomized into 3 groups: group 1 (n=28) received basic therapy plus trimethasidine in a daily dose 70 mg group 2 (n=25)--basic therapy plus 3-TMHP in a daily dose 1000 mgGroups 1 and 2 significantly reduced functional class of CCF and prolonged the distance of a 6-min walk. Significant improvement of life quality was observed only in the treatment with trimethasidine. According to PET, treatment with trimethasidine MB and 3-TMHP has an anti-ischemic action manifesting with a significant attenuation of glucose hypermetabolism in the ischemic segment to normal values. However, significant improvement of systolic thickening in hybernated segments by SPECT as well as a significant rise of LV EF were recorded only in the treatment with trimethasidine MB. Stress echocardiography with dobutamine had high specificity (85.7%) but low sensitivity (50.4%) in detection of hybernated myocardium.Trimethasidine MB (preductal MB) has advantages over 3-TMHP, so it is preferable in ischemic CHF.
