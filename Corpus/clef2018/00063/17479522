PET and SPECT imaging in psychiatric disorders. To review recent findings from positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies that investigate the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia, depression, and dementia.We carried out a review of the literature.PET and SPECT studies have provided evidence of dopamine system dysregulation in patients with schizophrenia and variable loss of monoamines in patients with depression. Antipsychotic response has been demonstrated to be associated with blockade of dopamine D2 receptors, and antidepressant response has now been linked to blockade of serotonin transporter receptors. PET and SPECT have been extensively evaluated as diagnostic procedures for dementia. Substantial progress has been made in developing radioligands that bind to amyloid deposits in the brain, which should provide new opportunities for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring in Alzheimer's disease.Advances in PET and SPECT imaging have provided new insights into the biology of major psychiatric disorders and their treatment. In the future, we can expect that these imaging techniques will become more central to the management of psychiatric disorders.
