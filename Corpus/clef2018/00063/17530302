Endocrine symptom assessment in women with breast cancer: what a simple "yes" means. To investigate the self-reported symptoms related to endocrine therapy in women with early or advanced breast cancer and the impact of these symptoms on quality of life (QL) indicators.Symptom occurrence was assessed by the Checklist for Patients on Endocrine Therapy (C-PET) and symptom intensity was assessed by linear analogue self-assessment (LASA) indicators. Patients also responded to global LASA indicators for physical well-being, mood, coping effort and treatment burden. Associations between symptoms and these indicators were analysed by linear regression models.Among 373 women, the distribution of symptom intensity showed considerable variation in patients reporting a symptom as present. Even though patients recorded a symptom as absent, some patients reported having experienced that symptom when responding to symptom intensity, as seen for decreased sex drive, tiredness and vaginal dryness. Six of 13 symptoms and lower age had a detrimental impact on the global indicators, particularly tiredness and irritability.Patients' experience of endocrine symptoms needs to be considered both in patient care and research, when interpreting the association between symptoms and QL.
