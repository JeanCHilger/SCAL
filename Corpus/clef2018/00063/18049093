Reduced thalamic 18F-flurodeoxyglucose retention in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1. Neurofibromatosis type1 (NF1) is associated with cognitive and motor deficits whose pathogenesis is not well understood. 18F-Flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) might be used to investigate putative functional correlates in the brain.Whole-body FDG PET including the brain had been performed in 29 NF1 patients suspected for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (20 females, nine males, age 31.2+/-11.8 years). Twenty-nine age-matched and sex-matched subjects without evidence of neurological/psychiatric disease in whom FDG PET had been performed for NF1-unrelated oncological indication served as controls. Individual brain FDG retention images were stereotactically normalized and scaled to a common median retention value within the brain. Scaled FDG retention was compared between the NF1 group and the control group on a voxel-by-voxel base using ANCOVA in SPM2 with the FDG uptake period as covariate. The corrected significance level alpha=0.05 was used. Voxel-based analysis was complemented by volume of interest (VOI)-based analysis using predefined standard VOIs.The voxel-based group comparison revealed a significant reduction of scaled FDG retention in the thalamus of the NF1 subjects within a cluster of 11.6 ml. There were no further significant effects, neither hypo-retention nor hyper-retention. Reduction of relative FDG retention in the thalamus in the NF1 subjects was confirmed by VOI analysis. The magnitude of the reduction was about 8%.The thalamus appears to be affected in adults with NF1. The observed magnitude of the reduction of scaled thalamic FDG retention in adults is smaller than previously reported in children. This may be consistent with a stabilization of the disease process with age.
