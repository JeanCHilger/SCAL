A stationary sampling scheme for multilayer positron tomographs. A stationary sampling scheme applicable to tomographic instruments incorporating two or more detector layers is described and tested. In this concept, the detectors in adjacent layers are angularly offset by half the interdetector distance. By reconstructing in one single slice all lines of response defined by two adjacent rings of detectors, a fourfold increase in the number of coincidence lines is obtained and a uniform sampling distance equal to one-quarter the interdetector spacing is achieved. Whereas this is obtained at the expense of a 100% degradation of the resolution in the axial direction, with the recent breed of PET (positron emission tomography) scanners using nearly square cross section detectors, the resolution loss may be tolerable in many situations. In addition, normal reconstruction of the individual coincidence planes is always possible. The sampling concept was investigated experimentally with the help of the Universite de Sherbrooke PET camera simulator.
