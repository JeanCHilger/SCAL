Role of [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine therapy in medullary thyroid carcinoma. In recent years several radiopharmaceuticals have become available, offering new possibilities for the diagnosis and therapy of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). For the diagnosis and follow-up 201TI-chloride and 99mTc(V)-DMSA are the tracers of choice. Imaging with [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) and 131I-anti-CEA or anti-calcitonin antibodies or fragments is less sensitive but very specific. These tracers can be used to evaluate their potential therapeutic use. Cumulative reported data on the diagnostic use of 131I-MIBG in 178 MTC patients indicate that overall 34.5% of medullary cancers concentrate MIBG. At The Netherlands Cancer Institute 131I-MIBG scintigraphy was positive in 8 of 23 patients with MTC. Four of these patients have received therapeutic amounts of 131I-MIBG, resulting in 1 partial remission and meaningful palliation in 3 patients with metastatic MTC. It is concluded that, although the preliminary experience suggests that the objective response of MTC to 131I-MIBG therapy is limited, the palliation provided to these patients, for whom there is little other treatment, may be very meaningful.
