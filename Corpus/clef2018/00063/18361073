Detection of inflammation in an atherosclerose plaque: the role of the positron emission tomography and C reactive protein. To demonstrate that inflammatory atheromatose carotid plaques can be visualized with positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG PET) in symptomatic patients, in order to correlate them with systemic inflammatory markers, such as CRP.Fifteen patients with cerebral ischemia due to atherosclerotic carotid disease were studied. 18FDG uptake with PET was considered and blood samples were taken for determining high sensibility C reactive protein (HsCRP).The mean age of the patients was 66 years 11 of them were males (73%) and 4 were females (27%). 18FDG PET was positive in 12 patients (80%), while 100% of the studied population had low risk HsCRP with normal white cell count.18FDG PET proves active inflammation in carotid atheromatose plaques. There was no significant correlation between the presence of ahteromatose carotid plaques, HsCRP serum levels, and 18FDG PET study.
