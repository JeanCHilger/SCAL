PET O-15 cerebral blood flow and metabolism after acute stroke in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Hypertension is a major stroke risk factor and is correlated with worse outcome after stroke. Thus, the effects of hypertension on cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism within an hour after stroke must be evaluated in detail. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) and cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRglc) were measured 1 h after the occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) in male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and male normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). Physiological responses were determined by positron emission tomography (PET) using 15O-H2O and radiolabeled 15O-O2 blood (methodology previously developed in this laboratory) and by autoradiography (ARG) using 18F-FDG. The right hemisphere of SHR showed lower CBF values than the left hemisphere after stroke (right: 0.17+/-0.07 mL/min/g left: 0.29+/-0.08 mL/min/g), CMRO2 (right: 2.55+/-0.80 mL/min/100 g
