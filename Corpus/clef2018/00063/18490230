Renal oncocytoma: clinical experience of Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Renal oncocytoma has been reported mostly in the Western literature, and only a few cases have been reported in Eastern populations. In the present study, we review the clinical course of renal oncocytoma in our institution.We obtained the files of 13 cases of renal oncocytoma between 1988 and 2006 from the pathological archives of Taipei Veterans General Hospital. We retrospectively analyzed the patients' characteristics, clinical manifestations, surgical technique and clinical outcome.The study population comprised 10 men and 3 women, and the mean age at diagnosis was 59.6 years (range, 37-75 years). Twelve patients (92%) were asymptomatic at presentation and were incidentally diagnosed to have renal tumor by sonography (9 patients), computed tomography (1 patient) or magnetic resonance imaging (2 patients), and 1 presented with hematuria. The clinical impression of oncocytoma was made preoperatively in only 3 patients by imaging studies, and most of the patients (76.9%) were diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma before surgery. Ten were treated with radical nephrectomy, 2 with partial nephrectomy, and 1 received excisional biopsy. All patients had unilateral solitary renal tumor the right kidney was involved in 7 cases (54%) and the left in 6 (46%). Mean tumor size was 5.3 cm (range, 2.7-8.5 cm). Three patients were lost to follow-up in our series, and there was no recurrence or death (100% disease-specific survival) in the remaining 10 patients (77%) who were followed-up for a mean duration of 53.2 months (range, 10-117 months).Renal oncocytoma has a benign clinical course with excellent long-term outcomes. Currently, nephron-sparing surgery is the mainstay of treatment, especially in patients with small tumors. However, accurate preoperative diagnosis based only on imaging studies is difficult, and radical nephrectomy was performed for most of the patients in our series.
