Ipsilateral motor-related hyperactivity in patients with cerebral occlusive vascular disease. Cerebral occlusive vascular disease is an established risk factor for ischemic stroke however, little is known about its effects on brain function in patients without stroke. To detect possible functional alterations, we used magnetoencephalography and evaluated cerebral cortical activity during hand motor tasks in a group of such patients. Method- Event-related desynchronization (ERD) during hand-grasping and self-paced finger-tapping tasks was examined in 38 right-hand-dominant patients with occlusive disease of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery caused by diverse pathologies (atherosclerosis, 28Abnormal ipsilateral dominant distribution of beta ERD was observed significantly more often during contralesional hand grasping in patients with atherosclerotic vascular lesion. It was accompanied by significantly higher t values on the ipsilateral hemisphere, without a decrease in those on the contralateral side. The age, the rating scores of periventricular hyperintensity, and ventricular size were all significantly higher in patients who showed the ipsilateral-dominant pattern.Abnormal ipsilateral hyperactivity may indicate the presence of subclinical functional alterations related to atherosclerotic occlusive vascular disease.
