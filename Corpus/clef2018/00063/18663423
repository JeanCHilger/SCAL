Neuroblastoma in children. Neuroblastomas have a very heterogenic clinical presentation, ranging from relatively benign forms with the potential of spontaneous regression, to foudroyant malignant forms. Over half of neuroblastomas must be classified as high-risk tumors with a markedly high rate of recurrence. Despite multidisciplinary therapeutic approaches, the survival rate of children with this type of tumor is still below 40%. An ever-growing amount of data from international studies dating from the early 1970s onwards, points to the necessity of re-evaluating the medical approach in establishing the diagnosis and staging, understanding tumor biology and pathology, as well as therapy planning.
