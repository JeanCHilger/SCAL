Baseline staging of melanoma with unknown primary site: the value of serum s100 protein and positron emission tomography. Baseline staging is important in all melanoma types, including melanoma with unknown primary site (MUP). Staging includes different examination strategies, each with different accuracy.To determine the value of serum S100 protein levels and positron emission tomography (PET) in the baseline staging of MUP.Twenty patients with MUP were evaluable for the analysis between 1996 and 2007 with both S100 assessment and PET performed for baseline staging.Serum S100 was elevated in 7 patients (35%). The PET scan detected the metastases in 6 of 7 patients with elevated serum S100 protein showing a strong correlation (p = 0.005). Patients with metastases had significantly higher serum S100 levels (p = 0.01) than the ones without. Serum S100 protein was shown to be discriminative between patients with and without metastases (receiver-operating characteristic, p = 0.012) with 75% sensitivity and 92% specificity.Serum S100 protein appears to be a sensitive as well as specific marker to detect metastases. We therefore might recommend serum S100 assessment to be included in the baseline staging of MUP.
