Evaluation of prescription of exercise, for rehabilitation of coronary artery disease patients by myocardial scintigraphy. It is advisable that the intensity of the exercises for rehabilitation of patients with coronary artery disease does not cause myocardial ischemia.Compare the capacity of myocardial tomographic scintigraphy with the electrocardiogram capacity in ischemia detection during rehabilitation session.Twenty six patients with coronary artery disease, undergoing the rehabilitation program and with previous scintigraphy, with transient hypo-uptake have been administered a new injection of MIBI-Tc-99m during a training session when they were also monitored with dynamic electrocardiography. The rest scintigraphies, after ergometric treadmill test and rehabilitation session, were assessed in a semi-quantitative way using scores from 0 to 4 to classify each one of the chosen segments (0 = normal 1 = discrete hypo-uptakeThe means of the total scores found were: at rest = 12.9 after treadmill test = 19.3The exercises prescribed for patients with coronary artery disease, according to recommendations found in the literature, may trigger myocardial ischemia, assessed by scintigraphy during a rehabilitation session.
