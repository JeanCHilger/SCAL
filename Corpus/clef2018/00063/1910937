Evaluation of SPECT with N-isopropyl [I-123]-p-iodoamphetamine (IMP) or technetium-99m [99mTc]-d,l-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (d, 1-HM-PAO) in cerebral concussion. 123I-IMP and Tc-PAO SPECT were performed in 20 cases of cerebral concussion ranging in age from 4 to 20 years old, including six cases of the juvenile head trauma syndrome (JHTS). The SPECT findings were divided into two main types: six cases in the normal group with no blood flow abnormalities, and 14 cases in abnormal group showing reduced blood flow, mainly in cerebellum and occipital lobe except in one case. In 10 cases with reduced blood flow which could be analyzed, calculation of the blood flow ratio in the temporal and occipital lobes and the cerebellum with the frontal lobe taken as 100 showed values of 93.5% for the temporal lobe, 82.7% for the occipital lobe and 76.8% for the cerebellum. A statistically significant reduction in blood flow occurred in the occipital lobe and cerebellum. In blood examination, abnormally high values of white blood cell counts were observed transiently in 94% of cerebral concussion cases. Abnormalities in brain stem and hypothalamus appeared to cause these abnormal WBC values. From these findings, it was suggested that the blood flow regions of the basilar and posterior cerebral arteries, i.e., the brain stem and hypothalamus are closely connected with the lesions responsible for cerebral concussion. It also appeared that the JHTS occurs in cerebral concussion cases where recovery of the abnormal blood flow in these regions in poor.
