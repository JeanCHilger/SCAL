Detection of colo-rectal liver metastases: prospective comparison of contrast enhanced US, multidetector CT, PET/CT, and 1.5 Tesla MR with extracellular and reticulo-endothelial cell specific contrast agents. To compare contrast-enhanced US (CE-US), multidetector-CT (MDCT), 1.5 Tesla MR with extra-cellular (Gd-enhanced) and intracellular (SPIO-enhanced) contrast agents and PET/CT, in the detection of hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer.A total of 34 patients with colo-rectal adenocarcinoma underwent preoperatively CE-US, MDCT, Gd- and SPIO-enhanced MR imaging (MRI), and PET/CT. Each set of images was reviewed independently by two blinded observers. The ROC method was used to analyze the results, which were correlated with surgical findings, intraoperative US, histopathology, and MDCT follow-up.A total of 57 hepatic lesions were identified: 11 hemangiomas, 29 cysts, 1 focal fatty liver, 16 metastases (dimensional distribution: 5/16 < 5 mm 3/16 between 5 mm and <10 mmGd- and SPIO-enhanced MRI seem to be the most accurate modality in the identification of liver metastases from colo-rectal carcinoma. PET/CT shows a trend to perform better than the other modalities in the identification of patients with liver metastases.
