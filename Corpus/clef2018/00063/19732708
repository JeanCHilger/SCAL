Bacterial and parasitic diseases of ferrets. The domestic ferret, Mustela putorius furo, is a popular companion animal and is used in biomedical research. When compared with other companion mammals, primary bacterial and parasitic infections are less common in domestic ferrets. In countries such as the United States, pet ferrets are generally kept indoors, and the risk for exposure to primary bacterial and parasitic infectious agents is low. Companion, breeding, and working ferrets are commonly kept outdoors in other parts of the world, placing them at comparatively greater risk for exposure to infectious diseases. This article discusses clinical signs, diagnosis, and treatment of bacterial and parasitic diseases of ferrets.
