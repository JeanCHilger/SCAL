PARALYSIS IN A DOG SIMULATING POLIOMYELITIS. A pet dog developed a form of paralysis simulating the paralysis of epidemic poliomyelitis. The autopsy showed changes in the spinal cord and intervertebral ganglia, resembling, but not identical with, the lesions of poliomyelitis in man. Inoculation of the affected spinal cord into the nervous system of young dogs and Macacus rhesus monkeys was not followed by the production of paralysis or other obvious symptom of disease.
