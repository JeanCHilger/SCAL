Nasal nitric oxide and regulation of human pulmonary blood flow in the upright position. There are a number of evidences suggesting that lung perfusion distribution is under active regulation and determined by several factors in addition to gravity. In this work, we hypothesised that autoinhalation of nitric oxide (NO), produced in the human nasal airways, may be one important factor regulating human lung perfusion distribution in the upright position. In 15 healthy volunteers, we used single-photon emission computed tomography technique and two tracers (99mTc and 113mIn) labeled with human macroaggregated albumin to assess pulmonary blood flow distribution. In the sitting upright position, subjects first breathed NO free air through the mouth followed by the administration of the first tracer. Subjects then switched to either nasal breathing or oral breathing with the addition of exogenous NO-enriched air followed by the administration of the second tracer. Compared with oral breathing, nasal breathing induced a blood flow redistribution of approximately 4% of the total perfusion in the caudal to cranial and dorsal to ventral directions. For low perfused lung regions like the apical region, this represents a net increase of 24% in blood flow. Similar effects were obtained with the addition of exogenous NO during oral breathing, indicating that NO and not the breathing condition was responsible for the blood flow redistribution. In conclusion, these results provide evidence that autoinhalation of endogenous NO from the nasal airways may ameliorate the influence of gravity on pulmonary blood flow distribution in the upright position. The presence of nasal NO only in humans and higher primates suggest that it may be an important part of the adaptation to bipedalism.
