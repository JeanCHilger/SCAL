Lymph node surgical staging for locally advanced cervical cancer. Lymph node staging in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer is the most important prognostic factor and also leads to adjuvant treatment choice. Because of the lymphadenectomy associated morbidity and delay in the beginning of adjuvant therapy, noninvasive approaches were developed during the last decennia. Recently, positron emission tomography employing a glucose analogue (FDG-PET) has been shown to be more sensitive and more specific than magnetic resonance imaging or than computed tomography usually used in diagnosis of pelvic and para-aortic lymph node metastases. Even if recent studies have reported promising results, surgical pelvic and para-aortic staging remains actually the most accurate procedure for evaluating lymph node metastases. This procedure should be accomplished by transperitoneal or extraperitoneal laparoscopy, with the benefits of minimal morbidity, shorter length of hospital stay and no significant increase of complications comparing to laparotomy approach. Laparoscopy also allows an early start of adjuvant treatment, this delay constituting an important prognostic factor for patients with locally advanced cancer. However, the survival benefit of lymph node dissection is still controversial and should be proved in randomised studies.
