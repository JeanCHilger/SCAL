Positron emission tomography-computed tomography in paraneoplastic neurologic disorders: systematic analysis and review. To evaluate the cancer detection rate of whole-body positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) in a paraneoplastic neurologic context.Retrospective medical record review.Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.Fifty-six consecutive patients with clinically suspected paraneoplastic neurologic disorders who underwent PET-CT after negative standard evaluations, including CT.Rate of cancer detection.Abnormalities suggestive of cancer were detected using PET-CT in 22 patients (39%) 10 patients (18%) had cancer confirmed histologically. Cancers detected (limited stage in 9 of 10 patients and extratruncal in 4) were as follows: 2 thyroid papillary cell carcinomas, 3 solitary lymph nodes with unknown primary (2 adenocarcinomas and 1 small cell carcinoma), 1 tonsil squamous cell carcinoma, 3 lung carcinomas (1 adenocarcinoma, 1 small cell, and 1 squamous cell), and 1 colon adenocarcinoma. Detection of a well-characterized neuronal nuclear or cytoplasmic paraneoplastic autoantibody was associated with a successful PET-CT-directed cancer search (P < .001). Detection of limited-stage cancer facilitated early initiation of oncologic treatments and immunotherapyIn a paraneoplastic neurologic context, PET-CT improves the detection of cancers when other screening test results are negative, particularly in the setting of seropositivity for a neuronal nuclear or cytoplasmic autoantibody marker of cancer.
