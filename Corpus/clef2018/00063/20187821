Successful treatment of a Vietnamese potbellied pig with an ovarian leiomyoma. An adult sexually intact female Vietnamese potbellied pig was examined because of abdominal distention of 5 months' duration.The pig was moderately anemic, and its abdomen was greatly distended. A freely movable abdominal mass was detected during palpation and ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen. Examination of abdominal and thoracic radiographs revealed faint, ill-defined, linear and curvilinear mineralized opacities in the region of the mass and that the gastrointestinal tract was displaced craniodorsally. Results of radiographic examination suggested that the cause of distention was a single abdominal mass (possibly a neoplasm).Surgery was performed, and the mass, which was identified as the right ovary, was removed. The left ovary had a normal appearance, but it was also removed during surgery. The pig was administered a transfusion (314 mL of plasma and 296 mL of packed RBCs) before and during surgery. The mass, which accounted for approximately one-third of the pig's body weight, was identified histologically as an ovarian leiomyoma.Pigs can safely be administered a transfusion of RBCs and plasma. Ovarian tumors can be removed from Vietnamese potbellied pigs, which allows them to be used as pets or for reproduction when only 1 ovary is affected. Uterine masses in older sexually intact Vietnamese potbellied pigs are more common than are ovarian tumors thus, complete ovariohysterectomy should be considered when the primary purpose of the pig is to serve as a pet.
