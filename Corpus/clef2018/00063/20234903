High chemo and regioselective formation of alcohols from the hydrocarbonylation of alkenes using cooperative ligand effects. The hydrocarbonylation of alkenes, including allyl alcohol, catalysed by rhodium complexes and wide angle bidentate ligands together with PEt(3), gives alcohols as the primary products with high chemo and regio-selectivity.
