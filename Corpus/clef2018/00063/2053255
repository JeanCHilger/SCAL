Behavioral medicine as a part of a comprehensive small animal medical program. The rationale of incorporating behavioral medicine into veterinary practice is that it can expand the range of medical services offered, help obtain happier, more acceptable pets, and lead to longer pet ownership. In doing so, veterinarians should be able to increase their business both through an actual increase in pet ownership and retention and through increased services for individual pets. The range of services offered can differ from practice to practice but may include preventive, interventive, and ancillary services, as with other areas in contemporary veterinary medical practice. Each area of behavioral practice can be an economically feasible addition to veterinary practice from the perspective of medical services rendered, as a method of practice promotion, or as an area of public service. The choice depends on the level of competence of the practitioner, the practice philosophy, and the need for the services in a given service area.
