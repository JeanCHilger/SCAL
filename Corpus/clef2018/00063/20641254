 CD44 is a member of the family of cell adhesion molecules that is known to promote cell migration and survival during cancer metastasis (1). The mouse CD44 gene contains ~20 exons, of which 10 are variants that are alternatively spliced for incorporation into the molecule to yield several CD44 variants (CD44v). The different CD44v forms have been reviewed elsewhere (2). The various CD44v molecules are involved in modulating a variety of cellular processes including cell migration and localization in the diverse organs, thereby promoting cancer metastasis (3). Among these variants, the variant containing domain 6 of the exons (CD44v6) has been specifically implicated in tumorigenesis and tumor cell migration (4). In normal tissue CD44v6 is expressed in a subset of epithelial cells, and it is found in most squamous cell carcinomas and some adenocarcinomas, but CD44v6 is seldom observed in tumors that have a nonepithelial origin (4). Also, CD44v6 was reported to have higher expression compared with the epidermal growth factor receptor in samples obtained from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors of patients (5). Because of its high expression in HNSCC, CD44v6 has been targeted with a monoclonal antibody (MAb), designated U36, for the diagnosis of this cancer in humans (6, 7). The biodistribution of U36 was investigated after being labeled with radioactive technetium, and it was reported that the labeled MAb could detect all primary tumors of HNSCC, but the micro-tumors or tumor nodes with necrosis, keratin, or fibrin were not visible by imaging (7). This MAb was also evaluated in two clinical trials for the treatment of HNSCC after labeling with radioactive rhenium (
