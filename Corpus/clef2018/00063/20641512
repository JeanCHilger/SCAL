. Integrin receptors that mediate tumor angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis through a complex network of signaling pathways are known to be expressed on the surface of cancerous tumor cells and neovasculature (1-3). Because of their role in tumor development and progression, inhibition of integrin receptor activity is being actively investigated in clinical trials for the treatment and imaging of various cancers (4, 5). Non-invasive imaging probes can be used to determine not only the efficacy of integrin-targeted anti-cancer drugs, but also to monitor disease progression and metastasis (6, 7). Although integrin receptors usually bind through the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif of the extracellular matrix protein ligands, it is the amino acid residues surrounding the RGD motif that determine the receptor specificity and affinity for the ligand (4, 8, 9). As a result of the small size of the drugs, mainly peptides, that target the integrin receptor, it has been challenging to generate peptides containing the RGD motif that have an improved pharmacokinetic behavior, receptor affinity, and tumor uptake for
