 Benzodiazepines are used for their sedative, anxiolytic, and muscle-relaxant properties (1). Their mechanism of action involves the binding of a ligand to a specific benzodiazepine receptor. Two types of benzodiazepine receptors have been identified: a central receptor and a peripheral one. The central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) is found exclusively in the central nervous system on the membranes of neurons and is coupled to the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor/chloride channel (2). The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), first thought to be a subtype of the CBR, was later identified as a separate class of receptor with its own structure, physiologic functions, and location on the outer membrane of the mitochondria (3). The PBR structure consists of a trimeric complex with an adenine nucleotide carrier and a voltage-dependent anion that form the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (3). Although it has been shown to be involved in numerous biological processes, the physiologic role of the PBR is still unclear (4). PBR is abundant in peripheral organs such as the kidneys, lungs, and heart, whereas lower levels are found in the brain (5). A significant increase in PBR expression after neural injury or inflammation (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy) has been observed and has been associated with microglial activation (6, 7). The development of PBR radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET) has enabled the study of microglial activation in the brain (8). One of these radioligands, 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-
