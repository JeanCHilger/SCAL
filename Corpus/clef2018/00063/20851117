Pharmacological characterization of the cannabinoid CB₁ receptor PET ligand ortholog, [³H]MePPEP. MePPEP ((3R,5R)-5-(3-methoxy-phenyl)-3-((R)-1-phenyl-ethylamino)-1-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-pyrrolidin-2-one) is an inverse agonist shown to be an effective PET ligand for labeling cannabinoid CB₁ receptors in vivo. [¹¹C]MePPEP and structurally related analogs have been reported to specifically and reversibly label cannabinoid CB₁ receptors in rat and non-human primate brains, and [¹¹C]MePPEP has been used in human subjects as a PET tracer. We have generated [³H]MePPEP, an ortholog of [¹¹C]MePPEP, to characterize the molecular pharmacology of the cannabinoid CB₁ receptor across preclinical and clinical species. [³H]MePPEP demonstrates saturable, reversible, and single-site high affinity binding to cannabinoid CB₁ receptors. In cerebellar membranes purified from brains of rat, non-human primate and human, and cells ectopically expressing recombinant human cannabinoid CB₁ receptor, [³H]MePPEP binds cannabinoid CB₁ receptors with similar affinity with K(d) values of 0.09 nM, 0.19 nM, 0.14 nM and 0.16 nM, respectively. Both agonist and antagonist cannabinoid ligands compete [³H]MePPEP with predicted rank order potency. No specific binding is present in autoradiographic sections from cannabinoid CB₁ receptor knockout mouse brains, demonstrating that [³H]MePPEP selectively binds cannabinoid CB₁ receptors in native mouse tissue. Furthermore, [³H]MePPEP binding to anatomical sites in mouse and rat brain is comparable to the anatomical profiles of [¹¹C]MePPEP in non-human primate and human brain in vivo, as well as the binding profiles of other previously described cannabinoid CB₁ receptor agonist and antagonist radioligands. Therefore, [³H]MePPEP is a promising tool for translation of preclinical cannabinoid CB₁ receptor pharmacology to clinical PET ligand and cannabinoid CB₁ receptor inverse agonist therapeutic development.
