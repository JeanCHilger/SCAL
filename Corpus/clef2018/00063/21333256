82 Rubidium PET to replace myocardial scintigraphy. Since the 1970's nuclear cardiology has mainly been based on the use of gamma camera technology. While gamma cameras have undergone a rapid development, the number of perfusion tracers has been limited. In parallel, cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) has only been performed with short-lived isotopes at centres with access to a cyclotron, and only including a very limited number of patients. The number of PET scanners has increased markedly in Denmark and with the introduction of generator-produced 82-Rubidium, this modality may replace the traditional cardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
