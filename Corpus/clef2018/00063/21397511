Implementation of 89Zr production and in vivo imaging of B-cells in mice with 89Zr-labeled anti-B-cell antibodies by small animal PET/CT. We examined the production, separation, and characterization of (89)Zr, including supplementation of a commercial Cyclone(Â®) 18/9 with a self-made Solid Target System (STS). Obtained [(89)Zr]Zr-oxalate was used for the labeling of anti-B cell antibodies with desferrioxamine-p-SCN as a bifunctional chelator. (89)Zr-labeled antibodies were injected in DBA/1 mice to examine usability for detection of B cells in vivo. PET measurements showed binding of (89)Zr-labeled anti-B cell antibodies in tissues with high frequencies of B cells, i.e. in spleen and lymph nodes.
