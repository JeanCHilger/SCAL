MIBG scintigraphy in differential diagnosis of Parkinsonism: a meta-analysis. Differential diagnosis between Parkinson's disease (PD) and other Parkinsonism using clinical criteria or imaging methods is often difficult. The purpose of this study is to systematically review and meta-analyze published data about the diagnostic performance of myocardial innervation imaging using (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy in differential diagnosis between PD and other Parkinsonism.A comprehensive computer literature search of studies published through March 2011 regarding MIBG scintigraphy in patients with PD and other Parkinsonism was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase databases. Only studies in which MIBG scintigraphy was performed for differential diagnosis between PD and other Parkinsonism were selected. Pooled sensitivity, pooled specificity and area under the ROC curve were calculated to measure the accuracy of MIBG scintigraphy in differential diagnosis between PD and other Parkinsonism.Nineteen studies comprising 1,972 patients (1,076 patients with PD, 117 patients with other Lewy body diseases and 779 patients with other diseases) were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity of MIBG scintigraphy in detecting PD was 88% (95% CI 86-90%) the pooled specificity of MIBG scintigraphy in discriminating between PD and other Parkinsonism was 85% (95% CI 81-88%). The area under the ROC curve was 0.93.In patients with clinically suspected PD, myocardial innervation imaging demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity. MIBG scintigraphy is an accurate test in this setting. Nevertheless, possible causes of false-negative and false-positive results should be kept in mind when interpreting the scintigraphic results.
