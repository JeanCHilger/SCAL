Zoonotic diseases of common pet birds: psittacine, passerine, and columbiform species. Zoonotic transmission of disease from pet birds is uncommon, but there are some recognized dangers. Most notably, Chlamydophila psittaci can be transmitted from pet birds to humans. Allergic responses to pet birds, including pneumonitis and contact dermatitis, have also been documented. Bite wounds from pet birds are rarely reported but can cause trauma and develop infection. The other diseases discussed here are considered potential zoonotic diseases of pet birds because of either isolated reports of suspected but unconfirmed transmission to humans or from reports of wild conspecifics being reported to have the disease.
