Comparison study of [18F]FAl-NOTA-PRGD2, [18F]FPPRGD2, and [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 for PET imaging of U87MG tumors in mice. [(18)F]FPPRGD2, an F-18 labeled dimeric cyclic RGDyK peptide, has favorable properties for PET imaging of angiogenesis by targeting the α(v)β(3) integrin receptor. This radiotracer has been approved by the FDA for use in clinical trials. However, the time-consuming multiple-step synthetic procedure required for its preparation may hinder the widespread usage of this tracer. The recent development of a method using an F-18 fluoride-aluminum complex to radiolabel peptides provides a strategy for simplifying the labeling procedure. On the other hand, the easy-to-prepare [(68)Ga]-labeled NOTA-RGD derivatives have also been reported to have promising properties for imaging α(v)β(3) integrin receptors. The purpose of this study was to prepare [(18)F]FPPRGD2 [corrected] , [(18)F]FAl-NOTA-PRGD2, and [(68)Ga]Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 and to compare their pharmacokinetics and tumor imaging properties using small animal PET. All three compounds showed rapid and high tracer uptake in U87MG tumors with high target-to-background ratios. The uptake in the liver, kidneys, and muscle were similar for all three tracers, and they all showed predominant renal clearance. In conclusion, [(18)F]FAl-NOTA-PRGD2 and [(68)Ga]Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 have imaging properties and pharmacokinetics comparable to those of [(18)F]FPPRGD2. Considering their ease of preparation and good imaging qualities, [(18)F]FAl-NOTA-PRGD2 and [(68)Ga]NOTA-PRGD2 are promising alternatives to [(18)F]FPPRGD2 for PET imaging of tumor α(v)β(3) integrin expression.
