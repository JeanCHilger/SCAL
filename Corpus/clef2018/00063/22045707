Evaluation of the role of tumor-associated macrophages in an experimental model of peritoneal carcinomatosis using (18)F-FDG PET. PET is widely used at the clinical and preclinical levels for tumor assessment and evaluation of treatment efficacy. Here, we established and took advantage of a preclinical model of peritoneal carcinomatosis to evaluate the contribution of inflammatory infiltrating macrophages in tumor progression that was followed using (18)F-FDG PET.Groups of mice with peritoneal carcinomatosis were longitudinally evaluated with (18)F-FDG PET. Intraperitoneal depletion of macrophages was achieved by an approach (i.e., administration of clodronate encapsulated into liposomes) that proved to be safe and effective. Sham liposomes were used in control animal cohorts.(18)F-FDG PET allowed us to detect and monitor peritoneal lesion growth and diffusion. Macrophage-depleted animals showed a substantial reduction in tumor burden paralleled by a decrement in the extent of radioactivity distribution. A significant correlation between lesion dimension and metabolic volume was observed not only in macrophage-depleted but also in sham-treated mice.(18)F-FDG PET allowed a noninvasive detection of peritoneal carcinomatosis lesions. Although macrophages play a key role in the early growth and spreading of lesions in the peritoneal cavity, neoplastic cells apparently represent the major player in this system in the uptake of (18)F-FDG.
