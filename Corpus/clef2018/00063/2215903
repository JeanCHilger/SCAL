Does the washout phenomenon of Tc-99m HM-PAO correlate to the "filling-in" phenomenon of I-123 IMP with brain SPECT? Using SPECT, the time course of brain uptake was compared between N-isopropyl-p-[I-123]-iodoamphetamine (I-123 IMP) and Tc-99m d,l hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime (Tc-99m HM-PAO). Of 14 patients with cerebrovascular disease showing areas of the "filling-in phenomenon" (i.e. delayed uptake) with I-123 IMP brain SPECT, 7 exhibited persistent defects with Tc-99m HM-PAO (Group I), and 7 showed early washout after the initial uptake (Group II). The filling-in of I-123 IMP did not always correlate to the washout region of Tc-99m HM-PAO. The temporal changes were also confirmed by semiquantitative analysis. While the filling-in of I-123 IMP was affected by many factors, the washout of Tc-99m HM-PAO was attributed to significant reduction of Tc-99m HM-PAO in the plasma. Delayed imaging of the brain with Tc-99m HM-PAO using SPECT may give a more accurate estimate of regional cerebral blood flow in cerebrovascular disease, because it should be lees effected by cerebral blood volume.
