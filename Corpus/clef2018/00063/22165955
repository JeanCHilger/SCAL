Phase II trial of the regulatory T cell-depleting agent, denileukin diftitox, in patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma. We previously found that administration of an interleukin 2/diphtheria toxin conjugate (DAB/IL2 Denileukin DiftitoxIn a single-center, phase II trial, DAB/IL2 (12 μg/kg 4 daily dosesAfter DAB/IL2 administration, 16.7% of the 60 patients had partial responses, 5% stable disease and 15% mixed responses. Importantly, 45.5% of the chemo/immuno-naïve sub-population (11/60 patients) experienced partial responses. One year survival was markedly higher in partial responders (80 ± 11.9%) relative to patients with progressive disease (23.7 ± 6.5% p value < 0.001) and 40 ± 6.2% of the total DAB/IL2-treated population were alive at 1 year.These data support the development of multi-center, randomized trials of DAB/IL2 as a monotherapy and in combination with other immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of stage IV melanoma.NCT00299689.
