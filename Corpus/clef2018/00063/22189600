Secondary intramedullary spinal cord non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Intramedullary spinal cord metastases of solid neoplasms are associated with poor long-term survival. As the characteristics of secondary intramedullary spinal cord non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) are not well understood, we sought to describe its clinical features and outcome. We retrospectively reviewed the Mayo Clinic patient database, lymphoma database, and pathology records from 1996 to 2010 and identified patients with clinical myelopathy and neuroimaging evidence of secondary intramedullary spinal cord involvement from pathologically confirmed systemic NHL. Seven patients were included in this study. The median age was 61 years (range, 41-81). Symptom onset was subacute (â‰¤8 weeks) in six. Four patients were wheelchair-dependent at diagnosis. Spinal cord NHL was diagnosed by cerebrospinal fluid cytology in four Positron emission tomography hypermetabolism in two
