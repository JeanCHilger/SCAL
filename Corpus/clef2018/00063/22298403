Central benzodiazepine receptor imaging and quantitation with single photon emission computerised tomography: SPECT. This review discusses the current use of single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) for central benzodiazepine receptor imaging and quantitation. The general principles underlying SPECT imaging and receptor quantitation methods such as the kinetic, pseudo-equilibrium and steady-state (tracer infusion and bolus) approaches are described. The advantages and practical drawbacks of these techniques are highlighted.
