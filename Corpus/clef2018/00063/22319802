 The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a 170-kDa transmembrane protein that promotes cell proliferation through a receptor-associated tyrosine kinase (TK)â€“mediated signal transduction pathway and is known to participate in the development, survival, and migration of normal cells and a variety of cancerous cells (1). In addition, overexpression of the EGFR in malignant tumors appears to correlate with a poor prognostic outcome for the patient (1). In an effort to develop therapies against cancer, a variety of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit activation of the receptor (see Di Fede et al. (2) for details) or small molecules that interfere with stimulation of the receptor TK pathway (for details, see Kumar et al. (3)) have been developed and approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in the clinic. Vallis et al. developed ior egf/r3, a murine mAb with a high affinity for the extracellular domain of the EGFR, labeled it with 99m-technetium, and used it for the molecular imaging of the receptor (4). However, because of immunogenicity, the
