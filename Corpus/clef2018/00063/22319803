 Mesothelin (MSLN) is a 40-kDa cell membrane surface protein that is anchored to the cell through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage and is believed to have a role in cell adhesion. In normal humans this protein is expressed at low levels mainly in the mesothelial tissues, but it is overexpressed in mesothelioma and certain types of lung, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers (1, 2). Because MSLN-related peptides (SMRP) are shed into the serum of patients with pleural mesothelioma, MSLN is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a biomarker to monitor the course of this disease in individuals diagnosed with the ailment. Investigators have suggested that quantification of SMRP in the blood may also be useful for the detection of lung cancer (3). In a phase I clinical trial, a cytotoxic T-cell response to MSLN epitopes was observed in three patients who had been vaccinated with autologous MSLN-positive tumor cells, and the patients showed delayed hypersensitivity to the vaccination, indicating that MSLN was capable of stimulating the T-cell response in humans (4). In another phase I clinical trial, it was shown that an anti-MSLN immunotoxin could elicit tumor responses in patients with mesothelioma as well as ovarian and pancreatic cancers (5). These clinical studies indicated that MSLN may be a suitable target for the treatment of cancerous tumors that overexpress this molecule. On the basis of these observations, Hassan et al. (5) developed a mouse-human chimeric monoclonal antibody (chAb), designated MORAb-009, that has a high affinity for human MSLN (
