Gallium-67-labeled lactam bridge-cyclized alpha-MSH peptides with enhanced melanoma uptake and reduced renal uptake. The purpose of this study was to examine the melanoma targeting and pharmacokinetic properties of (67)Ga-DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex {(67)Ga-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclononane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid-Gly-Gly-Nle-c[Asp-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Lys]-CONH2} and (67)Ga-NOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex {(67)Ga-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid-Gly-Gly-Nle-c[Asp-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Lys]-CONH2} and compare with (67)Ga-DOTA-GlyGlu-CycMSH {(67)Ga-DOTA-Gly-Glu-c[Lys-Nle-Glu-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Arg-Pro-Val-Asp]} we previously reported. DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex and NOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex were synthesized using fluorenylmethyloxy carbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry. The melanocortin-1 (MC1) receptor binding affinity of NOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex was determined in B16/F1 melanoma cells and compared with DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex. The melanoma targeting and pharmacokinetic properties of (67)Ga-NOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex and (67)Ga-DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex were determined in B16/F1 melanoma-bearing C57 mice. NOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex and DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex displayed comparable MC1 receptor binding affinities (1.6 vs 2.1 nM) in B16/F1 melanoma cells. Both (67)Ga-NOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex and (67)Ga-DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex exhibited dramatically enhanced melanoma uptake and reduced renal uptake than (67)Ga-DOTA-GlyGlu-CycMSH in B16/F1 melanoma-bearing C57 mice. Furthermore, (67)Ga-NOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex exhibited more favorable radiolabeling conditions (>85% radiolabeling yields started at 37 Â°C), as well as higher tumor/kidney uptake ratios than (67)Ga-DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex at 0.5, 2, and 24 h postinjection. High melanoma uptake coupled with low renal uptake highlighted the potential of (67)Ga-NOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex for melanoma imaging and therapy.
