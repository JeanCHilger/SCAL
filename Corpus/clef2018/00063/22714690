Preoperative sentinel lymph node mapping of the prostate using PET/CT fusion imaging and Ga-68-labeled tilmanocept in an animal  model. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification with preoperative image guidance may improve pathological staging of prostate cancer by identifying nodes outside the standard template of dissection. Four anesthetized male dogs received an intra-prostatic injection of Ga-68-labeled tilmanocept. Every 20 min the pelvic lymph nodes were imaged using PET/CT fusion imaging. At 90 min post-injection a prostatectomy and extended lymphadenectomy were completed ex vivo radioactivity was recorded for each node using a handheld gamma detector, and confirmed by calculation of percent-of-injected dose (%ID) via assay of Ga-68 radioactivity. SLNs were defined as containing >10 % of the maximum %ID. Preoperative PET/CT fusion imaging identified a mean of 4.25 lymph nodes per animal (range 3-7)
