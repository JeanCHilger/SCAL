Prokaryotic expression of recombinant prochymosin gene and its antiserum preparation. To optimize the prochymosin (pCHY) gene codons and express the gene in Escherichia coli (E.coli),  and to prepare its antiserum and detect chymosin protein specifically.According to codon usage bias of  E.coli,  prochymosin gene sequence was synthesized based on the conserved sequences of prochymosin gene from bovine,  lamb and camel,  and then cloned into the  plasmid pET-30a and pcDNA3-AAT-COMP-C3d3 (pcD-ACC),  respectively. pET-30a-pCHY was expressed,  as the detected antigen,  in E.coli BL21(DE3) after IPTG induction. RT-PCR was used to detect prochymosin mRNA expression in liver from the mice injected pcDNA3-AAT-COMP-pCHY-C3d3(pACCC) by hydrodynamics-based transfection method. To prepare the antiserum of prochymosin,  pACCC and GST-pCHY proteins were used to immunize New Zealand rabbits in accordance with DNA prime-protein boost strategy. Antibody levels were tested by ELISA.Western blotting showed the molecular weight of His-pCHY protein was about 55 000,  similar to the expected molecular size. ELISA demonstrated that the titer level of prochymosin antiserum was high.Based on the codon optimization,  we have obtained high-titer prochymosin antiserum through DNA vaccine vector pcD-ACC combined with DNA prime-protein boost strategy,  similar to that by protein vaccine.
