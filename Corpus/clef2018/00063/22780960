Subtype-selective dopamine receptor radioligands for PET imaging: current status and recent developments. This review presents a general overview of the subtype-selective dopamine receptor radioligands for in vivo imaging of dopamine receptor expression by positron emission tomography (PET). Besides the (11)C- and (18)F-labeled radioligands which are already in clinical use, a summary of subtype-selective radioligands which had been studied in vitro and in vivo is provided, which shines light onto the current status and recent developments in this field of radiopharmaceutical research.
