An interrupted PET coupled TBET process for the design of a specific receptor for Hg2+ and its intracellular detection in MCF7 cells. A new coumarin-rhodamine conjugate constitutes a unique example of the interrupted PET coupled TBET response for developing an imaging reagent for determining the intracellular distribution of Hg(2+) in MCF7 cells exposed to [Hg(2+)] as low as 2 ppb.
