Effects of amphetamine on the human brain opioid system--a positron emission tomography study. Studies in rodents have shown that psychostimulant drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine cause endorphin release in the brain reward system. There is also evidence for the involvement of the opioid system in human psychostimulant dependence. The acute effects of an i.v. psychostimulant drug on the brain opioid system, however, have not yet been investigated in humans. We hypothesized that an i.v. dose of amphetamine as compared to placebo would cause an opioid release in the human brain reward system, measurable as a reduction of the binding potential of the Î¼-opioid receptor radioligand [(11)C]carfentanil. Ten healthy young men were examined using positron emission tomography (PET) and [(11)C]carfentanil in three sessions: at baseline after placebo
