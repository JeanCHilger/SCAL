Diagnostic value of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors with reference to the World Health Organization classification. The 2004 classification of the World Health Organization (WHO) has demonstrated an efficacy for prediction of the prognosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. This study aimed to assess the predictive value of preoperative (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in relation to the 2004 WHO criteria. The histology of 21 pancreatic endocrine tumors resected at our hospital was reviewed and the tumors were classified according to the 2004 WHO criteria. FDG-PET findings were analyzed by comparing the findings with CT scans. FDG uptake was positive in 10 primary endocrine tumors (47%), but no uptake was seen in 11 tumors. In relation to the 2004 WHO classification, 1 out of 8 well-differentiated tumors with benign behavior was positive by PET (12.5%), 4 out of 7 well-differentiated tumors with uncertain behavior were positive (57%) and 4 low-grade malignant tumors were positive (100%). According to the WHO criteria, the rate of positive FDG uptake increased as the malignant potential increased. The metastases of low-grade malignant tumors also showed a positive FDG uptake. In conclusion, from our limited experience, FDG-PET appears to be useful for identifying pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors with a higher malignant potential. In addition, FDG-PET can detect distant metastases and may contribute to better staging of advanced disease.
