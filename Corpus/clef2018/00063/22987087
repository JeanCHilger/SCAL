Advances in immuno-positron emission tomography: antibodies for molecular imaging in oncology. Identification of cancer cell-surface biomarkers and advances in antibody engineering have led to a sharp increase in the development of therapeutic antibodies. These same advances have led to a new generation of radiolabeled antibodies and antibody fragments that can be used as cancer-specific imaging agents, allowing quantitative imaging of cell-surface protein expression in vivo. Immuno-positron emission tomography (immunoPET) imaging with intact antibodies has shown success clinically in diagnosing and staging cancer. Engineered antibody fragments, such as diabodies, minibodies, and single-chain Fv (scFv) -Fc, have been successfully employed for immunoPET imaging of cancer cell-surface biomarkers in preclinical models and are poised to bring same-day imaging into clinical development. ImmunoPET can potentially provide a noninvasive approach for obtaining target-specific information useful for titrating doses for radioimmunotherapy, for patient risk stratification and selection of targeted therapies, for evaluating response to therapy, and for predicting adverse effects, thus contributing to the ongoing development of personalized cancer treatment.
