Evaluation of the left ventricular myocardial infarction by Tc-99m cardiac pool SPECT and TI-201 myocardial SPECT--diagnoses in the inferior wall of the left ventricle and septum in the vicinity of the base of the heart. Thallium-201 myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (myocardial SPECT) has been believed likely to miss lesions or false lesions in the inferior wall of the left ventricle and septum in the vicinity of the basis of the heart. In 35 patients having undergone both coronary arterio-angiography and contrast left ventriculography, technetium-99m cardiac pool SPECT synchronized with electrocardiography (cardiac pool SPECT) and myocardial SPECT were performed simultaneously. Both cinematographic and phase techniques were used for the cardiac pool SPECT. Visual and Bull's eye techniques were used for the myocardial SPECT. The rate of correct diagnoses made by myocardial SPECT was compared by site with that by cardiac pool SPECT. With the inferior wall of the left ventricle of diagnoses made by cinematographic and phase techniques of cardiac pool SPECT, 97.0% each was correct. The rates of accurate diagnoses made by visual and Bull's eye techniques of myocardial SPECT were 97.0 and 93.9%, respectively. The rate at which at least one of the SPECT methods was correct was 97.1%. With the septum, the corresponding rates of accurate diagnoses were 97.1, 94.3, 90.0, and 90.9%, with rate of 94.3% at least one of these two methods made correct diagnoses. In conclusion, for diagnosing infarcts of the septal wall of the basis, the cardiac pool SPECT is more accurate than myocardial SPECT.
