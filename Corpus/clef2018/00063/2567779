D2-dopamine receptor specific brain uptake of carbon-11-labeled YM-09151-2. The in vivo D2-receptor specific brain uptake of N-[(2RS,3RS)-1-benzyl-2- methyl-3-pyrrolidinyl]-5-chloro-2-methoxy-4-[11C]methylaminobenzamide ([11C]YM-09151-2), was investigated. In rat brain the high uptake of [11C]YM-09151-2 in striatum was displaced with sulpiride, spiroperidol, and YM-09151-2. SCH-23390 and ritanserin, D1-dopamine and S2-serotonin antagonists, showed no effect on the distribution of [11C]YM-09151-2. In the striatum at 60 min, 95% of the radioactivity was detected as [11C]YM-09151-2 by high performance liquid chromatography. On the other hand, 41% of 11C in the plasma at 60 min was observed as metabolites. In vivo autoradiography showed a high uptake of [11C]YM-09151-2 in the striatum and in the nucleus accumbens of rat brain. A high uptake of radioactivity was also found in the canine basal ganglia with positron emission tomography. The uptake was reduced by pretreatment with spiroperidol. The present results demonstrate that [11C]YM-09151-2 is a D2 receptor specific compound and is a potential in vivo tracer for measuring D2 receptors.
