Silent ischemia: evaluation by exercise and redistribution tomographic thallium-201 myocardial imaging. To compare the amount of myocardium jeopardized during silent ischemia and painful ischemia, 112 consecutive patients undergoing coronary arteriography with ischemia demonstrated by exercise and redistribution tomographic thallium-201 myocardial imaging (SPECT) were divided into two groups: 84 patients without anginal pain (silent ischemia) and 28 with pain (painful ischemia). The SPECT apical, mid and basal ventricular levels of the short-axis view and the apical portion of the long-axis view were divided into 20 segments. The results were 1) 7.4 +/- 4.7 ischemic segments in silent ischemia and 7.6 +/- 3.7 in painful ischemia (p = NS) with 4.7 +/- 3.6 segments in silent ischemia undergoing total redistribution compared with 5.4 +/- 3.4 in painful ischemia (p = NS) 2) no difference in the incidence of single, double or triple vessel disease between silent and painful ischemic groups1) Patients with silent and painful ischemia during exercise have similar amounts of ischemic myocardium demonstrated by tomographic thallium-201 imaging and similar extent of angiographically documented coronary artery disease despite the absence of pain and the lower incidence of positive exercise ECG findings in silent ischemia. 2) Positive and negative exercise ECG findings were associated with similar amounts of ischemic myocardium.
