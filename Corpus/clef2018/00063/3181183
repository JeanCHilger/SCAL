Modification by nifedipine of 131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine kinetics in malignant phaeochromocytoma. Following a case report that oral nifedipine can suppress the secretion of noradrenaline by phaeochromocytoma, we examined the effect of nifedipine on the tumour kinetics of tracer 131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (131I-mIBG) in five patients referred for mIBG radionuclide therapy for disseminated malignant phaeochromocytoma. In one subject a striking modification of mIBG kinetics was found that resulted in a doubling of the absorbed dose to tumour while the patient was taking nifedipine. At the same time, urinary excretion of noradrenaline was suppressed by a factor of three. The effect of nifedipine in this patient was confirmed when tracer studies were repeated nine months later. The changes in tumour kinetics were shown to be due to prolonged retention of mIBG rather than increased tumour blood flow or alteration of the curve of mIBG plasma concentration as a function of time.
