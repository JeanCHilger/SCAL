Normal distribution of regional cerebral blood flow measured by dynamic single-photon emission tomography. Regional CBF (rCBF) was measured quantitatively using the inert-gas washout technique with xenon-133 and single-photon emission computed tomography. Tomographic data were reconstructed by filtered back projection, and flow was calculated according to the double-integral method. Ninety-seven subjects ranging in age from 20 to 59 years received a single examination eight of these received a second examination within 1 h of the first
