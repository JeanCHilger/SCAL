Effect of phenytoin on human cerebral glucose metabolism. We used serial positron emission tomography scans with [18F]2-deoxyglucose to study the effect of phenytoin on human cerebral glucose metabolism in 10 patients with seizure disorders. Local CMRglu for each patient was measured in 10 regions of interest. EEGs were performed during each procedure to match scans for state of consciousness and exclude data from scans with ictal activity. Serial scans without a drug change were performed in six control patients. Metabolic rates were significantly lower in two cortical regions while patients were taking phenytoin. No significant changes on repeat scan were seen in the control population. Measured across all regions of interest, metabolic rates were 13% higher when patients were off phenytoin (p less than 0.02).
