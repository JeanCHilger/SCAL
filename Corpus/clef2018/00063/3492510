Towards a behavioral typology of Alzheimer's patients. Neuropsychological test performance and estimates of regional rates of cortical glucose metabolism obtained via positron emission tomography are presented for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Analyses of these data indicated the presence of distinct subgroups characterized by qualitatively different profiles of cognitive impairment and corresponding patterns of cerebral hypometabolism. No subgroup differences were noted with regard to age at onset or reported duration of symptoms. These findings indicate that, in a given individual, AD may initially invade a relatively circumscribed cortical region. Thus, although AD may constitute a single disease process, it does not result in a unitary neuropsychological syndrome.
