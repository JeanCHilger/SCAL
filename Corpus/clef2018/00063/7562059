Presurgical visualization of primary breast carcinoma with PET emission and transmission imaging. The aim of this study was to investigate a technique that visualizes findings from PET images in a context useful for surgery.Simultaneously acquired PET emission and transmission scans were used. By applying a multipurpose imaging, registration and rendering tool (MPM), displays of orthogonal and volume-rendered views or any combination thereof were obtained. The PET emission and transmission scans were acquired under routine conditions. The final user-customized display (with a combination of orthogonal cuts and rendered views) was processed in 10 min or less on commercially available hardware. Distinct features of the body shape were clearly visible on the volume-rendered transmission views. Hot spots, e.g., in primary breast cancer, from the emission scans could be easily assessed in their localization relative to the body outline.Rendering of the main signatures in a single comprehensive display makes this method potentially valuable for simple presurgical workup and therapeutic management of breast cancer.
