Epidemiology of canine leishmaniasis in the Madrid region, Spain. A cross-sectional serological survey was carried out in the Madrid Autonomous Region (Comunidad de Madrid) in order to study and describe canine leishmaniasis epidemiology. The presence of leishmaniasis-specific antibodies was ascertained by immunofluorescence testing, 591 dogs were screened, revealing a prevalence of 5.25% (95% confidence interval 7.4-3.6), with no difference being encountered between rural and periurban areas. Age-specific prevalence exhibits a peak at 2-3 years and another at 7-8 years. Incidence or force of infection by occupation is as follows: pet dogs 0.059 (95% confidence interval 0.009-0.108) and working dogs 0.035 (95% confidence interval 0.012-0.057), there being a ratio between infection rates of 1.7, viz., indicating a 70% greater risk of infection among pet than among working dogs. The basic case reproduction number R0 is 1.06, suggesting that very intense control measures would not be needed for a drop in prevalence and incidence of infection to be achieved.
