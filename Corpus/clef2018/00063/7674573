Usefulness of 123I-BMIPP myocardial imaging in patients with stable effort angina and unstable angina. We evaluated the clinical significance of myocardial imaging using 123I-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-methyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) scintigraphy in patients with stable effort angina pectoris (SAP) and unstable angina pectoris (UAP). Thirty-three patients with SAP were studied using rest BMIPP and stress 201TlCl (Tl) myocardial scintigraphy, and 13 patients with worsening effort type of UAP were also examined using both rest BMIPP and Tl scintigraphy. We compared those BMIPP findings with myocardial perfusion images obtained with Tl and the regional wall motion determined by left ventriculography. In 45% of 282 segments of myocardial ischemia of SAP, the degree of myocardial uptake of BMIPP was concordant with that of stress Tl and the defect score of Tl was higher than that of BMIPP. On the other hand, in 32% of 62 segments of ischemia of UAP, the degree of myocardial BMIPP and Tl uptake was concordant and BMIPP defect score was higher than Tl score. In SAP, the decrease in regional wall motion agreed better with the decrease in myocardial uptake of BMIPP than that of Tl. These results suggest that myocardial ischemic regions decreased BMIPP uptake show the disturbance of fatty acid metabolism and lead to abnormal wall motions. Such ischemic regions may be clinically severe state in patients with angina pectoris.
