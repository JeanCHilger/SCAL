The fragrance mix and its constituents: a 14-year material. Results from 14 years of patch testing with the fragrance mix and its constituents are reviewed. From 1979-1992, 8215 consecutive patients were patch tested with the fragrance mix and 449 (5.5%) had a positive reaction. An increase in the frequency of reactions to fragrance mix was seen from the first 5-year period to the last. Only 54.4% of the patients tested in the last 5-year period with the individual constituents of the mix had at least 1 positive reaction. The results of testing with the constituents are the basis for a discussion of methodological problems. A significant decrease in the frequency of reaction to cinnamic aldehyde was registered, at the same time as the test concentration was reduced from 2% to 1% pet. However, no significant variations in the frequency of reactions to oak moss were seen, notwithstanding a similar reduction in test concentration.
