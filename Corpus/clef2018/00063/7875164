A hybrid method of attenuation correction for positron emission tomography brain studies. A hybrid method for attenuation correction (HAC) in positron emission tomography (PET) brain studies is proposed. The technique requires the acquisition of two short (1 min) transmission scans immediately before or after the emission study, with the patient and the head fixation system in place and after removing the patient from the scanner with the head fixation system alone. The method combines a uniform map of attenuation coefficients for the patient's head with measured attenuation coefficients for the head fixation system to generate a hybrid attenuation map. The HAC method was calibrated on 30 PET cerebral studies for comparison with the conventional measured attenuation correction method by ROI analysis. Average differences of less than 3% were found for cortical and subcortical regions. The HAC technique is particularly suitable in a PET clinical environment, allowing a reduction of the total study time, greater comfort for patients and an increase in patient throughput.
