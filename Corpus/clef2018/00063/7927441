131I-MIBG scintigraphy in neural crest tumours. Radioiodinated meta-iodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) has been widely used for the diagnosis of neuroblastomas, pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas and medullary carcinomas of thyroid. We have developed a procedure for preparation of 131I-MIBG and studied its utility in diagnosis of primary and metastatic neural crest tumours. Studies were carried out in 54 patients. Of them 39 cases were of neuroblastomas, 1 pheochromocytoma 6 operated medullary carcinomas
