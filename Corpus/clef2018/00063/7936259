Brain single-photon emission computed tomography. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides cost-effective information on regional cerebral perfusion and, indirectly, on regional cerebral metabolism. Its ease of use facilitates the application of SPECT in clinical neurology. SPECT is emerging as a useful tool for the management of patients with stroke, epilepsy, recurrent brain neoplasms, and some forms of dementia. The applications being investigated, such as in vivo receptor labeling for benzodiazepines, serotonin, dopamine, and muscarinic receptors, may expand the clinical usefulness of this technique in the future.
