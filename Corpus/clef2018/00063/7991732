Regional cerebral blood flow distribution in newly diagnosed schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder. Regional cerebral blood flow distribution (rCBF) in 24 first admissions with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder and in 17 healthy volunteers was examined. Single photon emission computed tomography with a brain-retained tracer, technetium-99m-d,l-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime, was used to study subjects under resting conditions and during performance of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. The study is a replication of a previous investigation in an independent series of patients and healthy volunteers. The patients had significantly lower relative blood flow in prefrontal regions during activation than did the healthy volunteers. An earlier series of 19 patients and 7 healthy volunteers was studied using exactly the same procedure. Analyses of the combined samples from the two studies (43 patients and 24 healthy volunteers) showed the patients to have significantly lower relative flow in prefrontal regions both at rest and during activation and higher flow in the left striatum during activation. The same finding emerged when analyses were confined to drug-naive patients and patients educationally matched to the healthy volunteers. The study suggests a defective frontostriatal interrelationship in schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder.
