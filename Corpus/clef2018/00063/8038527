A study of cerebral perfusion using single photon emission computed tomography in neonates with brain lesions. In this study we used a single photon emission computed tomography technique (SPECT) with radiolabelled 99mTcHMPAO to assess cerebral perfusion in newborn infants with documented cerebral lesions and to determine to what extent brain SPECT might be useful in the neonatal period. A total of 15 newborn infants with the following cerebral pathologies were enrolled: severe parietal bilateral periventricular leucomalacia (PVL, n = 6) moderate parietal bilateral PVL (n = 2)
