Bone scintigraphy in the evaluation of bone grafts used for mandibular reconstruction. Bone scintigraphy was applied in the follow-up of 24 patients who received bone grafts for reconstruction of the mandible after partial resection. Semiquantitative assessment of the grafts was done with a six-grade scoring system, based on comparison of tracer uptake in the graft and in the calvarium (as an internal control). Sixty-nine bone scans were evaluated. Late planar imaging was carried out in all cases, and single-photon emission tomography (SPET) was performed additionally in 34 of these cases. Complications were observed in four grafts. They occurred less frequently in revascularized grafts than in non-revascularized grafts. Planar scintigrams performed within 14 days after reconstruction showed a significantly higher tracer uptake in grafts with an uncomplicated further course than in those which developed complications. Follow-up scintigrams after 1 and 3 months revealed a significant increase in tracer uptake in grafts with an uncomplicated course. This was not apparent in grafts which developed complications. The tracer uptake was estimated to be higher on the basis of the SPET scans as compared with the planar scintigrams. It is concluded that bone scintigraphy is of prognostic value in the evaluation of bone grafts used for mandibular reconstruction. SPET seems to be more sensitive than planar imaging for the assessment of graft viability.
