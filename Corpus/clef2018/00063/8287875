Utility of thallium-201 and iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine in the scintigraphic detection of neuroendocrine neoplasia. Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a specific marker for neuroendocrine tumours, such as phaeochromocytoma, neuroblastoma, medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and paraganglioma, but it suffers in some cases (especially in MTC) from a lack of sensitivity. Thallium is a well-known marker of cellularity with a great sensitivity and a lack of specificity. In order to determine whether the association of these two markers is able to improve the detection of neuroendocrine lesions, 137 scintigraphic examinations using MIBG and thallium were performed in 101 patients referred for suspicion or follow-up of neuroendocrine tumours. Thallium chloride was first injected (1 MBq/kg), images being acquired about 20 min after injection 123I-MIBG (4 MBq/kg) was then injected and images acquired 5 and 24 h later. In patients with phaeochromocytoma or neuroblastoma, thallium scintigraphy appeared of little help since no tumoural site was discovered by thallium accumulation alone. In contrast, thallium examination seemed of interest in the detection of paraganglioma and MTC, the association of the two radiopharmaceuticals increasing the number of detected sites.
