Single-breath inhalation or rebreathing of gases labelled with positron emitters: some technical aspects of dispensing and waste gas management. A simple and reliable system for the single-breath inhalation and for short-term rebreathing of radioactive gases used in positron emission tomography is described. It comprises a collection- and radioactivity measurement-device, an inhalation bag for single-breath application, a modified anaesthetic system for rebreathing and a patient exhaled gas management system. The system is mainly used with 15O-labelled gases, but allows also the use of longer lived tracers such as methyl fluoride labelled with 18F or 11C.
