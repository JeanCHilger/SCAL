Myocardial substrate utilization and left ventricular function in adriamycin cardiomyopathy. We evaluated alterations of substrate utilization in a rat model of adriamycin cardiomyopathy with deteriorating left ventricular function. Rats were treated with adriamycin (2 mg/kg), once a week for 6, 8, 9 and 10 wk. Fluorine-18-F-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) and 125I-beta-methyl-branched fatty acid (125I-BMIPP) were used as tracers of glucose and fatty acid metabolism and 99mTc-hexakis (2-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile) (99mTc-MIBI) was used as a myocardial blood flow tracer. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) calculated from gated blood pool images was used as an indicator of cardiac function. LVEF was normal in the 6-wk group (78.0% +/- 4.8%), abruptly decreased in the 8-wk group (43.1% +/- 10.1%) and further deteriorated in the 9-wk group (27.6% +/- 13.4%). Accumulation of 18F-FDG (%kgID/g) in the hearts of adriamycin treated animals progressively decreased compared to controls (2.19% +/- 0.38%) 1.47% +/- 0.42% (p < 0.01) at 6 wk, 1.22% +/- 0.27% (p < 0.001) at 8 wk, 0.69% +/- 0.56% (p < 0.001) at 9 wk and 0.50% +/- 0.08% (p < 0.001) at 10 wk. This decrease occurred earlier than the deterioration in LVEF. Myocardial accumulation of 125I-BMIPP decreased in the advanced stages of adriamycin cardiomyopathy and was well correlated with the decrease in 18F-FDG accumulation. However, the decrease was less profound than for 18F-FDG
