Fast transmission CT for determining attenuation maps using a collimated line source, rotatable air-copper-lead attenuators and fan-beam collimation. We describe a technique using a line source and a rotatable air-copper-lead assembly to acquire gamma transmission computed tomographic (TCT) data for determining attenuation maps to compensate SPECT emission scans. The technique minimizes problems associated with discriminating 99mTc transmission and 201Tl emission photons and requires only a modest increase in total study time. A 99mTc line source and a stacked foil ("multislat") collimator are placed near the focal line of a fan-beam collimator (114 cm focal length) mounted on one detector of a triple-camera SPECT system. We acquired TCT data of plastic rod and anthropomorphic thorax phantoms to investigate the capability of the line source and rotatable air-copper-lead attenuators to determine attenuation maps. The data were acquired with and without 5.4 MBq (145 microCi) of 201Tl placed in the myocardial chamber of the thorax phantom. Phantoms also were scanned using a curved transmission slab source mounted to a parallel-hole collimator. Fan-beam TCT images have improved resolution compared with parallel-beam TCT images. Two patient scans also were performed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of fan-beam TCT. The rotatable air-copper-lead attenuator method eliminates contamination of emission data by transmission photons and reduces spill-over of emission data into the transmission energy window for some cases. Results show the feasibility of using fast, sequential or interlaced transmission scans of a line source within a rotatable air-copper-lead attenuator assembly to obtain accurate attenuation maps for SPECT attenuation compensation.
