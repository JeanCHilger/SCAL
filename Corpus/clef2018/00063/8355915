A method to improve the quality of bone marrow scintigraphy by scatter radiation correction with the use of two opposing views. Bone marrow scintigraphy using radiocolloids labelled with 99Tcm allows imaging of the active marrow with moderate effort. However, most of the administered colloid is trapped in the liver and spleen giving rise to a considerable amount of scattered photons, which cause considerable problems when evaluating the adjacent bone marrow. There are scatter correction methods developed for single photon emission computed tomography. The application of such a technique to bone marrow scintigraphy in the liver region using two opposing views is described. Phantom measurement and patients studies show that substantially improved visualization of the bone marrow close to the liver is possible using this technique for scatter correction.
