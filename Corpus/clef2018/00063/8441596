Diagnosis of myocardial infarction by cine MR imaging--a comparative study with thallium-201 myocardial SPECT. The usefulness of cine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was evaluated in 41 patients with acute (4 cases), subacute (21 cases) and chronic (16 cases) myocardial infarctions on the basis of the findings of thallium-201 myocardial SPECT. The overall rate of diagnostic accordance between cine MR imaging and SPECT was 85.0% (408/480). It was highest at the middle of the left ventricle (89.0%, 146/164) and lowest at the base (82.7%, 129/156). Measurement of wall thickness using the images printed on films was possible in 87.1% of segments (418/480). There was a significant difference in end-diastolic wall thickness and %-thickening between the infarcted and non-infarcted sites except for the base of the left ventricle. However, diastolic wall thinning was not remarkable in acute cases of less than one week after onset. In these cases %-thickening may be useful. Partial volume averaging on MR imaging and the inaccuracy of SPECT findings at the base also made meaningful comparison difficult. The most important diagnostic findings of myocardial infarction on cine MR imaging were end-diastolic wall thinning and abnormal motion such as akinesis and dyskinesis. It is concluded that cine MR imaging is a useful noninvasive examination method for evaluating the status of cardiac function in myocardial infarction.
