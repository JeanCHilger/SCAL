Time-dependent effects of a haloperidol challenge on energy metabolism in the normal human brain. Positron emission tomography and the fluorodeoxyglucose method were used to measure regional brain metabolism before and 2 h after haloperidol (5 mg, i.m.) in 11 young normal men. These data were compared with measures obtained from nine previously studied normal men who had received no drug intervention. Although a previously published study had demonstrated significantly decreased metabolism in whole brain, neocortex, limbic cortex, thalamus, and caudate nucleus 12 h after a 5-mg dose of haloperidol, the present 2-h study did not show significant metabolic changes despite the fact that significant extrapyramidal effects occurred. Taken together, these studies demonstrate differences in the temporal organization of behavioral and metabolic responses to haloperidol challenge.
