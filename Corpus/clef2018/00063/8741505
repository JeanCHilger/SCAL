The regional wall motion and the myocardial fatty acid metabolism at hibernating myocardium. To evaluate the regional wall motion and the myocardial fatty acid metabolism at hibernating myocardium after revascularization (PTCA or CABG), we performed dual SPECT with 201Tl and 123I-beta-methyliodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP), and left ventriculography (LVG) in 34 patients with coronary artery disease before and 3 to 4 months after revascularization. In the SPECT, regional tracer uptake was estimated qualitatively (visual) and quantitatively (% uptake). Regional wall motion was estimated qualitatively (visual) and quantitatively (shortening fraction). At the 78 hibernating areas, the improvement of regional wall motion was more significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with that of regional tracer uptake of 123I-BMIPP (r = 0.63) than 201Tl (r = 0.39), and also correlated with the improvement of the difference between 201Tl and 123I-BMIPP regional uptake (r = 0.36). These results suggest that the improvement of wall motion at hibernating myocardium is more significantly correlated with the improvement of 123I-BMIPP than 201Tl uptake after revascularization.
