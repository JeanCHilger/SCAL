Cloning, expression and purification of the ligand-binding region of human IL-6R in E. coli and its preliminary functional identification. The ligand-binding region of human IL-6R is taken as the target gene fragment to be cloned and expressed. With pET-3b as expressing vector, two recombinants pET-6R(B) and pET-6R(B)4 have been constructed encoding the ligand-binding region (28 kD) of hIL-6R and its dimmer (53 kD), respectively. After induction with IPTG, they produced two proteins rIL6R-28 of 28 kD and rIL6R-53 of 53 kD amounting to 50% and 30% of total bacteria proteins, respectively. The expressed products were mainly recovered as inclusion bodies. After purification and renaturation, both of them were capable of augmenting the growth-stimulating effect of IL-6 on 7TD1 cells, an IL-6 dependent cell line. The result of ELISA also revealed that both rIL6R-28 and rIL6R-53 had the obvious ligand-binding activity.
