Quantitative imaging of iodine-124 with PET. PET is potentially very useful for the accurate in vivo quantitation of time-varying biological distributions of radiolabeled antibodies over several days. The short half-lives of most commonly used positron-emitting nuclides make them unsuitable for this purpose. Iodine-124 is a positron emitter with a half-life of 4.2 days and appropriate chemical properties. It has not been widely used because of a complex decay scheme including several high energy gamma rays. However, measurements made under realistic conditions on several different PET scanners have shown that satisfactory imaging and quantitation can be achieved.Whole-body and head-optimized scanners with different detectors (discrete BGO, block BGO and BaF2 time-of-flight), different septa and different correction schemes were used. Measurements of resolution, quantitative linearity and the ability to quantitatively image spheres of different sizes and activities in different background activities were made using phantoms.Compared with conventional PET nuclides, resolution and quantitation were only slightly degraded. Sphere detectability was also only slightly worse if imaging time was increased to compensate for the lower positron abundance.Quantitative imaging with 124I appears to be possible under realistic conditions with various PET scanners.
