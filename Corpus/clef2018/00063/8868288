In vitro evaluation of N-(fluoro)isopropyl norephedrine as potential cardiac imaging agents for PET. N-Isopropylnorephedrine (INE) and N-fluoroisopropylnorephedrine (FINE) were found to have a poor affinity for either beta-adrenoceptors and the norepinephrine carrier protein. The low affinity of both compounds for Uptake-1 is probably due to the introduction of a bulky substituent on the nitrogen atom. It is concluded that INE and FINE cannot be used for cardiac imaging with PET.
