Motor imagery--anatomical representation and electrophysiological characteristics. Experience and results of neuropsychological studies have shown that motor imagery can improve motor performance and enhance motor learning. In recent years several electro-physiological and functional imaging studies have investigated the physiological basis for this observation. In the present essay we review two of our recent studies, in which we compared motor imagery with motor preparation and motor execution. In the first we used positron emission tomography to describe their functional anatomy and in the second we employed electromyography, H-reflexes and transcranial magnetic stimulation to delineate their electrophysiological characteristics. Both studies demonstrated that motor imagery shares some characteristics with motor preparation and other, additional ones with motor execution. Thus it can be seen as a special form of motor behaviour, similar but distinct from both motor preparation and execution. This combination of mutual and distinct characteristics may be the key to its successful role in motor learning.
