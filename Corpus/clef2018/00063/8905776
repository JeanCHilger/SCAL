Single photon emission computed tomography brain imaging. SPECT brain perfusion imaging has definite value in the evaluation of cerebrovascular disease (particularly acute stroke), dementia, epilepsy, and may have a role in the diagnosis of brain death and head trauma. SPECT with tumor tracers T1-201 and Tc-99m sestamibi shows promise for detecting tumor recurrence.
