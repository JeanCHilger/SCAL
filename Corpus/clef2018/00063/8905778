Use of functional magnetic resonance imaging. It has been the goal of this article to provide the reader with a brief background of fMRI, a basic understanding of the techniques of fMRI, and, more importantly, the potential for clinical and experimental studies using fMRI. In contrast to the limited number of installed PET and MEG units, the large installed base of MR imaging scanners (over 1000 installed at least at 1.5 T in the United States) makes fMRI potentially widely available. Initial studies (both clinical and experimental) have been validated and are reproducible in mapping the sensorimotor and visual cortices. The areas of language lateralization and memory are still preliminary at best. As methods to reduce the effects of head motion (due to both bulk head motion and physiologically induced motion) arise, the reliability of fMRI should improve, allowing for more definitive identification of task activation.
