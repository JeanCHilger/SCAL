Myocardial beta adrenoceptor density in primary and secondary left ventricular hypertrophy. Myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density has been found to be reduced in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, even when systolic function is preserved. Our purpose in the current study was to investigate whether beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation was unique to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or is also present in secondary myocardial hypertrophy.Myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density was measured in 11 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, eight patients with left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to arterial hypertension or aortic valve disease and 18 normal control subjects, using positron emission tomography with 11C-CGP-12177 as the myocardial beta-adrenoceptor ligand.Reflecting the natural incidence of the conditions, the age of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients was 37 (10) [mean (SD), range 20-51] years and that of the secondary hypertrophy patients 64 (18), [range 26-80] years P < 0.01. The controls' ages were 50 (13), [range 21-65] yearsMyocardial beta-adrenoceptor density appears to be comparably decreased in both primary and secondary left ventricular hypertrophy in the presence of preserved left ventricular systolic function.
