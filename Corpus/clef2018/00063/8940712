Detection of bony metastases of androgen-independent prostate cancer by PET-FDG. Fourteen F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) studies were carried out in 13 patients known to have bony metastases from carcinoma of the prostate. One patient was newly diagnosed. The remaining patients had various types of therapy and were considered hormonally resistant. The average age was 67. All patients had extensive bony metastases shown on the conventional Tc99m-MDP bone scans. Only about 18% of bony lesions apparent on the conventional bone scans showed corresponding increase of FDG uptake. Anatomical correlation was performed by using co-registered images of SPECT and PET in the same area. The positive FDG uptake was not related to the duration of illness, level of PSA, previous therapy, and magnitude of disease involvement. It appears that only a small percentage of bony metastases is associated with increased glycolysis. It is possible that other metabolic processes are more important than glycolysis for providing prostate cancer with a source of energy and nutrients.
