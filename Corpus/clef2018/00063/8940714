PET and [18F]-FDG in oncology: a clinical update. Positron emission tomography (PET) has become a very useful adjunct to anatomic imaging techniques, adding unique information to the characterization of disease. The whole-body PET FDG technique developed over the last few years has surpassed most expectations with respect to its utility in clinical oncology. The large spectrum of neoplasms that now can be studied with this approach makes it an essential clinical imaging tool in diagnosis and management for many patients with cancer. The metabolic information provided by this technique is complementary to results from standard clinical and morphological examinations. It may be anticipated that through application of the multi-modality imaging approach, significant advances in medical care will come.
