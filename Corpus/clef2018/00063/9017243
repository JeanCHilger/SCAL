Early auditory filial learning in degus (Octodon degus): behavioral and autoradiographic studies. Degu mothers (Octodon degus) utter specific maternal calls during nursing which presumably stimulate and reinforce suckling. Pups from surgically muted mothers show a reduced gain of body weight during postnatal development compared to pups from normally vocalizing mothers. Our behavioral studies suggest that the pups have to learn the meaning of the maternal calls during the first two weeks of life. Two-week-old pups from normally vocalizing mothers expressed a preference for the maternal call in a behavioral discrimination test, in contrast to pups from surgically muted mothers. Investigation of brain activities using the 2-[14C]fluoro-deoxyglucose (2-FDG) method revealed that pups from normal mothers display a significantly higher 2-FDG uptake in precentral medial, anterior cingulate cortex and a slight, non-significant increase in the prelimbic cortex and orbital PFC upon presentation of the maternal call, compared to pups from muted mothers, for which the maternal call was unfamiliar and meaningless. These prefrontal cortical areas are known to be involved in associative learning processes and our data suggest that they are involved in the association between the maternal call and the positive emotional situation during nursing.
