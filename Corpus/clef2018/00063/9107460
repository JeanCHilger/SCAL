Cobalt-55 positron emission tomography in ischemic stroke. After acute cerebral stroke, the (peri-) infarct tissue is characterized by calcium (Ca)-mediated neuronal damage and inflammatory processes. Monitoring Ca-mediated damage using the isotope cobalt-55 (Co) as a Ca-tracer may enable PET-imaging of this tissue. Since the fate of (peri-) infarct tissue determines clinical outcome, Co-PET may have prognostic value in stroke. Six stroke patients were examined with Co-PET, MRI and a middle cerebral artery (mca) stroke scale (Orgogozo). In every patient, specific Co-accumulation in the appropriate brain region was seen, irrespective of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. This pilot study suggests Co-PET as a diagnostic tool in stroke, which may provide additional information on the clinical outcome. Validation of method in larger patient series is necessary.
