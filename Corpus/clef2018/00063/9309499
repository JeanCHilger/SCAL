Market study: biomaterials supply for permanent medical implants. The withdrawal of DuPont as a supplier of key raw materials created a major dislocation in the medical device industry. We studied the present and future impact caused by the market removal of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) yarn ("Dacron"), polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) fiber and resin ("Teflon"), and polyacetal resin ("Delrin"). Findings were: 1) Dollar values of the permanent medical implant markets for PET yarn, PTFE fiber and resin, and polyacetal resin are a minute fraction, of their values for their other commercial markets 2) The implant market value is clearly not commensurate with the liability risk
