Assessment of vasoreactivity in brain edema by acetazolamide activation SPECT and PET. Our study was performed to find out cerebrovascular reactivity post acetazolamide administration in patients with peritumoral edema. Adult patients (n = 9) underwent CBF measurement by 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT pre and post 1 gram i.v. acetazolamide. In all patients, this procedure was repeated once again within 10 days of performing tumor removal. Five of these patients also underwent CBF measurement pre and post 1 gram i.v. acetazolamide post surgery only using oxygen-15 labeled H2O PET. Asymmetry index (AI) was calculated as ratio of ROI counts in the peritumoral edematous area and symmetrical ROI on the contralateral normal hemisphere. The AI increased after acetazolamide in edematous gray matter post operatively though the resting AI remained almost same post operatively. AI in edematous white matter showed non-significant increase post operatively both at rest and after acetazolamide. Good linear correlation of AI between PET and SPECT was observed both in gray and white matter. The improvement of vascular reactivity in edematous gray matter after tumor removal suggests that mass effect not only reduces CBF but also suppresses vascular reactivity. White matter vascular reactivity in early post operative period is little improved, possibly due to factors other than mass effect i.e. excess water accumulation in white matter perivascular space.
