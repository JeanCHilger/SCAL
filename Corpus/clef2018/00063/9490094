Early prediction of treatment outcome in head and neck cancer with 2-18FDG PET. The development of alternative treatment regimens in clinical oncology has increased the need for early prediction of cancer therapy outcome. The aim of this study was, early in the treatment phase, to identify patients with advanced head and neck cancer, responding or not responding to initiated therapy. The tumour metabolic rate of glucose (MRgl) examined by 2-18FDG-PET was determined in 17 patients before and after the first weeks of either radiotherapy (16-35 Gy) or one course of combination chemotherapy. Metabolic values uptake values normalized to plasma activity integrals--were correlated to loco-regional outcome, as evaluated 5-6 weeks after completion of treatment. Initial low tumour MRgl (<20 micromol/min/100 g tissue), in primary lesions or regional metastases, predicted a local complete response. When a high initial tumour MRgl was found, the magnitude of the reduction of MRgl in the second PET examination might be an adjunct in predicting local tumour response.
