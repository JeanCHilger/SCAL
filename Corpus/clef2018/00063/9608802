Prognosis of patients with angina pectoris or silent ischemia: exercise 99mTC-MIBI SPECT. Although different reports have compared the extent of the myocardial ischemia in patients with or without angina during exercise test, there have been few publications which have studied their prognosis. The aim of this study is to analyze the prognostic value of the presence of angina during 99mTc-MIBI SPECT in patients with proven coronary artery disease without previous myocardial infarction.We studied 82 patients prospectively with at least one coronary stenosis > 70% and with reversible perfusion defects in 99mTc-MIBI SPECT (long protocol). Twenty two of these patients had angina during exercise test. The extension of ischemia was quantified on SPECT and the severity of coronary stenoses on coronary angiography. The mean follow-up period was 3.2 years.The angina patients showed a significantly lower coronary reserve (exercise duration: 6.3 min vs 8 min p = 0.03), a lower maximal O2 consumption (5.8 METs vs 6.2 METsPresence of angina during 99mTc-MIBI SPECT portends a higher risk of medium and long term complications, mainly due to surgical revascularization.
