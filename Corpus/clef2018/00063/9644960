Sympathetic reinnervation of the transplanted heart. Study using iodine-123 labeled meta-iodobenzylguanidine. Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is an analogue of norepinephrine and its cardiac uptake shows sympathetic innervation. During the heart transplantation the allograft becomes completely denervated. The present study was conducted to assess the evolution of sympathetic re-innervation after transplantation, and to related re-innervation with functional status.We studied 31 patients from 6 months to 12 years after transplantation by 123I-MIBG studies to evaluate re-innervation and by rest/exercise radionuclide ventriculography to evaluate cardiac function. Myocardial MIBG uptake was quantified by calculating a heart-to-mediastinum ratio (HMR). An HMR > 1.8 was considered normal, moderate between 1.8 and 1.6, mild between 1.6 and 1.3, and absent < 1.3.HMR correlated with time after transplantation (r = 0.607 p < 0.001). HMR of patients studied after 2 years of transplantation was significantly higher (1.62 +/- 0.2 vs 1.34 +/- 0.2Sympathetic re-innervation increase with time after heart transplantation, and is more frequently seen 2 years after transplantation. Sympathetic re-innervation first appears in the anterior or the antero-lateral regions. A complete re-innervation of the transplanted heart does not occur 12 years after transplantation.
