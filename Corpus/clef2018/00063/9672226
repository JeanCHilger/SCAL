Magnetic field tomography analysis of continuous speech. In this article we investigate MEG correlates of syntactic violations in continuous speech. An early left anterior negativity (ELAN) has been reported in previous EEG studies and has been related to syntactic processing. We used Magnetic Field Tomography (MFT) to extract a 3D estimate of the current density distribution J, from MEG data recorded while subjects listened to continuous speech. Separate estimates were obtained from the activity associated with the first word of the sentence, and the last words of the sentence which signified syntactic violation, semantic violation or correct sentences. In each case independent 3D MFT estimates of activity were obtained 2 ms apart. After converting the solutions into a PET-like format we perform a statistical analysis on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Visual inspection of the power of J at the time of the ELAN component and the statistical maps overlaid on the individual anatomical MRI suggests generators in the vicinity of the auditory cortex and in left frontal regions. Directional activation curves are computed to show the variation of activity as a function of time, from well circumscribed areas. The activation curve for the auditory cortex has a characteristic pattern consisting of three peaks, seen in the average time-locked to the onset of the first word, and the critical word of the syntactic violation. The left auditory cortex shows a delay of about 30 ms in the syntactic violation condition compared to the first word condition. No such delay is seen in the right auditory cortex.
