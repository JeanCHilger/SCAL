Current and future technological trends in positron emission tomography. Current trends in positron emission tomography (PET) instrumentation are examined, with an emphasis on providing information suitable to the prospective PET user. Basic principles underlying PET are explained and information on performance measurements, techniques, and quantitation are given in order to allow the user to compare and contrast different types of PET scanners.  These scanner designs are described.  Specific examples are given and the combination of PET with other modalities is discussed.
