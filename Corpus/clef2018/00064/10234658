Evaluation of suspected recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. We evaluated 10 patients with suspected recurrent papillary thyroid cancer using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET). Prior therapy included total (n = 8) or subtotal (n = 2) thyroidectomy, radiation therapy (n = 2) and radioiodine ablation (n = 2). All patients had an 131I scan and one or more of the following imaging studies: 99Tcm-sestamibi scan. 111In-octreotide scan, sonography (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both the PET and 131I scans were negative in four patients. The PET and 131I scan results were discordant in six patients. Of the six discordant cases, five had true-positive PET scans and false-negative 131I studies. Three of these patients underwent neck lymph node dissection that showed positive histology for metastatic papillary carcinoma. Another patient had fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a parapharyngeal mass that was also positive for papillary carcinoma. One patient was treated with radiation to the thyroid surgical bed based on an elevated serum thyroglobulin and a positive PET finding. Tumour response with a decrease in the size of the lesion was documented by a follow-up MRI scan. The remaining patient had a presumed false-positive PET scan, since a difficult hypocellular FNA of a small palpable lymph node was negative for tumour. We conclude that FDG PET is useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected recurrent papillary thyroid cancer when the 131I scan is negative.
