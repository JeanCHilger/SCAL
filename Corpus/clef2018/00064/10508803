Role of cyclooxygenase-2 in oleic acid-induced acute lung injury. Eicosanoid production appears to be important to both edemagenesis and the pattern of pulmonary perfusion in experimental acute lung injury (ALI). We hypothesized that these effects could be mediated by the inducible form of cyclooxygenase (COX-2). We used positron emission tomography to evaluate the pulmonary perfusion pattern in dogs given oleic acid (OA) only (n = 6), the novel COX-2 inhibitor SC-236 50 min before OA (n = 3), and SC-236 given 20 min before endotoxin (Etx), followed by OA given 30 min after Etx (n = 5). Thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) and prostacyclin (6-keto prostaglandin F(1alpha) 6-keto PGF(1alpha)) metabolite concentrations in plasma and lung tissue were measured in these groups and in another group given Etx + OA (n = 4). Inhibition of COX-2 before administration of OA alone or before administration of Etx and OA did not have any significant effect on plasma or lung tissue concentrations of TXB(2). However, inhibition of COX-2 prior to Etx and OA significantly reduced the plasma and lung tissue concentrations of 6-keto PGF(1alpha) as compared with those in the group given only Etx + OA. Moreover, SC-236 prevented the expected loss of perfusion redistribution associated with Etx + OA only. The effect of endotoxin on pulmonary perfusion in ALI is therefore the result of a COX-2-mediated increase in prostacyclin production in lung tissue.
