Current imaging modalities for the diagnosis of breast cancer. Although mammography still remains the gold standard for breast cancer screening and diagnosis, it typically cannot differentiate benign from malignant disease and is less accurate in patients with dense glandular breasts. This article is an overview of imaging modalities that have emerged to augment mammography and improve the accuracy of non-invasive breast cancer diagnosis. Ultrasound is currently used to differentiate breast masses and guide aspirations and biopsies. Magnetic resonance imaging has excellent sensitivity in demonstrating breast cancer but a low specificity. Nuclear medicine studies have recently emerged that detect the increased metabolic rate and vascularity of breast cancers. Other modalities, such as thermography and computed tomography, have a more limited utility for breast cancer diagnosis. Digital mammography is among other emerging technological advancements that will continue to develop and improve the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis in the future.
