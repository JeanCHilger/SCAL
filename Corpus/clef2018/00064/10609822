Dopamine transporter density in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Dopamine transporter density was measured in vivo in six adult patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. We have shown a 70% increase in age-corrected dopamine transporter density in patients with attention hyperactivity disorder compared with healthy controls.
