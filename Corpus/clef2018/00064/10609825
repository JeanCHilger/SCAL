Changes in regional cerebral blood flow after a cold hand test in systemic lupus erythematosus patients with Raynaud's syndrome. The appearance of vasospastic features in the central nervous system (CNS) after a cold stressor test was Investigated through single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of regional cerebral blood flow in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, with and without Raynaud's syndrome, and in scleroderma patients. We have shown that Raynaud's syndrome may occur in the CNS and that anticardiolipin or lupus anticoagulant positivity may favour perfusion defects.
