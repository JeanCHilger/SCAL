Positron emission tomography ia an effective tool in modern oncology. A total of 399 positron emission tomography (PET) examinations were carried out with a GE 4096 Plus PET scanner during the past 5 years on patients referred to the National Institute of Oncology in Budapest. The majority (n = 316) of these investigations were performed with the use of [18F]-fluorodezoxyglucose (FDG) to map the glucose metabolism [11C]-methionine PET was indicated in 79 cases to detect protein transport and metabolism. The perfusion tracer [15O]-butanol was applied in only 4 cases to answer certain oncology-related, differential diagnostic questions. The oncological examinations were related to primary diagnostics, staging/restaging and therapy monitoring. In the staging/restaging and therapy monitoring of known tumours, conclusive results were achieved in 81-82% of the cases by using either FDG or [11C]-methionine as tracer. The concordant numerical data indicated that the PET investigation provides a definite answer to the question of the presence or absence of viable tumour tissue, with similar effectivity in any of the above indications, no matter whether FDG or [11C]-methionine is used. The search for occult primary tumours was the most frequent indication within the primary diagnostics: 10 (37%) primaries were localized by using FDG PET in the 27 investigated cases. This is a remarkably high value, especially in view of the failure of all the conventional diagnostic procedures carried out prior to the PET investigations. Application of PET may be indicated in all cases when the ultimate question is a non-invasive estimation of viable tumorous tissue.
