Picture naming without Broca's and Wernicke's area. Lexical and semantic retrieval was investigated in normal volunteers with PET by comparing picture confrontation naming and verb generation related to the same pictures. Conjunction analysis of the naming and verb generation uncovered a common network including the occipito-temporal ventral pathway for object recognition, and the bilateral anterior insula, SMA and precentral gyrus for coordination, planning and overt word production. Naming and verb generation highlighted two different patterns: verb generation showed specific implication of Broca and Wernicke's areas, whereas naming specifically relied on the primary visual areas, the right fusiform and parahippocampal gyri and the left anterior temporal region. These results indicate that speech does not necessarily involve the Wernicke-Broca's language network and testify that naming relies on an early developmental language network.
