Myocardial perfusion by contrast echocardiography: diagnosis of coronary artery disease using contrast-enhanced stress echocardiography and assessment of coronary anatomy and flow reserve. The advent of intravenous contrast agents, and newer ultrasound technology to enhance their detection, promises to improve and augment our conventional stress echocardiographic practice by improving diagnostic accuracy and providing novel information regarding myocardial perfusion and functional assessment of the coronary vasculature. The combination of intravenous contrast and harmonic stress echocardiography is a powerful tool for improved wall motion analysis through enhanced image quality, routinely permitting the evaluation of patients with suboptimal images. In this era of cost containment, we await studies in large populations addressing resource utilization and cost-effectiveness to determine if, indeed, all patients presenting with stress echocardiography should receive contrast. Myocardial perfusion can be observed using the technique, but the complex interactions of microbubbles and ultrasound in patients must be understood more fully before its implementation becomes routine practice. Non-invasive imaging of coronary arteries using contrast-enhanced transthoracic harmonic echo/Doppler promises to expand the field of diagnostic and experimental echocardiography, bringing new insight into the pathophysiology of ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease. The continued development of newer contrast agents and refinement of ultrasound imaging equipment ensures that the applications of contrast echocardiography in the assessment of CAD will continue to increase.
