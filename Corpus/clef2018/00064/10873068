High microvascular blood volume is associated with high glucose uptake and tumor angiogenesis in human gliomas. The purpose of this investigation was to elucidate the association between microvascular blood volume and glucose uptake and to link these measures with tumor angiogenesis. We demonstrate a regionally specific correlation between tumor relative microvascular blood volume (CBV), determined in vivo with functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques, and tumor glucose uptake determined with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Regions of maximum glucose uptake were well matched with maximum CBV across all patients (n = 21 r = 0.572
