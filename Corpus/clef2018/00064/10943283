Digital mammography, sestamibi breast scintigraphy, and positron emission tomography breast imaging. Digital mammography allows for the separate optimization of image acquisition and display. Through this technology, and the application of image processing and computer aided diagnosis, breast cancer detection and breast lesion diagnosis might be improved. Besides the obvious data storage, retrieval, and transmission advantages that digital mammography will allow, additional advances such as tomosynthesis, dual energy mammography and digital subtraction mammography are in development. The possible future utility of Sestamibi breast scintigraphy and breast imaging with positron emission tomography is also discussed.
