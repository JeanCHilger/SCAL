Nuclear medicine diagnosis in diseases of the central nervous system. Positron-emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can be used to visualize and quantify cerebral perfusion, glucose consumption, neurotransmission, and amino acid uptake. These techniques are clearly superior to conventional structural imaging techniques for several indications. This contribution describes the clinical role of PET and SPECT in clinical neurology.
