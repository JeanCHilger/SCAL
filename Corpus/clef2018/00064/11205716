New radiographic techniques to evaluate cerebrovascular disorders in children. The radiographic evaluation of the pediatric patient with cerebrovascular disease has dramatically improved during the past decade. Few new technologies have been introduced, but significant new developments in data acquisition and post-processing have resulted from refinements in both software and, to a lesser extent, hardware. This review focuses on the advantages and limitations of the different imaging modalities and their recommended role in managing the pediatric patient who presents with signs or symptoms of cerebrovascular disease.
