Fatal intussusception associated with intestinal coccidiosis (Eimeria perforans) in a rabbit. Fatal intussusception was observed to be the proximate cause of death in a young (14 wk old) pet male New Zealand white rabbit. The intussusception was ileo-ileal, and this region was shown to be extensively parasitized by Eimeria perforans. It was concluded that the intussusception was consequent to hyperperistalsis induced by the coccidial infection of the intestines.
