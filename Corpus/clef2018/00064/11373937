Follow-up of differentiated thyroid cancer patients using rhTSH--preliminary results. In the follow-up of patients with advanced stage thyroid cancer radioiodine scintigraphy, F-18-FDG PET and tumormarker hTg using stimulation with recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) were compared to the results of same diagnostic procedures during TSH-suppression or endogenous TSH-stimulation.30 patients were investigated in hypothyroidism and after application of rhTSH regarding the serum hormone concentrations, hTg, radioiodine scans and FGD-PET scans.Radioiodine avidity and FDG uptake were significantly higher in 7/30 and 3/5 patients, respectively, compared to endogenous stimulation or TSH-suppression. In about one third of patients hTg increased more than 30%.Our preliminary results indicate a sufficient feasibility and sensitivity of rhTSH not only in the follow-up by hTg and radioiodine scan but also in FDG-PET.
