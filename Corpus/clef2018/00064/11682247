Subjective effects of AMPT-induced dopamine depletion in schizophrenia: correlation between dysphoric responses and striatal D(2) binding ratios on SPECT imaging. Approximately one third of schizophrenic patients treated with neuroleptic drugs experience unpleasant subjective responses, that are collectively known as neuroleptic dysphoria. Experimental research in animals indicates that drug induced dopaminergic blockade in mesolimbic circuits, especially the nucleus accumbens, leads to impaired pleasure responsivity and dysphoria. The present study tested this putative mechanism in drug-free schizophrenic patients (n = 12), through inducing dysphoric responses with alphamethyl paratyrosine (AMPT) and simultaneously quantifying their baseline striatal dopmine (D(2)) function with (123)IBZM-SPECT imaging. Results showed a wide variability in the occurrence and severity of dysphoric responses, clearly distinguishing a dysphoric group from non-dysphoric responders. Severity of dysphoric responses, measured by standardized rating scales, correlated inversely with changes in D(2) receptor binding ratios (r = +0.82, p <.01). These results support the notion that striatal dopaminergic activity is not uniformly elevated in all schizophrenic patients, and the sub-group of individuals with lower baseline dopamine function are at an increased risk for dysphoric responses during antipsychotic therapy with dopaminergic blocking drugs.
