Imaging of the endothelial dysfunction in coronary atherosclerosis. Coronary endothelial dysfunction is characterised by coronary vasoconstrictive responses to endothelium-dependent vasodilators. It is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and is considered an early phase of coronary atherosclerosis. Patients with CAD benefit from vigorous risk factor interventions and medical treatment, with a marked decrease in coronary events and an improvement in survival that are not reported following revascularisation procedures. Therefore, early detection of anatomical and functional changes in the coronary vasculature due to atherosclerosis provides the basis for integrated pharmacological, dietary and lifestyle modifications to prevent cardiovascular events and revascularisation procedures. The question arises as to whether these alterations in regional myocardial tone can be detected by any of the current non-invasive methods. Several methods are reviewed. We consider that intracoronary ultrasonography is the most accurate method, but non-invasive positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging technology is of growing importance for identifying endothelial dysfunction of early coronary atherosclerosis.
