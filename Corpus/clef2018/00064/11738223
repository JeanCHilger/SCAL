Exercise-induced ST-elevation is related to left ventricular dysfunction but not to myocardial viability in patients with healed myocardial infarction. Exercise-induced ST-segment elevation was proposed as a marker of myocardial viability after a recent myocardial infarction.The aim of this study was to evaluate whether exercise-induced ST segment elevation is related to viability or to left ventricular dysfunction in patients with history of old Q wave myocardial infarction.Fifty patients (43 men, age 57+/-11 years) were studied 31+/-49 months after a Q wave myocardial infarction. They all underwent stress, reinjection-redistribution, and late redistribution Tl-201 SPECT, completed by equilibrium radionuclide angiography. Viability was defined by defect reversibility or significant (>60%) persistent Tl-201 uptake in dyssinergic segments on late redistribution SPECT. Relative post-exercise and reinjection-redistribution LV volumes were calculated using validated software (QGS).Twenty-one out of 50 patients (42%, G1) had significant stress-induced ST-elevation (>1 mm 80 ms after J point in at least 2 ECG leads with Q wave), and 29/50 (58%, G2) did not. Seventeen out of 50 patients (34%) demonstrated myocardial viability on late redistribution scan. The diagnostic accuracy of exercise-induced ST-elevation was only 52% for viability assessment. Significant LVEF reduction and increased relative LV volumes were observed in G1 compared to G2 (LVEF: 39+/-10% vs. 49+/-11%, P=0.003 post-stress LV volume: 134+/-98 ml vs. 81+/-41 ml, P<0.02These results suggest that, in patients with history of myocardial infarction, exercise-induced ST-segment elevation is not related to persistent myocardial viability but is associated to left ventricular dysfunction.
