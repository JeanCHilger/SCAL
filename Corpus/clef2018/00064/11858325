Implementation of PET scan as a new service. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a diagnostic test using injected radiopharmaceuticals (drugs or compounds tagged with radioactive isotopes) to obtain images of metabolic/physiologic processes. PET provides physiologic data rather than just anatomic data such as that provided by CT scan or MRI. Metabolic changes precede anatomic changes, hence the higher accuracy of PET. Scar tissue, necrosis and tumor mass may appear identical on CT and MRI, but markedly different on PET. PET may decrease unnecessary surgeries and improve treatment through greater specificity about the disease and may provide a better evaluation of recurrent disease.
