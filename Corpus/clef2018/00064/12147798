Plasma and dialysate IL-6 and VEGF concentrations are associated with high peritoneal solute transport rate. It has been speculated that increased levels of circulating or intraperitoneal pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6, and pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may contribute to high peritoneal small-solute transport rate (PSTR) in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. In this study we evaluated possible relationships between plasma and dialysate IL-6 and VEGF levels and PSTR.Forty CAPD patients (mean age+/-SD of 58+/-14 years) with no apparent inflammation process or disease, who had been on CAPD for 19+/-15 months (range 3-56 months) were included in the study. Peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was used to evaluate PSTR. Patients were divided into two groups: high-average and high transporters (H/A D/P(creat)>/=0.65) and low-average and low transporters (L/APlasma IL-6 (7.6 vs 4.3 pg/ml) and VEGF (342 vs 163 pg/ml) as well as dialysate IL-6 (174 vs 80 pg/ml) and VEGF (96 vs 69 pg/ml) levels were significantly higher in the H/A than in the L/A group. The dialysate appearance of IL-6 and VEGF correlated with D/P(creat), as well as with albumin and IgG clearances. Moreover, significant correlations were noted between dialysate IL-6 and dialysate VEGF levels.The findings of (i) increased plasma and dialysate levels of IL-6 and VEGF in the H/A group compared to the L/A group, (ii) an association between PSTR and both plasma and dialysate IL-6 and VEGF levels, and (iii) a significant correlation between dialysate IL-6 and VEGF concentrations suggest that inflammation, angiogenesis, and peritoneal transport may be interrelated and involved in the pathophysiology of high PSTR in CAPD patients. However, due to the cross-sectional design of this study, the cause and effect relationships between plasma and dialysate IL-6 and VEGF concentrations and high PSRT remain unclear.
