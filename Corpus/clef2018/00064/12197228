Fluorine-18 FDG-PET in detecting local recurrence and distant metastases in breast cancer--Taiwanese experiences. Fluorine-18 fluorodeonyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was used to detect local recurrence, axillary lymph node (LN) involvement and distant metastases in patients with breast cancer. Thirty-six female patients with breast cancer s/p operation underwent FDG-PET studies. Findings were confirmed by histology following surgery and/or biopsy or negative follow-up results over a period of at least one year. In the evaluation of local recurrence, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FDG-PET was 100, 96.8, and 97.2%, respectively. In the evaluation of axillary LN involvement, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy was 80, 100, and 97.2%, respectively. In the evaluation of distant metastases, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy was 83.3, 85.2, and 84.4%, respectively. The FDG-PET is a useful diagnostic tool in detecting local recurrence, axillary LN involvement, and distant metastasis.
