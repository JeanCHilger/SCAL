18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in small-cell lung cancer. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is not used routinely in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) but has been proven useful in non-small-cell lung cancer. The performance of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET in patients with SCLC was evaluated in this study. Fifteen patients with proven SCLC were evaluated (8 men and 7 women mean age, 68 years
