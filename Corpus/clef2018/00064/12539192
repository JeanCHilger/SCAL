Use of experimental design for optimisation of the cold plasma ICP-MS determination of lithium, aluminum and iron in soft drinks and alcoholic beverages. A sensitive method for the simultaneous determination of (7)Li, (27)Al and (56)Fe by cold plasma ICP-MS was developed and validated. Experimental design was used to investigate the effects of torch position, torch power, lens 2 voltage, and coolant flow. Regression models and desirability functions were applied to find the experimental conditions providing the highest global sensitivity in a multi-elemental analysis. Validation was performed in terms of limits of detection (LOD), limits of quantitation (LOQ), linearity and precision. LODs were 1.4 and 159 ng L(-1) for (7)Li and (56)Fe, respectively the highest LOD found being that for (27)Al (425 ng L(-1)). Linear ranges of 5 orders of magnitude for Li and 3 orders for Fe were statistically verified for each compound. Precision was evaluated by testing two concentration levels, and good results in terms of both intra-day repeatability and intermediate precision were obtained. RSD values lower than 4.8% at the lowest concentration level were calculated for intra-day repeatability. Commercially available soft drinks and alcoholic beverages contained in different packaging materials (TetraPack, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), commercial cans and glass) were analysed, and all the analytes were detected and quantitated.
