PET/CT of the abdomen: optimizing the patient breathing pattern. The aim of this study was to evaluate the respiration position, which is optimal for co-registration of abdominal CT images, and the corresponding positron emission tomography (PET) scan in a new combined PET/CT system. Ten patients (5 men, 5 women age 57.7+/-15.3 years, age range 34-80 years) underwent imaging for tumor staging on a combined PET/CT scanner (Discovery LS, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wis.). The PET emission images were acquired during normal shallow breathing and during CT scanning the patients performed four different breathing tasks: free breathing (FB)
