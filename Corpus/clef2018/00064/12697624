Neuropharmacology and drug development. Positron emission tomography (PET) and allied non-invasive imaging techniques are being increasingly embraced by the pharmaceutical industry. These imaging modalities allow the assessment of novel drug action in man at a very early stage of the drug's discovery and development process in turn, this enables earlier decision making about the developmental potential of novel and potential therapeutics. The in vivo characterisation of novel molecular targets and disease mechanisms in man is intimately connected with future developments in the diagnosis, management and treatment of human disease. The utility of non-invasive imaging modalities within the pharmaceutical industry is discussed with particular reference to the use of PET in drug discovery and development in the 21st century.
