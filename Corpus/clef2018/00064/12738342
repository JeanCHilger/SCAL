Association between regional cerebral blood flow and eye-tracking performance and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test in schizophrenics: a single photon emission computed tomography study. The objectives of this study were (1). to examine the changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) performance in two different eye-tracking groups (2). to explore the relationship between eye-tracking movement and rCBF at rest
