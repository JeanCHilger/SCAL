Determination of functional kidney volume by single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Functional parenchymal kidney volume was determined by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) using a rotating gamma camera in phantom experiments and in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The results from the patient examinations were corrected according to the phantom studies and were thereafter set in relation to renal haemodynamics, blood pressure, and urinary albumin excretion. Functional parenchymal kidney volume was significantly greater in diabetic patients compared to that of 11 healthy controls (P < 0.003). Urinary albumin excretion was increased and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) per renal parenchymal volume significantly less in patients with a duration of diabetic disease of more than 15 years compared to patients with shorter duration of disease (P < 0.03 and P < 0.05 respectively). Diabetic patients with a GFR of more than 120 ml/min had greater renal parenchymal volume than patients with lower GFR (P < 0.02). Patients with increased GFR, renal plasma flow (RPF), renal blood flow, or filtration fraction had significantly greater functional parenchymal volume than the healthy subjects (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). We conclude that by application of SPECT for DMSA we were able to show that IDDM patients have greater renal parenchymal volumes than healthy subjects. GFR/kidney volume was increased in IDDM patients with a duration of disease of < 15 years compared to patients with long-standing diabetes. The SPECT technique seems suitable for prospective long-term follow-up studies of functional kidney volume in IDDM patients.
