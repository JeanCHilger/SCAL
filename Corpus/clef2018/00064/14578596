Medium- to long-term prognostic impact of dipyridamole thallum-201 myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography in elderly patients. Dipyridamole thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has not been extensively evaluated for risk stratification and the medium- to long-term prognostic value in elderly cardiac patients who are unable to exercise. The present study group comprised 210 consecutive patients aged at least 70 years with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). The SPECT findings were classified as a reversible, fixed, or combined (reversible and fixed) defect. Of the 210 patients, 201 (77+/-5 years, 85 male) were successfully followed for 49+/-26 months. Thirteen (7%) patients had cardiac events: cardiac death (n=10), non-fatal myocardial infarction (n=1), or coronary artery bypass grafting (n=2). Cardiac events occurred in 3 of 112 patients with normal SPECT and in 10 of 89 patients with an abnormal scan (0.7% /year vs 2.8% /year, p=0.01). Stepwise Cox regression analysis revealed that the significant predictors of cardiac events were combined defects (relative risk 7.3) and the number of defect areas (relative risk 4.4). The predictive value of dipyridamole thallium-201 SPECT is maintained over 4 years in mixed populations of elderly CAD patients who are unable to exercise.
