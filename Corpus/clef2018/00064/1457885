Estimation of urea and creatinine clearance in peritoneal dialysis. The authors performed peritoneal equilibration tests (PET) in children and young adults of widely varying sizes to characterize membrane transport type, and used data (D/P ratios) obtained to predict clearances of urea (KT/Vurea) and creatinine (CrCl). Overall, PET predicted and measured values for KT/Vurea and CrCl were not significantly different. KT/Vurea could be reliably predicted from PET data for all membrane transport types. However, the relationship between predicted and measured CrCl was only significant for patients with high and high average membrane transport. In addition, the relationship between KT/Vurea and CrCl was significant only in patients with high and high average membrane transport.
