Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy with 111In-pentetreotide in non-functioning gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. To investigate somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) usefulness compared to conventional imaging procedures (CIP) in non-functioning gastroenteropatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors, we studied 40 patients, 30 in follow-up (FU) after previous operation for primary tumor (27 cases) or non-operable for disseminated metastases (3 cases), and 10 in the phase of initial diagnosis and staging (IDS). All patients were asymptomatic for hormone overexpression, with slightly high serum chromogranine A in 6 FU. The definitive diagnosis was obtained by surgery, laparotomy or percutaneous CT/US guided biopsy. Within 1 month before scintigraphy, all patients had undergone at least 2 of 3 CIP (CT, MRI and US) 4 and 24 h after 250 MBq 111In-pentetreotide i.v. injection, whole body scanning, planar and SPECT over the abdomen or other suspect regions were performed. Globally, 135 neoplastic lesions (84 hepatic, 34 abdominal extra-hepatic and 17 extra-abdominal) were ascertained in 32/40 patients
