Favorable biodistribution of 99mTc-ECD for brain SPECT comparing with 123I-IMP using alternative body scan. In order to evaluate the lung and brain uptake of 99mTc ethyl cysteinate dimer (99mTc-ECD) and N-isopropyl-p-[123I]-iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP), alternative body scans were carried out in 15 cases of cerebrovascular disease. The biodistribution of 99mTc-ECD was 5.5 +/- 0.7%, 3.8 +/- 0.7% in the brain 13.1 +/- 3.7%, 2.2 +/- 1.2%, in the lung at 15 min and at 4 hours, respectively, whereas that of 123I-IMP was 3.9 +/- 1.4%, 5.0 +/- 1.0% in the brain
