Cardio-esophageal cancer. Is 18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography worthwhile? 18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography has been proposed for the preoperative staging of carcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia. The aim of this study was to assess its diagnostic value and its influence on therapeutical decisions.Twenty-eight patients with a cancer of the esophagus or gastric cardia underwent a 18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography on a gamma camera with coincidence detection electronics, in addition to our standard preoperative procedures (barium swallow, liver ultrasonography, chest X-ray). Four types of lesions were searched for: primary tumor, abdominal and mediastinal lymph nodes, and distant metastases. Results of 18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography were compared to pathological findings.Sensitivity for the primary tumor was 86%. Sensitivity for mediastinal and abdominal lymph nodes was 75 and 54%, respectively, whereas specificity was 100%. Distant metastases were detected in 4 patients: liver metastasis in 2 patients and bone metastasis in 2 patients. Results of 18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography influenced therapeutical decisions for 2 patients.18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography seems to be worthwhile in the preoperative staging of carcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia, mainly because it may detect distant metastases.
