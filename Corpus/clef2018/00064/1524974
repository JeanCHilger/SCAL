Nonmammographic breast imaging techniques. Significant progress in early detection of malignancy has been achieved by the improvement of mammographic technique, the introduction of quality control, the demonstration of benefits from screening, and appropriate application of supplementary methods such as ultrasound, cytology, and stereotaxis. Certain problems in breast imaging, however, are still unsolved. These include early detection and exclusion of malignancy without microcalcifications in mammographically dense tissue (particularly in younger women), the still-limited accuracy of mammographic signs, and the management of diagnostic problems after surgery, radiation therapy, or silicone implants. Therefore, research is needed to further improve diagnostic capabilities. The research can be subdivided into different approaches: 1) further development of the mammographic technique (digital luminescence radiography) 2) evaluation of techniques that image other physical tissue properties (sonography, thermography, trans-illumination, CT, non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging, biomagnetism, biostereometry, and ductoscopy)
