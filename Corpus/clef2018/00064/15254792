Comparison of alpha-dihydroergocryptine and levodopa monotherapy in Parkinson's disease: assessment of changes in DAT binding with [123I]IPT SPECT. Putative neurotoxic actions of levodopa and neuroprotective effects of dopamine agonists, as indicated by laboratory and animal studies, provide the rationale to study their effect on the progression of Parkinson's disease. Aim of this pilot study was to compare the effects of monotherapy with the dopamine agonist alpha-dihydroergocryptine (DEC) versus monotherapy with levodopa on nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons as measured with dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT. 25 PD patients (H&Y stages 1 to 2.5) entered this study and were treated in a randomized fashion either with DEC (101+/-39 mg) or levodopa (369+/-51 mg) monotherapy. 16/25 patients (8 per group) terminated the study after 52 weeks. In each patient SPECT investigations with [123I]IPT were performed at baseline and after 52 weeks to assess changes of specific DAT binding over time. Changes in clinical symptoms were assessed by UPDRS score. The mean annual decline rate in striatal IPT-binding was lower in the DEC group (8.4%) compared to the levodopa group (10.4%). The difference was most accentuated in the putamen (DEC: 7.3% levodopa: 16.2%
