Bilateral globus pallidus stimulation for Huntington's disease. Bilateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) was performed in a patient with Huntington's disease (HD) with severe chorea. Stimulation at 40 and 130 Hz improved chorea. Stimulation at 130 Hz slightly worsened bradykinesia overall, whereas 40 Hz had little effect. A [15O] H2O positron emission tomography showed increased regional cerebral blood flow in motor decision making and execution areas more evident at 40 Hz. Adjustment of stimulation parameters in GPi DBS may have the potential to optimize the motor response in HD, improving chorea without aggravating bradykinesia.
