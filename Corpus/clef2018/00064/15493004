The reproductive tract. Diagnostic imaging has played a major role in the evaluation of patients with the cancers of the reproductive tract. The imaging modalities have included ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, hysterosalpingography, and scintigraphy with radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies. Positron emission tomography (PET) with [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose also has been shown to be useful in the imaging evaluation of these patients. Clinical applications have included initial staging and posttherapy restaging of disease, detecting metastatic disease, differentiating posttherapy anatomic alterations from recurrent or residual disease, and predicting and evaluating treatment response. In this article, we review the diagnostic utility of dedicated PET and combined PET-computed tomography systems in the imaging assessment of reproductive tract malignancies (excluding prostate cancer) in both sexes with an emphasis on fluorodeoxyglucose applications.
