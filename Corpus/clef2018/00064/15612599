These techniques will allow for better understanding of the occurrence of changes in the tumor with therapy and hold the promise of earlier diagnosis of progression and response.Understanding the application of current neuroimaging techniques is essential for the oncology nurse caring for brain tumor patients to provide education and assist with interpretation of results.
