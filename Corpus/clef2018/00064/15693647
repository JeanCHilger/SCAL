The role of PET imaging in the management of patients with central nervous system disorders. PET will continue to play a critical role in both clinical and research applications with regard to CNS disorders. PET is useful in the initial diagnosis of patients presenting with CNS symptoms and can help clinicians determine the best course of therapy. PET studies can also be useful for studying the response to therapy. From the research perspective, the various neurotransmitter and other molecular tracers currently available or in development will provide substantial information about pathophysiologic process in the brain. As such applications become more widely tested, their introduction into the clinical arena will further advance the use of PET imaging in the evaluation and management of CNS disorders.
