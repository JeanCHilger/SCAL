PET in seizure disorders. PET imaging has been widely used in the evaluation and management of patients with seizure disorders. The ability of PET to measure cerebral function is ideal for studying the neurophysiologic correlates of seizure activity during both ictal and interictal states. PET imaging is also valuable for evaluating patients before surgical interventions to determine the best surgical method and maximize outcomes. PET will continue to play a major role, not only in the clinical arena, but also in investigating the pathogenesis and treatment of various seizure disorders.
