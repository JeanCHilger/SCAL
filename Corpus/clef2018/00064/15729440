Neurocognitive assessment in alcohol abuse and dependence: implications for treatment. The aim of the Neuropsychology applied to the Alcohol Dependence field is the comprehension of the effects of brain dysfunction on cognition and human behavior. It investigates neurocognitive impairments and associates them to structural and functional neuroimaging findings (CT, MRI, PET and SPECT). Acute use of alcohol impairs attention, memory, executive functions and visuospatial skills, while chronic abuse causes neurocognitive deficits in memory, learning, visuospatial functions, psychomotor speed processing, executive functions and decision-making, and may lead to persistent amnesic disorder and alcoholic dementia. Executive Dysfunction related to frontal lobe has direct implications on treatment, by the choosing of strategies and for prognostic evaluation. It is presented an easy tool to screen cognitive impairments, the Frontal Assessment Battery--FAB.15. Neuropsychological Assessment is useful for early detection of impairments and evaluation of their evolution and Cognitive Rehabilitation has a significant role on deficits recovery and psychosocial adjustment of these patients.
