Myocardial viability assessment in patients with highly impaired left ventricular function: comparison of delayed enhancement, dobutamine stress MRI, end-diastolic wall thickness, and TI201-SPECT with functional recovery after revascularization. This study compared different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods with Tl(201) single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and the "gold standard" for viability assessment, functional recovery after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Twenty patients (64+/-7.3 years) with severely impaired left ventricular function (ejection fraction [EF] 28.6+/-8.7%) underwent MRI and SPECT before and 6 months after CABG. Wall-motion abnormalities were assessed by stress cine MRI using low-dose dobutamine. A segment with a nonreversible defect in Tl(201)-SPECT and a delayed enhancement (DE) in an area >50% of the entire segment, as well as an end-diastolic wall thickness <6 mm, was defined as nonviable. The mean postoperative EF (n=20) improved slightly from 28.6+/-8.7% to 32.2+/-12.4% (not significant). Using the Tl(201)-SPECT as the reference method, end-diastolic wall thickness, MRI-DE, and stress MRI showed high sensitivity of 94%, 93%, and 84%, respectively, but low specificities. Using the recovery of contractile function 6 months after CABG as the gold standard, MRI-DE showed an even higher sensitivity of 99%, end-diastolic wall thickness 96%, stress MRI 88%, and Tl(201)-SPECT 86%. MRI-DE showed advantages compared with the widely used Tl(201)-SPECT and all other MRI methods for predicting myocardial recovery after CABG.
