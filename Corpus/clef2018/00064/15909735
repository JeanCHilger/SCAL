Myocardial viability, its importance for the therapeutic decision. Myocardial viability detection is essential in patients with history of myocardial infarction whom develop ventricular dysfunction. Its detection influences the therapeutic decisions and the prognosis. Medical therapy in patients with ventricular dysfunction due to myocardial infarction and myocardial viability has been associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates than revascularization therapy, as well as improvements in the systolic function. Several imaging techniques used in the recognition of myocardial viability are available these techniques are based on the assessment of the ventricular motion posterior to inotropic agents stimulation or on the demonstration of metabolic activity at the dysfunctional regions. In this study, some important aspects of each technique are reviewed, doing special emphasis in the utility of the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) which has been considered as the "gold standard" in the detection of myocardial viability.
