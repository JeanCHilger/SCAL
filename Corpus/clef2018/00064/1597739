A simulation of dynamic SPECT using radiopharmaceuticals with rapid clearance. Data acquisition in SPECT assumes that there is no change in radionuclide distribution during data collection. However, this assumption is not valid in radiopharmaceuticals with rapid temporal changes in radioactivity. Artifacts and quantitative errors are studied using phantom studies, mathematical models, and clinical myocardial data. Projection data of each model were sequentially multiplied by weighting coefficients that varied mono-exponentially with time, and the SPECT images were reconstructed. A long data acquisition time in comparison to the clearance of the tracer can be a significant cause of artifact. When the myocardial septum-to-lateral count ratio is used as an index of distortion, a shorter acquisition time than the effective half-life of the tracer is required to reduce the error of the septum-to-lateral count ratio to within 10%. Since 180 degrees rotation acquisition causes artifacts depending on the direction of rotation, 360 degrees acquisition is preferable. Continuous repetitive rotation acquisition is a suitable method for dynamic SPECT to reduce quantitative errors and artifacts.
