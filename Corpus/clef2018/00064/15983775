Combined SPECT/CT imaging using 123I-IMT in the detection of recurrent or persistent head and neck cancer. The aim of the study was to assess the clinical value of combined SPECT/CT imaging using L: -3-[123I]iodine-alpha-methyl tyrosine (IMT) for the differential diagnosis of recurrences in patients pre-treated for head and neck cancer. Thirty-four consecutive patients with biopsy-proven carcinomas, who had previously been treated by surgery and/or radio/chemotherapy, were examined at our clinic by IMT-SPECT using a dual-head system with integrated low-dose CT. SPECT results were correlated with histopathology, clinical and CT/MRI follow-up data. In the follow-up after SPECT examination, the final diagnosis of recurrent tumour was established in 26 patients the remaining eight patients were recurrence-free (follow-up >6 months). IMT-SPECT/CT correctly detected recurrent disease and/or neck lymph node metastases in 22 patients. In addition, distant metastases were displayed in two patients. The study was false-negative in four patients (sensitivity 85%). True-negative results were registered in seven patients, and false-positive in one patient. Image fusion with coregistered low-dose CT facilitates the localisation and interpretation of IMT-SPECT findings. IMT-SPECT using integrated low-dose CT is a promising non-invasive imaging tool for the detection of head and neck cancer recurrences and their differentiation from treatment-induced changes.
