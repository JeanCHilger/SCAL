Regional and subtype selective changes of neurotransmitter receptor density in a rat transgenic for the Huntington's disease mutation. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein. We have recently generated a rat model transgenic for HD, which displays a slowly progressive phenotype resembling the human adult-onset type of disease. In this study we systematically assessed the distribution and density of 17 transmitter receptors in the brains of 2-year-old rats using quantitative multi-tracer autoradiography and high-resolution positron emission tomography. Heterozygous animals expressed increased densities of M(2) acetylcholine (increase of 148 +/- 16% of controls p > 0.001
