Quantitative evaluation of 123I-FP-CIT SPECT: validation of a semiautomated method. To assess the utility of a quantification of the 123I-FP-CIT uptake by the definition of some reference values, normal range values and interobserver variation.Fifty patients with a 123I-FP-CIT SPECT: 25 patients had a pathological SPECT with the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and the remaining had a qualitative normal SPET, with the diagnosis of 14 drug-induced Parkinsonism and 11 with psychogenic Parkinsonism. In the transversal slices, the best central slice that showed the nuclei of the base best was selected and standard ROIs (Region Of Interest) were applied. Specific (caudate and putamen) versus non specific (occipital) and laterality ratios were calculated. A normal statistical analysis for independent quantitative samples was used (mean, standard deviation and range) as well as variation coefficient and correlation coefficient of two observers and the 10th and 90th percentile.The variation coefficient interobserver was 3.24-5.61 and the correlation coefficient was 0.89-0.99. Cut-off values between both populations were established at 2.10 in the right putamen and at 2.05 in the left. Cut-off values definition in caudate were not assessable due to overlapping of ratios of both populations.This quantification method is highly reproducible. It makes it possible to obtain reference values and to define normal range.
