Worms: transmission from animals to man. It is useful to know that household pets are not involved in the life cycles of some worms, for example, pinworms. Some worms require a household pet in their cycles: the dog and cat roundworms, heartworms, and the dog and cat hookworms, the larvae of which are responsible for cutaneous larva migrans. Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation is sometimes difficult to diagnose and may be traced directly to the family dog.
