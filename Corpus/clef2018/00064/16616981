Effects of long-term methylphenidate treatment: a pilot follow-up clinical and SPECT study. Although abnormalities in the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) responses to methylphenidate (MPH) treatment have been reported in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), there are few prospective longitudinal studies assessing the long-term effects of MPH and discontinuation effects after chronic treatment.The authors studied ten drug-naive children (2 girls, 8 boys, mean age+/-S.D.=9.60+/-1.96) diagnosed with ADHD by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria, using (99m)Tc-HMPAO-single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Patients were studied at baseline (visit 1), after 2 months of MPH treatment (visit 2) and after a drug-free period of 2 months following 12 months of MPH treatment (visit 3) at doses of 1 mg/kg/day. We evaluated SPECT data visually and semi-quantitatively.Two months of chronic MPH treatment resulted in visually detectable improvement in hypoperfusion in the right frontal cortex and all areas of temporal cortex with the exception of left lateral temporal cortex. This improvement was still detectable on visual evaluations of SPECT data after 2 months of treatment discontinuation. The treatment effects that were detected visually were not statistically significant in semi-quantitative analyses.Treatment effects of chronic MPH treatment may persist long after the discontinuation of the treatment.
