Blood-brain barrier disruption by low-frequency ultrasound. A recent study showed a dramatic increase in cerebral hemorrhage comprising atypical locations with low-frequency ultrasound-mediated recombinant tissue plasminogen activator-thrombolysis in humans. Here, we provide a possible explanation for this phenomenon by a side effect observed in a study using the similar ultrasound device.The study was originally undertaken to investigate by transcranial Doppler sonography, positron emission tomography and perfusion MRI whether transcranial application of wide-field low-frequency ultrasound (300 kHz) improves cerebral hemodynamics in patients with cerebral small vessel disease.Showing no clear positive effect on cerebral hemodynamics in 4 patients and on cerebral perfusion (positron emission tomography) in 2 patients, the study has been terminated early because of a remarkable side effect in the first patient (a 62 year-old man) undergoing perfusion-MRI: detection of frontoparietal extravasation of Gadolinium contrast agent (applied during MRI perfusion imaging preinsonation) on MRI immediately postinsonation.Abnormal permeability of the human blood-brain barrier can be induced by wide-field low-frequency insonation. The observed excessive bleeding rate with low-frequency sonothrombolysis might thus be attributable to primary blood-brain barrier disruption by ultrasound.
