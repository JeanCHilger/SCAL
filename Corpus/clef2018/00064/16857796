High fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on positron emission tomography in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer on platinum-based combination chemotherapy. To evaluate response and survival for platinum-based combination chemotherapy in chemonaive patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) according to pretreatment standardized uptake values (SUV) by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.Patients with advanced NSCLC who had not previously received chemotherapy were eligible. Response rates and survivals were analyzed according to maximal SUVs [low (<or=7.5) versus high (>7.5), where 7.5 was the median value] before the first cycle of chemotherapy.Eighty-five consecutive patients were included in the retrospective study. Patients with high SUV tumors exhibited significantly higher response rates (34.1% for low SUVs versus 61.0% for high SUVs P = 0.013). Other factors, including sex, age, histology, performance status, number of involved organs, regimens used, and disease stage, did not affect response. However, high SUVs were related with a shorter response duration (279 days for low SUVs versus 141 days for high SUVsPatients having NSCLC with high maximal SUVs showed a better response to platinum-based combination chemotherapy but had a shorter time to progression. Tumor glucose metabolism, as determined by SUVs on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, was found to discriminate NSCLC subsets with different clinical and biological features.
