Semiautomated synthesis of a novel [18F] amine fluorocyanoborane for PET imaging studies. Radiosynthesis and in vivo characterization in rats. A novel fluorine-18 labeled amine fluorocyanoborane derivative was synthesized from the bromo-derivative precursor in 22% radiochemical yield. The [18F] labeling was accomplished by a semiautomatic method that is based on the synthesis of Ag 18F from Ag2CO3 and H 18F in a platinum dish followed by sonication of the bromo-precursor with Ag 18F in dry benzene to produce [18F] labeled amine fluorocyanoborane which was used with no further purification. A total of 50 microCi of the [18F] labeled amine fluorocyanoborane was injected into normal, female Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) via the tail vein and monitored by Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT to detect its biodistribution in the rat body. The images showed an uptake of this compound in the bones of rats.
