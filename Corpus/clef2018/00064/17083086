Multitrack electrospray chips. Multitrack electrospray chips (MTEC) were fabricated by UV-photoablation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates. They are composed of an array of up to six microchannels that are successively used as electrospray ionization (ESI) emitters for mass spectrometry (MS). There is no requirement for alignment of the different spraying microchannels with the mass spectrometer orifice. The MTEC is thus fixed in front of the mass spectrometer and the successive MS analyses are performed without moving the chip. The sequential electrospraying by successive application of an identical high voltage in each off-axis microchannel was evaluated for the fast screening of peptides and proteins. The counting of cysteines in peptides through chemical modification and the relative quantification of a peptide in two samples are presented herein as two original strategies based on this new analytical tool.
