Value of PET restaging after chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: implications for consolidation radiotherapy. Patients treated for non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) frequently are restaged for response using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. This study investigates the role of subsequent consolidation radiation therapy (CRT) based on PET response to chemotherapy.An IRB-approved database was queried for patients who underwent PET scans after chemotherapy for NHL between 1995 and 2004 77 patients were identified. To determine benefit of CRT, overall survival and local control were assessed with median follow-up of 39.8 months (range, 2-125 months).Median age of patients was 53 (range, 18-82 years). Multivariate analysis adjusted for age, indolent vs. aggressive histology, and time from chemotherapy to PET revealed PET positive scans (RR = 30.5 95%CI = 5.9, 156.4), lack of RT (RR = 5.25While RT may control relapse in PET negative patients, NHL patients who remain PET positive after chemotherapy are not well managed by RT alone.
