Adolescent social integration through the "Cuidar cuidando" program. The "Care Caring program" is a device of social reinsertion, carried out by a multidisciplinary and a multi-institutional practice of more than fifteen years. Those who sustain it, have always presented the necessity of articulating the cure with social reinsertion, therefore the purpose of the Program itself is not only to favour a clinical psychiatric recovery, but also to prompt changes in the manner of social liaison of the children and youngsters taking part. Animal contact in many way produce therapeutic effects. We describe here those we have seen and discuss the "popular" term zootherapy. After 16 years of non stop activity, more than 500 children and adolescents benefited from this innovative experience. We learned also that without broad social integration policies, the devices of reinsertion are limited in their long term effects. Breaking the differentiation circuit is impossible only with these resources. Working out these difficulties will allow us to answer if it is possible to think of strategies of rehabilitation in psychology and psychiatry for infancy and adolescence using communal resources.
