Improving the interpretation of ictal scalp EEG: BSS-CCA algorithm for muscle artifact removal. To investigate the potential clinical relevance of a new algorithm to remove muscle artifacts in ictal scalp EEG.Thirty-seven patients with refractory partial epilepsy with a well-defined seizure onset zone based on full presurgical evaluation, including SISCOM but excluding ictal EEG findings, were included. One ictal EEG of each patient was presented to a clinical neurophysiologist who was blinded to all other data. Ictal EEGs were first rated after band-pass filtering, then after elimination of muscle artifacts using a blind source separation-canonical correlation analysis technique (BSS-CCA). Degree of muscle artifact contamination, lateralization, localization, time and pattern of ictal EEG onset were compared between the two readings and validated against the other localizing information.Muscle artifacts contaminated 97% of ictal EEGs, and interfered with the interpretation in 76%, more often in extratemporal than temporal lobe seizures. BSS-CCA significantly improved the sensitivity to localize the seizure onset from 62% to 81%, and performed best in ictal EEGs with moderate to severe muscle artifact contamination. In a significant number of the contaminated EEGs, BSS-CCA also led to an earlier identification of ictal EEG changes, and recognition of ictal EEG patterns that were hidden by muscle artifact.Muscle artifacts interfered with the interpretation in a majority of ictal EEGs. BSS-CCA reliably removed these muscle artifacts in a user-friendly manner. BSS-CCA may have an important place in the interpretation of ictal EEGs during presurgical evaluation of patients with refractory partial epilepsy.
