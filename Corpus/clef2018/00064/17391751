Behaviour of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line grown in different media and on different chemically modified substrates. Among the parameters that can be tested in experiments on neuronal cell culture the use of different culture media and substrates represents a powerful assay to influence cell adhesion and differentiation. In this work, plasma-enhanced-chemical vapour depositions (PE-CVD) from acrylic acid and allylamine vapours have been performed to deposit coatings bearing oxygen (O)- and nitrogen (N)-containing functional groups on polyethylenetherephtalate (PET) surface. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were grown on plasma modified substrates and in presence of media containing different amount of fetal calf serum (FCS) or in serum-free medium containing cAMP. Our results showed that N-containing substrates improved cell adhesion, while the neurites sprouting was influenced by cell culture media. Interestingly, the presence of carboxylic groups on the modified surface can influence the expression of a differentiation marker, neurofilament-200 (NF-H), in cells grown in serum-containing media.
