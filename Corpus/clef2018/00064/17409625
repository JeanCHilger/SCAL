Investigation of the present management status of calibration source based on the law concerning prevention of radiation hazards due to radioisotopes. An amendment concerning the enforcement of the law on the prevention of radiation hazards due to radioisotopes, etc., and the medical service law enforcement regulations were promulgated on June 1, 2005. This amendment concerned international basic safety standards and the sealing of radiation sources. Sealed radiation sources < or =3.7 MBq, which had been excluded from regulation, were newly included as an object of regulation. Investigation of the SPECT system instituted in hospitals indicated that almost all institutions adhere to the new amendment, and the calibration source, the checking source, etc., corresponding to this amendment were maintained appropriately. Any institutions planning to return sealed radioisotopes should refer to this report.
