Noninvasive quantification of hepatic arterial blood flow with nitrogen-13-ammonia and dynamic positron emission tomography. To determine if dynamic PET and 13N-ammonia can be utilized to quantitate regional hepatic arterial blood flow (rHABF) noninvasively, eight anesthetized dogs and eight human volunteers were examined with PET following intravenous bolus administration of 13N-ammonia. Hepatic time-activity curves and the arterial input function were derived from ROIs drawn over the right lateral superior segment of the liver and the left ventricle of the heart, respectively. rHABF was quantitated using a two-compartment model, with comparison with simultaneously acquired microsphere blood flow measurement (MS) in the canine studies. rHABF derived from canine dynamic PET with 13N-ammonia were linearly related to microsphere values (rHABF = 0.92 x MS + 0.04, r = 0.98), with a mean of 0.40 ml/min/g. The results in eight normal volunteers gave a rHABF value of 0.26 +/- 0.07 ml/min/g. Dynamic 13N-ammonia hepatic PET allows noninvasive quantification of rHABF.
