Objective and subjective comparison of standard 2-D and fully 3-D reconstructed data on a PET/CT system. The relative advantage of fully 3-D versus 2-D mode for whole-body imaging is currently the focus of considerable expert debate. The nature of 3-D PET acquisition for FDG PET/CT theoretically allows a shorter scan time and improved efficiency of FDG use than in the standard 2-D acquisition. We therefore objectively and subjectively compared standard 2-D and fully 3-D reconstructed data for FDG PET/CT on a research PET/CT system.In a total of 36 patients (mean 58.9 years, range 17.3-78.9 years 21 male, 15 female) referred for known or suspected malignancy, FDG PET/CT was performed using a research PET/CT system with advanced detector technology with improved sensitivity and spatial resolution. After 45 min uptake, a low-dose CT (40 mAs) from head to thigh was performed followed by 2-D PET (emission 3 min per field) and 3-D PET (emission 1.5 min per field) with both seven slices overlap to cover the identical anatomical region. Acquisition time was therefore 50% less (seven fieldsOn average, per patient, the SUV(max) was 7.86 (SD 7.79) for 2-D and 6.96 (SD 5.19) for 3-D. On a lesion basis, the average SUV(max) was 7.65 (SD 7.79) for 2-D and 6.75 (SD 5.89) for 3-D. The absolute difference on a paired t-test of SUV 3-D-2-D based on each measured lesion was significant with an average of -0.956 (P=0.002) and an average of -0.884 on a patient base (P<0.05). With 3-D the SUV(max) decreased by an average of 5.2% for each lesion, and an average of 6.0% for each patient. Subjective analysis showed fair inter-observer agreement regarding detectability (kappa=0.24 for 3-D 0.36 for 3-D) and dignity (kappa=0.44 for 3-D and 0.4 for 2-D) of the lesions. There was no significant diagnostic difference between 3-D and 2-D. Only in one patient, a satellite liver metastasis of a colon cancer was missed in 3-D and detected only in 2-D. On average, the overall image quality for 3-D images was equal (in 24%) or inferior (in 76%) compared to 2-D.A possible major advantage of 3-D data acquisition is the faster patient throughput with a 50% reduction in scan time. The fully 3-D reconstruction technique has overcome the technical drawbacks of current 3-D imaging technique. In our limited number of patients there was no significant diagnostic difference between 2-D and fully 3-D.
