Cancer screening of healthy volunteers using whole-body 18F-FDG-PET scans: The Nishidai clinic study. In order to evaluate the diagnostic performance of cancer screening using whole-body (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning for asymptomatic subjects, we conducted a historical cohort study. The study group comprised 5807 individuals who underwent PET scanning from 2002 to 2003. Each subject had carried out a procedure with whole-body (18)F-FDG-PET scan with some other diagnostic tests. Out of 5807 participants, data from 4881 subjects were analysed. Among them, PET screening revealed abnormal FDG uptake in 562 subjects, and possible or probable malignancy in 324 subjects, and histological diagnosis of cancer in 36 subjects (16 thyroid, seven colon, four lung, five breast, two prostate, and two others) out of them. The overall cancer detection rate was 0.7%, and PET scanning had a sensitivity of 70.6% and a specificity of 94.0%. This result warrants further prospective cohort studies to evaluate the usefulness of PET cancer screening for cancer prevention.
