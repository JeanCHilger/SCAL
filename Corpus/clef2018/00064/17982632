Early diagnosis of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma with 18F-FDG PET after radiofrequency ablation therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) in the restaging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA). This study was performed on 33 lesions in 24 patients with HCC. 18F-FDG PET and computed tomography (CT) studies were performed in all patients before treatment. PET acquisition was started 50-60 min after injection of 18F-FDG (5-6 MBq/kg). Semi-quantitative analysis using Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) was measured for the evaluation of tumour 18F-FDG uptake. All patients underwent RFA treatment and were followed up at least 2 years with 18F-FDG PET, CT and clinical evaluation in the interval of every 3 months in the first year and every 6 months in the second year. 18F-FDG PET detected recurrence earlier than CT between 4-6 months in 2 patients and between 7-9 months in 6 patients whereas CT was positive in 4 patients. Overall detection rate of recurrence with 18F-FDG PET was 92% which was higher than that of CT (75%). Statistically significant difference in the SUV was observed between well and moderately differentiated HCC (p=0.033) and also between well and poorly differentiated HCC (p=0.037). The size of tumours showed a significant correlation with the time of recurrence (p<0.00033, r=0.8601, n=12). The results of this study indicate that 18F-FDG PET could detect recurrence earlier in patients with HCC treated with RFA, as compared with CT and could diagnose extrahepatic lesions. SUV showed a significant correlation with time of recurrence after RFA. 18F-FDG PET may be a dominant imaging modality as a follow-up procedure of HCC after RFA, in terms of early detection of recurrence.
