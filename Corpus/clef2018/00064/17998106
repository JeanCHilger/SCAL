Species differences in mGluR5 binding sites in mammalian central nervous system determined using in vitro binding with [18F]F-PEB. Binding of [18F]3-fluoro-5-[(pyridin-3-yl)ethynyl]benzonitrile ([18F]F-PEB) was evaluated in membranes and tissue sections prepared from rat, rhesus and human brain. Saturation equilibrium binding experiments with frozen brain cortex and caudate-putamen membranes of young adult rhesus and human and with cortex and striatum from rat yielded data indicative of specific high-affinity binding (KD=0.1-0.15 nM, n> or =3) to a saturable site previously shown to be metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5 Patel S, Ndubizu O, Hamill T, Chaudhary A, Burns HD, Hargreaves RJ, Gibson RE.
