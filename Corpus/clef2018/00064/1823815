Biology of metaiodobenzylguanidine interactions with human neuroblastoma cells. [131I]Metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) is selectively taken up and stored by tumors derived from the neural crest and is utilized in the diagnosis and treatment of neuroblastoma (NB). Variable MIBG uptake has been observed, although the underlying mechanisms are not known. We have studied the uptake kinetics of 125I-MIBG and uptake characteristics of NB cell clones with different phenotypes (SH-SY5Y and SH-EP1, the neuroblastic and the substrate-adherent sublines of SK-N-SH respectively, BE(2)-M17 and LA-N-1n with neuroblastic phenotype). We have been able to correlate the MIBG uptake with the neuroblastic phenotype: a specific uptake system satisfying all the characteristics of the neuronal uptake-1 (temperature dependency, sodium dependency, high affinity, saturability and imipramine sensitivity) was observed in all the neuroblastic sublines. In contrast, MIBG accumulation was a passive diffusion phenomenon in the substrate-adherent clone SH-EP1. In addition, terminal neuronal differentiation induced in SH-SY5Y by retinoic acid caused a marked increase of the uptake and retention of MIBG. Our findings may be pertinent to an understanding of the variability of the MIBG uptake in vivo.
