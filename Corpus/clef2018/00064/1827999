The estimated density of D2 striatal receptors in schizophrenia. A study with positron emission tomography and 76Br-bromolisuride. The striatal D2 receptors of 19 untreated schizophrenics and 14 normal control subjects were investigated with PET and 76Br-bromolisuride. The ratio of radioactivity in the striatum to that in the cerebellum was taken as an index of the striatal D2 receptor density. There was no significant difference between the control and the schizophrenic groups, nor any difference between subgroups of patients defined by clinical type or course of illness, and no relationship between the striatum:cerebellum activity ratio and SANS or SAPS ratings of symptoms. Unlike in the controls, this ratio was not correlated with age in schizophrenics. This study suggests that there is no quantitative abnormality of striatal D2 dopamine receptors in schizophrenia.
