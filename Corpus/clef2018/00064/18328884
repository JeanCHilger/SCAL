Imaging the male reproductive tract: current trends and future directions. The male reproductive system encompasses several organs: the testes, ejaculatory ducts, seminal vesicles, prostate, and penis. The function of this system is to accomplish reproduction. Diagnostic imaging modalities, such as ultrasound, CT, MR imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET), are increasingly used to evaluate the male reproductive tract. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the use of imaging techniques in the male reproductive tract and to discuss current trends and future directions in prostate and testicular imaging. This review focuses on the prostate and scrotum.
