Allergic contact dermatitis from 1,6-diisocyanatohexane in an anti-pill finish. We report an outbreak of occupational allergic contact dermatitis from 1,6-diisocyanatohexane (old name hexamethylene diisocyanate or HDI), in the anti-pill finish Evafanol AS-1, in 2 clothing factories. The 19 operatives from 2 dressmaking mills all complained of work-related dermatitis. 5 of the subjects had positive patch tests to the fabric with which they were working, and when all 19 were patch tested to Evafanol AS-1 (1% aq.), 11 were positive. 6 of these 11 were patch tested to HDI (1% pet.) and all 6 were positive. It appears that HDI in our group of clothing workers acted as a potent sensitizer affecting around 10% of the workforce.
