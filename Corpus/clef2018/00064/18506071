Multisphere phantom and analysis algorithm for PET image quality assessment. PET image quality measurements of lesion detectability frequently use a small, radioactive sphere in a larger phantom. The typical analysis of a small single sphere in background has several shortcomings as a measure for detectability and quantitation: the measurement has low statistical power the region of interest (ROI) is susceptible to large pixel-to-pixel fluctuations
