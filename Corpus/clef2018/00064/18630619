The importance of determining the viability of the myocardium prior to revascularisation in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Chronic heart failure is a worldwide clinical syndrome with substantial socio-economical impact. The aim of this overview is the summary of contemporary knowledge in epidemiology, elementary pathophysiological implications and some possibilities of treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy, which represents the most frequent cause of heart failure in developed countries. Emphasis is on the right indication for myocardial revascularization as a causal option of therapy of ischemic cardiomyopathy, timing and risk of revascularization and especially on importance of assessment of viability of myocardium using presently available imaging methods.
