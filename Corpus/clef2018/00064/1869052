A new anatomical representation of the human visual pathways. A three-dimensional, computer-aided reconstruction of the intracranial parts of the visual system, optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tract, lateral geniculate body, optic radiation and striate area on the basis of anatomical serial cuts is presented in this paper. The computer-graphic representation simulates the illumination of a three-dimensional reconstruction. This study depicts for the first time a detailed anatomical reconstruction and illustrative representation of the striate area. An interactive investigation of the structure on the screen as well as a demonstration of the intracranial relationships between different neuroanatomical structures and comparisons with magnetic resonance, computed tomographic, and positron emission tomographic images is possible, providing that the neuroimaging uses the identical Cartesian coordinate system [22].
