Scatter correction for heart SPECT images using TEW method. Radionuclide imaging has the potential to be used in quantitative analysis of the regional function of organs. However, quantification of SPECT images is degraded by many factors such as Compton photon scattering. This could have a destructive effect on clinical reports so it is important to do scatter correction to get better quality SPECT images. We intended to determine how scatter correction with the TEW method can help physicians who look at heart SPECT images, get better reports. This study used the TEW method for scatter correction, which was proposed by Ogawa et al.,(9) using the two narrow windows on either side of the photopeak (20% down and 20% up of the photopeak respectively). Injection of radiopharmaceutical 99mTc was used for medical imaging. In the Shariati Hospital, Tehran, we studied a total of 80 patients with heart disease indications (43 men and 37 women) over the ages of 30-80 years. Contrast and sharpness were considerably improved after scatter correction so physicians could look at defects better. In a few cases scatter correction changed heart defect reports to normal. Using TEW, sensitivity and specificity increased from 86% to 94% and from 61% to 84% respectively. This method was simple to use in clinics.
