Sedation of infants with congenital hyperinsulinism during PET CAT scanning. A case collection. Infants with congenital hyperinsulinism may require a positron emission tomography examination with 18F-labeled L-DOPA for the evaluation and planning of surgical interventions. To obtain optimal results it is important for the child to be in a stress-free situation because a stable glucose homoeostasis must be maintained by intravenous glucose infusion. The infant needs to lie calm over a long period of time to obtain optimal results. Sedation for this purpose can be achieved with a continuous infusion of propofol and should be carried out by an anesthesiologist. Additionally blood glucose measurements must be regularly carried out and the glucose infusion must be adjusted to prevent hypoglycemia.
