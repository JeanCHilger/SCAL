Role of 18F-FDG PET in tumor grading and evaluating effectiveness of therapy in malignant lymphomas. The report compares the results of (multi-layer spiral computed tomography) (MSCT), 67 Ga citrate lymph scintigraphy and 18FDG PET in patients with Hodgkin's disease. The predictive significance of the latter method exceeded that of MSCT and ultrasound in diagnosing lymph node neoplasia below the diaphragm. As far as peripheral and mediastinal lymph nodes are concerned, the MSCT efficiency of the three procedures was comparable. Advantage was offered by PET in early evaluation of therapeutic effectiveness. Moreover, its practical significance for assessing tumor sensitivity to therapy as well as differentiation between viable tumor tissue and fibrosis was demonstrated.
