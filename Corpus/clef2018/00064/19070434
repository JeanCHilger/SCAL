Tritrichomonas foetus infections in surveyed pet cats. Tritrichomonas foetus is the causative agent of feline trichomoniasis, a large-bowel disease resulting in chronic diarrhea. Feline trichomoniasis has been reported in cats of both pure and mixed breeds and in both males and females. In order to estimate the prevalence of trichomoniasis in the pet cat population, we requested fecal samples, via veterinarians throughout the United States, from cats with or without clinical signs of trichomoniasis. Of the 173 feline fecal samples received from veterinarians, 17 were culture and PCR positive for T. foetus. Our results suggested no correlation between breed or sex and infection with T. foetus. All cats that were infected with T. foetus had diarrhea at the time the fecal sample was taken. Other enteric pathogens were present in nine of the 17 positive cats. Our results support that trichomoniasis is a disease of younger male and female cats of all breeds.
