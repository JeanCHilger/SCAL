The welfare and suitability of primates kept as pets. Amid growing concern about keeping exotic species as companion animals, nonhuman primates have been highlighted as inappropriate for private ownership. However, there has been no comprehensive review of the suitability of primates as pets, using a framework such as Schuppli and Fraser's (2000). Schuppli and Fraser incorporate welfare of the individual, of others, and of the environment. This article (a) examines the numbers, origins, ages, and ownership trends of primates kept as pets in the United Kingdom and (b) identifies a number of welfare, health, and environmental concerns. Overall, strong evidence supports the argument that primates are not suitable pets it is unlikely that the welfare of pet primates can be adequately addressed in normal households. Finally, using unpublished data on complaints and inquiries received by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the study assesses the degree of public concern about the welfare of primates kept as pets in England and Wales. The article identifies a wide range of concerns about keeping pet primates and concludes that this practice should end.
