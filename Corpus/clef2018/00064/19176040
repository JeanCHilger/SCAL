Diagnostic value of FDG-PET in the detection of bone marrow involvement in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. To evaluate the diagnostic value of bone marrow (BM) involvement detected by F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).The study population comprised 81 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL. All patients had both (18)F-FDG PET/CT and standard BM biopsy at iliac crest. In 9 patients, additional direct BM biopsy at FDG-avid bone lesion was performed.Among all 81 cases, 23 were diagnosed as BM involvement by PET/CT. Of the 23 positive cases 17 were confirmed by biopsy. However, only 11 cases were diagnosed by merely bilateral iliac crest biopsy. In patients in early stage of disease (18)F-FDG PET/CT had the same results as bilateral iliac crest biopsy.(18)F-FDG PET/CT is superior to standard BM biopsy in detecting BM involvement in newly diagnosed DLBCL patients. In patients with FDG-avid bone lesions, direct PET/CT-guided bone biopsy seems to be more accurate than standard BM biopsy.
