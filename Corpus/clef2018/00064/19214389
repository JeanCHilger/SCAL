An efficient plasmid vector for constitutive high-level expression of foreign genes in Escherichia coli. The levansucrase gene (lsrA) from Rahnella aquatilis was strongly expressed in a constitutive manner in Escherichia coli when cloned into a pBluescript KS-based pRL1CP plasmid vector. The native promoter upstream of lsrA and the lacZ promoter cooperatively enhanced the expression of lsrA to a level that was comparable to that of the T7 promoter, which is used in commercial pET expression vector system. A putative rho-independent transcription termination signal downstream of lsrA was crucial for gene expression. This plasmid vector also proved to be applicable for efficient expression of other foreign genes in E. coli.
