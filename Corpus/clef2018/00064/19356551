Changes in myocardial perfusion correlate with deterioration of left ventricular systolic function in chronic Chagas' cardiomyopathy. This study aimed at analyzing the association between myocardial perfusion changes and the progression of left ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients with chronic Chagas' cardiomyopathy (CCC).Pathological and experimental studies have suggested that coronary microvascular derangement, and consequent myocardial perfusion disturbance, may cause myocardial damage in CCC.Patients with CCC (n = 36, ages 57 +/- 10 years, 17 males), previously having undergone myocardial perfusion single-positron emission computed tomography and 2-dimensional echocardiography, prospectively underwent a new evaluation after an interval of 5.6 +/- 1.5 years. Stress and rest myocardial perfusion defects were quantified using polar maps and normal database comparison.Between the first and final evaluations, a significant reduction of left ventricular ejection fraction was observed (55 +/- 11% and 50 +/- 13%, respectively p = 0.0001), as well as an increase in the area of the perfusion defect at rest (18.8 +/- 14.1% and 26.5 +/- 19.1%, respectivelyIn CCC patients, the progression of left ventricular systolic dysfunction was associated with both the presence of reversible perfusion defects and the increase in perfusion defects at rest. These results support the notion that myocardial perfusion disturbances participate in the pathogenesis of myocardial injury in CCC.
