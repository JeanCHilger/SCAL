Evaluation of PET-CT : product safety, clinical usefulness, reimbursement in Germany and the USA. Since 1994, PET - and later PET-CT - have gained significant clinical importance. Since 2002, PET-CT systems (PET + multislice CT) are available. The combination of high sensitivity PET images fused with high resolution CT images has gained widespread clinical acceptance for diagnosis, staging and re-staging as well as prediction of response to chemotherapy in oncology. Besides oncology, there are clear indications in diseases of the heart and the brain. The development of new systems in mainly based on multislice CT (64 slice). Radiopharmacology is advancing quickly, especially in the fields of oncology and neurological disorders. However, the limited reimbursement in Germany hampers this development.
