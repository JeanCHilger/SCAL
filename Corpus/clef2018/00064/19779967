Evaluation of a 99mTc-labeled AnnexinA5 variant for non-invasive SPECT imaging of cell death in liver, spleen and prostate. We investigate radio-labeling and pharmacokinetics of a new AnnexinA5 variant (HYNIC-cys-AnxA5) and then assess its utility for the non-invasive detection of cell death in liver, spleen and prostate.AnnexinA5 binds to phosphatidylserine expressed on the surface of apoptotic and necrotic cells. Contrary to other AnnexinA5 variants, the new cys-AnxA5 allows for site-specific conjugation of a hydrazinonicotinamide-maleimide moiety and subsequent radio-labeling with (99m)Tc at a position not involved in the AnxA5-phosphatidylserine interaction. Distribution of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-cys-AnxA5 was studied in rats, both invasively and via SPECT/CT. Cycloheximide was used to induce cell death in liver and spleen, whereas apoptosis in the prostate was induced by castration.HYNIC-cys-AnxA5 was efficiently and reproducibly labeled with (99m)Tc. Blood clearance of radioactivity after iv-injection was adequately described by a two-compartment model, the renal cortex representing the main site of accumulation. Cycloheximide treatment resulted in increased accumulation of intravenous-injected (99m)Tc-HYNIC-cys-AnxA5 in liver and spleen over controls, which correlated well with TUNEL staining for cell death in corresponding tissue sections. However, the increase in TUNEL-positive prostate epithelial cells observed following castration was not paralleled by greater (99m)Tc-HYNIC-cys-AnxA5 accumulation.(99m)Tc-HYNIC-cys-AnxA5 appears a suitable tracer for assessment of cell death in liver and spleen, but not prostate.
