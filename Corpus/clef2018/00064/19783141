Synthesis of (R,S)-[4-11C]baclofen via Michael addition of nitromethane labeled with short-lived 11C. The synthesis of (R,S)-[4-11C]baclofen, the first 11C-labeled GABAB agonist, was demonstrated via Michael addition of nitro[11C]methane as a key step. A tetrabutylammonium fluoride promoted Michael addition of nitro[11C]methane to methyl p-chlorocinnamate, followed by the nitro-group reduction in the presence of NiCl2 and NaBH4 in aqueous MeOH and alkaline hydrolysis yielded (R,S)-[4-11C]baclofen in 36.4+/-1.8% radiochemical conversion in three steps within 20 min.
