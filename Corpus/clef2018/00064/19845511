The efficacy of external counterpulsation depending on severity of coronary artery lesion. The aim of our investigation was to assess the efficacy of enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) in ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients depending on previous by-pass surgery. 30 IHD patients (pts) were treated with EECP using standard protocol (35 hours, 1 hour each procedure). All patients were divided into 2 groups. 1-st group (n=15) - pts after by-pass surgery, 2-nd group (n=15) - pts without previous coronary revascularisation. Pts were examined by ECG, echocardiography, bicycle test, radionuclide perfusion scintigraphy (SPECT) before and after EECP treatment. There was significant decreasing of perfusion defect severity for rest SPECT after EECP treatment (64.93+/-13.21 std and 58.53+/-17.28 std, respectively, p<0.01) and decreasing of size of perfusion defects - 26.10+/-15.76% before and 22.63+/-18.54% after EECP (p<0.05). Size and severity of perfusion defects estimated by SPECT at stress conditions didn't change. After EECP treatment the decreasing of perfusion defect severity (p<0.01) was registered in both groups, the decreasing of size of perfusion (p<0.05) - only in the 1-st group. In the 1-st group decreasing of perfusion defect severity and size of perfusion was more intensive. The efficacy of EECP depends on previous coronary revascularization.
