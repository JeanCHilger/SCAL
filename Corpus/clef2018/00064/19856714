Diagnosis, localization and treatment of pheochromocytoma in MEN 2 syndrome. Pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PHEOs/PGLs) in patients with MEN 2 are usually found in the adrenals after the manifestation of medullary thyroid cancer. These PHEOs are commonly bilateral and hormonally active. Tachycardia, diaphoresis and cephalalgia are encountered in 40 %-80 % of patients with PHEOs hypertension is very prevalent. Plasma concentrations of free metanephrines (or free metanephrines in urine) are best used for the biochemical diagnosis of PHEO/PGL. In patients with biochemically-proven PHEOs/PGLs, anatomical imaging with computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be used. False-positive CT/MRI studies can ensue and the specificity of CT/MRI may vary from 50%-90%. Functional imaging (implementing nuclear medicine modalities) should follow anatomical imaging
