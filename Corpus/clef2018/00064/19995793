Systematic evaluation of quality of care provided to patients undergoing pulmonary surgery helps to identify areas for improvement. Systematic assessment of care pathways may identify areas of potential improvement beyond that generated by traditional outcome measures alone. This approach was used to audit a single-surgeon's practice of pulmonary resection [182 patients over 21 months, median age of 69 (range 18-86) years] by choosing 10 gold standards in three areas of care. Preoperative: 1) Percentage cancer patients undergoing PET scan prior to surgery, 2) Percentage of patients with predicted postoperative FEV(1) (ppoFEV(1)) <40% who had gas transfer (DLCO) measured. Perioperative: 3) Percentage of operations postponed, 4-5) Percentage of cancer patients undergoing anatomical resections and systematic lymph node excision, 6) Rate of exploratory thoracotomies. Postoperative: 7-8) Risk-adjusted mortality according to thoracoscore and ESOS.01, 9) Percentage patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), and 10) Percentage patients discharged directly home from our unit. Postoperative mortality (2.2%), ICU admission (4%), exploratory thoracotomy (2.7%), and home discharge (98%) fared within standards. Only 57% of patients with a ppoFEV(1)<40% had DLCO tested, and eight cases (4.4%) were postponed on the day of surgery. Analysis of the processes of care identified areas for improvement (preoperative preparation of patients, theatre cancellations and intraoperative lymph node management) even in a practice with satisfactory risk-adjusted results.
