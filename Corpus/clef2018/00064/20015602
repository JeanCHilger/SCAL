The potential clinical value of FDG-PET for recurrent renal cell carcinoma. The clinical value of positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for follow-up or suspected recurrence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has not been fully evaluated. The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of FDG-PET for postoperative assessment in patients with RCC.We reviewed 28 scans in 23 patients who had undergone FDG-PET scans after surgery for RCC. Diagnostic accuracy of visually interpreted PET was evaluated based on final diagnoses obtained histologically or by clinical follow-up at least 6 months. Also, additional information over CT, influence on treatment decisions, and the accuracy of FDG uptake as a predictor of survival were assessed.Recurrence of renal carcinoma was histologically (n=15) or clinically (n=6) confirmed in 21 of 28 cases. Overall, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy using FDG-PET were 81%, 71%, and 79%, respectively. In papillary RCC, the sensitivity was 100% however, that was 75% in clear cell RCC in patient-basis. PET correctly detected local recurrence and metastases in all cases in the peritoneum, bone, muscle and adrenal gland. Additional information was obtained from scans in 6 cases (21%), which influenced therapeutic management in 3 cases (11%). Cumulative survival rates over 5 years in the PET-positive vs. the PET-negative group were 46% vs. 83%, respectively (p=0.17).FDG-PET would be useful for postoperative surveillance in patients with RCC, although its impact on treatment decisions may be limited. Further investigations are necessary to conclude whether PET has a prognostic value.
