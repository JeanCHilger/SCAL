SPECT Imaging of Teboroxime during Myocardial Blood Flow Changes. Kinetic parameters and static images from dynamic SPECT imaging of (99m)Tc-teboroxime have been shown to reflect blood flow in dogs and in humans at rest and during adenosine stress. When compartment modeling is used, steady-state physiological conditions are assumed. With standard adenosine stress protocols, imaging of teboroxime would likely involve significant changes in flow, even if performed only for five minutes. These flow changes may significantly bias the kinetic parameter estimates. On the other hand, when static imaging is performed, large flow changes during acquisition may improve contrast between normal and occluded regions. Computer simulations were performed to determine the effect of changing flows on kinetic parameter estimation and on static (average tissue uptake) images. Two canine studies were also performed in which adenosine was given with a standard protocol, and then imaging was repeated with adenosine infusion held constant. The simulations predicted biases on the order of 7% for kinetic washin parameter estimation and 18% for the washout parameter. Contrast for static studies was found to depend critically on the time-activity behavior of the distribution as well as on the stress protocol. The differences in washin contrast from the standard and continous adenosine dog studies was slightly larger than predicted from the simulations. Optimal imaging of teboroxime with adenosine using compartment modeling will require non-standard adenosine stress protocols, although sub-optimal imaging may still be useful clinically.
