Isolated skeletal muscle metastasis following successful treatment of laryngeal cancer: case report.  Skeletal muscle metastases from tumors are a rare occurrence and can present difficult management decisions. We report here on a patient that had been previously treated for squamous cell laryngeal cancer with surgical resection and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy that presented with a metastasis to the rectus abdominis muscle without evidence of recurrent disease at the primary site. After a metastatic workup with PET/CT scan suggested this to be an isolated lesion, surgical excision with negative margins was performed based upon limited treatment options secondary to the location of the tumor and his favorable prognosis suggested by his pathological staging at the time of the initial resection. Here we discuss the incidence of distant metastases from laryngeal cancer and appropriate screening methods. Additionally, skeletal muscle metastases and treatment considerations are discussed.
