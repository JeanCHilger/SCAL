Recent developments in innervation imaging using iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy in Lewy body diseases. Radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is an analog of guanethidine and is taken up by the postganglionic presynaptic nerve endings. MIBG uptake in the heart correlates with adrenergic function, which can be reduced in Lewy body diseases. We described the recent developments in innervation imaging using (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy in Lewy body diseases including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Particularly, we underlined the role of MIBG scintigraphy in differential diagnosis of movement disorders. As described by recent studies, MIBG scintigraphy is a valuable diagnostic tool for differentiation between Lewy body diseases and parkinsonian syndromes or other movement disorders with parkinsonism. Furthermore, this method may provide a powerful differential diagnostic tool between dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease. We also reported the results of clinical investigations about the correlation between characteristics of Parkinson's disease and myocardial MIBG uptake.
