Cerebral glucose metabolism: Influence on perihematomal edema formation after intracerebral hemorrhage in cat models. Most intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) imaging studies focus on structural brain changes. Stereotactic neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) are helpful in the diagnosis of ICH, monitoring the subsequent recovery and investigating its functional mechanisms.To explore the influence of the changes in cerebral glucose metabolism on perihematomal edema formation in an experimental cat model of ICH.Forty-eight cats were divided into 1 sham operation group (6 cats) and 7 ICH model groups (42 cats)". The ICH model groups were injected with 1.0 ml autologous nonheparinized blood into their thalami using accurate stereotactic guidance apparatus. MRI and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT scans were acquired at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 120 h following the intervention. Pearson's correlation test was used to evaluate the association between T2-weighted signal intensity and the edema volume. Student's t test and q test were used to identify the times of significant temporal changes.The volume of perilesional edema did not significantly increase from 2 h to 12 h after ICH, but then increased by 229.4% at 24 h, peaked (by 273.5%), and steadily decreased by 72 h. The FDG intensity in perihematomal edema tissues was markedly reduced 2 h after ICH on PET images, reached its lowest level at 12 h, and then steadily increased at 24 h and 48 h. The changes of standard absorption value (SUV) in perihematomal edema were consistent with those of FDG intensity.Perihematomal glucose metabolism abnormalities have a close relationship with the formation of vasogenic edema. Furthermore, abnormal glucose metabolism may impair capillary integrity and increase blood-brain barrier permeability.
