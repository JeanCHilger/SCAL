Cerebral pharmacodynamics of physostigmine in Alzheimer's disease investigated using single-photon computerised tomography. The effects of physostigmine on patterns of rCBF in patients with pre-senile Alzheimer's disease were studied using 99mTc-labelled HMPAO SPECT. Regional CBF increased in the left cortex relative to right, with the most significant effect in left frontal and higher frontal regions. Measures of regional brain function, such as SPECT, are an important complement to psychological test batteries in understanding the effects in brain of putative antidementia drugs. SPECT brain imaging could extend our understanding of the action of psychotropic drugs in other major psychiatric illnesses.
