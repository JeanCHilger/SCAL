Biocatalytic synthesis of (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ethyl ester using a recombinant whole-cell catalyst. A cofactor regeneration system for enzymatic biosynthesis was constructed by coexpressing a carbonyl reductase from Pichia stipitis and a glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus megaterium in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) PlySs. Transformants containing the polycistronic plasmid pET-PII-SD2-AS1-B exhibited an activity of 13.5 U/mg protein with 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate ethyl ester (COBE) as the substrate and an activity of 14.4 U/mg protein with glucose as the substrate NAD(H) was the coenzyme in both cases. Asymmetric reduction of COBE to (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ethyl ester [(S)-CHBE] with more than 99% enantiomeric excess was demonstrated by transformants. Furthermore, the paper made a comparison of crude enzyme catalysis and whole-cell catalysis in an aqueous monophasic system and a water/organic solvent biphasic system. In the water/n-butyl acetate system, the coexpression system produced 1,398 mM CHBE in the organic phase, which is the highest yield ever reported for CHBE production by NADH-dependent reductases from yeasts. In this case, the molar yield of CHBE was 90.7%, and the total turnover number, defined as moles (S)-CHBE formed per mole NAD+, was 13,980.
