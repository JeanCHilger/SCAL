Children treated for epileptic encephalopathies show improved glucose metabolism. Epileptic neurological disorders in infants are often difficult to distinguish, and call for disparate treatments. Positron emission tomography (PET) using an [18F] fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18FDG) tracer, is a powerful non-invasive technique successful in improving the diagnosis of a number of conditions. Interestingly, this technique has shown that cerebral glucose hypometabolism is present in children with epileptic encephalopathies (EE). Ten children with age-dependent EE were recruited and routine 18FDG PET images were evaluated for their ability to indicate cerebral glucose metabolism both before and after anti-epileptic treatment. We found that there is diffuse glucose hypometabolism in both hemispheres before treatment, indicating EE. Following treatment, the number of epileptic episodes significantly decreased (P < 0.05), while cerebral glucose metabolism improved. Our findings suggest that 18FDG PET can be utilized to monitor cerebral glucose metabolism as a measure of treatment progress in EE.
