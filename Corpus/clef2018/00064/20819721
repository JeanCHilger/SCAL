Application of bioluminescence imaging to therapeutic intervention of herpes simplex virus type I - Thymidine kinase/ganciclovir in glioma. Lentiviral vector containing the HSV1-tk and firefly luciferase (fLuc) gene was infected into C6 and C6-TL expressing HSV1-tk and fLuc gene was generated. C6-TL showed higher [(125)I]IVDU uptake than C6. The survival rate of C6-TL decreased more rapidly with increasing GCV dose and was well correlated with fLuc activity. The images of microPET clearly demonstrated higher uptake of [(18)F]FHBG into the C6-TL tumor. Inhibition of tumor growth was observed in C6-TL tumor-bearing mice treated with GCV through tumor size measurement and bioluminescence imaging. The therapeutic effect of HSV1-tk/GCV system can be monitored using bioluminescent imaging and tumor size measurement.
