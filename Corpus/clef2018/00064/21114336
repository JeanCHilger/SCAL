Synthesis of long-chain [¹⁸F]Deoxyfluoropoly(ethylene glycol) methyl ethers and their noninvasive pharmacokinetic analysis by positron emission tomography. [¹⁸F]DeoxyfluoroPEG methyl ethers with an average molecular weight of 2 kDa ([¹⁸F]1a) and 10 kDa ([¹⁸F]1b) were synthesized by the fluorination of the tosylates 3a,b with [¹⁸F]nBu₄NF at 80°C for 20 min followed by flash filtration through a Sep-Pak Plus Alumina-N cartridge. After the intravenous administration of [¹⁸F]1a and [¹⁸F]1b to rats, their pharmacokinetics was analyzed by noninvasive, real-time, whole-living-body monitoring using positron imaging technology. The effect of PEG's molecular weight on their blood circulation and organ clearance were quantitatively visualized for the first time.
