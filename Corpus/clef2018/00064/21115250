The first synthesis of [(11)C]SB-216763, a new potential PET agent for imaging of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). SB-216763 is a novel, potent and selective glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitor with an IC(50) value of 34 nM. [(11)C]SB-216763 (3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-(1-[(11)C]methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione), a new potential PET agent for imaging of GSK-3, was first designed and synthesized in 20-30% decay corrected radiochemical yield and 370-555 GBq/Î¼mol specific activity at end of bombardment (EOB). The synthetic strategy was to prepare a carbon-11-labeled maleic anhydride intermediate followed by the conversion to maleimide.
