Trends in head and neck radiology. Trends in clinical research of head and neck radiology are well described within four articles published in the European Radiology in the last 2Â years. One constant top issue is to gain more, better or new morphological information by so-called "conventional" methods (CT, MRI) with thin-sliced imaging including special reconstructions. The addition of functional or metabolic methods (e.g. diffusion-weighted MRI, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, positron emission tomography) to anatomical imaging is a further general trend in oncological radiology over the last few years and has been invaluable in head and neck radiology.
