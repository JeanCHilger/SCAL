Synthesis and Evaluation of Fluorinated Aporphines: Potential Positron Emission Tomography Ligands for D2 Receptors The 2-fluoroalkoxy substituted catechol-aporphines 6, 8a-f and 11-monohydroxyaporphines 11a-e were synthesized and found to have high in vitro affinity and selectivity for the dopamine D(2) receptors. The catechol aporphines, 8b and 8d, and the monohydroxy aporphines, 11a-d, were identified as candidates for development as potential PET ligands.
