PET scanning in sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that most commonly presents with pulmonary involvement. The diagnosis is suggested on the basis of clinical and radiologic manifestations and is supported by the histological demonstration of noncaseating granulomas in affected tissues. Different imaging modalities, including chest radiography, X-rays, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and (67) Ga scintigraphy are currently employed to help diagnose and help plan treatment strategy in sarcoidosis patients. Here, we discuss the potential role of positron emission tomography in the diagnosis, assessment of disease activity, and management of patients with sarcoidosis. We also point out some of the limitations of this technique.
