Behavioral and subjective effects of ethanol: relationship to cerebral metabolism using PET. This study examined the effects of ethanol on regional cerebral metabolic rate using positron emission tomography (PET). The study explored the relationship between the mood-altering effects of ethanol and its effects on regional cerebral glucose utilization (CMRglu) in eight healthy male volunteers. In the first phase of the study, the subjects participated in a behavioral preference procedure conducted in a recreational environment to determine their responses to ethanol (0.5 g/kg) in a naturalistic setting. They then participated in three PET sessions, receiving at three to seven day intervals, in counterbalanced order, placebo, 0.5 g/kg or 0.8 g/kg ethanol. PET scans were conducted using a PETT-VI scanner with F-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) as the tracer. The mood-altering effects of ethanol were measured in both the naturalistic and the PET phases of the study. Ethanol produced comparable effects on mood in the naturalistic and the PET settings (i.e., increases in positive mood). The lower dose of ethanol produced variable effects on whole brain and regional CMRglu across subjects. There was some suggestion that certain regional metabolic changes after ethanol were correlated with subjective responses to the drug. The higher dose of ethanol decreased whole brain CMRglu in most subjects. All regions were affected about equally. It was concluded that the mood-altering effects of ethanol are not related in a simple manner to regional changes in CMRglu.
