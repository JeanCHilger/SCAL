Comparative effectiveness of positron emission mammography and MRI in the contralateral breast of women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. The objective of our study was to compare the performance of positron emission mammography (PEM) with that of MRI in the evaluation of the contralateral breast of women with newly diagnosed cancer.Four hundred seventy-two women with newly diagnosed breast cancer offered breast-conserving surgery from September 2006 through November 2008 consented to participate in a multicenter protocol. Participants underwent contrast-enhanced breast MRI and 18F-FDG PEM in randomized order, and the examinations were interpreted independently. The performance characteristics of the imaging modalities were compared using the McNemar test and generalized estimating equations. A retrospective blinded review of PEM images was performed by four experienced observers to understand the reasons for false-negatives.Three hundred sixty-seven women (median age, 58 years age range, 26-93 years) eligible for analysis completed the appropriate follow-up for study inclusion. Fifteen women (4.1%) were found to have contralateral cancer (11 invasive [mean tumor size, 12 mmContralateral cancer was found in 15 of 367 women (4.1%), with MRI showing 14 (93%). Eleven contralateral cancers (73%) were visible on PEM, but only three (20%) were recognized prospectively as suspicious. Lesions that are visible on PEM should be viewed as suspicious unless known to be benign by prior breast imaging or biopsy.
