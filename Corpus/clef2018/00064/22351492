Non-invasive imaging and monitoring cardiotoxicity of cancer therapeutic drugs. Cardiotoxicity due to administration of cancer therapeutic agents such as anthracyclines and herceptin are well described. Established guidelines to screen for chemotherapy-related cardiotoxicity (CRC) are primarily based on serial assessment of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF). However, other parameters such as LV volume, diastolic function, and strain may also be useful in screening for cardiotoxicity. More recent advances in molecular imaging of apoptosis and tissue characterization by cardiac MRI are techniques which might allow early detection of patients at high risk for developing cardiotoxicity prior to a drop in EF. This comprehensive multi-modality review will discuss both the current established imaging techniques as well as the emerging technologies which may revolutionize the future of screening and evaluation for CRC.
