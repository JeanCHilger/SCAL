Multivariable passive RFID vapor sensors: roll-to-roll fabrication on a flexible substrate. We demonstrate roll-to-roll (R2R) fabrication of highly selective, battery-free radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymeric substrate. Selectivity of our developed RFID sensors is provided by measurements of their resonance impedance spectra, followed by the multivariate analysis of spectral features, and correlation of these spectral features to the concentrations of vapors of interest. The multivariate analysis of spectral features also provides the ability for the rejection of ambient interferences. As a demonstration of our R2R fabrication process, we employed polyetherurethane (PEUT) as a "classic" sensing material, extruded this sensing material as 25, 75, and 125-Î¼m thick films, and thermally laminated the films onto RFID inlays, rapidly producing approximately 5000 vapor sensors. We further tested these RFID vapor sensors for their response selectivity toward several model vapors such as toluene, acetone, and ethanol as well as water vapor as an abundant interferent. Our RFID sensing concept features 16-bit resolution provided by the sensor reader, granting a highly desired independence from costly proprietary RFID memory chips with a low-resolution analog input. Future steps are being planned for field-testing of these sensors in numerous conditions.
