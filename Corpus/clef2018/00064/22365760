Pyrrolovesamicols--synthesis, structure and VAChT binding of two 4-fluorobenzoyl regioisomers. This Letter describes the synthesis of two regioisomers of a new class of vesamicol analogs as possible ligands for imaging the vesicular acetylcholine transporter in future PET studies. The two pyrrolovesamicols (±)-6a and (±)-6b were synthesized by nucleophilic ring opening reaction of a tetrahydroindole epoxide precursor with 4-phenylpiperidine. The reaction mechanism of the synthesis was studied by HPLC and the molecular structures were determined by X-ray structure analysis. Unexpected low binding affinities to VAChT (K(i)=312±73 nM for (±)-6a and K(i)=7320±1840 nM for (±)-6b) were determined by competitive binding analysis using a cell line stably transfected with ratVAChT and (-)-[(3)H]vesamicol.
