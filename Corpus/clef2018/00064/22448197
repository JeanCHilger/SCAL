Clinical Indications of C-Choline PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Relapse. Several studies investigated the potential role of imaging modalities in prostate cancer patients in case of biochemical recurrence. However, the role of molecular imaging has not been well established yet. Considering the results of the literature and of our own experience, we tried to summarize the potential applications of (11)C-choline PET/CT in prostate cancer patients in case of biochemical relapse for the detection of lymph node and distant recurrence.
