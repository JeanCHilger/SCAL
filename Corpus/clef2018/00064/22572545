Consensus report on the radiological management of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST): recommendations of the German GIST Imaging Working Group. The aim was to reach consensus in imaging for staging and follow-up as well as for therapy response assessment in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). The German GIST Imaging Working Group was formed by 9 radiologists engaged in assessing patients with GIST treated with targeted therapy. The following topics were discussed: indication and optimal acquisition techniques of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT tumour response assessment considering response criteria and measurement techniques on CT, MRI and PET/CT
