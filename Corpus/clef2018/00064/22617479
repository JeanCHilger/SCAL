Integration of hybrid single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography in the preoperative assessment of sentinel node in patients with cervical and endometrial cancer: our experience and literature review. The purpose of this study was to assess whether there is an additional value of single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) over lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) alone for sentinel node (SN) mapping in endometrial and cervical cancer.Ten women with clinically cervical stage IA2 to stage IB1 and 25 women with stage I endometrial cancer underwent preoperative LSG for SN mapping. Technetium Tc 99m albumin nanocolloid was injected submucosally at 4 points of the cervix. Patients underwent SPECT/CT emission-transmission study at least 3 hours after standard planar images. Methylene blue was injected into the cervix just before surgery under general anesthesia. All patients underwent hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and radical regional nodal dissection. Hot and/or blue nodes were labeled as SNs.Conventional planar imaging detection rate was 50%, whereas the detection rate of at least one SN with SPECT/CT was 91% (32/35) bilateral detection was achieved in 7 (39%) of 18 women in planar and in 17 (53%) of 32 women in SPECT/CT imaging, respectively. Bilateral detection was achieved in 57% of women (20/35). Sentinel nodes were located in external and internal iliac nodes (66%), obturator nodes (5%), internal iliac nodes (11%), common iliac nodes (9%), and presacral nodes (9%). Lymph node involvement was identified in 5 patients (14%). Sentinel node correctly predicted lymph node involvement in all node-positive patients. Sentinel node sensitivity and negative predictive value of SPECT/CT were 100%.Single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography seems to improve intraoperative identification of SNs and provides additional useful information about the anatomic location of SNs compared to planar LSG in cervical and endometrial cancer.
