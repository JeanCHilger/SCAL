Use of ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography in a miniature pig (Sus scrofa domestica) with pneumonia. A 1-y-old male miniature pig housed in our laboratory facility was evaluated for weight loss and rough coat condition. CBC results revealed neutrophilia. Radiography of the thoracic area showed increased opacity throughout the thoracic cavity except for the right caudal lobe. ¹⁸F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG-PET-CT) revealed elevated standard uptake values in the area corresponding to the radiologic findings. Follow-up thoracic radiography taken 2 wk after FDG-PET-CT showed several interval changes, including markedly decreased opacity throughout the entire thoracic cavity. Necropsy revealed adhesions between the upper portion of the caudal lobe of the left lung and thoracic wall. ELISA for several closely related infectious species confirmed the presence of antibody to Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serovar V.
