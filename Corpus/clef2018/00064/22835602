Hodgkin's lymphoma in adults. Management of Hodgkin's lymphoma continues to develop. Outcomes for patients with favourable-risk, early-stage disease are excellent, and serial reductions in intensity of treatment have been made to retain the excellent prognosis while reducing the late effects of treatment. Prognosis is also very good in advanced-stage disease but the rate of relapse is higher than in early-stage disease, and the optimum first-line treatment is unclear. Workers are investigating the role of functional imaging to assess whether treatment can be tailored according to response, with the most intensive therapies reserved for patients predicted to have poor outcomes. In this Seminar we critically appraise the management of Hodgkin's lymphoma in early-stage disease, advanced-stage disease, and at relapse, with a focus on late effects of treatment.
