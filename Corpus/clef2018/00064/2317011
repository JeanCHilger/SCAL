Regional cerebral blood flow during focal seizures of temporal and frontocentral onset. Ictal single photon emission computed tomography recordings were performed in 9 patients in the course of 11 seizures. Injections of radionuclide were made an average of 72 seconds after the onset of the seizure as indicated by electroencephalography. All patients also underwent interictal recordings. In 6 patients, the localization of the electroencephalographic focus and the morphological lesions corresponded with the ictal hyperperfusion. This could be seen in single photon emission computed tomography. Seizures triggered by hyperventilation, and seizures of patients with anatomical brain lesions (e.g., cysts, surgical defects, and recent injections of technetium-hexamethylene-propylene-amine-oxime) showed an absent or noncorresponding localization of the ictal recording. The ictal and interictal recording seems suitable as a confirmatory noninvasive method for the localization of the epileptogenic focus, particularly in the preoperative evaluation of epilepsy.
