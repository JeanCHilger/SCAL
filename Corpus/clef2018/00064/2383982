Patch testing with the "sesquiterpene lactone mix": a marker for contact allergy to Compositae and other sesquiterpene-lactone-containing plants. A multicentre study of the EECDRG. 6278 patients were patch tested with a sesquiterpene lactone mix (SL-mix) in 10 European clinics. 4011 patients were tested only with 0.1% SL-mix, 63 (approximately 1.5%) of whom were positive, with 26 (41%) of these cases being considered clinically relevant. There were no cases of active sensitization, though 5 cases of irritation were reported. 22 irritant reactions and 22 cases of active sensitization occurred when testing also with 1% and 0.33% concentrations of SL-mix. SL-mix 0.1% pet. is shown to be an important patch test and many relevant sensitizations will be missed without routine screening with such a mix. Most patients with SL-mix sensitivity presented with hand and/or face dermatitis, apparent photodermatitis or more generalised eczema.
