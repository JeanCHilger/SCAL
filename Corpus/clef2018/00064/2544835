New tracers for the imaging of the medullary thyroid carcinoma. I-MIBG and 99Tcm(V)-DMSA have been recently proposed as scintigraphic markers of the medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Thirty two patients were examined with 131I- or 123I-MIBG and 26 of these were re-examined with 99Tcm(V)-DMSA (planar and SPECT). From our experience we can draw the following conclusions: (1) the scintigraphic attempt was useless in patients with normal levels of plasma calcitonin (CT): (2) in patients with high plasma CT levels, the sensitivity of the MIBG was better in familiar (3/3 true positive) than in sporadic disease (7/21 true positive overall sensitivity = 42%)
