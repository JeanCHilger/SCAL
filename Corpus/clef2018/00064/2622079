SPECT measurement of cerebral hemodynamics in transient ischemic attack patients--evaluation of pathogenesis and detection of misery perfusion. To evaluate the cerebral hemodynamics and the pathogenesis by regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV), 42 transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients and 9 normal volunteers were studied using SPECT. We classified these patients into Group A (n = 23: no occlusion or stenosis of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery non large vessel disease) and Group B (n = 19: chronic occlusion or severe stenosis of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery
