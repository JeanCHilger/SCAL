Interaction between the veterinarian, the client and the patient. From the literature it has been established that pets can fulfill specific functions with regard to their owners. The purpose of this investigation is to highlight the interaction which takes place between pet owners and their pets as observed during consultations with veterinarians. The emphasis is however on the meaning of the emotional content of the interaction rather than on the actual functioning of the interaction. The interactions were monitored by means of natural observation, information gained through the completion of questionnaires, information about the client obtained from the veterinarian and content analysis of taped conversations which took place during consultations. The results indicate that the interaction between a pet owner and a pet is one of need fulfillment. Content analysis indicated that the owners attempt to fulfill certain needs through their pets, or conversely attempt to project their own emotions onto their pets. Loneliness and aggression are typical examples of this. A veterinarian who is able to identify his client's emotional needs, can alleviate his problems by giving unconditional support, referring the client with serious emotional problems to a psychologist or consulting a psychologist on behalf of the client.
