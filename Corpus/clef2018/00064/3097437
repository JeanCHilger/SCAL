Determination of plasma [18F]-6-fluorodopa during positron emission tomography: elimination and metabolism in carbidopa treated subjects. An investigation of the metabolism of [18F]-6-fluorodopa (FDOPA) given to carbidopa treated subjects for scanning by positron emission tomography (PET) has been carried out by analysis of plasma. Reverse phase ion pair HPLC and alumina extraction were employed to fractionate and identify the [18F]-labelled compounds of plasma over a two hour period. During this time, the plasma levels of both total 18F and FDOPA decreased as a bi-exponential function of time. The rates of 18F, but not FDOPA, elimination were observed to decrease with age. In addition to FDOPA, only one other major peak of radioactivity was resolved by HPLC. Identification of this compound as the O-methylated derivative of FDOPA (MeFDOPA) is based on its shared HPLC elution time with in vitro synthesized O-[methyl-14C]-FDOPA. The ratio of the concentration of MeFDOPA to FDOPA (MeFDOPA/FDOPA) in plasma increased linearly with time, and the slope of this linear relationship decreased with the age of the individual.
