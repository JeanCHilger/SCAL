Effect of exercise on the leg distribution of C15O2 and 15O2 in normals and in patients with peripheral ischemia: a study using positron tomography. In order to evaluate regional muscle blood flow and oxygen utilization, we study with positron emission tomography (PET) the distribution of C15O2 and 15O2 in 17 subjects: 5 normals (24 +/- 3 years) and 12 patients (63 +/- 13.5 years). C15O2 and 15O2 are inhalated with a steady-state technique. Positron tomograms are recorded in supine position at the greatest diameter of the leg. Exercise consists in simultaneous ankle flexions. In all normals, C15O2 and 15O2 are distributed homogeneously and symmetrically in both legs. At rest, they concentrate in the region of vascular pedicle. After exercise, C15O2 and 15O2 are electively distributed in the anterolateral region of the leg. In patients, this pattern of distribution is similar but asymmetrical. Moreover, the regional uptake of C15O2 and 15O2 often dissociates. In conclusion, C15O2 and 15O2 allow to study repeatedly muscle blood flow and oxygen utilization in patients with peripheral ischemia, both at rest and after exercise. The broad spectrum of pathological changes observed in this study needs further metabolic investigations.
