A preliminary evaluation of a dual crystal positron camera. The whole-body positron camera PC2048-7WB, manufactured by Scanditronix AB, is based on a detection unit with two scintillating crystals on each photomultiplier tube. The design ideas are specified and a system description is given. Preliminary test results including spatial resolution, time resolution, scatter correction, homogeneity, sensitivity, and count rate linearity are presented.
