Anamnestic data in allergic rhinitis. In a study of 770 patients with allergic rhinitis, anamnestic data were collected by means of a questionnaire. 484 (63%) of the patients were women and 286 (37%) men. 45.5% of the patients had perennial symptoms, 33.5% had seasonal symptoms only, and 21% had predominantly seasonal but also some perennial symptoms. More than 50% of the patients belonged to the age group 21-40 years. The seasonal group included significantly more young patients than the perennial group. More than 50% of the parents and about 45% of the siblings had some atopic disorder. About 20% of the rhinitis patients had a concomitant allergic disorder. Sneezing was the commonest complaint in both rhinitis groups, but it was significantly more frequent in patients with seasonal rhinitis. Nasal blockage, again, was significantly commoner in perennial rhinitis. More than half of the patients reported severest symptoms in the morning. 282 patients had some domestic animal or pet, and 34% of these developed symptoms when close to an animal. Hypersensitivity to animals was significantly more frequent in patients who had domestic animals or pets than in those who did not. There was a clear correlation in perennial allergic rhinitis between the duration of rhinitis and deterioration of the sense of smell.
