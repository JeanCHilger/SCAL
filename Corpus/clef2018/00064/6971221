A new radioisotope for lung ventilation studies: 19-neon. Neon 19, 17-second positron-emitting radioelement, is produced continuously by 23MeV alpha particle bombardment of oxygen. For a 12 muA particle current the method of preparation described delivers 14 mCi of neon 19 per min to the functional exploration room. The radiochemically pure radioactive gas is diluted in air and breathed continously by the patient lying under a positron tomographic camera. The regional lung ventilation distribution is obtained on 2 cm thick sections of organ with a transverse resolution of 17 mm. Quantification of the ventilation output per unit lung volume is contemplated.
