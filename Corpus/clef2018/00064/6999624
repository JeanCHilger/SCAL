Special characteristics and potential of single photon emission computed tomography in the brain. Single photon emission tomographic techniques for evaluation of the brain have as their major advantage the ability to employ readily available radionuclides, such as technetium-99m. With present radiopharmaceuticals, single photon emmision tomography of the brain primarily provides morphological information that may be complimentary to standard gamma camera images. Particular areas of assistance have included detection of basal lesions, delineation of multiplicity of lesions, definition of medial extent of abnormalities, clear separation of skull and intracranial abnormalities, and perhaps improved lesion characterization. Overall, however, the reported improvement in sensitivity has been relatively small. To optimally utilize the tomographic and quantiative capabilities of single emission tomography, new classes of radiopharmaceuticals must be developed that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and provide information on CNS function and pathophysiology. If such radiopharmaceuticals can be labeled with single emission radionuclides, this technique has the potential to provide critically important information. The ultimate outcome of single emission tomographic techniques for the study of the brain may depend on radiopharmaceutical advances.
