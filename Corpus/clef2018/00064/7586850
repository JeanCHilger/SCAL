Positron emission tomographic study of late-onset cryptogenic symptomatic seizures. Ten patients with epilepsy of unknown origin, starting after the age of 50 years, and without clear evidence of cognitive decline were studied with positron emission tomography, using the steady state technique with 15O. Cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism were significantly decreased in all cortical areas. No focal areas of hypometabolism were detected. Treatment with phenytoin did not influence the results. It is suggested that late-onset seizures could be the premonitory signs of a progressive encephalopathy of unknown origin.
