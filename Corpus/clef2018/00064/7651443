n-Hexane-induced parkinsonism: pathogenetic hypotheses. n-Hexane, similar hydrocarbons, and derivatives are common environmental pollutants and by-products of lipid peroxidation, and they may have a nigrotoxic effect like that of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. This report describes our second case of parkinsonism in a subject exposed to n-hexane. Positron emission tomography studies demonstrated regional striatal abnormalities of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system and of glucose metabolism that were different from those found in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
