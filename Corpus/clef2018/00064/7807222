Many areas in the human brain respond to visual motion. 1. The regions of the human brain responsive to motion were mapped using the H2(15)O position emission tomography (PET) activation technique and compared by viewing a moving random dot pattern with a stationary dot pattern. The stimulus was optimized in dot density and 3 degrees in diameter. 2. In addition to bilateral foci at the border between Brodmann areas 19 and 37, a V1/V2 focus and a focus in the cuneus reported earlier, we observed activations in other visual areas (lower BA 19 and the parieto-occipital fissure) in the cerebellum and in two other, presumed vestibular areas, the posterior bank of lateral sulcus and at the border of BA 2/40. 3. Homologies between monkey and human cortex are discussed.
