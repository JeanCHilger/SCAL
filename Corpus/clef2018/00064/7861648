Therapeutic effectiveness of 131I-MIBG on malignant pheochromocytoma--results of long-term follow-up. The therapeutic response of 131I-MIBG was evaluated in 4 patients with malignant pheochromocytoma who had been treated with 131I-MIBG and followed-up over 5 years. The patients were 2 men and 2 women with ages ranging from 41 to 69 years old (mean 53 years). The primary tumors in 3 of 4 patients had been resected four to eight years before 131I-MIBG treatment. One patient was diagnosed as adrenal pheochromocytoma, and two were retroperitoneal paraganglioma. And in one patient, the resection of primary mediastinal tumor was not performed due to the adhesion to pericardium but the diagnosis of paraganglioma was obtained by biopsy of bone lesion. All patients showed the clear accumulation of 131I-MIBG in tumor on scintigraphy. The number of doses of 131I-MIBG ranged from one to three times with 3.7 GBq per administration and a cumulative activity from 3.7 to 11.1 GBq. Treatment effect was obvious in one patient with lung, bone, and lymph node metastases whose cumulated absorbed dose with 11.1 GBq of 131I-MIBG exceeded over 150 Gy. At the present time, the duration of survival since the beginning of initial 131I-MIBG therapy is over 5 yrs. The other three patients, however, showed little effects, and died with the disease in 2.6 to 4.1 years after the initial 131I-MIBG therapy. 131I-MIBG will become a promising agent for therapy in patients with malignant pheochromocytoma with high degree of accumulation.
