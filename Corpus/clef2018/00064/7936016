Clinical value of DMSA planar and single photon emission computed tomography as an initial diagnostic tool in adult women with recurrent acute pyelonephritis. Routine DMSA scintigraphy, ultrasound (US) of the kidney, intravenous pyelography (IVP) and voiding cystoureterography (VCU) were performed in 27 consecutive adult women with recurrent acute pyelonephritis (APN) during a 12-month follow-up. Both planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were obtained for DMSA scan. DMSA scans were repeated in those patients with abnormal initial scan. DMSA-SPECT showed normal findings in 2, single renal cortical detect (RCD) in 9 and multiple RCD in 16 (including nonvisualization in 2). Of the 11 kidneys with normal findings or single RCD on DMSA-SPECT, only 1 (9%) showed vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) on VCU (grade I). A large proportion of those with multiple RCDs showed abnormal findings on IVP (44%, 7/16), US (38%, 6/16) or VCU (31%, 5/16) 63% in any of these three studies. 5 of 6 patients with VUR had multiple RCDs on DMSA-SPECT, and 3 of these 5 showed no abnormality on IVP or US. 7 patients who needed other managements besides initial standard antibiotic treatment had multiple RCDs on DMSA-SPECT. 15 normal women were also studied and showed normal DMSA-SPECT, US and IVP, in all cases. Follow-up DMSA-SPECT was done in 16 patients (7 with single RCD, 9 with multiple RCD). All 7 patients with single RCD showed improvement, in those with multiple RCDs improvement was observed in 2, no change in 7 on follow-up studies. We conclude: (1) DMSA-SPECT is a useful initial diagnostic tool in adult women with recurrent APN to identify patients who need more extensive radiological studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
