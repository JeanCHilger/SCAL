Comparison and spacial correlation of interictal HMPAO-SPECT and FDG-PET in intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. The respective contribution of interictal HMPAO-SPECT and FDG-PET to the imaging of the epileptogenic zone in intractable temporal lobe epilepsy is not known. Ten consecutive patients with drug resistant focal epilepsy of temporal lobe origin were studied with prolonged noninvasive video-EEG monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging, interictal FDG-PET and HMPAO-SPECT. Five patients demonstrated unitemporal and 5 patients bitemporal interictal and/or ictal EEG epileptiform abnormalities. We developed a 3-dimensional semiquantitative method for interpretation and comparison of FDG-PET and HMPAO-SPECT using a 15-compartment model of the temporal lobe. In all 5 patients with unilateral epileptogenicity, interictal hypometabolism and hypoperfusion were recorded on the side of the EEG abnormalities without discrepancy between PET and SPECT. The severity and the extent of focal abnormalities were consistently greater on PET than on SPECT, in agreement with previously well documented better 'sensitivity' of PET. Among the 5 patients with bitemporal epileptogenicity, results of SPECT and PET were convergent in only 2 cases. In this group, SPECT abnormalities appeared more profound but either SPECT or PET were not constantly correlated with the side of predominant EEG epileptogenicity. Abnormalities on PET and SPECT were more frequently limited to mesiobasal structures among cases with unilateral epileptogenicity and tended to involve neocortical structures in bitemporal cases. We conclude that interictal FDG-PET and HMPAO-SPECT provide the same type of information on the side of the epileptogenic zone in cases with clearly unilateral epileptogenicity, with abnormalities more intense and more extensive on PET.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
