Correlation of pharmacological 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging with poststenotic coronary flow reserve in patients with angiographically intermediate coronary artery stenoses. The physiological assessment of angiographically intermediate-severity stenoses remains problematic. Functional measurements of poststenotic intracoronary Doppler coronary flow reserve can be performed in humans but have not been correlated with hyperemic myocardial perfusion imaging or angiographic data in this patient population.Thirty-three patients undergoing diagnostic quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) for assessment of intermediate-severity coronary artery disease (mean QCA percent diameter stenosis, 56 +/- 14%) were studied. Proximal and distal poststenotic Doppler coronary flow velocities were measured (left anterior descending coronary artery, 16 right coronary artery, 10Two technologically diverse functional measures of stenosis severity--Doppler-derived poststenotic hyperemic intracoronary flow reserve and vasodilator stress 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging--are highly (89%) correlated. The physiological assessment of coronary stenoses of angiographically intermediate severity may be improved by the use of these techniques.
