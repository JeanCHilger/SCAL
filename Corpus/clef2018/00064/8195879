Prospective evaluation of technetium-99m-HMPAO SPECT in mild and moderate traumatic brain injury. We prospectively evaluated the contribution of 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT in patients who have sustained acute, mild or moderate head trauma.Forty-two patients formed the first subgroup of moderate trauma (ModTr) and 25 patients formed the second subgroup of mild trauma (MilTr). All 67 patients underwent an initial SPECT (Tinit) within 4 wk after a closed cranial trauma. After a mean interval of 3 mo from the time of Tinit, all patients were clinically re-evaluated those with an abnormal Tinit underwent a repeat SPECT (Trpt) as well. All SPECT studies were visually graded by agreement of three observers adjudging a score ranging from 0 (no lesions) to 4.For the group as a whole (ModTr + MilTr), the following results could be derived: (1) in 32/33 Tinit negative cases, clinical symptoms had resolved (2) the positive predictive value of Tinit was only 20/34 (59%)Our results show that: (1) SPECT alterations correlate well with the severity of the trauma (2) a negative initial SPECT study is a reliable predictor of a favorable clinical outcome
