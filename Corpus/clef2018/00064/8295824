The noninvasive determination of resting myocardial blood flow in patients using 82 Rb in comparison with the argon method. Resting myocardial blood flow in absolute units was determined in 11 patients without known heart disease using dynamic PET with 82Rb. Based on a modified Fick's approach to measuring myocardial blood flow, originally developed and validated in canine studies by Herrero and coworkers (Circulation 1990 82: 1377-86), a global flow value of 0.60 +/- 0.10 ml/min/gr myocardium (MV +/- SD, N = 11) was obtained. With the exception of the apex, segmental blood flow was not significantly different in 12 left ventricular myocardial segments, indicating homogenous myocardial blood flow distribution. In 5 patients global myocardial blood flow was determined simultaneously both by 82Rb PET and argon as inert gas method. 82Rb flow did not differ significantly from argon flow (0.60 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.68 +/- 0.15, MV +/- SD, N.S.). These results show that correct quantitation of resting myocardial blood flow with dynamic 82Rb PET is feasible also in patients.
