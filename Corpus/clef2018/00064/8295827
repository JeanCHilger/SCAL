Drug effects on cerebral blood flow in the baboon model--acetazolamide and nimodipine. The sensitivity of the baboon model under anaesthesia for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain with 99mTc-HMPAO, as recently developed by us to study cerebral blood flow patterns, was investigated using drugs that are known to increase cerebral blood flow, e.g. acetazolamide, the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and nimodipine, the calcium channel blocker. Increases in cerebral blood flow for both acetazolamide and nimodipine were observed that correspond well with other studies. Statistically significant regional specificity was noted for acetazolamide and nimodipine. Interestingly a combination of these drugs did not enhance cerebral blood flow but rather decreased it in comparison with the individual drug responses. The results were correlated with arterial blood pressure, heart rate, pCO2 and pO2. A blood pressure decrease was noted for both drugs, while acetazolamide had a marked influence on pO2. The results indicate that the baboon model is sensitive for evaluation of drug effects on cerebral blood flow.
