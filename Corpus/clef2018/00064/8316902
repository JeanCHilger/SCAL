Antiphospholipid antibodies and regional cerebral blood flow in systemic lupus erythematosus. We investigated the relationship between antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) on 25 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Lupus anticoagulant (LA) and anticardiolipin antibody-IgG (ACA-IgG) as a marker of APA were determined. Brain CT and single photon emission CT (SPECT) were performed to evaluate the rCBF. LA was positive in 8 cases (32%), and ACA-IgG was positive in 3 cases (12%), respectively. Brain CT revealed brain atrophy in 8 cases (32%), but none of them had localized lesions. SPECT disclosed a reduced rCBF in 11 cases (44%). A reduced rCBF was noted to have a significant relationship with LA (p < 0.005), but not with ACA-IgG. It was suggested that LA might be an important factor as the cause of rCBF disturbances detected by SPECT in SLE patients.
