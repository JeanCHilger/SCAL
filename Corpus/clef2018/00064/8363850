Sequential changes in SPECT using 201T1 chloride during the treatment of intracranial gliomas. The authors followed up the change in SPECT using 201Tl chloride (Tl-SPECT) according to the course of treatment of intracranial gliomas and analyzed the difference in Tl-SPECT between the stable and progressive groups. The subjects were 26 series of supratentorial gliomas subjected to Tl-SPECT before and after the treatment (radio-therapy and chemotherapy). They were put on Tl-SPECT after 10 minutes (early image) and 4 hours (delayed) following 74 MBq of 201Tl chloride intravenous injection. Besides, RI count ratio (L/N) in the tumor lesion (L) and contralateral parenchyma (N) was measured. The patients were divided into stable and progressive groups judging from the therapeutic effects, the change in L/N ratio between before and after the treatment was analyzed. The stable group showed a significant post-treatment decrease in L/N ratio compared with a significant post-treatment increase therein for the progressive group. This result suggested Tl-SPECT to change according to the course of treatment and to be applicable to the judgement of the therapeutic effect on gliomas.
