Coronary angiographic changes during 2 years after myocardial infarction largely undetected by repeated tomographic thallium-201 scintigraphy and not reflected by clinical symptoms. Repeated coronary angiographies and single photon emission computed tomographies (SPECT) were performed at 9 and 33 months after myocardial infarction (MI) in 47 young men. Coronary lesions were classified in eight grades with respect to the reduction of the luminal diameter. The progression and regression of two steps or more in lesions of grade 2 or more, the recanalization of coronary thrombosis and an increase in collaterals were recorded. Patients were divided into three groups with regard to (A) deterioration, (B) improvement and (C) no changes in the three major coronary regions, respectively. Overall, 23 patients (49%) showed changes between the first and the second investigation. A simplified method using summarized short-axis slices for evaluation of the thallium-201 SPECT showed a significant difference in change of regional myocardial uptake of thallium-201 between groups A and B (P = 0.047) but not between the groups A and C, in lateral myocardial regions. No significant differences were found between any of the groups in respect of the anterior or inferior myocardial regions. These findings were not explained by changes in clinical status, maximum heart rate or workload, or by changes in medication. Our results suggest that substantial changes in coronary morphology can take place during the 2 years following MI without consistent changes in clinical symptoms or regional myocardial perfusion.
