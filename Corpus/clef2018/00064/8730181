Susceptibility-weighted MR for evaluation of vasodilatory capacity with acetazolamide challenge. To investigate cerebral vasodilatory capacity by acetazolamide challenge in healthy subjects and in patients with chronic occlusive cerebrovascular disease by using susceptibility-weighted gradient-echo MR imaging.Eight patients with chronic occlusive cerebrovascular disease and four healthy volunteers were studied with susceptibility-weighted MR imaging before and after intravenous administration of 1000 mg of acetazolamide. Signal intensities were measured as a function of time in several regions of interest defined on anatomic images. In all patients with chronic occlusive cerebrovascular disease, acetazolamide challenge and resting regional cerebral blood flow were also evaluated with single-photon emission CT (SPECT).In healthy volunteers, signal intensities began to increase 3 to 4 minutes after acetazolamide administration, with a continuous increase during the subsequent 10 minutes. The effect lasted for approximately 45 minutes after administration. In patients with chronic occlusive cerebrovascular disease, signal changes on susceptibility-weighted MR images of occluded areas with normal vasodilatory capacity on SPECT images did not differ from signal changes of nonocclusive areas. In those patients with changes that reflected diminished vasodilatory capacity, the MR images showed a lower percentage of signal changes after acetazolamide administration than those in normally perfused areas.Susceptibility-weighted MR imaging offers an alternative method for estimating vasodilatory capacity.
