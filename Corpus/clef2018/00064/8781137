Regional cerebral blood flow pattern in normal young and aged volunteers: a 99mTc-HMPAO SPET study. The aim of this study was to investigate the normal pattern of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) distribution in normal young and aged volunteers using technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99m-Tc-HMPAO) as a tracer. The region brain perfusion of young and aged subjects was compared, especially regarding rCBF differences due to age and gender, and interhemispheric rCBF asymmetries. Sixty-eight right-handed normal volunteers - 40 young (mean age 29. 5+/-6.3 years) and 28 aged (mean age 71.2+/-4.3 years) - were included in the study. rCBF was estimated on the basis of a semiquantitative approach by means of a left/right index and two region/reference ratios, using the cerebellum and the whole brain activity as references. A good correlation between these two region/reference ratios was found (P<0.005 in all cerebral regions). The highest rCBF ratios corresponded to the cerebellum, followed by the occipital lobe. The remaining cortical regions (temporal, parietal, frontal and basal ganglia) showed slightly lower values. The white matter showed rCBF ratios substantially lower than the grey matter. In neither young nor aged subjects were significant rCBF differences between the genders found in any of the two region/reference indices employed. Aged subjects showed significantly lower rCBF ratios than young subjects in the left frontal lobe and in the posterior region of the left temporal lobe. In both young and aged subjects, lower perfusion was found in the left hemisphere, except for the white matter region in both age groups and the frontal lobe in the young subjects. Aged subjects presented a slightly higher interhemispheric asymmetry in the frontal lobe. However, interhemispheric asymmetry was minimal (-1. 01% to 3.14%). Consequently, a symmetrical rCBF distribution can be assumed between homologous regions, independent of age.
