Local cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with long-term behavioral and cognitive deficits following mild traumatic brain injury. A retrospective study of 20 patients with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) examined brain regions of interest by comparing [18F]-2-deoxyglucose PET, neuropsychological test results, and continuing behavioral dysfunction. Abnormal local cerebral metabolic rates (rLCMs) were most prominent in midtemporal, anterior cingulate, precuneus, anterior temporal, frontal white, and corpus callosum brain regions. Abnormal rLCMs were significantly correlated statistically with 1) overall clinical complaints, most specifically with inconsistent attention/concentration and 2) overall neuropsychological test results. The authors conclude that 1) even mild TBI may result in continuing brain behavioral deficits 2) PET can help elucidate dysfunctional brain circuitry in neurobehavioral disorders
