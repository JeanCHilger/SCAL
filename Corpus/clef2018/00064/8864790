Feasibility of simultaneous Tc99m sestamibi and 2D-echo cardiac imaging during dobutamine pharmacologic stress. Preliminary results in a female population. Feasibility of simultaneous 2D-Echo and SPECT Tc99m Sestamibi imaging during dobutamine infusion was evaluated in a female population with suspected coronary artery disease and scheduled for diagnostic coronary angiography. A total of 49 consecutive subjects were studied. Patients under continuous ECG and 2D-Echo monitoring underwent standard dobutamine infusion at increasing doses to a diagnostic end-point. Tc99m Sestamibi was administered at the peak of the dobutamine effect. With this approach, 35 patients were identified correctly by 2D-Echo (Sensitivity = 60.1% Specificity = 83.3%
