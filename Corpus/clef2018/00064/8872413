Cerebral metabolic changes in Alzheimer's disease: neurobehavioral patterns. Regional cerebral glucose metabolism was surveyed in 37 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 21 normal controls using positron emission tomography. Where possible, brain regions were specified according to their neurobehavioral function rather than as anatomically demarcated structures. Absolute metabolic values revealed significant differences (p < 0.05) between AD patients and controls for whole brain and the more superior supratentorial brain slices. Normalized values (region/brain stem) showed the most striking declines (p < 0.001) in the association cortex (heteromodal region -21% unimodal region -19%) and the primary sensory-motor cortex (-13%), with motor, auditory, and visual areas more affected than somatosensory areas. Limbic and paralimbic systems were equally affected (-14%
