Which clinical sign of Parkinson's disease best reflects the nigrostriatal lesion? Clinical scales, based on the major signs of Parkinson's disease (PD), are commonly used to assess the effect of symptomatic treatment of PD. With the appearance of therapy aiming to rescue or protect the nigrostriatal neurons in PD, it becomes essential to define which of these signs best reflects the underlying neuronal deficit. Fluorodopa positron emission tomography has been shown to correlate with postmortem nigral cell counts. We correlated the major signs of PD with positron emission tomography results in 35 PD patients. We found that in the "practically defined off" state, (1) Purdue pegboard scores correlated best with the nigrostriatal dopaminergic deficit (2) of the subscales of the modified Columbia score, the bradykinesia subscale correlated best
