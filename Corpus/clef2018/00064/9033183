Neuroimaging in intractable complex partial seizures. We retrospectively analyzed 19 patients with intractable complex partial seizures who underwent temporal lobectomy and compared the usefulness of various imaging techniques in diagnosis and localization. Pathologic findings consistent with mesial temporal sclerosis were found in 12 patients arteriovenous malformations in four, tumors in three, and coexistence of a tumor and mesial temporal sclerosis in one. Electroencephalography and single photon emission computed tomography detected lateralized functional abnormality in two patients when computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed equivocal results. Both CT and MRI showed all arteriovenous malformations and tumors. CT detected only four cases of mesial temporal sclerosis, while MRI showed nine cases. Detection, delineation and diagnosis of lesions responsible for complex partial seizures are essential for good surgical results. Thus, the importance of image studies, especially MRI, should be emphasized in patients with complex partial seizures.
