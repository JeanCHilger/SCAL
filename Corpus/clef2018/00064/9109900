A direct comparison of PET activation and electrocortical stimulation mapping for language localization. Mapping eloquent language cortex in presurgical patients typically is accomplished using highly invasive direct cortical stimulation techniques. Functional imaging during language activation using positron emission tomography (PET) is a promising, noninvasive alternative that requires validation. In seven patients undergoing surgical evaluation for intractable epilepsy, we performed both direct cortical stimulation and PET activation mapping of language cortex using identical tasks. MRI, PET, and CT scans were coregistered to directly compare the location of language centers determined by cortical stimulation versus activation PET. We found that cortical regions that showed increased cerebral blood flow during both visual and auditory naming tasks were located in the same regions as subdural electrodes which disrupted language during electrical stimulation. Cortical regions underlying electrodes that did not disrupt language also showed no consistent changes in regional cerebral blood flow during PET activation. Used cautiously, PET activation produces language maps similar to those obtained with direct cortical stimulation, with more complete brain coverage and considerably less invasion.
