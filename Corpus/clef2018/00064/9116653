An automated radiopharmaceutical dispenser. An automated radiopharmaceutical dispenser, that offers several advantages over manual procedures, has been developed. It employs a personal computer interfaced to a precision syringe drive module, a dose calibrator, and a printer. The operating program provides menu-selection operation and documentation of procedures and individual doses delivered. All materials in contact with the radiopharmaceutical are sterile and disposable. A novel transport safe is employed to further reduce radiation exposure.
