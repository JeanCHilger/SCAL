Reduced activity in the extrastriate visual cortex of individuals with strabismic amblyopia. In order to examine the relationship between reduced visual acuity in human strabismic amblyopia and the cortical activation pattern, we studied, by use of positron emission tomography (PET) and the H2(15)O bolus technique, changes in the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) induced by monocular visual stimulation of 8 individuals with this disorder. Individual amblyopic thresholds for monocular detection of the checkerboard pattern were employed as stimuli for both eyes during PET scans. Statistical analysis of subtracted images showed significant increases in rCBF (P < 0.05) by the stimulation of the sound eye localized bilaterally to Brodmann's areas (BAs) 17-19. The cortical response evoked by the amblyopic eye was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) in the ipsilateral BAs 18, 19. These results suggest that the reduction in contrast sensitivity (pattern vision) in amblyopia is coupled with deactivation in identifiable regions of occipital visual areas, including ipsilateral BAs 18,19.
