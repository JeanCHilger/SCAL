Achieving sustained improvement in myocardial perfusion: role of isosorbide mononitrate. The efficacy of antianginal agents in the treatment of patients with chronic stable angina has traditionally been evaluated by performance measures, such as the exercise treadmill test (ETT). Although reliable and reproducible, ETT is not a sensitive measure of changes in myocardial ischemia. The effects of antianginal agents on coronary blood flow and myocardial perfusion have been less frequently studied. Angiographic studies have demonstrated that nitrates may operate by preferentially directing blood flow to ischemic regions of the myocardium. These investigations have been limited, however, by the invasive nature of the evaluation. Measurements of regional myocardial perfusion may also be made with noninvasive tests. Both quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) have been employed, but few studies have used these techniques to assess the effects of antianginal drugs (in general) and nitrates (in particular) on changes in reversible myocardial perfusion defects. Studies that have evaluated the direct effects of nitrate treatment on coronary blood flow and myocardial perfusion defects in patients with chronic stable angina are reviewed, and preliminary data from a study of the effects of long-term nitrate treatment on myocardial perfusion are discussed.
