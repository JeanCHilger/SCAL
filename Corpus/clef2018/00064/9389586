The basic pattern of activation in motor and sensory temporal tasks: positron emission tomography data. Positron emission tomography (PET) data were obtained from subjects performing a synchronization task (target duration 2700 ms). A conjunction analysis was run to identify areas prominently activated both in this task and in a temporal generalization task (target duration 700 ms) used previously. The common pattern of activation included the right prefrontal, inferior parietal and anterior cingulate cortex, the left putamen and the left cerebellar hemisphere. These areas are assumed to play a major role in time processing, in relation to attention and memory mechanisms.
