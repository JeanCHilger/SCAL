99m-Tc-MIBI SPECT parathyroid gland scintigraphy for the preoperative localization of small parathyroid gland adenomas. It was the of this study to assess the value of the 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy in SPECT technique in the preoperative lateral location of small parathyroid adenoma (PTA).25 consecutive patients (8 male, 17 female, mean age 63 +/- 13 years) with the established diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism and non-diagnostic ultrasonography were scanned preoperatively. After a thyroid examination to exclude radionuclide accumulating thyroid adenoma, planar and tomographic images were acquired 20 min. and 120 min. after i.v. injection of 740 MBq 99mTc-MIBI using a 3 head gamma camera (Picker Prism 3000). The first 10 patients underwent an additional 201Tl/99mTc subtraction scintigraphy in a 2 days protocol.All patients had small, solitary PTA (< 1 g). 201Tl/99mTc subtraction scintigraphy (n = 10) showed only a sensitivity of 50%. Using planar MIBI-scintigraphy lateral location of PTA was possible in 18 cases (sensitivity: 72%). There was an increase in sensitivity up to 96% using the SPECT technique and the 3D display (volume-rendered reprojection).In contrast to 201Tl/99mTc subtraction scintigraphy, which showed only a low sensitivity, a reliable lateral location of small PTA was obtained using the tomographic 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy. This method offers e.g. the possibility for the surgeon to perform an unilateral parathyroidectomy.
