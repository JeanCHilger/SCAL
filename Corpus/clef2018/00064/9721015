Functional analysis of cGMP-dependent protein kinases I and II as mediators of NO/cGMP effects. NO and cGMP have emerged as important signal transduction mediators of the effects of certain hormones, inter-/intracellular signals, toxins and drugs. However, a major challenge is to define relevant criteria for determining which of the many NO and/or cGMP effects are dependent on cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cGKs). Important criteria include that: (1) the cell types/tissues investigated contain at least one form of cGK which is activated by the cGMP-elevating agent in the intact cell system (2) specific activators/inhibitors of cGKs mimic/block the effects of cGMP-elevating agents in the intact cell system
