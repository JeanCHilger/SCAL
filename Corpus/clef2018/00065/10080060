3-phase bone scintigraphy of microsurgically attached bone transplants as early graft survival assessment. Vascularized bone grafts do not allow direct graft monitoring during the early postoperative period. The first two weeks are critical for the blood supply and viability of the graft. Three-phase bone scintigraphy, performed between the 7th and 14th postoperative day, was valuable in predicting the survival of vascularized bone grafts. It is a simple and safe method for the evaluation of blood supply of both the graft and the graft-surrounding tissue. Clinical data, obtained from studying 17 patients,/led to the conclusion that three-phase bone scintigraphy plays an important role in the process of decision-making on surgical reexploration.
