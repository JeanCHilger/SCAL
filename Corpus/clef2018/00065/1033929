A serologic survey of a population of Georgia dogs for Brucella canis and an evaluation of the slide agglutination test. In a serologic survey of stray and pet dog populations of Georgia, serums were screened for Brucella canis antibodies, using the slide agglutination test. If results were positive, B canis antibody titers were determined, using the standard tube agglutination test. The stray dogs had significantly (P less than 0.01) higher titers than did the pet dogs. The reactor rate was 58% higher for the slide agglutination test than for the tube agglutination test. The manufacturer's  evaluation of the slide agglutination test was based on a comparison of the serologic results of that test with those of the tube agglutination test, using a comparative method that permitted the results to be interpreted as 99% agreement between the 2 tests. Reevaluation of the manufacturer's data by a different method indicated that the slide agglutination test is very accurate when the results are negative (99.7% specific) but less so when the results are positive (62.5% sensitive).
