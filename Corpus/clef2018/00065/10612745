The SUN family of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: the double knock-out of UTH1 and SIM1 promotes defects in nucleus migration and increased drug sensitivity. UTH1 and SIM1 are two of four 'SUN' genes (SIM1, UTH1, NCA3 and SUN4/SCW3) whose products are involved in different cellular processes such as DNA replication, lifespan, mitochondrial biogenesis or cell septation. UTH1 or SIM1 inactivation did not affect cell growth, shape or nuclear migration, whereas the double null mutant presented phenotypes of numerous binucleate cells and benomyl sensitivity, suggesting that microtubule function could be altered the uth1Deltasim1Delta strain also presented defects which could be related to the Ras/cAMP pathway: pet phenotype, heat shock sensitivity, inability to store glycogen, sensitivity to starvation and failure of spores to germinate. These observations suggested that Uth1p could be involved as a connection step between pathways controlling growth and those controlling division.
