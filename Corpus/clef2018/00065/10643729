Updating working memory for words: a PET activation study. A PET study of 10 normal individuals was carried out to investigate the cerebral regions involved in the controlled updating of verbal working memory. Subjects viewed single concrete words on a computer monitor and detected occasional target words in an attended color. In the activating condition, a target was defined as a word that was identical to the previous word presented in the attended color. In the control condition, the target was a predesignated word. The same word lists, target probabilities, and target response demands were used for both conditions, with interword intervals constrained to ensure equivalence in the demand for target rehearsal. A comparison of the conditions found bilateral activation of dorsolateral prefrontal (middle frontal gyrus MFG) and inferior parietal (supramarginal gyrus
