55Co-EDTA for renal imaging using positron emission tomography (PET): a feasibility study. The feasibility of imaging renal function with 55Co-ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and dynamic positron emission tomography was investigated. A group of normal Wistar rats was injected intravenously with 55Co-EDTA and underwent dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in order to study the biodistribution. The time-activity curves of the heart (blood pool), both kidneys, liver, and bladder were observed. In two animals, blood and urinary clearances of 55Co-EDTA were compared with those for 51Cr-EDTA. In one animal, unilateral reduction in kidney function was induced and the right/left ratio for the kidneys was determined. The time-activity curves showed that 55Co-EDTA cleared rapidly from the blood pool (heart), whereas prompt and high target-to-background ratios for both kidneys were obtained. The entire tracer was cleared from the renal parenchyma by urinary excretion and collection of the activity in the bladder. No specific activity uptake was noticed in any other organ or tissue. The clearances of 55Co-EDTA and 51Cr-EDTA in blood were not significantly different, showing that the nature of the M++ has no influence on the in vivo behavior of EDTA. 55Co can be produced easily by cyclotron irradiation and 55Co-EDTA is a promising physiological tracer for nephrological research using PET.
