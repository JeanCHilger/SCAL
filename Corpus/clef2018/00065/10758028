Morphologic classification of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with myocardial single photon emission tomography. Comparison with echocardiographic classification. The aim of this study was to compare different morphologic types of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy obtained by single photon emission tomography to those obtained by echocardiogram.In 76 (64%) out of 119 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the echocardiogram permitted an optimal visualization of all left ventricular segments in the short axis view and consequent classification to one of the six morphological types: type I (septal anterior hypertrophy), type II (septal anterior and septal posterior hypertrophy), type III (septal and antero-lateral hypertrophy), type IV (antero-lateral and/or septal posterior hypertrophy), type V (concentric hypertrophy) and type VI (apical hypertrophy). Without knowledge of echo data, two experienced observers included the short axis of single photon emission tomography images at rest (99mTc-tetrofosmin) to one of those types.Global concordance between echocardiogram and single photon emission tomography was 75%. Type III was the most frequent both in echo (76%) and in single photon emission tomography (74%) and type III produced the majority of discrepancies. SPET identified 4 patients with a predominant septal and inferior hypertrophy, that did not correspond to any of the 6 types of echocardiographic classification and had been previously classified as type III by echo in 3 cases and as type V in 1 case.There was agreement between echo and single photon emission tomography in the morphological classification of most of the patients (75%) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Nevertheless, some discrepancies were observed for the type III echocardiogram.
