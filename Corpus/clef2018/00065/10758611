A comparison of 99Tcm-MDP and 99Tcm-MIBI in the detection of breast cancer. In this study, we made an intra-individual comparison of the uptake of 99Tcm-MDP and 99Tcm-MIBI in breast cancer. Twenty women with large breast masses (one dimension > or = 3 cm on mammography) underwent SPET in the supine position with both agents. All transverse sections demonstrating tumour activity were added together and the net (total) tumour uptake in a region of interest was compared to that of surrounding tissue activity (background). We also evaluated maximum tumour uptake versus background activity. Tumour uptake was observed in all examinations. In contrast to MIBI, eight MDP examinations showed increased uptake in normal breast parenchyma in addition to tumour uptake. There was no significant difference in net tumour uptake between the two tracers and non-parenchymal (indifferent) background activity, but the maximum tumour activity of MIBI was significantly higher than that of MDP. In the eight MDP examinations with parenchymal activity, mammograms were required to identify tumour uptake correctly. In conclusion, MDP may provide similar images to MIBI in postmenopausal women not receiving hormone replacement therapy. For other patients, MIBI gives better tumour depiction.
