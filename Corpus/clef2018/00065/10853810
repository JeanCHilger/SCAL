O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine and L-[methyl-11C]methionine uptake in brain tumours: initial results of a comparative study. O-(2-[18F]Fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) is a recently described amino acid analogue that has shown high accumulation in animal tumours. The aim of this study was to compare the uptake of FET with that of L-[methyl-11C]methionine (MET) in patients with suspected primary or recurrent intracerebral tumours. Sixteen consecutive patients with intracerebral lesions were studied on the same day by positron emission tomography (PET) using MET and FET. Uptake of FET and MET was quantified by standardized uptake values. Tracer kinetics for normal brain and intracerebral lesions were compared. On the basis of the MET-PET studies, viable tumour tissue was found in 13 patients. All tumours showed rapid uptake of FET and were visualized with high contrast. Mean uptake of FET for normal grey matter, white matter and tumour tissue was 1.1+/-0.2, 0.8+/-0.2 and 2.7+/-0.8 SUV, respectively. In all three tissues, uptake of MET was slightly higher (1.4+/-0.2, 0.9+/-0.1 and 3.3+/-1.0 SUV P<0.01). However, contrast between tumour and normal tissues was not significantly different between MET and FET. Uptake of FET in non-neoplastic lesions (1.0+/-0.1 SUV) was significantly lower than in tumour tissue (P = 0.007). For all lesions there was a close correlation (r = 0.98) between MET and FET uptake. In conclusion, in PET studies of human brain tumours, the uptake and image contrast of FET appear to be very similar to those of MET. The specificity of FET for tumour tissue is promising but has to be addressed in a larger series of patients with non-neoplastic lesions.
