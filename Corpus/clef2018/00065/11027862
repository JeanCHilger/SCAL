Control of fleas on naturally infested dogs and cats and in private residences with topical spot applications of fipronil or imidacloprid. Thirty-four flea-infested dogs and cats residing in 20 homes in Tampa, FL were randomly placed into 1 of 2 treatment groups during the summer of 1997. Pets were treated topically with either 10.0%w/v imidacloprid or 10%w/v fipronil spot-on on day 0, then once for every 28-30 days for 90 days. Flea populations were assessed in the environment using an intermittent-light trap, while pet flea burdens were assessed using visual area counts. A single application of imidacloprid was 95.3 and 97.4% effective in reducing flea populations on pets at 7 and 28 days, respectively. A single application of fipronil was 97.5 and 97.0% effective in reducing flea populations on pets at the same time points. Following 3 monthly applications of either imidacloprid or fipronil, flea burdens on pets were reduced by 99.5 and 96.5%, respectively. In addition, flea numbers in the in-home environment were reduced by 99. 0 and 98.6% in homes, where pets were treated with imidacloprid or fipronil, respectively.
