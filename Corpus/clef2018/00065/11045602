Increased activity of the temporal insula in subjects with bradycardia. Though it has been postulated that cortical brain regions participate in the regulation of heart rate, their involvement is poorly understood. Using PET and [18] FDG (to measure regional brain glucose metabolism, which serves as an index of brain function) we compared the regional brain metabolic activity between healthy subjects with bradycardia (<60 beats per minute) with those with normal heart rates in the 75-100 beats per minute range. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) analyses revealed significant differences between the groups predominantly localized to the temporal insula. This finding was corroborated by a separate analysis that measured the metabolic activity for each subject in preselected regions located in the temporal insula. Subjects with bradycardia had significantly higher metabolic activity in the right (p < 0.0001) and in the left temporal insula (p < 0.015) than those with normal heart rates. Moreover, resting heart rates were negatively correlated with metabolism in the right (r = -0.77, p < 0.0001) and in the left temporal insula (r = -0.44, p < 0.05). These results corroborate the importance of the temporal insula in the regulation of resting heart rate in humans. The temporal insula is interconnected with limbic brain region and autonomic centers and suggests that this may be a mechanism by which emotional responses regulate heart rate.
