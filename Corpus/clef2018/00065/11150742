Methodology for measuring in vitro/ex vivo cardiac energy metabolism. The high energy demands of the heart are met primarily by the metabolism of fatty acids and carbohydrates. These energy substrates are efficiently and rapidly metabolized in order to produce the high levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) necessary to sustain both contractile activity and other cellular functions. Alterations in energy metabolism contribute to abnormal heart function in many cardiac diseases. As a result, a number of techniques have been developed to directly measure energy metabolism in the heart in order to study energy metabolism. Two important variables that must be considered when making these measurements are energy substrate supply to the heart and the metabolic demand of the heart (i.e. contractile function). The use of the in vitro/ex vivo heart, perfused with relevant energy substrates, is a useful experimental approach that accounts for these variables. This paper overviews a number of the techniques that are used to measure energy substrate metabolism in the isolated perfused heart. Recently developed technology that allows for the direct measurement of energy metabolism in an isolated working mouse heart preparation are also described.
