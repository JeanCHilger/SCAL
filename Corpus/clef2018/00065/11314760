Assessment of left ventricular function by 201Tl SPECT using left ventricular cavity-to-myocardium count ratio. Equilibrium radionuclide angiography (ERNA) is the 'gold standard' for assessing left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The aim of the study was to determine whether the left ventricular cavity-to-myocardium count ratio (LVCMR) from 201Tl myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) correlated with LVEF assessed by ERNA. The study group included 159 consecutive patients (117 male, 42 female), aged 59+/-12 years, who underwent both 201Tl SPECT and ERNA at rest on the same day. The LVCMR was calculated from a mid-ventricular short axis slice on redistribution studies, using two regions of interest (ROIs). One ROI was placed in the centre of the left ventricular cavity (C) and the other was placed in the myocardium with maximum uptake (Mmax): LVCMR= (C/Mmax) x 100. The correlation between LVCMR and LVEF was r = 0.85 (y = 0.943x+5.002 P < 0.0001). The mean calculated values +/- 1 SD were LVCMR=54+/-16% and LVEF=52+/-15%. In conclusion, LVCMR from 201Tl SPECT studies was closely correlated with LVEF from ERNA studies and can be used to easily and rapidly estimate left ventricular function.
