Tomographic studies of myocardial perfusion normality with 99m Tc-Tetrofosmin. Spanish multicenter study. This objective of this study was to obtain a pool of Myocardial Perfusion SPECTs with a 99mTetrofosmin stress/rest one day protocol in normal volunteers having a less than or equal to 5% likelihood of coronary artery disease that represents normalcy in the Spanish population. A total of 169 volunteers from 15 hospitals were studied. The volunteers were divided into 5 groups: Groups 1, 2 or 3 corresponding to men < 30 years (n = 33), men between 30 and 50 years (n = 32), or men > 50 years (n = 31) Groups 4 or 5: premenopausal (n = 38) or postmenopausal women (n = 35). A clinical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory parameters, echocardiography and a symptom limited exercise stress test were performed in all of them and had to be normal. The mean likelihood of coronary artery disease was 1.15 +/- 1.07%.Twenty-four segments were analyzed in each study and were classified into 5 grades of uptake (1 = normal, 2, 3, 4 = mild, moderate or severe defect and 5 = no uptake). Defects were then analyzed according to sex and location. Considering the stress and rest studies separately (8,112 segments), only 19 moderate and 75 mild defects were found, these corresponding to 16 volunteers, with more inferior defects in men and anterior defects in women. These data validate the normalcy of our population. A pool of Myocardial Perfusion SPECTs with a 99mTetrofosmin stress/rest one day protocol in normal volunteers that represents Spanish normal values was obtained.
