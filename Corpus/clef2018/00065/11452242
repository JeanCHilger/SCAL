Levodopa pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and 6-[18F]levodopa positron emission tomography in patients with Parkinson's disease. Parameters of a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model of levodopa have been claimed to reflect the magnitude of the dopaminergic deficit in patients with Parkinson's disease. The aim of this study was to correlate such parameters with positron emission tomography (PET) with levodopa tagged with 6-fluorine 18, an established imaging method for striatal dopaminergic neurons.Twenty-three patients in different disease stages (Hoehm and Yahr stage 2.5-5 [Hoehn MM, Yahr MD. Parkinsonism: onset, progression and mortality. Neurology 19674:427-42](1) A significant correlation was observed between PK-PD parameters or with k(c) putamen as the dependent variable and the duration of the disease as the independent variable, which explains 33% of the variability of the EC(50), 42% of the variability of T(eq), and 36% of the variability of k(c). (2) Significant correlations were observed between k(c) and either EC(50) or T(eq), yielding the closest correlation for the putamen region (r = -0.47, P <.05 and r = 0.55, P <.01Our findings show that key parameters of a PK-PD model of levodopa were in fairly close agreement with imaging of dopaminergic neurons by 6-[18F]levodopa PET. However, although PK-PD modeling of levodopa has been proven as a useful investigation of approaches aimed to restore dopaminergic deficits or to monitor disease progression, this modeling cannot serve as a pathomorphologic surrogate for the loss of striatal dopaminergic neurons.
