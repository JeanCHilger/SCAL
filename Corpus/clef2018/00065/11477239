Whole-body 18F dopa PET for detection of gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors. To evaluate fluorine 18 (18F) dopa positron emission tomography (PET) in comparison with established imaging procedures in gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors.After evaluation of the normal distribution of 18F dopa, 17 patients with histologically confirmed tumors were examined with 18F dopa PET. Results of 2-[fluorine 18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET, somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy, and morphologic imaging (computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging) were available for all patients. Results of the procedures were evaluated by two radiologists and two nuclear medicine specialists, whose consensus based on all available histologic, imaging, and follow-up findings was used as the reference standard.Ninety-two tumors were diagnosed: eight primary tumors, 47 lymph node metastases, and 37 organ metastases. 18F dopa PET led to 60 true-positive findings (seven primary tumors, 41 lymph node metastases, 12 organ metastases) FDG PET, 27 (two primary tumors, 14 lymph node metastases, 11 organ metastases)18F dopa PET is a promising procedure and useful supplement to morphologic methods in diagnostic imaging of gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors.
