Endocrine tumours of the pancreas: review and recent advances. Pancreatic endocrine tumours (PET) are rare but nonetheless important to recognize and treat in a timely fashion. Significant morbidity occurs due to excess secretion of hormones, with all of the PET having some degree of malignant potential. Surgeons must plan directed operative strategies to deal with these tumours and be prepared to undertake aggressive palliative debulking resections if indicated. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and endoscopic ultrasound have been particularly helpful in both localizing and staging patients with PET. Other important advances in management include the use of long-acting somatostatin analogues to inhibit hormonal secretion and tumour growth. The possibility of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) should be considered in any patient with a PET. The present article will review the various classes of PET, describe MEN-1 in relation to PET and examine advances in imaging and localization. The role of surgery for PET is also discussed in the present review.
