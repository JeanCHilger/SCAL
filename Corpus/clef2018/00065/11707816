Positron emission tomography in lymphoma: comparison with computed tomography and Gallium-67 single photon emission computed tomography. With the advent of positron emission tomography (PET), metabolic imaging has become a reality for tumor staging and monitoring response to therapy in lymphoma. Increased Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) uptake in lymphomas has been well documented in the literature it is based upon elevated glycolysis and longer residence time of FDG in malignant cells compared to most normal tissues. This suggests that in tumor staging, FDG-PET may be more sensitive and specific than the anatomic imaging modalities. Computed tomography (CT) is the standard imaging modality for the staging and restaging of lymphoma, and Gallium-67 ((67)Ga) scintigraphy has played an important role in monitoring response to therapy and follow-up of patients. Published results suggest that FDG-PET is superior to (67)Ga imaging and may be equal or superior to CT for the detection of nodal as well as extranodal involvement in lymphoma.
