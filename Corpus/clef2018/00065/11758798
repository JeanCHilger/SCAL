Presence of a pet dog and human cardiovascular responses to mild mental stress. The mechanisms underlying the possible cardiovascular benefits of pet ownership have not been established. Using a randomized design, the effect of a friendly dog on cardiovascular and autonomic responses to acute, mild mental stress was investigated. Seventy-two subjects (aged 40 +/- 14 y mean +/- SD) participated. Rest was alternated with mental stress during four 10-minute periods. An unknown dog was randomly selected to be present during the first or the second half of the study. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored continuously and cardiac autonomic function assessed using spectral analysis of heart period. Heart period variability data were expressed as the ratio of 0.1 Hz to respiratory or high frequency variation (LF/HF). Whereas mental stress significantly increased BP and HR in the absence of the dog (from 125/71 +/- 3/2 to 133/75 +/- 3/2 mm Hg
