Myocardial fatty acid imaging with 123I-BMIPP in patients with chronic right ventricular pressure overload: clinical significance of reduced uptake in interventricular septum. Regionally reduced 123I-BMIPP uptake in the interventricular septum (SEP) is observed in some patients with chronic right ventricular (RV) pressure overload. We studied the significance of this finding by comparing it with mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP). 123I-BMIPP SPECT imaging was carried out in 21 patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH 51(+)-14 years
