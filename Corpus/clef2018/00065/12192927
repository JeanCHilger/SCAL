Radioimmunoguided surgery (R.I.G.S.) in colorectal cancer. Preliminary results. The authors describe their experience in utilizing 'ArcitumoMab' and radioimmunoguided surgery in a group of patients with localized and advanced colorectal cancer. Twenty-one patients were studied who were found to be positive to 'ArcitumoMab'. Immunoscintigraphy was obtained in 95% of cases. Radioimmunoguided surgery was performed in all cases. One case, which was negative at immunoscintigraphy, was found to be positive intraoperatively when radioimmunoguided surgery was performed. Radioimmunoguided surgery, in the authors' view, is a useful technique but needs to be validated in larger samples, particularly in cases of relapse.
