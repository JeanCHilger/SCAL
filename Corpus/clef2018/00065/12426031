Reversed hemispheric asymmetry during simple visual perception in schizophrenia. Processing of sensory information in the human brain progresses from primary areas, dedicated to a single sensory feature, to multimodal areas, which integrate many features across sensory modalities. For some of these processes hemispheric dominance has developed. Here we report the results of a passive viewing task using positron emission tomography. Subjects were scanned twice while staring at a stationary visual noise pattern. Normal subjects showed a significant reduction of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in a distributed right hemisphere network of brain regions during the second visual task. Schizophrenic subjects, however, showed significant increases of right hemisphere rCBF during the second visual task and showed significant decreases only in the left hemisphere. These results are consistent with the notion of reversed hemispheric asymmetry during the processing of sensory information in schizophrenia.
