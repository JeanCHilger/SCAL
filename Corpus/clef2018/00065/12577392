Study on effect of shenmai injection in protecting myocardium against ischemia-reperfusion injury in thrombolytic therapy with urokinase for acute myocardial infarction patients evaluated by 99mTc-MIBI myocardial imaging. To evaluate the myocardial protecting effect of Shenmai injection (SMI) against ischemia/reperfusion injury in thrombolytic therapy with urokinase (UK) for acute myocardial infarction patients by 99mTc-MIBI myocardial imaging (SPECT).Five hundred and thirty-seven patients were randomly divided into two groups. The SMI group (n = 292) was treated with thrombolytic treatment plus SMI and the control group (n = 245) with thrombolytic treatment only. Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) was carried out on the 7th day after thrombolysis to determine the ischemic myocardial area (IMA) and ejection fraction (EF) in both groups and compared.The reperfusion rate of infarction related area (IRA) in the two groups was not different significantly (72.26% vs 72.65%, P > 0.05). The IMA in patients of the SMI group, no matter with or without reperfused IRA (211 cases and 81 cases) respectively, was significantly lower than that in the control group (178 cases and 67 cases) respectively, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 respectively. The EF value in the SMI group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.01).Using SMI in early stage of thrombolytic treatment in acute myocardial infarction could significantly reduce IMA and increase EF. SMI showed good protective effect against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in thrombolytic treatment.
