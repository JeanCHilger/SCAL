PET imaging-based evaluation of aerosol drugs and their delivery devices: nasal and pulmonary studies. Three-dimensional (3-D) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of inhaled radiolabeled aerosol in the nasal or pulmonary regions provides an in vivo measurement of drug distribution using the drug itself as the tracer. Repeated or dynamic PET scans over the time after inhalation provides us with further information about the fate of the deposited drug. These quantitative measurements are sufficient to describe the performance of a drug or device and they are obtained in a noninvasive fashion, which cannot be achieved by using any other methods. Using this PET-imaging paradigm, we conducted a sequence of drug studies to evaluate the performance of aerosol drugs and delivery devices to compare the performance of similar drugs from different manufacturers
