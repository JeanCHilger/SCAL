Regional myocardial perfusion defects during exercise, as assessed by three dimensional integration of morphology and function, in relation to abnormal endothelium dependent vasoreactivity of the coronary microcirculation. To test the hypothesis that scintigraphic regional myocardial perfusion defects during exercise in patients with normal coronary angiography may be related to abnormal endothelium dependent vasoreactivity of the corresponding myocardial territory in response to cold pressor testing.38 patients were classified into two groups according to the presence or absence of exercise induced scintigraphic myocardial perfusion defects. A cold pressor test was done in all patients during routine coronary angiography, followed by dynamic positron emission tomography to establish coronary blood flow mediated vasoreactivity of the epicardial coronary artery and the myocardial territories supplied by the left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary arteries.28 patients had regional myocardial perfusion defects while 10 had normal scintigraphic imaging. The three dimensional scintigraphic fusion image revealed 49 regional myocardial perfusion defects with a mean (SD) reversibility of the original stress defect of 20 (3)%. In patients with exercise induced regional myocardial perfusion defects, the responses of epicardial luminal area and regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) to cold pressor testing were reduced compared with patients with normal perfusion imaging (epicardial luminal area: 5.2 (1.2) to 4.2 (0.86) mm2 v 4.7 (0.5) to 5.8 (0.5) mm2 RMBF: 0.75 (0.16) to 0.78 (0.20) ml/g/min v 0.75 (0.15) to 1.38 (0.26) ml/g/minExercise induced scintigraphic regional myocardial perfusion defects in patients with angina but normal coronary angiography may be related to abnormal endothelium dependent vasoreactivity of the corresponding myocardial territory.
