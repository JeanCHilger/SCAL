Neuroprotection in hypothermia linked to redistribution of oxygen in brain. Hypothermia improves the outcome of acute ischemic stroke, traumatic injury, and inflammation of brain tissue. We tested the hypothesis that hypothermia reduces the energy metabolism of brain tissue to a level that is commensurate with the prevailing blood flow and hence allows adequate distribution of oxygen to the entire tissue. To determine the effect of 32 degrees C hypothermia on brain tissue, we measured the sequential changes of physiological variables by means of PET in pigs. Cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption (cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen) declined to 50% of the baseline in 3 and 5 h, respectively, thus elevating the oxygen extraction fraction to 140% of the baseline at 3 h. The results are consistent with the claim that cooling of the brain to 32 degrees C couples both energy metabolism and blood flow to a lower rate of work of the entire tissue.
