Effect of antianginal medication on resting myocardial perfusion and pharmacologically induced hyperemia. Patients scheduled for myocardial perfusion imaging are often taking several antianginal drugs. There is presently no consensus concerning a regimen of discontinuation before either rest or pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion imaging. Whether antianginal treatment affects diagnostic sensitivity and specificity is not well documented. Methods and results The effect of the three most commonly used antianginal drugs (nitroglycerin, 400 microg [NTG] metoprolol, 50 mg [MET]Antianginal medication can alter both resting and hyperemic myocardial perfusion and might affect the ability to detect flow-limiting stenosis. NTG increases perfusion, MET reduces perfusion, and AML does not affect perfusion. Larger-scale trials are warranted to establish a consensus for optimal antianginal medication for patients undergoing perfusion imaging.
