Comparison of three different purification methods for the routine preparation of [11C] Metomidate. PET with (R)-[O-methyl-11C] metomidate ([11C] MTO) is an attractive method for the characterisation of adrenal masses discriminating lesions of adrenal cortical origin from noncortical lesions. [11C] MTO was prepared by the reaction of [11C] methyliodide with the corresponding free acid. Three purification methods have been compared. The method of choice uses preparative HPLC with a ready-to-use weak acidic solvent.
