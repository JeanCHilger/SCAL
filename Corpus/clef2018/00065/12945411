Characterization of the structure of industrial poly(ethylene terephthalate) fibers by polarized FTIR. The polarized FTIR was applied to characterize the structure of Poly(Ethylene Terephthalate) (PET) yarn for industrial use. The fractions of trans and gauche conformers, the orientation of PET chain in the amorphous region and the overall molecular orientation of the samples, have been determined. The structure development during the process has been revealed.
