Value of MRI and MIBG-I123 scintigraphy in the diagnosis of spinal bone marrow involvement in neuroblastoma in children. The results of MRI and MIBG scintigraphy performed on the spine of 14 children with neuroblastoma are reported. In 6 cases of diffuse spinal bone marrow tumor infiltration, diagnosis is easier with MIBG scintigraphy than with MRI. In 5 cases, MRI detected hyposignal of the vertebral body without any spinal abnormality on MIBG scintigraphy. A discussion of the reasons for negative MIBG scintigraphy is presented and in these 5 cases, it is suggested that a lateral view of MIBG scintigraphy and HMDP-Tc99m scintigraphy may be performed, even vertebral body biopsy in order to assess bone marrow tumoral infiltration.
