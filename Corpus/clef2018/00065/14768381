Wound healing and management in psittacine birds. Psittacines and other companion avian species often develop wounds requiring some form of medical or surgical therapy. Advancing technology in the field of wound care and management continues to evolve for use by the veterinary clinician. Although not all wounds can be successfully treated, many can be reduced and minimized with therapy. Consideration of the overall health, management, and nutrition of the avian patient will also aid in wound management. The avian patient with normal immune function and optimal nutrition will have improved wound healing compared with an immunocompromized or malnourished patient. The duration of treatment and potential stress of the wound-management program should also be taken into consideration when selecting a treatment program for the avian patient.
