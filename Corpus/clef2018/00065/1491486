Diagnostic value of a new myocardial perfusion agent, 99mTc-teboroxime (SQ30,217) in patients with coronary artery disease, utilizing a SPECT imaging protocol: a multicenter phase III clinical trial. Technetium-99m teboroxime (TEBO) is a new technetium-based myocardial perfusion imaging agent, which has high myocardial extraction and rapid myocardial washout. Its rapid myocardial washout may necessitate rapid imaging protocols. This study was designed to perform exercise/rest SPECT imaging protocols with rapid data acquisition (from 2.8 +/- 1.4 min to 11.2 +/- 4.1 min after injection) in 171 patients with coronary artery disease, 15 patients with cardiomyopathy and 8 patients with other heart disease. The rapid imaging protocols resulted in a high prevalence of good image quality. The diagnostic value of TEBO was recognized from the high concordance of image findings with thallium-201 (201Tl) scintigraphy, 88.2% in the exercise protocol and 89.9% in the rest protocol. Also, the sensitivity and specificity of TEBO for detecting coronary artery disease were comparable (86.6% and 53.9%, respectively) with those of 201Tl (90.7% and 46.2%, respectively). No toxic effects of TEBO were observed in subjective and objective clinical findings and blood examinations. TEBO was finally evaluated to be useful in 98.4% of the patients. Thus, this agent has good clinical potential for myocardial perfusion imaging.
