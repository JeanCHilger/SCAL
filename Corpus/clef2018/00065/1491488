Usefulness of 99mTc-ECD SPECT in diseases of the central nerve system: special reference to a comparison with 123I-IMP and 99mTc-HM-PAO SPECT. The usefulness of a new cerebral perfusion imaging radiopharmaceutical, 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD), was clinically evaluated. The subjects of this study were 14 patients with neurological disorders including 10 patients with cerebral infarction and 4 patients with other diseases. A total of 15 examinations was performed. 99mTc-HM-PAO or 123I-IMP SPECTs were performed simultaneously, and the findings from those examinations were compared with 99mTc-ECD. As to the count ratio of lesions to normal area (L/N), the L/N ratio in severe ischemic patients was lower in 99mTc-ECD than in 99mTc-HM-PAO or 123I-IMP. In mild ischemic patients, on the other hand, the L/N ratio was the lowest in 123I-IMP. When the relationship between rCBFs obtained from 123I-IMP and the values of L/N in 99mTc-ECD or 99mTc-HM-PAO was compared, the values of L/N in 99mTc-ECD or 99mTc-HM-PAO were found to have decreased linearity with increasing rCBF. In a patient showing luxury perfusion, the accumulation pattern of 99mTc-ECD was different from that of the other two radiopharmaceuticals, and focal defect was revealed in 99mTc-ECD SPECT. On the dynamic SPECT of 99mTc-ECD in a patient with meningioma, the tumor showed a change from high to low perfusion with the passage of time. This finding indicated that care should be taken in the evaluation of accumulation of 99mTc-ECD. Therefore, 99mTc-ECD was found to be useful as a cerebral perfusion agent. In addition, as accumulation of 99mTc-ECD might somehow reflect metabolism in some cases, further careful investigation of many cases should be carried out.
