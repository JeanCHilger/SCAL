Time course of tumor metabolic activity during chemoradiotherapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and response to treatment. To evaluate the time course of therapy-induced changes in tumor glucose use during chemoradiotherapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and to correlate the reduction of metabolic activity with histopathologic tumor response and patient survival.Thirty-eight patients with histologically proven intrathoracic ESCC (cT3, cN0/+, cM0) scheduled to undergo a 4-week course of preoperative simultaneous chemoradiotherapy followed by esophagectomy were included. Patients underwent positron emission tomography with the glucose analog fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) before therapy (n = 38), after 2 weeks of initiation of therapy (n = 27), and preoperatively (3 to 4 weeks after chemoradiotherapy n = 38). Tumor metabolic activity was quantitatively assessed by standardized uptake values (SUVs). Results Mean tumor FDG uptake before therapy was 9.3 +/- 2.8 SUV and decreased to 5.7 +/- 1.9 SUV 14 days after initiation of chemoradiotherapy (-38% +/- 18%Changes in tumor metabolic activity after 14 days of preoperative chemoradiotherapy are significantly correlated with tumor response and patient survival. This suggests that FDG-PET might be used to identify nonresponders early during neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, allowing for early modifications of the treatment protocol.
