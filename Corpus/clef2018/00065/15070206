Non-stationary convolution subtraction scatter correction with a dual-exponential scatter kernel for the Hamamatsu SHR-7700 animal PET scanner. A spatially variant convolution subtraction scatter correction was developed for a Hamamatsu SHR-7700 animal PET scanner. This scanner, with retractable septa and a gantry that can be tilted 90 degrees, was designed for studies of conscious monkeys. The implemented dual-exponential scatter kernel takes into account both radiation scattered inside the object and radiation scattered in gantry and detectors. This is necessary because of the relatively large contribution of gantry and detector scatter in this scanner. The correction is used for scatter correction of emission as well as transmission data. Transmission scatter correction using the dual-exponential kernel leads to a measured attenuation coefficient of 0.096 cm(-1) in water, compared to 0.089 cm(-1) without scatter correction. Scatter correction on both emission and transmission data resulted in a residual correction error of 2.1% in water, as well as improved image contrast and hot spot quantification.
