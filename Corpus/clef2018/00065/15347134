Thallium-201 SPECT and low-dose dobutamine stress cine MRI for predicting functional recovery of regional myocardial contraction in patients with myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic performances of Tl-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and dobutamine stress cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting functional recovery of regional myocardial contraction in patients after myocardial infarction.Twenty patients underwent Tl-201 SPECT and MRI 3-4 weeks after onset of myocardial infarction. Cine MR images were acquired in the resting state and during dobutamine stress. Tl-201 uptake and systolic wall thickening (SWT) on cine MRI were analyzed on short-axis images by using a 14-segment model. Follow-up cine MR images were obtained 187.1+/-33.5 days after onset.The averaged Tl-201 uptake in 54 segments with impaired SWT was 47%+/-20%, being significantly lower than that in 226 segments with preserved SWT (75%+/-18% p<0.0001). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of dobutamine MRI and Tl-201 SPECT for predicting preserved SWT after 6 months were 89% vs. 80%, not significant (NS)Both SPECT and dobutamine MRI showed excellent sensitivity for predicting myocardial viability in all left ventricular segments. Decreased specificity of SPECT in the inferior and posterolateral segments resulted in lower overall specificity in comparison with dobutamine MRI.
