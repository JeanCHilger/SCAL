A performance study of 3D reconstruction algorithms for positron emission tomography. This paper investigates the statistical and systematic accuracy of five three-dimensional reconstruction algorithms for multi-ring PET scanners operated without septa: the reprojection method, the direct Fourier reconstruction, the FAVOR algorithm, and the single-slice and multi-slice rebinning algorithms. Simulated data of a uniform cylinder, of Gaussian sources, and of spherical sources are used to compare respectively the noise properties, the modulation transfer function, and the recovery coefficients of the algorithms. Brain scans reconstructed with the different algorithms are compared by calculating the linear regression of the mean values within regions of interest. The most significant observations are a slight loss of transaxial resolution with the reprojection algorithm in the external slices of the scanner, and increased noise in the images reconstructed using multi-slice rebinning.
