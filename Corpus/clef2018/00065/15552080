Quantitation in SPECT using an effective model of the scattering. A new method for correcting simultaneously the attenuation, scatter and resolution effects in SPECT has been developed for the case of a homogeneous medium. It is based on an effective model of the scatter process. This model depends on only four parameters which are determined experimentally and remain independent of the geometry and of the dimensions of the scatter medium. The method uses the data from the peak events and does not need additional energy windows on the scattered events. An original filter is proposed to remove the noise due to the poor statistics of clinical data. Tests on phantoms varying in size and activity show that the model allows absolute activity determination with an accuracy of a few per cent.
