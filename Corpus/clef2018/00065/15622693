Pattern and factors affecting the outcome of pregnancy in hypertensive patients. The pattern and factors affecting the outcome of pregnancy in hypertensive patients at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, Nigeria between January 1997 and December 2002 were studied. There were 2,393 deliveries, with 127 (5.3%) patients fulfilling the criteria for hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. 26.2% had de-novo (gestational) hypertension, 19.7% had pre-eclampsia (PET) superimposed on chronic hypertension and 54.1% had PET/eclampsia. All patients with prepregnancy chronic hypertension had superimposed PET or eclampsia in this study. The PET/eclampsia group had the worst maternal and fetal outcomes as demonstrated by maternal mortality (6.1%), fetal mortality (36.4%), fetal respiratory distress (66.7%) and abruptio (6.1%). They also had more target organ damage (18.2%). 50.8% of these were categorized as high risk. Furthermore, patients in the PET/eclampsia group tended to be illiterate, attended antenatal clinic (ANC) less regularly and had more maternal and fetal adverse outcomes. Twenty percent of the patients had poorly controlled blood pressures (BP) at discharge, and only one out of five of the chronic hypertensive patients attended the medical hypertension clinic on discharge. These poor outcomes further emphasize the need for patient education regular antenatal clinic attendance
