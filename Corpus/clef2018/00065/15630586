Value of 123I-IMT SPECT for diagnosis of recurrent non-astrocytic intracranial tumours. The value of single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) using iodine-123-alpha-methyl-tyrosine (IMT) for the diagnosis of recurrent or residual gliomas is well established. In the current study we investigated whether IMT-SPECT could also be useful in the follow-up of brain metastases and other intracranial tumours of non-astrocytic origin. The study included 22 patients with suspected recurrent intracranial tumours of non-astrocytic origin (12 brain metastases, one supratentorial primitive neuroendocrine tumour (PNET), one rhabdoid tumour, two clivus chordomas, three ependymomas, two pituitary tumours, one anaplastic meningioma) who had previously been treated by surgery and/or radio/chemotherapy. SPECT results were correlated with clinical and MRI follow-up data. The study was true positive in 13 patients, true negative in five, false positive in one and false negative in three patients. Notably, all false negative findings were <13 mm. The resulting sensitivity of the IMT-SPECT was 81%. We concluded that the IMT-SPECT is a promising complementary imaging tool for the detection of recurrences of non-astrocytic intracranial tumours and their distinguishing from treatment-induced changes. The limitation of the IMT-SPECT is its low sensitivity for the detection of small lesions.
