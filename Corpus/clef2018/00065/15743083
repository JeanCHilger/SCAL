Hydrogel characteristics of electron-beam-immobilized poly(vinylpyrrolidone) films on poly(ethylene terephthalate) supports. A novel strategy for the preparation of thin hydrogel coatings on top of polymer bulk materials was elaborated for the example of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) surfaces layered with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). PVP layers were deposited on PET foils or SiO2 surfaces (silicon wafer or glass coverslips) precoated with PET and subsequently cross-linked by electron beam treatment. The obtained films were characterized by ellipsometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and electrokinetic measurements. Ellipsometric experiments and AFM force-distance measurements showed that the cross-linked layers swell in aqueous solutions by a factor of about 7. Electrokinetic experiments indicated a strong hydrodynamic shielding of the charge of the underlying PET layer by the hydrogel coatings and further proved that the swollen films were stable against shear stress and variation of pH. In conclusion, electron beam cross-linking ofpreadsorbed hydrophilic polymers permits a durable fixation of swellable polymer networks on polymer supports which can be adapted to materials in a wide variety of shapes.
