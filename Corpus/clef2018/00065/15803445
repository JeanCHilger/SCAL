Purification of carbon-11 PET radiotracers from unlabeled precursors by preparative HPLC and SPE. A general methodology for the rapid purification of carbon-11 positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers from radiolabeling reaction mixtures has been developed. Preparative HPLC and solid-phase extraction (SPE) techniques are described which can separate some commonly used radiopharmaceuticals such as [(11)C]raclopride, [(11)C]beta-CFT and [(11)C]choline from their unlabeled precursors.
