The maximum standardized uptake values on positron emission tomography of a non-small cell lung cancer predict stage, recurrence, and survival. We sought to assess whether the standard uptake value of a pulmonary nodule is an independent predictor of biologic aggressiveness.This is a retrospective review of a prospective database of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Patients had dedicated positron emission tomography scanning with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose, with the maximum standard uptake value measured. All suspicious nodal and systemic locations on computed tomographic and positron emission tomographic scanning underwent biopsy, and when indicated, resection with complete lymphadenectomy was performed.There were 315 patients. Multivariate analysis showed patients with a high maximum standard uptake value (>/=10) were more likely to have poorly differentiated tumors (risk ratio, 1.5 P = .005) and advanced stage (risk ratio, 1.9The maximum standard uptake value of a non-small cell lung cancer nodule on dedicated positron emission tomography is an independent predictor of stage and tumor characteristics. It is a more powerful independent predictor than the TNM stage for recurrence and survival for patients with early-stage resected cancer. This information might help guide treatment strategies.
