Striatal D2 receptor binding as a marker of prognosis and outcome in untreated first-episode psychosis. In a preliminary 123I-IBZM SPECT study in first-episode psychosis, a relationship between striatal dopaminergic D2 receptor (D2R) binding and premorbid adjustment was suggested. These results were replicated in the present study (n = 18), and D2R binding at diagnosis predicted a high probability for schizophrenia outcome by 2-year follow-up. The present findings contribute to the evidence of abnormal D2R binding in schizophrenia and suggest that SPECT might be useful for outcome prediction in first-episode psychosis.
