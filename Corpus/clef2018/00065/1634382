Diagnosis of energy metabolism in ENT tumors--a PET study. The metabolism of malignant tumours can be determined in vivo by positron emission tomography. Fifty patients with malignant lesions of the head and neck were examined before therapy and followed up for 11-18 months. The course of the disease was related to the initial fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake of the tumour. There was a relation between FDG uptake and survival: an increased FDG uptake of more than 300-400% was related to a reduced survival rate. Patients with an uptake less than 300% had a much better prognosis.
