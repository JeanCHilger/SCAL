Functional evaluation of arteriovenous malformations. Detailed knowledge of the angioarchitecture of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is necessary in determining the optimal timing and method of treatment of these challenging lesions. Many techniques are available for studying the functionality of surrounding cortical structures of AVMs. These include the use of positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography, and direct provocative testing of cortical function. The use of these methods to determine flow dynamics and tissue perfusion is also reviewed. These techniques are discussed in the present study, and their judicious utilization will enhance the safety of AVM therapy.
