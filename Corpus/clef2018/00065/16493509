Cardiac re-synchronization therapy: effects on myocardial perfusion at rest, after vasodilation and oxygen consumption. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been shown to improve haemodynamics and clinical symptoms in heart failure patients. The present study evaluated the effects of a 4-month CRT on myocardial blood flow (MBF) at rest, after vasodilation and on myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO(2)).We studied 16 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy prior to and during CRT performed as biventricular pacing. Resting MBF and MVO(2) were determined from an (11)C-acetate PET study and vasodilator MBF from a (13)N-ammonia study.MBF at rest (0.55 +/- 0.10 ml/min/g), after vasodilation (1.20 +/- 0.45 ml/min/g), and MVO2 (0.082 +/- 0.014/min) did not change by mid-term CRT at a global level (0.57 +/- 0.11 ml/min/g 1.32 +/- 0.49 ml/min/gEffects of mid-term CRT on resting MBF, vasodilator MBF and MVO(2) occur at a regional level. The resynchronization is associated with a more homogenous distribution pattern of these parameters among the myocardial walls. Substantial alterations to global MBF at rest, after vasodilation or to MVO(2) are not detectable. Regarding the RPP normalised MVO(2), there is evidence of improved ventricular efficiency through CRT.
