Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of iodinated derivatives of piperazine as a new ligand for sigma receptor imaging by single photon emission computed tomography. A new series of radioiodinated analogues of 1-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine (SA4503) was synthesized and evaluated as a potential brain sigma-1 receptor imaging ligands by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Iodinated analogues of SA4503 (4a-c) were prepared from piperazine in a high yield. The in vitro competition binding studies using [3H] DTG (sigma-1, 2), [3H] (+)-pentazocine (sigma-1), and [3H] DTG in the presence of carbetapentane (sigma-2) as sigma receptor selective radioligands were revealed that iodinated analogues 4a-c possess high affinities to sigma receptors (IC50: 4a=7.1, 4b=31.0, and 4c=77.3 nM). In particular, the affinity of 4a, bearing iodine at ortho position on the phenyl ring, was 4.4 times greater than SA4503, and 3 times greater than that of haloperidol. The meta-iodo analogue 4b was the same to SA4503, the lead compound. The radioiodinated derivatives, [125I] 4a, 4b were synthesized no-carrier-added from the corresponding tributyltin precursors by the iododestannylation reaction with high yields. The binding of [125I] 4a, 4b have been characterized in the rat brain membranes. These compounds were indicated single population binding to sigma receptor with high affinity (4a: Kd=1.86+/-0.34 nM, Bmax=205+/-28.9 fmol/mg protein, 4b: Kd=3.30+/-0.51 nM, Bmax=231.5+/-13.8 fmol/mg protein). In vitro blocking studies were confirmed that the high specificity of 4a, 4b. These results suggest that radioiodinated 4a and 4b are promising sigma receptors imaging ligand for pursuing further in vivo studies.
