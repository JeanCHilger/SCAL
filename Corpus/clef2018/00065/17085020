Regional brain serotonin and dopamine transporter binding capacity in suicide attempters relate to impulsiveness and mental energy. To study different aspects of regional pre-synaptic brain (123)I-beta-CIT uptake on serotonin and dopamine re-uptake sites in drug-free suicide attempters in comparison with age- and sex matched control subjects, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) measurements were analysed for regional serotonin re-uptake (5HTT) and dopamine re-uptake (DAT) capacity (binding potential, BP()) after i.v. (123)I-beta-CIT administration. All suicide attempters were examined concerning seriousness of the attempt, and DSM-IV diagnosis. Both suicide attempters and control subjects were tested for psychotropic drugs, and completed the Marke-Nyman Temperament (MNT) test, including solidity (level of impulsiveness/initiative) and validity (level of mental energy). We found no significant difference between suicide attempters and control subjects concerning the regional levels of 5HTT BP() or DAT BP(). However, in suicide attempters, but not controls, we found significant regional correlations between MNT variables and SPECT results. We interpret the discrepant findings in suicide attempters and control subjects to be due to a disability of the suicide attempters to regulate their serotonin and dopamine levels, e.g. in response to external stress.
