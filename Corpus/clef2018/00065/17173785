Hyperemic reactivity scintigraphy in endothelial function. The aim of this study was to compare a recently described method to evaluate endothelial function the hyperemic reactivity scintigraphy (HRS) with the ultrasonographic flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in brachial artery and its relationship with myocardial SPECT.42 consecutive patients that underwent myocardial scintigraphy were included. Thirty-six patients had simultaneous measurement of FMD. Both studies were obtained after 5 minutes occlusion of the upper arm with a blood pressure cuff inflated at 250 mmHg. HRS was performed dynamically at rate 1 frame/sec during 3 minutes after intravenous injection of 740 MBq of Tc-99 sestamibi. Time-activity curves allowed obtaining the following indexes: medium hyperemic activity/medium contrallateral activity (MHA/MCA) and maximum hyperemic activity/maximum contrallateral activity (MxHA/CxHA).In 13 patients SPECT was normal. Twenty-nine patients had perfusion defects in scintigraphy. There was relationship between the FMD and the MHA/MCA (r = 0.23 p = 0.018) and the FMD and the MxHA/CxHA (r = 0.18There is relationship between FMD and HRS. HRS is lower in patients with perfusion defects in the SPECT. HRS could provide additional value to myocardial scintigraphy.
