Magnetic resonance angiography shows dilatation of the middle cerebral artery after infusion of glyceryl trinitrate in healthy volunteers. Previous studies have reported dilatation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) during acute glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)-induced headache, using imaging techniques such as transcranial Doppler (TCD), positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). In the present study we aimed to evaluate whether magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may be used to examine the effect of GTN on the MCA, with respect to changes in diameter and cross-sectional area in healthy volunteers. In addition, we wanted to determine the intra- and inter-observer variation of the method. In a randomized, double blind, crossover study 12 healthy volunteers received intravenous infusion of GTN (0.5 microg/kg/min for 20 min) or placebo. Using 1.5 Tesla MRA, we recorded changes in the diameter and cross-sectional area of MCA before, during and after infusion of GTN. The MRA images were evaluated by two blinded, independent observers/neuroradiologists. The primary endpoints were the differences in the AUC for diameter and cross-sectional area of the MCA between the two experimental conditions and the intra- and inter-observer variation. The areas under the curve (AUC) of the MCA diameter and cross-sectional area were significantly greater after GTN than after placebo (P < 0.05). The intra-observer variation (day-to-day) at baseline was 8.3% and 10.9% for the two observers. The mean inter-observer variation of the cross-sectional MCA area was 15.5% and for the diameter measurements 8%. The present study shows that the MRA method gives a reliable semi-quantitative index of the vascular changes in the intra-cerebral arteries after infusion of GTN and may be useful for headache research.
