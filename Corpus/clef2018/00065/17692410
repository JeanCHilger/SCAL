Estimation of global and regional cardiac function using 64-slice computed tomography: a comparison study with echocardiography, gated-SPECT and cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Sixty-four-slice multidetector spiral computed tomography (CT) has improved temporal resolution and reduced acquisition time. We aimed to evaluate the functional analysis using 64-slice CT comparing with echocardiography, electrocardiographically gated single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR).Six-three patients (77.4+/-18.6 bpm) underwent 64-slice CT and CMR (echocardiography in 55 SPECT in 33) within 2 weeks were retrospectively reviewed. The left ventricular volumetric data from different methods were compared with CMR. Regional wall motion was compared between CT and CMR in a 17-segment and 4-point system (1=normal to 4=akinesis/dyskinesis).Ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) by CT agreed well with CMR (bias+/-SD, -0.22%+/-4.18, r=0.97-0.59 mL+/-15.21, r=0.98Sixty-four-slice CT agreed well with CMR in LV function assessment, and had a superior accuracy than echocardiography and SPECT on EF estimation. Sixty-four-slice CT is considered a clinically acceptable and robust method to evaluate LV function.
