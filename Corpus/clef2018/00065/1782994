Brain kinetics and specific binding of [11C]PK 11195 to omega 3 sites in baboons: positron emission tomography study. We characterized, in vivo, using positron emission tomography in baboons, the kinetics and specific binding of i.v. injected [11C]PK 11195 to omega 3 sites in the brain. Following immediate access to brain tissue, the brain kinetics of [11C] K 11195 showed a slow elimination for the 60 min of study. Both coinjection and pulse-chase (at t = 8 min) with saturating amounts of cold PK 11195 immediately enhanced the availability of radiotracer to brain tissue, but also markedly increased the rate of washout. These effects presumably reflect displacement or inhibition of specifically bound [11C]PK 11195 to both peripheral and central omega 3 sites, respectively. These results indicate that [11C]PK 11195 has easy access and binds with moderate specificity to the normal primate brain in vivo.
