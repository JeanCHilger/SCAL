Researches of the left ventricle model and optimization arithmetic based on myocardial radionuclide tomographic images. In this paper are presented and recommended the researches of the left ventricle model and optimization arithmetic based on myocardial radionuclide tomographic images (SPECT and PET). We adopted the hemispheric-cylindrical myocardial model which was largely used in quantitative analysis of myocardium. Then we adopted the radionuclide maximum counts method in LV myocardium and used the Powell optimization arithmetic to fit the myocardial model. Comparing the result from the adopted method against that of the doctors' diagnosis, we found the rate of high relevancy being 83.2%.
