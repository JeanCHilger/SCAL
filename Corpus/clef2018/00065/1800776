A study on crosstalk correction in dual energy acquisition of 123I-MIBG and 201TlCl in myocardial SPECT. In the simultaneous dual energy acquisition, energy spectrums of two radionuclides crosstalk each other and this phenomenon is a cause of the poor quality of images. In order to obtain the image of high quality in dual energy acquisition of 123I-MIBG and 201TlCl, a crosstalk correction method was originated. The crosstalk from 201Tl to 123I window (R1) and the crosstalk from 123I to 201Tl window (R2) were determined by the cardiac phantom studies. R1 and R2 showed almost constant value throughout the myocardial wall. The crosstalk correction was performed using R1 and R2. After the crosstalk correction, the defect region placed in the cardiac phantom was detected more clearly both in visual interpretation and in quantitative analysis. The crosstalk correction method with R1 and R2 was applied to some clinical cases. By the crosstalk correction, the quality of image was improved and a false defect caused by crosstalk disappeared in a clinical case. The crosstalk correction was considered to be useful for improving the quality of image on dual energy acquisition.
