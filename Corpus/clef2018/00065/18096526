Imaging genetics of brain longevity and mental wellness: the next frontier? The advent of new "omics" technologies (genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) has ushered in a new era of biomedical discovery that is already affecting every field of medicine. With the rapid growth of the older population worldwide, there is great interest in applying these technologies not only to diagnose and prevent disease, but also to enhance brain longevity and mental wellness. Nearly two-thirds of the approximately 30,000 genes in the human genome are related to brain function, and up to half of the variance in age-related changes in cognition, brain volume, and neuronal function appears to be genetically determined. Selected examples will be used to illustrate how neuroimaging is being employed to study the effects of genes and how neurogenetics may affect future radiology research and practice.
