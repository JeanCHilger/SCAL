Positive rates to propyl gallate on patch testing: a change in trend. Propyl gallate (E310) has, until recently, been used as a major antioxidant in fatty food and, in the cosmetic industry, in the manufacture of lipsticks. Propyl gallate has a high sensitizing potential however, the frequency of allergic contact dermatitis from antioxidants of the gallate type was previously thought to be surprisingly low. Previous exposure and orally induced tolerance, as suggested by Khan and colleagues, may have explained the low rates of allergic contact dermatitis to propyl gallate in the past. The objectives were to assess the prevalence of allergic contact dermatitis to propyl gallate in our centre from 1988 to 2005. From 1988 to 2005, 9529 patients were patch tested to the face series, 6973 were females and 2556 were males. Patch tests were read at 2 D and 4 D. Positive reactions were scored as per International Contact Dermatitis Research Group recommendations as negative, +, ++, and +++ reactions. Propyl gallate was used at a 1% petrolatum (pet.). A total of 55 patients had positive reactions to propyl gallate 1% pet. (0.57%), 46 were female (0.65%) and 9 were male (0.33%). Using chi-square, there was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the positivity rates between the 1988-96 period (0.45%) and the 1997-2005 period (0.77%). A review of our face series performed in the last 18 years has shown a statistically significant increase in propyl gallate-positive rates on patch testing over the last decade. An increase in its use in the cosmetic industry may well be the explanation for this. Nevertheless, a concomitant reduction of propyl gallate as an antioxidant in food, with oral tolerance being less likely to develop, may also be a contributing factor in the increasing trend of allergic contact dermatitis caused by propyl gallate.
