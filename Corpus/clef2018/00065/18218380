Implementation, investigation, and improvement of a novel cone-beam reconstruction method [SPECT]. A three-dimensional reconstruction method which uses cone-beam data was implemented. Issues concerning implementation are investigated and discussed in detail. Computer simulations were used to determine the amount of image degradation occurring in each of the three steps that comprise the reconstruction method. In addition, computer simulations were used to investigate issues concerning sampling. Improvements in the implementation were made. Additionally, suggestions for future efforts to improve the implementation are made.
