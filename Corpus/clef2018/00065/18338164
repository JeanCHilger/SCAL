Role of [18F]FDG-PET/CT after radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases: preliminary results. Focal metastasis may be treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), a low invasive method yet limited by the lack of direct evidence of radicality of treatment. We, hereby, aimed at assessing the role of positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) with fluoride radiolabeled deoxy-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) in RFA treatment success evaluation and early diagnosis of local relapse of liver metastasis after RFA procedure.RFA was performed in nine patients on 12 liver metastasis, serially imaged through [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT and multidetector CT (MDCT) at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months after treatment. Eight lesions were also scanned with [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT at 1 week after treatment. Imaging analyses were performed on 47 [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT and 51 MDCT. Imaging reading outcomes were compared to each other and to biopsy tissue results when available.In one case, [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT revealed radiotracer uptake at RFA site a week after procedure. Negative concordant outcome was obtained on eight lesions at 1 month after RFA, on eight cases at 3 months, on four at 6 months, and on two cases at 9 months. Extra-liver (peritoneal) disease was detected in one case by both [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT and MDCT. In seven cases, [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT revealed the presence of local recurrence earlier than MDCT. In no cases did MDCT detect local relapse earlier than [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT.[(18)F]FDG-PET/CT may detect RFA treatment failure as well as local relapse after RFA earlier than MDCT.
