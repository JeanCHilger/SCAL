PET imaging with 11C-acetate in prostate cancer: a biochemical, radiochemical and clinical perspective. In the present study, the potential clinical role of 11C-acetate PET mainly in the differential diagnosis, in the staging and in the follow-up of prostate cancer patients is reported.Each of the above points has been accurately investigated by studying the specific biochemical and radiobiochemical behaviour of this positron emitter compound.The imaging quality of 11C-acetate PET and its unique mechanisms of cellular uptake, make such radiotracer a powerful tool in evaluating all the steps of the prostatic cancer.
