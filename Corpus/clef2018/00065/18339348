Paraneoplastic syndromes of the CNS. Major advances in the management of paraneoplastic neurologic disorders (PND) include the detection of new antineuronal antibodies, the improved characterisation of known syndromes, the discovery of new syndromes, and the use of CT and PET to reveal the associated tumours at an early stage. In addition, the definition of useful clinical criteria has facilitated the early recognition and treatment of these disorders. In this article, we review some classic concepts about PND and recent clinical and immunological developments, focusing on paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, opsoclonus-myoclonus, and encephalitides affecting the limbic system.
