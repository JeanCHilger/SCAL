Follow-up after malignant tumours of the uterus (cancer of the uterine corpus / cervical cancer). Malignant uterine tumours can affect the corpus or the cervix. The endometrial carcinoma with its different histological subtypes counts for most of the malignomas of the uterine body. But the rare category of uterine sarcomas (carcinosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas as well as endometrial stromal sarcomas) also belongs to this group. Cervical cancer presents an own entitity, regarding both histology and therapeutic options. Endometrial cancer is the most common genital malignoma in Northern Europe and North America. Histologically, the endometrial cancer can be subdivided in two groups: type I is hormonal sensitive and well differentiated, type II represents an undifferenciated aggressive tumour with poor prognosis. In general, the patient is elderly. Due to the main symptom - abnormal vaginal bleeding - endometrial cancer is detected in an early stage in about 75% of all patients. First choice in therapy is stage related surgery. Follow-up schemes have not proved yet to improve survival, therefore clear guidelines are missing. National and international groups recommend regular follow-up visits to detect the early vaginal vault relapse which is curable. Cervical cancer is mainly a squamous cell carcinoma and oncogenic Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) associated. Surgery is only indicated up to stage IIA, advanced stages should be treated by radio-chemotherapy. Several studies have shown that follow-up visits can improve survival rates. Intention is the detection of the curable local relapse.
