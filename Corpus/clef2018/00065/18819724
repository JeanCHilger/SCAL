EGFR gene copy number in adenocarcinoma of the lung by FISH analysis: investigation of significantly related factors on CT, FDG-PET, and histopathology. It has been suggested that a high EGFR gene copy number may be an indicator of good response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and a marker of poor prognosis in NSCLC. However, imaging features related to EGFR gene copy number status in adenocarcinoma are still unknown. We therefore retrospectively analyzed CT, FDG-PET, and histopathologic slides of surgical resected lung adenocarcinoma in 132 patients. Tumor characteristics on preoperative chest-CT, such as, GGO proportions, tumor diameters, and cavitation FDG-PET SUV(max)
