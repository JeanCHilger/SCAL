Role of 18F-FDG PET scan in the differential diagnosis of large pancreatic masses. Results of standard 18FDG PET and double-phase scanning were compared in the course of differential diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and chronic pseudotumorous pancreatitis, particularly, during exacerbation. PET diagnosis of cancer was confirmed in 6.5% while that of double-phase scanning--100%.
