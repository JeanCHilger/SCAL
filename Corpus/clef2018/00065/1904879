Measurement of cerebral monoamine oxidase B activity using L-[11C]deprenyl and dynamic positron emission tomography. A tracer kinetic procedure was developed for the measurement of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) activity using L-[11C]deprenyl and positron emission tomography (PET). The kinetic model consisted of two tissue compartments with irreversible binding to the second compartment (three rate constants). In addition, a blood volume component was included. Special attention was given to the accurate measurement of the plasma and whole blood input functions. The method was applied to the measurement of the dose-response curve of a reversible MAO-B inhibitor (Ro 19-6327). From the results, it followed that the rate constant for irreversible binding (k3) appeared to be a better index of MAO-B activity than the net influx constant Ki. Furthermore, regional analysis demonstrated that Ki, but not k3, was flow dependent. This implies that full kinetic analysis is required for an accurate assessment of MAO-B activity.
