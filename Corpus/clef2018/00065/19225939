Comparative study of FDG PET/CT and conventional imaging in the staging of rhabdomyosarcoma. The current study was conducted to compare the diagnostic accuracy between (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), and conventional imaging (CI) for the staging and re-staging of patients with rhabdomyosarcomas.Thirty-five patients who underwent FDG PET/CT prior to treatment were evaluated retrospectively. CI methods consisted of (99m)Tc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy, chest radiograph, whole body CT, and magnetic resonance imaging of the primary site. The images were reviewed and two boardcertified radiologists reached a diagnostic consensus. Tumor stage was confirmed by histological examination and/or follow-up examinations.Interpretation on the basis of FDG PET/CT, and CI, diagnostic accuracies of the T and N stages were similar. Using FDG PET/CT, the M stage was correctly assigned in 31 patients (89%), whereas the accuracy of CI in M stage was 63%. TNM stage was correctly assessed with FDG PET/CT in 30 of 35 patients (86%) and with CI in 19 of 35 patients (54%). The overall TNM staging and M staging accuracies of FDG PET/CT were significantly higher than that of CI (P < 0.01).FDG PET/CT is more accurate than CI regarding clinical staging and re-staging of patients with rhabdomyosarcomas.
