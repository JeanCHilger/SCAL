Ischemic cardiomyopathy: a clinical nuclear cardiology perspective. Ischemic cardiomyopathy results from severe extensive coronary artery disease, which is associated with left ventricular dysfunction and also, in many cases, with significant left ventricular dilatation. Mortality is high, especially in patients who satisfy myocardial viability criteria but who have not undergone revascularization. Although age, exercise capacity and comorbidity influence survival, the most important prognostic factors are the extent of the ischemia, myocardial viability and left ventricular remodeling, all of which can be successfully evaluated by gated myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
