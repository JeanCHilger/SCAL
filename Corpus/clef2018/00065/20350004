Tripodal exTTF-CTV hosts for fullerenes. A receptor for fullerenes featuring three exTTF units linked to a CTV scaffold is described. The exTTF-CTV host forms remarkably stable complexes with both C(60) (log K(a) = 5.3 +/- 0.2) and C(70) (log K(a) = 6.3 +/- 0.6). Light-induced ESR spectra demonstrate that intracomplex PET processes take place in solution.
