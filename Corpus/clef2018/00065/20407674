Orthogonal 18F and 64Cu labelling of functionalised bis(thiosemicarbazonato) complexes. The synthesis of three pairs of orthogonally labelled fluorinated Cu bis(thiosemicarbazonato) complexes is presented. These are the first examples of (18)F-labelled Cu(II)-complexes designed to serve as new hypoxia selective PET tracers and as mechanistic probes to study the mode of action of this class of markers. In vitro evaluation revealed that the fluorinated Cu-complex derived from amide coupling is suitable for in vivo work.
