Prognostic factors and patterns of recurrence in esophageal cancer assert arguments for extended two-field transthoracic esophagectomy. High recurrence rates determine the dismal outcome in esophageal cancer. We reviewed our experiences and defined prognostic factors and patterns of recurrences after curatively intended transthoracic esophagectomy.Between January 1991 and December 2005, 212 consecutive patients underwent a radical transthoracic esophagectomy with extended 2-field lymphadenectomy. Recurrence rates, survival, and prognostic factors were analyzed (minimal follow-up period, 2 y).Radicality was obtained in 85.6%. The median follow-up period was 26.6 months. The overall recurrence rate at 1, 3, and 5 years was 28%, 44%, and 64%, respectively, and locoregional recurrence rate was 17%, 27%, and 43%, respectively. Overall survival rates, including postoperative deaths, were 45% and 34% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. pT stage and lymph node (LN) ratio greater than .20 were independent prognostic factors for survival and recurrences. Radicality was most prognostic for survival, and for N+ greater than 4 positive LN for recurrences.Radicality and LN ratio are strong prognostic factors. High radicality and adequate nodal assessment are guaranteed by an extended transthoracic approach.
