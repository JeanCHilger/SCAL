Endovascular trapping for a giant aneurysm of the cervical internal carotid artery: a case report. We describe a case of giant cervical internal carotid aneurysm successfully treated by endovascular trapping. A 57-year-old woman with a history of maxillary contusion seven years before presented with pharyngeal discomfort during swallowing. MRI revealed a 4 cm mass in the right parapharyngeal space. A common carotid angiogram revealed a giant aneurysm with a wide neck originating from the cervical internal carotid artery kinking of the internal carotid artery was noted at a point distal to the carotid bifurcation. Analysis of cerebral blood flow by SPECT during a balloon occlusion test showed no hypoperfusion areas, and the patient underwent endovascular trapping. There were no neurological or other complications after the procedure. A follow-up MRI revealed complete thrombosis of the aneurysm. Our results show that endovascular trapping for pseudoaneurysm of the cervical internal carotid artery can be a reliable and effective treatment in patients who tolerate a balloon occlusion test.
