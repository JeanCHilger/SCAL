Recognition of fibrous dysplasia of bone mimicking skeletal metastasis on 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging. Fibrous dysplasia of bone (FDB) reveals intense 18F-FDG uptake mimicking metastases on 18F-FDG PET/CT. We reviewed sites of FDB revealed by 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging to allow identification of this abnormality.Eleven patients (7 male, 4 female, aged 16-78 years) were evaluated after 55 MBq (0.15 mCi)/kg 18F-FDG utilizing a 16-slice multiple detector CT (MDCT) whole-body PET scanner, with LOR algorithm 3D reconstruction. One- and 2-h imaging was performed in 9 patients. Standard uptake value (SUV) for each lesion, on early and delayed imaging, was calculated. Lesions were confirmed in 6 patients by biopsy. The PET images correlated with MDCT to establish the imaging characteristics.Solitary lesions were found in 4 patients, two lesions in 1 patient, and in 6 patients there were multiple bone lesions. The SUV(early) ranged from 1.23 to 9.64 with an average of 3.76 ± 2.40. The SUV(delayed) ranged from 1.76 to 11.42 with an average of 4.51 ± 3.07. The SUV(delayed) decreased or increased slightly (-31% to 5%) in 6 of our patients, and increased significantly (11% to 39%) in 3. There was a negative correlation between SUVs and age, as well as the number of affected bones.In our study, FDB had wide skeletal distribution with variability of 18F-FDG uptake and CT appearance. SUV in the delayed stage was seen to either decrease or increase on dual-time 18F-FDG PET scanning. It is very important to recognize the characteristics of this skeletal dysplasia to allow differentiation from skeletal metastasis.
