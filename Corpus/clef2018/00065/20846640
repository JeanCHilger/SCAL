Minimally invasive radio-guided surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism: From preoperative to intraoperative localization imaging. The introduction and successful implementation of minimally invasive radio-guided parathyroidectomy (MIRP) has revolutionized the surgical approach to remove parathyroid adenomas. A prerequisite for such success is an accurate localization of the offending adenoma. To achieve this goal, a multimodality approach is commonly employed using a combination of anatomical and functional imaging. Of the anatomical cross-sectional techniques, ultrasonography is the most widely available but is operator-dependent and has reduced sensitivity, specially in the presence of thyroid nodules. Similarly, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have low sensitivities but provide value in detecting retrotracheal, retro-oesophageal and mediastinal adenomas. Functional imaging with ⁹⁹(m)Tc-Sestamibi is currently the most vital imaging procedure in this respect with variable protocols including dual-phase and dual isotope imaging. The sensitivity and specificity can improve by acquiring in single photon emission tomography (SPECT) mode and using co-registration with low dose CT to provide anatomical data (SPECT/CT). The current recommended approach is the combination of functional imaging with ⁹⁹(m)Tc-Sestamibi and high-resolution ultrasound (US), supplemented with intraoperative gamma probe in certain cases and quick persurgical measurement of parathyroid hormone. This review aims to explore the utility of various imaging modalities, alone and in combination, in detecting parathyroid adenoma and facilitating the current approach of MIRP.
