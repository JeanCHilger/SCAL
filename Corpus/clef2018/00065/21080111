CT perfusion: ready for prime time. Advancements in computed tomography (CT) technology have revolutionized clinical practice, particularly regarding the noninvasive assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). The versatility of cardiac CT has rendered multiple applications including assessment of cardiac structure and function, myocardial viability, and coronary anatomy. The merits of cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA) have been proven for the detection, and particularly the exclusion, of CAD. However, CTA becomes limited in the presence of significant CAD. Its inability to consistently identify lesion-associated ischemia may necessitate additional radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging. Myocardial computed tomography perfusion imaging (CTP) has emerged as a useful and convenient method to immediately assess myocardial ischemia. In this review, we discuss the current state of CTP including available technology, its performance to date from current literature, and future challenges to this field.
