Validation of longitudinal peak systolic strain by speckle tracking echocardiography with visual assessment and myocardial perfusion SPECT in patients with regional asynergy. Automated function imaging (AFI) is a recently developed method of calculating the longitudinal peak systolic strains (LS) of the regional left ventricular (LV) wall using speckle tracking echocardiography and displaying them on a single bull's-eye map. The feasibility of AFI in patients with regional LV wall motion abnormalities caused by myocardial infarction (MI) was evaluated by comparison with visual assessment and myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Segmental LS was measured by AFI in 60 patients with MI (67 ± 11 years) and 58 controls (71 ± 9 years). Wall thickening (WT) was measured by SPECT in 20 patients with MI. There was a strong positive linear relationship between the wall motion score index by expert visual assessment and global LS. The receiver-operating characteristic analysis revealed the best cutoff value of 11% < LS to identify hypokinetic segments. The overall accuracy of wall motion scoring by LS in the 2,006 segments was 96.8% (κ = 0.90) compared with visual assessment. The correlation coefficient between LS and WT was R² = 0.65 in the 340 segments.Assessment of LV regional asynergy by AFI showed good agreement with visual and SPECT assessments. AFI is clinically useful for quantitative assessment of LV regional wall motion abnormalities.
