Sustained ventricular tachycardia is associated with regional myocardial sympathetic denervation assessed with 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. Cardiac sympathetic denervation and ventricular arrhythmia are frequently observed in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC). This study quantitatively evaluated the association between cardiac sympathetic denervation and sustained ventricular tachycardia (SVT) in patients with CCC.We prospectively investigated patients with CCC and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 35% with SVT (SVT group: n = 15 mean age ± SD, 61 ± 8 yCompared with the non-SVT group, the SVT group had a similar (99m)Tc-MIBI summed score (6.9 ± 7.5 vs. 4.4 ± 5.2, respectively, P = 0.69) but a higher (123)I-MIBG summed score (10.9 ± 7.8 vs. 22.4 ± 9.5, respectively, P = 0.007) and a higher number of mismatch defects per patient (2.0 ± 2.2 vs. 7.1 ± 2.0, respectively, P < 0.0001). The presence of more than 3 mismatch defects was strongly associated with the presence of SVT (93% sensitivity, 82% specificity P = 0.0002).In CCC, the amount of sympathetically denervated viable myocardium is associated with the occurrence of SVT. Myocardial sympathetic denervation may participate in triggering malignant ventricular arrhythmia in CCC patients with relatively well-preserved ventricular function.
