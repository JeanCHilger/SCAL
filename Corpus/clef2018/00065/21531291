Binding of 2-[18F]fluoro-CP-118,954 to mouse acetylcholinesterase: microPET and ex vivo Cerenkov luminescence imaging studies. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has been an important cholinergic factor for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), because of reduced AChE activity in the postmortem brains of AD patients. We previously developed 5,7-dihydro-3-(2-(1-(2-[(18)F]fluorobenzyl)-4-piperidinyl)ethyl)-6H-pyrrolo(3,2,f)-1,2-benzisoxazol-6-one (2-[(18)F]fluoro-CP-118,954) for in vivo studies of AChE in mice. In the present study, we automated the synthesis of 2-[(18)F]fluoro-CP-118,954 for the routine use and evaluated the radioligand by microPET and ex vivo Cerenkov luminescence imaging of mouse AChE. 4-[(18)F]Fluoro-donepezil, another AChE inhibitor, was used for comparison. Automated syntheses of 2-[(18)F]fluoro-CP-118,954 and 4-[(18)F]fluoro-donepezil resulted in high radiochemical yields (25-33% and 30-40%) and high specific activity (27.1-35.4 and 29.7-37.3 GBq/μmol). Brain microPET images of two ICR mice injected with 2-[(18)F]fluoro-CP-118,954 demonstrated high uptake in the striatum (ROI analysis: 5.1 %ID/g for the first 30 min and 4.1 %ID/g for another 30 min), and a blocking study with injection of CP-118,954 into one of the mice at 30 min after radioligand injection led to complete blocking of radioligand uptake in the striatum (ROI analysis: 1.9 %ID/g), whereas (18)F-labeled donepezil did not show specific uptake in the striatum. In another set of experiments, the brain tissues (striatum, parietal cortex, frontal cortex and cerebellum) were excised after brain microPET/CT imaging of mouse injected with 2-[(18)F]fluoro-CP-118,954, and a high striatal uptake was also detected in ex vivo optical and microPET images (ROI analysis: 1.4 %ID/g) and in γ-counting data (2.1 %ID/g at 50 min post-injection) of the brain tissues. Taken together, these results demonstrated that 2-[(18)F]fluoro-CP-118,954 specifically binds to AChE in mouse brains.
