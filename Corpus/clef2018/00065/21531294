Evaluation of adenosine preconditioning with 99mTc-His10-annexin V in a porcine model of myocardium ischemia and reperfusion injury: preliminary study. The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of (99m)Tc-His(10)-annexin V for the detection of acute myocardial cell death and to assess the effect of adenosine preconditioning in a porcine model of myocardium ischemia and reperfusion injury (RI).(99m)Tc-His(10)-annexin V was prepared by one-step direct labeling, and RCP and radiostability were tested. The binding of (99m)Tc-His(10)-annexin V to apoptosis was validated in vitro using camptothecin-induced Jurkat cells. In vivo biodistribution was determined in mice by the dissection method. Ischemia of 20-30 min was induced by balloon occlusion of the epicardial coronary artery of the porcine model (n=14). Adenosine was infused intravenously in six pigs before coronary occlusion. (99m)Tc-His(10)-annexin V (n=12) was injected intravenously at 1 h after reperfusion. SPECT/CT was acquired at 3 h postinjection. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with (99m)Tc-MIBI was also performed 1 day after His(10)-annexin V imaging. Cardiac tissues were analyzed postmortem using hematoxylin-and-eosin and TUNEL staining. Caspase-3 activity was measured to confirm the presence of apoptosis.(99m)Tc-His(10)-annexin V had a RCP >98% and high stability 2 h after radiolabeling it could bind to apoptotic cells with high affinity. Biodistribution of (99m)Tc-His(10)-annexin V showed a predominant uptake in the kidney and relatively low uptake in the myocardium, liver and gastrointestinal tractThis study addresses the feasibility of imaging of myocardial cell death in acute ischemia and RI in pigs with (99m)Tc-His(10)-annexin V it holds prospect for the detection of myocardial cell death in clinical practice. Adenosine preconditioning could attenuate the myocardial apoptosis
