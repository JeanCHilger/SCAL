Two-phase [11C]L-methionine PET in childhood brain tumors. Thirteen children (1.8-15.8 years of age) with brain tumors were studied with [11C]L-methionine positron emission tomography (METPET). Patients were injected intravenously with tracer before a baseline PET scan was obtained. To assess the sensitivity of [11C]L-methionine uptake to competitive inhibition, 10 patients received oral L-phenylalanine (100 mg/kg) 1 hour later, a second METPET was obtained. Subjective assessment of [11C]L-methionine uptake closely paralleled results of quantitative examination (r = 0.81). [11C]L-methionine uptake in tumor-containing brain was increased in 11 patients (mean ratio of [11C] radioactivity in tumor to normal brain: 1.5 +/- 0.57
