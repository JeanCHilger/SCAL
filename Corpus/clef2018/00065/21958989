Dosimetry in molecular nuclear therapy. Advanced personalized dosimetry for molecular nuclear therapy has been shown to be feasible in clinical practice. At the same time instrumentation and dosimetric software are still evolving at a high pace. Procedures developed so far differ in approach and sophistication, and standard operating procedures necessary for accurate patient specific dosimetry do not yet exist. For this reason we restricted ourselves to reviewing the literature and highlighting relevant developments.
