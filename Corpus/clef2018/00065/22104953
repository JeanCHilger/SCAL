((18)F)-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT in cervix cancer: lymph node assessment and prognostic/predictive value of primary tumour analysis. In cervix carcinoma: (a) to evaluate the ability of ((18)F)-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in the lymph node detection (b) to investigate the prognostic and predictive value of the primary cervical PET parameters.Ninety patients treated for cervix carcinoma and evaluated initially by MRI and FGD PET were included. The performances of FDG-PET for lymph node detection (relatively to the lymph node dissection) have been described (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value). PET tumour parameters analyzed were: maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), the volume and the maximum diameter. The prognostic and predictive values of these parameters were investigated. The tumour response was evaluated on surgical specimens.PET detected the cervical tumour with a sensitivity of 97% (mean values: SUVmax=15.8, volume=27 mm(3), maximum diameter=47). For the detection of the lymph nodes, the values of sensibility, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were: 86, 56, 69 and 78% in the pelvic, and 90, 67, 50 and 95% for the para-aortic area, respectively. The SUVmax was correlated with histologic response (P=0.04). The frequency of partial histological response was significantly higher for tumour SUVmax>10.9 (P=0.017). The maximum PET diameter and pathologic response had an impact on disease-free survival and overall survival in multivariate analysis (P<0.05).PET has high sensitivity in detecting pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes. Some primary cervical tumour PET parameters are useful as prognostic and predictive factors.
