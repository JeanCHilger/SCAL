Anticancer activity of an imageable curcuminoid 1-[2-aminoethyl-(6-hydrazinopyridine-3-carbamidyl)-3,5-bis-(2-fluorobenzylidene)-4-piperidone (EFAH). 3,5-Bis(2-fluorobenzylidine)-4-piperidone or EF24 is a potent anticancer derivative of curcumin. Using an amine derivative of EF24, we synthesized a hydrazinonicotinic acid conjugate, EFAH, for Tc-99m radiolabelling and single photon emission tomography imaging. The aqueous solubility of EFAH (3.5 mg/mL) was significantly more than that of EF24 (1.2 mg/mL) the octanol/water partition coefficient of EFAH was estimated at log P = 0.33. As an antiproliferative agent, EFAH was as effective as EF24 in suppressing the proliferation of H441, MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells. Daily intraperitoneal injection of EFAH (5 Î¼g) for 3 weeks in mice carrying xenografts of Panc-1 pancreatic cancer showed a mean tumour volume reduction of 79%
