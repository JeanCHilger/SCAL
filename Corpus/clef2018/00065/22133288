The clinical application of whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging in the early assessment of chemotherapeutic effects in lymphoma: the initial experience. At present, accurate assessment of therapeutic efficacy at the early stage of treatment is still a challenge for radiologists. As a new non-radiation whole body imaging technology, Whole body-diffusion weighted imaging (WB-DWI) had shown promising application prospects in therapeutic assessment, which confirmed by many premier animal studies. Here we report that in the chemotherapeutic assessment of malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, WB-DWI can not only detect the morphological change of solid infiltrated lesion as the convention (such as CT, PET, etc.) but also provide information about the growth and decline process of tumor cells in the lesion combining with the dynamic changes of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, which is sooner than the morphological changes.
