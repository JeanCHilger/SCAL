Malignant lymphoma of the skin: update on diagnostics and therapy of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. The diagnosis of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma is made based principally on the results of histological investigations and staging. For an exact staging abdominal sonography and chest X-ray examinations and for appropriate clinical symptoms special investigations as well as radiological imaging procedures including PET are indicated in addition to conventional laboratory investigations. For therapy rituximab is normally administered as monotherapy in order to avoid over therapy of indolent lymphoma. Further options are radiotherapy and new approaches with electrochemotherapy as well as pegylated doxorubicin.
