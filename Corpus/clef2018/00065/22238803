For example, the pHe of the tumor microenvironment can be acidic (pH 6.5–6.9) relative to pHe in normal tissues (pH 7.2–7.4) due to aerobic glycolysis that produces excess lactic acid (1). Accurately measuring tumor pHe may be used to diagnose tumors. Furthermore, acidic tumors are chemoresistant against weak-base chemotherapies such as doxorubicin, and they may be more sensitive to weak-acid chemotherapies (2). Accurately measuring tumor pHe may provide patients and physicians with the ability to select the best chemotherapy for the tumor in order to provide personalized medicine to the patient. Clinical drug trials with experimental weak-base and weak-acid chemotherapies may benefit by stratifying patients on the basis of their tumor pHe. Treatments that modulate pHe, such as bicarbonate, have been shown to reduce metastases and increase survival in mouse models of human mammary carcinoma (3). Chronic administration of excessive bicarbonate, however, may lead to alkalosis of normal tissues, so a method to monitor tissue pHe is needed to support studies of pHe-modulating treatments. Many imaging methods have been developed to measure tumor pHe, including optical imaging, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging, positron emission tomography imaging, magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, and hyperpolarized MR imaging (MRI), but these methods suffer from poor depth of penetration, lack of accuracy or precision, produce images with poor spatial resolution, and/or require specialized hardware that is not readily available in the imaging clinic (4). Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) is a novel MRI contrast technique (5) that is an attractive alternative to the T
