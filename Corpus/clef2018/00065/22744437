CT- versus coregistered FDG-PET/CT-based radiation therapy plans for conformal radiotherapy in colorectal liver metastases: a dosimetric comparison. Our aim was to compare computed tomography (CT) and coregistered [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT-(FDG-PET/CT) based delineation of gross tumor volume (GTV) in unresectable colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM).Fifty-four patients with unresectable CRLM were enrolled but 16 were excluded due to detection of additional hepatic metastases in ten on PET/CT scans, precluding radiotherapy because of transcendent critical organ doses beyond tolerable limits and of extrahepatic metastases in six. For 38 eligible patients, both CT and PET/CT images were acquired, and two 3D conformal plans were made using the CT and FDG-PET/CT fusion data sets. Radiotherapy plans (RTP) and doses to critical organs were analyzed.Comparisons between two RTPs revealed need for change in GTV in 31 of 38 analyzable patients (81.6 %). In 25 (65.8 %) patients, GTV was significantly increased, with a median of 33.2 % (p < 0.001), whereas median 12.8 % decrease in six (15.8 %) (p < 0.001). There were no clinically meaningful differences in critical organ doses.Coregistered FDG-PET/CT may improve delineation of GTV and theoretically reduce the likelihood of geographic misses in unresectable CRLM. Additionally, integration of FDG-PET/CT in the initial assessments of CRLM may spare almost one third of patients from potentially futile radical interventions.
