Comparative characteristics of revealing hibernated myocardium by means of perfusion and metabolic scintigraphy. comparative assessment of the informative value of the methods of perfusion and metabolic single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in detecting the hibernated myocardium.the study included a total of twenty six patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). Of these, there were 24 men and 2 women, mean age 52.0±7.0 years. All the patients in order to detect the viable myocardium were subjected to perfusion scintigraphy of the myocardium with (99)mTc-technitrile («Diamed», Russia) at rest and in a combination with the nitroglycerine test, as well as metabolic scintigraphy of the myocardium with (123)I-labelled beta-methyl-ρ-iodophenyl pentadecanic acid (BMIPP).the studies showed that sensitivity of myocardial scintigraphy with (99)mTc-technitrile on the background of the nitroglycerine test amounted to 89%, with specificity of 85% and diagnostic accuracy of 86%. While calculating the diagnostic significance of SPECT with (123)I-BMIPP, in turned out that the method's sensitivity amounted to 94%, specificity to 87%, and diagnostic accuracy to 91%.perfusion scintigraphy of the myocardium on the background of the nitroglycerine test and scintigraphic assessment of metabolism of fatty acids are highly informative tests for revealing viable portions of the ischemic myocardium, with the diagnostic parameters of SPECT with (123)I-BMIPP being slightly superior to those of perfusion scintigraphy with (99)mTc-technitrile on the background of sublingual administration of nitroglycerine.
