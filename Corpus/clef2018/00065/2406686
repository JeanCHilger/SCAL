Significance of computer analysis of dynamic brain scintigraphy in patients with cerebrovascular disorders. Dynamic cerebral scintigraphy was performed on 41 patients with cerebrovascular disease. The diagnostic value of parametric images formed by a computer was correlated to angiographic findings and clinical sings, respectively. Having the appropriate software these examinations can be performed with traditional gamma-cameras. Analysis of parametric pictures increases the reliability of the method. Analysis of cinematic display of serial images had the highest sensitivity and accuracy, while time-of-maximum pictures had the highest specificity. In departments, where digitized subtraction angiography, single photon emission computed tomography or positron emission tomography is not available, the non invasive dynamic brain scintigraphy is a useful screening method, its application is proposed by the authors.
