A partial decay scheme study of 82Rb and consequences for radiation dose measurements. Measurements of the relative emission rates of the 776 keV gamma ray, the positrons and the K x-rays in the decay of 82Rb have been repeated. This has led to the finding that the gamma ray to positron ratio is 0.1578 +/- 0.0019 and that the 776 keV gamma-ray probability per decay is (15.12 +/- 0.18)%.
