Hexa-methyl-propylene-amine-oxime (HMPAO) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in epilepsy. Twenty-eight normal volunteers and 74 seizure patients were investigated with hexa-methyl-propylene-amine-oxime (HMPAO) brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Fifty-four patients suffered from partial seizures and 20 patients had generalized seizures. Indices describing regional tracer distribution (RIs) were calculated in all investigated subjects. Regions whose RI exceeded the mean normal RI +/- 3 SD were defined as abnormally perfused. In normals a significant interhemispheric asymmetry of HMPAO deposition was found, with higher RI values in the right frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital regions. In 59.3% of partial seizure patients abnormal RIs were found. Low RIs were detected predominantly in the frontal and temporal cortex, while elevated RIs were observed predominantly in the anterior basal ganglia. Only in 20% of the cases with generalized seizures, abnormal RIs were found. In one patient an ictal and 3 follow-up SPECT studies were obtained. Here SPECT results indicated transient rCBF changes between the ictal and seizure free state. EEG and SPECT foci were ipsilaterally located in 69.2% of the partial seizure cases. The results indicate that HMPAO brain SPECT is valuable for the detection of rCBF abnormalities in seizure patients and that patients with partial seizures have mostly several abnormally perfused areas in their brains.
