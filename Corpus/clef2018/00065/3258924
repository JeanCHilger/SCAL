Synthesis and biodistribution of 99mTc-labeled piperidinyl bis(aminoethanethiol) complexes: potential brain perfusion imaging agents for single photon emission computed tomography. In developing clinically useful 99mTc-labeled radiopharmaceuticals for the evaluation of regional cerebral perfusion with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), a number of substituted alkyl(aryl)piperidinyl bis(aminoethanethiol) ligands for chelating [99mTc]TcO(III) were synthesized. Each ligand forms two diastereomers, syn and anti, after reacting with a racemic mixture of the ligand. The diastereomers were separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography. In biodistribution studies conducted in rats, the diastereomers exhibit widely disparate brain uptake values however, this disparity seems to diminish as the steric bulk of the substituent at the C-4 position of the piperidinyl moiety increases. Furthermore, all the complexes evaluated failed to show a prolonged retention in the rat brain, suggesting that further structural modification may be necessary to obtain clinically useful complexes from this class of compounds.
