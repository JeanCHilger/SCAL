Determination of the optimum filter function for SPECT imaging. An observer study was performed in order to evaluate several filters used in SPECT imaging. The filters were applied to the simulated projection data of a uniform activity density cylinder which contained a cold, spherical lesion, 2 cm in diameter. The data incorporated the effects of the detector and scatter response functions, photon attenuation, and noise. Reconstructed transaxial images were used in 2AFC and ROC observer studies testing lesion detectability. In the 2AFC experiment, the Hanning filter scored lowest and did not show a optimum cutoff frequency. The Butterworth filter performed better and showed a well-defined optimum cutoff frequency at 0.15 cycles/pixel. The Metz filter performed as well as the optimum Butterworth but did not show an optimum power factor. In the ROC study, a high power Metz filter demonstrated an ROC curve of lower Az index and different shape from a lower power Metz filter and the optimum Butterworth filter.
