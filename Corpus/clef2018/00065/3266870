Lack of correlation after reperfusion between ventricular function and infarct size estimated by thallium single-photon emission computed tomography. In 32 patients with acute myocardial infarction, who had undergone successful intracoronary thrombolysis, the results of regional wall motion measured from contrast cineangiograms 10 to 21 days after thrombolysis were related to the results of thallium single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) after intravenous dipyridamole. Wall motion was measured by means of the centerline method, and thallium defect size was estimated by comparing the patient's circumferential profile with that of 20 normals. No correlation was found between ejection fraction or regional wall motion and thallium defect size. The time from symptom onset to thrombolysis was inversely correlated with the degree of hypokinesis (r = -0.51) but not with thallium defect size. In patients treated within 3 hours, hypokinesis was significantly less than in patients treated later (-1.1 +/- 0.6 SD vs -2.2 +/- 0.8 SD, p less than 0.01) whereas thallium defect size was not significantly different in both groups. It is concluded that, in patients after thrombolysis, thallium defect size determined by SPECT does not reflect the degree of left ventricular dysfunction.
