Iodo carboxamidino-1 phenyl-4 piperazine, a new adrenomedullary imaging agent: comparison with metaiodobenzylguanidine. This report describes the comparison between two adrenal medulla imaging agents, mIBG and I-CPP. Biodistribution demonstrated an early and preferential uptake by both adrenal glands and heart and then storage in the adrenal gland of both agents, however I-CPP is less stable in vivo than mIBG. Reserpine depletion study in rat indicated that the I-CPP and mIBG uptake mechanisms are not similar.
