Character of transient ischemia in angina pectoris. There is growing interest in the possible therapeutic and prognostic significance of silent myocardial ischemia in coronary artery disease (CAD) and its detection by ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. In 100 apparently healthy normal subjects (20 with angiographically normal coronary arteries), Holter monitoring revealed significant ST-segment depression in only 2 (both over 40 years, one with positive treadmill test, the other with risk factor for CAD). No significant ECG changes were found in those with normal coronary vessels. In 30 patients with documented CAD, significant ST-segment depression during 1,934 episodes over 446 days of monitoring over 18 months was found. Only 24% of the episodes were associated with angina. Asymptomatic and symptomatic episodes were associated with comparable changes in perfusion detected by positron emission tomography. Heart rate increases greater than 10 beats/min preceding the onset of the ST-segment changes occurred in only 23% of the episodes. There was considerable variability in the ST-segment changes in the same patient monitored serially over long periods of time. The data indicate that it is extremely uncommon for patients without CAD to exhibit silent myocardial ischemia, whereas patients with stable angina exhibit frequent, variable and often asymptomatic ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia rarely triggered by increases in heart rate. These findings are likely to be of therapeutic and prognostic significance.
