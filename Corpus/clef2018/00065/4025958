Occupational respiratory disease in veterinarians. In order to determine the effect of occupational animal exposure on the occurrence of respiratory disease, we studied 257 active veterinarians and 100 control subjects who had not had occupational animal contact. All participants provided a detailed medical history and underwent spirometry, skin tests, and determination of total serum IgE levels. Asthma was significantly more prevalent in veterinarians (16.3%) than in controls (6%), (P less than .05), as was infectious/obstructive respiratory disease, 10.5% in veterinarians, 3% in controls (P less than .025). Only 13 of 257 veterinarians had respiratory symptoms related to animal contact of these, seven experienced only allergic rhinitis while six reported both asthma and rhinitis. Animal-related allergic rhinitis was found more frequently in laboratory animal veterinarians than among veterinarians in farm, pet, or poultry practice. No symptoms typical of hypersensitivity pneumonitis were reported in veterinarians, nor were precipitins to animal antigens demonstrable.
