Quantitative autoradiography with radiopharmaceuticals, Part 1: Digital film-analysis system by videodensitometry: concise communication. A simple low-cost digital film-analysis system using videodensitometry was developed to quantitate autoradiograms. It is based on a TV-film analysis system coupled to a minicomputer. Digital sampling of transmitted light intensities through the autoradiogram is performed with 8-bit gray levels according to the selected array size (128 X 128 to 1024 X 1024). The performance characteristics of the system provide sufficient stability, uniformity, linearity, and intensity response for use in quantitative analysis. Digital images of the autoradiograms are converted to radioactivity content, pixel by pixel, using step-wedge standards. This type of low-cost system can be installed on conventional mini-computers commonly used in modern nuclear medical facilities. Quantitative digital autoradiography can play an important role, with applications stretching from dosimetry calculations of radiopharmaceuticals to metabolic studies in conjunction with positron-emission tomography.
