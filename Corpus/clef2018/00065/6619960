Myocardial perfusion with rubidium-82. I. Measurement of extraction fraction and flow with external detectors. Accurate measurement of the regional extraction of a diffusible radiopharmaceutical is essential for the quantifying of regional blood flow, and may also provide an important physiologic or diagnostic indicator of the cellular viability of an organ in man through external detection by positron emission tomography. However, extraction fraction of a diffusible tracer usually decreases as flow increases, and thus noninvasive methods for measuring flow are nonlinear unless the extraction fraction can be measured independently. This report describes the theoretical basis and documents the applicability of this theory for determining, with external detectors, the first-pass regional extraction fraction of rubidium-82 by the heart, following a single intravenous bolus injection of the tracer. Measurement of extraction fraction was found to be independent of flow, thereby making it possible to determine accurately with a single intravenous bolus injection of rubidium-82, the regional blood flow in the myocardium at up to five times normal resting flow.
