Three-dimensional regional cerebral blood perfusion images with single-photon emission computed tomography. Twenty-seven patients were studied for cerebral blood perfusion abnormalities using krypton 81m. A solution of 81mKr was continuously infused into an internal carotid artery, and single-photon emission computed tomograms were recorded. The transverse section images using 81mKr represented the three-dimensional regional cerebral blood perfusion, and this technique seemed to be useful for evaluating the regional cerebral blood perfusion in the deep brain.
