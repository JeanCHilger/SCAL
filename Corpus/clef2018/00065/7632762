Nickel-57-doxorubicin, a potential radiotracer for pharmacokinetic studies using PET: production and radiolabelling. The clinical use of anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin (DXR), is hampered by tumour development of multidrug resistance (MDR). The drug efflux associated with MDR could be characterised in vivo using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in conjunction with a suitable radiolabelled drug. We are investigating DXR labelled with the positron emitter 57Ni as a potential analogue of the parent drug. Essential to this work is the production of a high purity radionuclide in a suitable chemical form for the preparation of radiolabelled DXR. To optimise production parameters, excitation functions (reaction cross section as a function of beam energy) for proton induced reactions in cobalt were measured up to 60 MeV. The excitation function for the 59Co(p,3n)57Ni reaction shows a maximum cross section of 13.8 +/- 1.5 mb at 38 MeV. The optimum energy range for production of 57Ni was found to be 41-->26 MeV resulting in an experimental thick target yield of 17.8 MBq/muAh. The level of the 56Ni impurity is only 0.21% at the end of bombardment. A radiochemical procedure, based on cation-exchange chromatography, has been developed for the separation of radionickel from the cobalt target and other radiochemical and chemical impurities. The 57Ni activity was eluted, using 2M HCl, from a Dowex-50Wx8(H+) column, in a 95% radiochemical yield. Optimum labelling of DXR has been investigated in terms of pH, reaction time and temperature, achieving radiochemical yields > 94%. DXR labelled with 57Ni therefore shows promise as a radiotracer for pharmacokinetic studies using PET.
