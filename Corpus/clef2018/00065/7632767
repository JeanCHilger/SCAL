Evaluation of a 99mTc-antimyosin kit for myocardial infarct imaging. The Fab fragment of a mouse monoclonal antibody AM(3-48) that recognizes alpha and beta-heavy chains of human atrial and ventricular myosin and beta-heavy chain of human slow skeletal muscle myosin [CardioVisionTM] was labeled with 99mTc using stannous reductant in a simple, instant kit method. The infarcted heart uptake in dogs of 99mTc-AM(3-48)Fab' was compared with that of established radiopharmaceuticals routinely used for cardiac imaging in humans. The dog infarct was induced by bringing a catheter from the femoral artery to the coronary artery where an artificial blood clot was generated. The 99mTc-AM(3-48)Fab' preparation was selectively taken up by infarcted myocardium, resulting in diagnostic quality images of the infarcted area as early as 6 hour post-injection, rendering CardioVisionTM particularly useful for SPECT imaging. Good agreement was found between the images obtained with 99mTc-Pyrophosphate and those obtained with 99mTc-AM(3-48)Fab', while the infarcted area was clearly delineated as a cold spot with 99mTc-MIBI or 201 Tl-thallous chloride. The biodistribution of 99mTc-AM(3-48)Fab' was also studied in healthy and isoproterenol-infarcted rats, from which dosimetry values in man were extrapolated. The data indicate that the kidneys will receive the highest radiation dose and that they will be the main contributors to the total radiation burden, which was estimated at 0.005 rad/mCi.
