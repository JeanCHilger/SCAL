The heterogeneity of temporal lobe epilepsy. Neurology, neuropsychology, and psychiatry. The present paper introduces the reader to the behavioral variability of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. The neurobiological variability is evidenced by reviewing neurological, neurophysiological, and neuropsychological investigations. The behavioral variability of persons affected by epilepsy with a temporal focus is proposed to be an expression of the neurobiological complexity of temporal lobe epilepsy. The aim of this paper is to encourage endeavors in behavioral taxonomy. Efforts to foster homogeneity through improved classification are considered fundamental in behavioral science and should be applied to epilepsy. The achievement of a behavioral taxonomy may help in both understanding the mechanism(s) of these behavioral disorders and targeting more specific treatments.
