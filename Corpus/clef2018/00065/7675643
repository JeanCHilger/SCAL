Brain SPECT with 123I-lisuride in patients with Parkinson's disease and controls. The goal was to visualize cerebral dopamine-D2 receptors in 6 patients with Parkinson's disease and in 3 healthy controls using iodine-123-Lisuride-SPECT. In addition, we performed receptor-replacement studies using 123I-Lisuride and cold Lisuride as competitive ligands. The highest uptake of 123I-Lisuride was observed in the striatum, a region with known high dopamine receptor density. In two patients premedication with cold Lisuride displaced 123I-Lisuride from the dopamine receptor. 123I-Lisuride is valuable as a radiotracer in cerebral dopamine-D2 receptor scintigraphy. Whether or not it is possible to determine dynamic changes of dopamine receptor density or function by receptor replacement studies needs further evaluation in larger patient populations.
