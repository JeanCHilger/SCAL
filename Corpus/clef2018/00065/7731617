SPET quality control: a comprehensive test procedure for evaluating the rotation system parameters COR-offset, y-shift and detector tilt. This paper describes a method for SPET quality control that facilitates the determination of COR-offset, parallel y-shift and detector tilt by means of a single, comprehensive test using a special phantom consisting of three point sources. The evaluation of the method was performed by a series of measurements utilizing manually adjusted detector tilts and a simulation of y-shift by moving the phantom. The results show that y-shift and detector tilt are measured with reasonable accuracy, and that y-shift caused by variations in detector tilt can be differentiated from y-shift caused by other factors.
