Canine SPECT studies for cerebral amino acid transport by means of 123I-3-iodo-alpha-methyl-L-tyrosine and preliminary kinetic analysis. We have already reported that 123I-3-iodo-alpha-methyl-L-tyrosine (123I-L-AMT) is superior as a single-photon emitter labeled radiopharmaceutical reflecting cerebral amino acid transport. In this study, we investigated the distribution of 123I-L-AMT in the canine head by means of SPECT and kinetically analyzed the data in the brain. As a result, clear SPECT images of the canine brain were obtained. Kinetic analysis with a 2-compartment model, including or expressing membrane transport of the amino acid, was performed with time-activity curves in the arterial blood and in the cerebral region. The results of the analysis coincided closely with the experimental data and the relevance of the model was strongly suggested. Therefore 123I-L-AMT is considered to be useful as a single photon radiopharmaceutical which enables us to measure the cerebral amino acid transport rate.
