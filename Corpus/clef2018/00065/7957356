Scatter correction in scintigraphy: the state of the art. In scintigraphy, the detection of scattered photons degrades both visual image analysis and quantitative accuracy. Many methods have been proposed and are still under investigation to cope with scattered photons. The main features of the problem of scattering in radionuclide imaging are presented first, to provide a sound foundation for a critical review of the existing scatter correction techniques. These are described using a classification relating to their aims and principles. Their theoretical potentials are analysed, as well as the difficulties of their practical implementation. Finally, the problems of their evaluation and comparison are discussed.
