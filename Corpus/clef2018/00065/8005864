Interrelationships between regional blood flow, blood volume, and ventilation in supine humans. Positron emission tomography was used to measure alveolar gas volume, pulmonary blood volume (VB), regional alveolar ventilation (VA), and the regional ventilation-to-perfusion ratio (VA/Q) in a transaxial slice at midheart level in eight supine subjects and one prone normal subject during quiet breathing. These relationships allow regional blood flow (Q) to be calculated as VA/(VA/Q). No significant differences between right and left lung were found. Within the volume studied, which excluded the peripheral 2 cm of the lung, there was an exponential increase in Q by 11%/cm from 1.2 ml.min-1.cm-3 in the upper (ventral) to 3.5 ml.min-1.cm-3 in the lower (dorsal) lung regions, explaining 61% of the total variation within groups, whereas the horizontal gradient only explained 7% (right lung supine subjects). Similar gravitational gradients were found in the single prone subject. VA and Q were well matched except at the dorsal lung thoracic border where low values of VA/Q due to a reduction in ventilation were occasionally found even in these normal subjects. VB and Q were reasonably well matched, implying that variations in vascular transit time due to gravity are kept to a minimum. The coefficient of local variation of peripheral vascular transit times (VB/Q) (33%) was, therefore, less than would have been expected if VB and Q were uncorrelated (57%).
