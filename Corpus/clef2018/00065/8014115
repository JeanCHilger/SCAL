Functional neuroanatomy of the human brain: positron emission tomography--a new neuroanatomical technique. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive radiotracer-based technique which increasingly is being applied to describe the functional anatomy of the human brain in life. It is a technically sophisticated approach to perfusion mapping, and is predicated on the fact that increases and decreases of synaptic activity in the brain are accompanied by appropriate and equivalent changes in local glucose consumption and perfusion (Raichle, 1987 Mata et al. 1980
