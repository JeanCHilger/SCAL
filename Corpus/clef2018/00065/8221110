High metabolic activity demonstrated by positron emission tomography in human auditory cortex in case of deafness of early onset. Glucose metabolism has been studied in the auditory cortex of human subjects with deafness of early onset, and compared to normal subjects with ears plugged. The metabolism in the auditory cortex and in the association auditory cortex was higher in deaf subjects than in normal subjects. This result is compared to similar observations that we made previously in the visual cortex of human subjects with blindness of early onset.
