Biplane transesophageal pacing echocardiography compared with dipyridamole thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography in detecting coronary artery disease. TPE is a new diagnostic technique that uses simultaneous graded transesophageal left atrial pacing and biplane transesophageal echocardiography for the detection of pacing-induced wall motion abnormalities. In a prospective study 30 patients underwent biplane TPE, dipyridamole thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and coronary arteriography. The sensitivity (86% vs 95%, p = not significant [NS]), specificity (89% vs 56%, p = NS), positive predictive value (95% vs 73%, p = NS), and negative predictive value (83% vs 83%, p = NS) of biplane TPE and thallium-201 SPECT in identifying patients with significant coronary artery disease was similar. In the 90 vascular territories analyzed, the agreement between biplane TPE and thallium-201 SPECT for presence or absence of significant disease was 71%. Analysis of the three major vascular territories demonstrated that each imaging modality had a high sensitivity and specificity in the left anterior descending and right coronary artery segments. However, the two techniques demonstrated poorly sensitivity in the segmental distribution of the circumflex coronary artery. In conclusion, biplane TPE compared favorably with thallium-201 SPECT in terms of safety and accuracy for detecting significant coronary artery disease. Accordingly, biplane TPE may be a suitable alternative for those patients with nondiagnostic thallium-201 SPECT studies and in those with contraindications to adenosine or dipyridamole.
