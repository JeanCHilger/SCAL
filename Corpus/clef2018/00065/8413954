Frontal lobe epilepsy: clinical seizure characteristics and localization with ictal 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT. We evaluated ictal 99mtechnetium hexamethyl propylene-amine-oxime single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 22 children with electroclinical features of frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE). Ictal SPECT demonstrated unilateral frontal hyperperfusion in 20 of 22 children (91%) (one lobar, two frontocentral, six dorsolateral, six frontopolar, three orbitofrontal, one medial frontal, and one insula), concordant with electroclinical lateralization in 19 of 20 (95%). Hyperperfusion was evident in the ipsilateral basal ganglia in 16 of 22 (73%) and the contralateral cerebellum in 14 of 22 children (64%). Interictal SPECT showed unilateral, localized frontal hypoperfusion concordant with electroclinical lateralization in only two of 22 children (9%). Ictal SPECT localization to the frontocentral, media frontal, or dorsolateral regions was associated with asymmetric tonic posturing, contralateral head/eye deviation, and unilateral clonic jerking (p < 0.01). Ictal SPECT localization to the frontopolar or orbitofrontal regions was associated with vocalization, hyperventilation, truncal flexion, and complex gestural automatisms (p > or = 0.05). Ictal SPECT has the potential to (1) localize seizures in patients with intractable FLE, and (2) advance understanding of the in vivo anatomico-clinical relationships of frontal lobe seizures.
