Ictal/postictal SPECT in the pre-surgical localisation of complex partial seizures. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) used in conjunction with HM-PAO (Ceretec-Amersham International) was used to image regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 28 patients with medically intractable complex partial seizures during or soon after a seizure, and interictally. Changes from interictal rCBF were seen in 26/28 (93%) patients. The main findings were 1) During the seizure--hyperperfusion of the whole temporal lobe
