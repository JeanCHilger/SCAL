Effect of propentofylline on regional cerebral glucose metabolism in acute ischemic stroke. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study in 30 patients with acute ischemic stroke, the effect of the adenosine uptake blocker propentofylline on regional brain glucose metabolism (rCMRglu) was investigated using repeated positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). Treatment was initiated within 48 h after onset of symptoms. The clinical course was followed for 3 months. In the propentofylline group, after 14 days rCMRglu was increased in the infarct by 37.3% and was practically unchanged in other brain regions, whereas in the control group glucose metabolism had decreased in all regions (1.4-13.4%). These differences were significant between the two groups [Analysis of variance (ANOVA) p = 0.005]. Although there was a trend toward greater clinical improvement in the propentofylline-treated patients, this did not reach statistical significance. The results correspond to experimental data showing that propentofylline improves energy metabolism in cerebral ischemia. A clinical trial is needed to determine whether this new therapeutic principle can be successfully used in acute human stroke.
