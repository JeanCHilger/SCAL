The functional anatomy of memory. A review of recent work using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to examine brain systems involved in auditory-verbal memory is presented. Initial work delineated widespread brain regions which were, to a large extent, in agreement with existing neuropsychological literature. Expanding on this, a number of studies have examined memory encoding and retrieval separately. Additionally, experiments have been carried out to specifically address sub-components of memory such as the use of visual imagery as a mnemonic strategy, the functional anatomical evidence for the episodic/semantic memory distinction and the different brain regions involved in explicit and implicit memory tasks.
