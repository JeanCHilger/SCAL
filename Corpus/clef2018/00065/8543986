PET hydroxyephedrine imaging of neuroblastoma. The goals of this investigation were to characterize the uptake of 11C-hydroxyephedrine (HED) in neuroblastoma and to determine the feasibility and potential advantages of utilizing this compound as a tumor imaging agent.Seven patients with known or subsequently proven neuroblastoma were studied. Each patient underwent PET scanning with 11C-HED. Six of seven patients underwent scintigraphy with [123I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), and two patients were also studied with [18F]FDG PET. For six patients, CT or MR images were available for comparison.Neuroblastomas were located by PET scanning with 11C-HED in all seven patients. The uptake of HED into neuroblastomas was rapid tumors were evident on images within 5 min postintravenous injection. Those lesions in the field of view of the PET camera were also identified on [123I]MIBG scintigraphic images. In two patients, tumor deposits in the abdomen were better visualized with MIBG scintigraphy due to relatively less hepatic accumulation of MIBG than HED.PET scanning with HED for neuroblastoma results in high quality functional images of the tumors that can be obtained within minutes following injection.
