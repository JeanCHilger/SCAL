Positron emission tomography. Cost-benefit considerations. To date, positron emission tomography (PET) is the most powerful tool for the non-invasive study of biochemical processes. Besides its usefulness for basic research PET has been proven to be superior to conventional diagnostic methods in several clinical indications. However, the introduction of PET into clinical practice has been hindered considerably by its costs. Several American studies lend support to the hypothesis that PET may be more cost-effective than the conventional diagnostic work-up-at least for some of its clinical indications. In Germany, however, this hypothesis has still not been verified.
