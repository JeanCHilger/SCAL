Tc-99m MIBI brain SPECT of cerebellopontine angle tumors. To prospectively evaluate the imaging feasibility of Tc-99m sestamibi brain SPECT of cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumors, seven patients with CPA lesions seen on CT or MRI and five normal control subjects underwent brain SPECT using a triple-headed camera. Five of these patients had acoustic neuromas, one had a meningloma, and the other had a vascular loop. Subsequently, four patients underwent surgery. In normal control subjects and patients with CPA lesions, there was Tc-99m sestamibi activity in the pituitary gland, choroid plexi, and extraocular muscles. The uptake in these structures, especially the choroid plexi could not be blocked by the oral administration of potassium perchlorate in two normal subjects. Four of seven patients with CPA lesions larger than 1.0 cm in diameter showed tumor uptake (3 acoustic schwannomas, 1 meningloma). Two small ( > 1.0 cm in diameter) intracanalicular type acoustic neuromas failed to show uptake, despite additional attenuation correction for the petrous bone. There was no abnormal uptake in the patient with a vascular loop in the CPA. Preliminary data suggest that, with the exception of small intracanalicular neuromas, CPA tumors can be imaged using Tc-99m sestamibi brain SPECT.
