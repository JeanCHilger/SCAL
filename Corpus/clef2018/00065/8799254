Fluorine 18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography: an alternative for determining myocardial viability. The identification of hibernating myocardium in patients with poor ventricular function has become increasingly important as investigators demonstrate an improvement in ventricular performance in patients with injured but viable myocardium who undergo surgical revascularization. Modifications of 201Tl redistribution protocols and rest/stress 99mTc-labeled hexakis-2-methoxy-2-methyl propylisonitrile perfusion studies continue to underestimate myocardial viability compared with resting 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) positron emission tomography. The combined data from multiple investigators suggest that 18FDG single-photon emission computed tomography used in combination with cardiac perfusion agents, either sequentially or with simultaneous dual-isotope acquisition, may provide an acceptable alternative to positron emission tomographic imaging for the detection of hibernating myocardium.
