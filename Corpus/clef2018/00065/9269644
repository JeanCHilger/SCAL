In vivo and in vitro effects of amino-acid-based and bicarbonate-buffered peritoneal dialysis solutions with regard to peritoneal transport and cytokines/prostanoids dialysate concentrations. Increasing evidence suggests that conventional PD solutions are detrimental to host defence mechanisms of peritoneal cells. We tested a new amino-acid-based and bicarbonate-buffered PD solution under in vivo and in vitro conditions.During a prospective, cross-over randomized, intraindividual study 10 CAPD patients were investigated with three different solutions: Amino/Bic, 1% amino acid, 34 mmol/l bicarbonate Glu/Bic, 1.5% glucose, 34 mmol/l bicarbonateApplication of an amino-acid/bicarbonate solution resulted in a small but significant increase in peritoneal permeability. Also increased concentrations of various cytokines/prostanoids were measured in the effluent. According to in vitro testing with mononuclear phagocytes both bicarbonate-buffered fluids were to the same extent less inhibitory to certain cell functions than lactate-buffered solution.
