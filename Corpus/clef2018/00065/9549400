Evaluation of cardiac sympathetic innervation with 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine in patients with diabetes mellitus. To evaluate the usefulness of iodine-123 metaiodobencylguanidine (123I-MIBG) in the study of the cardiac autonomic neuropathy in insulin-dependent diabetic patients, by means of: a) analysis of heart to mediastinic ratio and tomographic images with 123I-MIBG b) comparison with conventional non-invasive cardiac reflex test, and c) analysis of left ventricle ejection fraction.Ten patients submitted for cardiac evaluation with 123I-MIBG were compared with a control group of 11 patients. In both groups we excluded the presence of coronary pathology by means of an exercise test. We carried out planar and SPECT studies, using 123I-MIBG, and the calculation of the ejection fraction by equilibrium ventriculography.The uptake of 123I-MIBG in diabetic patients was significantly smaller than the control group in the calculated index (heart to mediastinic ratio: 1.64 +/- 0.20 vs 2.00 +/- 0.26 p < 0.001Despite the small sample population, insuli-dependent diabetic patients in show a significant reduction of the uptake of 23I-MIBG, more accentuated in the base. Scintigraphy using 123I-MIBG can be an approach to investigate the pattern and the natural history of the sympathetic innervation in these patients.
