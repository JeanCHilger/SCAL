The practical utility of performing peri-ictal SPECT in the evaluation of children with partial epilepsy. Peri-ictal brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is increasingly being established as a useful test in localizing partial epilepsy in adults. However, obtaining an ictal injection and acquiring the SPECT images poses a greater challenge in pediatric patients, and few reports have specifically addressed the practical use of this technique in children. The Mayo Clinic experience of peri-ictal SPECT in the evaluation of children with partial epilepsy is reported here. Peri-ictal SPECT was attempted during 71 admissions involving 59 patients (median age 12 years, range 1 year 6 months-17 years). A peri-ictal SPECT injection was performed on 48 (67.6%) of these admissions in 43 (72.9%) patients, and only two patients could not be scanned. Of the 46 peri-ictal images successfully obtained, 30 (65.2%) were from ictal injection and 16 (34.8%) from post-ictal injections. Forty-two (91.3%) of the successfully obtained SPECT images, in 38 patients (92.3%), were classified as localizing (15 temporal, 24 extratemporal). We conclude that, with the appropriate unit setup and well-trained staff, peri-ictal SPECT scans can be obtained in most pediatric partial epilepsy patients. Moreover, the procedure provides specific localizing information in a high proportion of these patients.
