Prognosis in patients with left bundle branch block and normal dipyridamole thallium-201 scintigraphy. The presence of complete left bundle branch block (LBBB) is commonly associated with a poorer prognosis, especially in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). In the general population with suspected CAD and normal intraventricular conduction, a normal dipyridamole-thallium scintigraphy is a strong marker of a favorable outcome.Our objective was to assess the prognosis in patients with LBBB and a normal dipyridamole thallium-201 scintigram.Patients with complete LBBB and normal myocardial perfusion on dipyridamole SPECT thallium-201 scintigraphy performed in our center for suspected CAD between 1988 and 1995 were monitored for clinical events.Sixty-nine patients (36 women and 33 men) with a mean age of 59 years (range 56 to 61) were monitored for a mean period of 33 months (range 25 to 35). During this period, 4 patients had unstable angina, 2 of whom underwent myocardial revascularization. There were no deaths or myocardial infarction. All events occurred at least 2 years after the thallium-201 scintigraphy.The presence of a normal myocardial perfusion with dipyridamole thallium-201 scintigraphy in this group of patients with suspected CAD and LBBB was associated with a very good prognosis, a low rate of clinical events occurring only 2 years after the myocardial scintigraphy, and no hard events.
