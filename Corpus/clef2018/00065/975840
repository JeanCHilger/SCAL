Element and chlorinated hydrocarbon content of commercial pet foods. An analytical survey has been conducted of 42 elements, p,p'-DDE, dieldrin andpolychlorinated biphenyls in 31 commercial canned pet foods. Neutron activation analysis, graphite furnace atomic absorption, anodic stripping voltammetry, electron affinity gas chromatography and other methods were used. Arsenic, bromine, cadmium, chromium, mercury, selenium and DDE were highest in fish-containing cat foods. Lead was most consistently high in those products containing chicken. Barium, nickel and tin also appeared high in certain of the samples.
