Combined scatter and attenuation correction for 201Tl myocardial perfusion SPECT using OS-EM algorithm. There are two possible ways to obtain scatter-corrected images with the ML-EM (maximum likelihood expectation maximization) algorithm: one is the subtraction of scatter estimate si from projection data pi, and then (pi-si) is used for scatter-corrected projection data (denoted as SC(T)) the other method is the addition of scatter estimate si to the projections calculated from the reconstructed image without performing data subtraction (SC(E)). This paper investigated these two ML-EM algorithms of combined scatter and attenuation correction on 201Tl myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging. Scatter windows were placed one full width at half maximum (FWHM) below and above the photopeak centerline. The scatter fraction in the primary peak was estimated using trapezoidal approximation by the triple energy window method. Phantom and clinical images were reconstructed using 6 iterations of ordered subsets EM algorithm (OS-EM). A cylindrical phantom with a cold-rod insert and a heart/thorax phantom with liver insert were used to evaluate scatter and the attenuation compensation technique. A cylindrical phantom filled with uniform 201Tl solution was used to evaluate statistical noise. The percent root-mean-square uncertainty (%RMSU) was used as a quantitative measure of noise amplification. %RMSU showed that the SC(E) method amplified noise less in comparison with the SC(T) method, however, no significant difference in image quality was observed between the two methods. In conclusion, both the SC(T) and SC(E) methods provided significant and similar improvement in the removal of scatter in 201Tl myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging.
