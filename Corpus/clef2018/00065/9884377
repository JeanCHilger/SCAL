Functional recovery of subepicardial myocardial tissue in transmural myocardial infarction after successful reperfusion: an important contribution to the improvement of regional and global left ventricular function. The transmural extent of myocardial necrosis after an acute coronary artery occlusion can vary considerably. The contribution of residual subepicardial viable myocardium to global left ventricular function is largely unknown.We studied 12 patients with single-vessel disease 1 week after successful reperfusion of a first transmural anterior myocardial infarction (MI). With PET, myocardial blood flow (MBF) and glucose metabolism were measured regionally, and the viability was graded as normal, mismatch, or match with severely (<50% of normal) or intermediately (50% to 80% of normal) impaired MBF. Magnetic resonance tagging was used to regionally quantify fiber strains, wall thickening, and ejection fraction in patients 1 week and 3 months after the MI and in age-matched healthy volunteers. From 1 week to 3 months, subepicardial fiber shortening improved significantly in the match region (MBF <50%, -5.1+/-7.0% to -9.9+/-8. 7% MBF of 50% to 80%, -7.1+/-7.6% to -14.9+/-7.9%). This was associated with an improvement in regional ejection fraction in the infarcted myocardium (29.6+/-21.8% to 43.5+/-15.5%, P<0.0001) and in normal regions (54.3+/-15.1% to 56.5+/-13.1%, P=0.013), contributing to an increase in global ejection fraction from 44.2+/-22.2% to 49. 3+/-17.9% (P<0.0001).Functional recovery of viable subepicardial regions is a mechanism of late improvement in regional and global ejection fraction after a so-called transmural MI.
