The design and pharmacology of novel selective muscarinic agonists and antagonists. The muscarinic pharmacology of C1-methyl-substituted chiral compounds related to McN-A-343 and of (R)- and (S)-dimethindene has been studied. Among the McN-A-343 analogues, the (S)-enantiomers were more potent and had higher affinity than the (R)-isomers. The quaternary compound (S)-BN 228 was found to be the most potent M1-selective agonist known today (pEC50: M1/rabbit vas deferens = 7.83 M2/guinea-pig atria = 6.35
