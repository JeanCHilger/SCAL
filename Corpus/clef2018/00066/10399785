Interactive fusion of three-dimensional images of upper abdominal CT and FDG PET with no body surface markers. The aim of this study was to propose and validate a new method of making fused images from CT and FDG PET images for the upper abdominal area with no body surface marker. PET and CT were carried out in patients with pancreatic cancer (N = 5) and mass-forming pancreatitis (N = 2). First, we determined the midsagittal plane from PET and CT data. From the difference in location of the midsagittal planes, rotations of Y (from back to front) and Z axes (from foot to head) and X translation (from right to left) were calculated. An upper pole of the kidney was determined from PET and CT data. It showed Y and Z translations. The images of the three-dimensional data sets were fused on a workstation. Reproducibility was assessed with randomly misaligned PET and CT data sets. Pancreatic cancer and its lymph node metastases were identified easily on fused images. In reproducibility assessment, the average error of rotation was 0.77 degree. The average errors of translation were 3.43, 4.70, and 9.23 mm on the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively. In conclusion, this PET/CT image registration technique is feasible and practical. It allows precise anatomical assessment of normal and abnormal FDG accumulation.
