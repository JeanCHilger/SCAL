Collection conditions of ECG-gated myocardial SPECT. In ECG-gated myocardial SPECT, we evaluated the effects of data acquisition and imaging conditions on the parameters of left ventricular cardiac function by a phantom experiments and in patients (n = 50) and normal controls (n = 15). Data acquisition was performed under the following conditions: (1) matrix size, 64 x 64 or 128 x 128 R-R interval, 8 or 6 frames
