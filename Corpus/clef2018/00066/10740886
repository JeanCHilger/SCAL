Positron emission tomography: radioisotope and radiopharmaceutical production. A Centre for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has been operational within the Department of Nuclear Medicine at the Austin & Repatriation Medical Centre (A&RMC) in Melbourne for seven years. PET is a non-invasive imaging technique based on the use of biologically relevant compounds labelled with short-lived positron-emitting radionuclides such as carbon-11, nitrogen-13, oxygen-15 and fluorine-18. The basic facility consists of a medical cyclotron (10 MeV proton & 5 MeV deuteron), six lead-shielded hotcells with associated radiochemistry facilities, radiopharmacy and a whole body PET scanner. A strong radiolabelling development program, including the production of 15O-oxygen, 15O-carbon monoxide, 15O-carbon dioxide, 15O-water, 13N-ammonia, 18F-FDG, 18F-FMISO, 11C-SCH23390 and 11C-flumazenil has been pursued to support an ambitious clinical and research program in neurology, oncology, cardiology and psychiatry.
