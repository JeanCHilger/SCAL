Cytokine expression in vitro by cultured human endothelial cells in contact with polyethylene terephthalate coated with pyrolytic carbon and collagen. In order to evaluate whether or not polyethylene terephthalate coated with pyrolytic carbon and collagen (PET+PC) favors inflammatory or hyperplastic reactions, the expression of mRNAs specific for interleukin-6 (IL-6), platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGF-A), PDGF-B, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), and TGF-beta2 were tested in vitro by cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The cultures were put in contact with PET+PC for 1, 24, 48, and 72 h. The same cells cultured on polystyrene without biomaterials were tested as negative controls cultures incubated with LPS were the positive control. The expression of mRNAs was evaluated by RT-PCR with specific primers. PET+PC did not determine any differences in the expression of IL-6-specific mRNA at any of the incubation times compared to the negative control while LPS (the positive control) induced expression after 24, 48, and 72 h. PET+PC induced a more precocious expression of mRNA specific for PDGF-A than did the negative control
