Significant regional heterogeneity of coronary flow reserve in paediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Previous studies have indicated that cardiac events in young patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are related to ischaemia rather than to arrhythmia. We measured coronary flow reserve in paediatric HCM and compared the values with those in adult HCM. We studied 12 patients with HCM including six paediatric (<20 years old mean 13 years) and six adult patients (>20 years old: mean 62 years), and six healthy young adults (mean 29 years) as controls. Every patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for anatomical assessment. Myocardial blood flow at rest and after dipyridamole infusion was measured with dynamic nitrogen-13 ammonia positron emission tomography (PET). Partial volume effect was corrected for using the anatomical data obtained with MRI. In adult patients with HCM, coronary flow reserve in the hypertrophied septal region was not significantly different from that in the non-hypertrophied lateral wall (1.38+/-0.29 vs 1.77+/-0.39, respectively). In the paediatric patients, coronary flow reserve in the hypertrophied septal region was significantly lower than in the non-hypertrophied lateral wall (0.84+/-0.33 vs 2.74+/-0.90, respectively, P<0.01). In addition, coronary flow reserve in adult patients was lower than in control subjects both in the septal wall (1.38+/-0.29 vs 2.94+/-0.35, respectively, P<0.0001) and in the lateral wall (1.77+/-0.39 vs 2.85+/-0.69, respectively, P<0.05). In contrast, coronary flow reserve in paediatric patients was not significantly different from that in control subjects in the lateral wall (2.74+/-0.90 vs 2.85+/-0.69, respectively), while absolute reduction of myocardial blood flow was noted after pharmacological vasodilatation in the hypertrophied septal region. In conclusion, significant regional differences of coronary flow reserve were present in the paediatric patients with HCM. These results suggest that paediatric patients with HCM intrinsically have the potential to experience significant regional ischaemia even in the absence of coronary stenosis.
