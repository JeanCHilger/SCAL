3-[123I]iodo-alpha-methyl-L-tyrosine transport and 4F2 antigen expression in human glioma cells. 3[(123)I]iodo-alpha-methyl-L-tyrosine is a tracer of amino acid transport in brain tumors using single-photon emission-computed tomography and predominantly transported by amino acid transport system L. The 4F2 antigen has been identified to be linked to system L-like transport and is assumed to be a part of the transporter protein. We demonstrated that system L-mediated transport of IMT and 4F2 antigen expression are dependent on proliferation rate of human glioma cells and significantly correlated with each other.
