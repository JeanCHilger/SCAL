Use of 99Tcm-MIBI scintigraphy in the evaluation of perfusion improvement after myocardial revascularization with the use of the left internal thoracic artery. In spite of successful revascularization, in a significant group of patients myocardial ischaemia is present after surgery. The final effect of surgery depends on preoperative left ventricular function, initial coronary artery status, completeness of revascularization, the use of arterial or venous grafts, and many other factors. The aim of our 99Tcm-MIBI scintigraphy study was to examine the improvement of perfusion in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) vascular territory after revascularization with the use of the left internal thoracic artery (LITA), with respect to the LAD diameter and use of additional venous graft to diagonal artery. The study group consisted of 45 subjects (42 male, three female) aged 34-68 years (mean age 50.9+/-8.3 years) recruited from patients in whom LITA was grafted into LAD. The operation and postoperative period was uneventful in all patients. Two weeks before, and 3-4 months after surgery, dipyridamole-rest sestamibi SPECT were performed. The revascularization significantly improved both stress (deltaPI = 0.77+/-0.66 P < 0.001) and rest (deltaPI = 0.32+/-0.60
