Binding rate constant of Tc-99m DTPA galactosyl human serum albumin measured by quantitative dynamic SPECT--clinical evaluation as a total and regional liver function test. To evaluate the clinical utility of a new method with dynamic single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and scatter and attenuation compensation to estimate both total and regional liver function quantitatively. Five controls, 20 patients with chronic liver disease, and 2 patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome were studied. Dynamic liver SPECT data were acquired during 20 minutes after injection of Technetium (Tc)-99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) galactosyl human serum albumin (GSA) with scatter and attenuation compensation. The binding rate constant of Tc-99m GSA (Ku) was derived quantitatively from the Patlak plot based on kinetic models for GSA receptor binding. The mean Ku was obtained by dividing the Ku value (total Ku) by the liver volume. Both total and mean Ku were significantly lower in patients with chronic liver disease than in controls (302 +/- 112 vs. 523 +/- 78 ml/min p < 0.001, 0.26 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.43 +/- 0.03 ml/min/cm3
