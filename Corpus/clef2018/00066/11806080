Assessment of myocardial fatty acid metabolism in patients with angina pectoris and diabetes mellitus using 123I-BMIPP myocardial scintigraphy. We studied the effect of myocardial ischemia and diabetes mellitus (DM) on the myocardial fatty acid metabolism using 123I-BMIPP myocardial scintigraphy.We performed 123I-BMIPP myocardial scintigraphy in 50 patients with myocardial ischemia and without DM (AP), in 30 patients with myocardial ischemia and DM (AP + DM), 12 patients with DM and without myocardial ischemia (DM), and in 10 normal subjects (N). Myocardial uptake rate of 123I-BMIPP was obtained using the time activity curve. Myocardial washout rate of 123I-BMIPP was calculated using the polar images of early and delayed SPECT images.Myocardial uptake rate of 123I-BMIPP (%) were AP: 4.9 +/- 0.6, AP + DM: 5.5 +/- 0.5, DM 5.7 +/- 0.5 and N: 5.0 +/- 0.4. 123I-BMIPP myocardial uptake rate was increased in AP + DM and DM. 123I-BMIPP myocardial washout rate (%) were AP: 30.2 +/- 4.3, AP + DM: 24.5 +/- 3.9, DM: 16.1 +/- 2.8 and N: 19.4 +/- 3.2. 123I-BMIPP myocardial washout rate was increased in AP and AP + DM. 123I-BMIPP myocardial washout rate was increased particularly in patients with multi-vessels disease. 123I-BMIPP myocardial washout rate was decreased in DM.The present study suggested that diabetes mellitus increased myocardial fatty acid uptake and decreased myocardial fatty acid washout, and that myocardial ischemia increased myocardial fatty acid washout.
