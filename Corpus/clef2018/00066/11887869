Clinical outcome in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients is not influenced by high peritoneal transport status. We undertook this study to examine the influence of demographics, peritoneal membrane transport characteristics, nutrition indices, dialysis adequacy, and comorbid diseases on patient survival on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and to identify whether high peritoneal membrane transport is an independent risk factor for mortality on CAPD.Our retrospective study was carried out in CAPD patients in a large tertiary care teaching hospital.Until December 2000, we followed 212 patients who started CAPD between 1994 and 1997 and who underwent a peritoneal equilibration test (PET) within 3 months of CAPD initiation.By univariate analysis, comorbid diseases, old age, high peritoneal transport, and serum albumin predicted patient mortality. Independent predictors of mortality as determined by the Cox proportional hazard model included diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, serum albumin, and old age. High peritoneal transport failed to independently influence mortality in our CAPD patients.
