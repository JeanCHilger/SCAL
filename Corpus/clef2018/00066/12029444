Detection of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinomas with positron emission tomography using 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose in patients with indeterminate magnetic resonance imaging findings after radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of positron emission tomography (PET) using 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) to detect recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are indeterminate.After radiotherapy, 28 NPC patients with indeterminate MRI findings were included. MRI, FDG-PET, and biopsy were performed at least 4 months after radiotherapy and within 1 week. The final results were based on histopathologic findings and a clinical follow-up of at least 6 months.For detecting recurrent NPC in indeterminate MRI findings, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of FDG-PET were 100.0%, 92.9% and 96.4%, respectively.Based on these results, we can recommend FDG-PET for detecting recurrent NPC when MRI findings are indeterminate.
