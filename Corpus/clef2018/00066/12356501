The effects of irradiation and hyperbaric oxygen on bone formation during rabbit mandibular distraction. [18F-]fluoride positron-emission tomography (PET) was used to assess bone formation during mandibular distraction osteogenesis. There were three study groups: irradiation, irradiation+hyperbaric oxygen and control. The two experimental groups received a tumoricidal dose of irradiation to the mandible, and one group was also given hyperbaric oxygen (2.5 ATA (atmospheres absolute) for 90 min) 18 times preoperatively. Control animals received neither irradiation nor oxygen. A unilateral osteotomy was made and, after a period of latency, bone distraction was started, continued for 2 weeks, and the distraction generated was then allowed to consolidate for 4 weeks. The first PET study was performed at the end of distraction and the second at the end of consolidation. At the end of distraction, the metabolic activity of bone in the distracted area was significantly higher in the controls than in either experimental group differences between the experimental groups were not statistically significant. By the end of consolidation, activity in the control group had diminished to the same as in the two experimental groups, in which no significant change had occurred. Radioactivity was still significantly higher at second imaging on the distracted than non-distracted side in the control and irradiation+hyperbaric oxygen groups, but not in the group that was only irradiated. The results indicate that previous irradiation disturbs bone formation during mandibular distraction osteogenesis. Hyperbaric oxygen was not able to prevent the suppression of osteogenesis caused by radiotherapy but it might improve bone formation by prolonging high osteogenic activity.
