Novel techniques in the delivery of radiation in pediatric oncology. The field of radiation oncology continues to develop at a rapid pace, due to concurrent progress in high speed computing, improved sensitivity in diagnostic imaging (both anatomic and physiologic), and the introduction of rational new therapeutics built on solid radiobiologic principles. These innovations will become critically important in the field of pediatric oncology, as they will allow for an increased therapeutic ratio in the developing child. Maximizing the benefit of lower dose radiation through the use of radiation modifiers (hypoxic cell sensitizers, signal transduction pathway inhibitors, concurrent chemotherapy), increasing the tolerance of normal tissues (radioprotectors) and tailoring the target area more closely to the desired critical tissues (IMRT, functional simulation with PET and MRS, radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies) will lessen the short and long term toxicity of radiation and increase its effectiveness.
