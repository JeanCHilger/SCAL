Enhancement of the relative uptake of 18F-FDG in mouse fibrosarcoma by rolipram. The effect of rolipram, a selective phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor, on the uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in tumor tissue was examined in mice transplanted with NFSa fibrosarcoma. The uptake indexes of 18F-FDG in the heart, skeletal muscle and brain remarkably decreased after treatment with 3 mg/kg of rolipram (heart: 13%, skeletal muscle: 14%, brain: 31%), but fibrosarcoma tissue showed only a 50% reduction in the uptake index of 18F-FDG. The tumor/muscle ratio of radioactivity 30 min after 18F-FDG injection was consequently enhanced from 1.9 to 6.5 by rolipram. This indicates the possible use of rolipram to enhance the sensitivity of tumor detection, as well as characterization of tumors in 18F-FDG PET.
