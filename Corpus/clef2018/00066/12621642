Decreased striatal dopamine transporter binding in a patient with extrapontine myelinolysis. We describe the case of a 61-year-old woman who developed extrapontine myelinolysis (EPM) with parkinsonism. Decreased striatal dopamine transporter binding assessed by [(123)I]N-(3-iodopropen-2-yl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl) tropane and single photon emission computed tomography ([(123)I]IPT) SPECT) were observed in the patient, suggesting that osmotic injury causes the demyelination of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and that such injury may be involved in the pathogenesis of EPM with parkinsonism.
