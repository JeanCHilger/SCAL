Repair of large bone defect due to excision of bone tumor with bone allograft. To study the reparative and reconstructive methods for the large bone defect due to the excision of bone tumor.According to the size and shape of the bone defect, we selected the proper bone and joint or manipulated bone segment of the profound hypothermia freezing allograft and gave locked intramedullary nails or steel plate and screws for stable internal fixation.In the 22 cases, 20 survived without tumor and 2 died. One patient treated with the allograft of semi-knee joint was found rejection. Then the wound did not heal. After the skin flap grafting was performed, the wound still did not heal, so the patient accepted amputation(4.5%). In the other 21 cases, the X-ray and 99mTc SPECT showed some callus or concentration of nuclein which implied bone union. According to Markin bone graft criterion, the excellent rate of function recovery was 81.8%.Allografting of bone and joint is a good and workable method in repairing and reconstructing the bone defect due to the excision of bone tumor. It should be further studied and be applied.
