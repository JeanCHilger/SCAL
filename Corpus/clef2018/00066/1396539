Single photon emission computed tomography using perfusion tracers in seizure disorders. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using perfusion tracers makes it possible to estimate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and, indirectly, local brain metabolism. It may be possible to detect and follow physiopathological alterations, such as may be seen in seizure disorders. The authors review the principles of and some data on perfusion SPECT in seizure disorders, stress advantages as well as major drawbacks and add their initial experience with Tc-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) SPECT in febrile convulsions.
