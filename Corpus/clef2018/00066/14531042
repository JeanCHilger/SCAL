Role of dopamine transporter imaging in the diagnosis of atypical tremor disorders. Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging detects presynaptic dopamine neuronal dysfunction and thereby assists differentiation of conditions with and without dopamine deficit. In atypical tremor disorders, DAT imaging can differentiate between Parkinson's disease (PD), where dopamine deficit is demonstrated on DAT imaging, and essential tremor, where no dopamine deficit is found. DAT imaging may be particularly informative in monosymptomatic rest tremors, benign tremulous Parkinson's syndrome, and in the elderly in whom essential tremor may be accompanied by pseudoparkinsonism.
