Significance of non-presynaptic SPECT tracer methods in Parkinson's disease. Tropane-related tracers for SPECT and PET scanning have shown their value in assessing the in vivo striatal presynaptic status of the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system in man. Previously, there were a few other tracers suggested to be useful in the study of in vivo brain biochemistry in humans, particularly in patients afflicted with Parkinson's disease (PD) or parkinsonian syndromes. We summarize the work concerning the two main tracers applied in that context using single photon emission tomography (SPECT) scanning in patients with PD: IBZM and HMPAO. IBZM binds specifically to striatal dopamine D(2) receptors and HMPAO uptake is a measure of cerebral tissue perfusion.
