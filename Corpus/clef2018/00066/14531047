Dopamine transporter imaging and SPECT in diagnostic work-up of Parkinson's disease: a decision-analytic approach. As a diagnostic test for patients with suspected Parkinson's disease (PD), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using [(123)I]FP-CIT tracer has better sensitivity but is more expensive than regular clinical examination (CE). Our objective was to evaluate the clinical and economic impacts of different diagnostic strategies involving [(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT. We developed a decision tree model to predict adequate treatment-month equivalents (ATME), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) during a 12-month time horizon in patients with suspected PD referred to a specialized movement disorder outpatient clinic. In our cost- effectiveness analysis, we adopted the perspective of the German health care system and used data from a German prospective health care utilization study (n = 142) and published diagnostic studies. Compared strategies were CE only (EXAM+), SPECT only (SPECT+), SPECT following negative CE (SINGLE+), and SPECT following positive CE (DOUBLE+). Costs of SPECT amounted to euro789 per investigation. Based on our model, expected costs (and ATME) were euro
