Issues specific to implementing PET-CT for pediatric oncology: what we have learned along the way. In parallel with the expansion of PET imaging to pediatric patients has been the technological development of merging state-of-the-art cross-sectional anatomic information (CT) with functional imaging (PET) into a single modality: PET-CT. Attending to the clinical, scheduling, and medical needs that are unique to imaging children and adolescents can be a challenge, particularly when instituting a single new modality. When that modality bridges two unique, previously independent methods-often previously located in two separate departmental divisions-the details and logistics required to set up a smoothly functioning process can be particularly difficult. This paper focuses on our experience in implementing PET-CT in a tertiary pediatric referral center.
