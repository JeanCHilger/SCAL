Single photon emission tomography (SPECT) study of regional cerebral blood flow in normoalbuminuric children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Cerebral damage in diabetes can be related to chronic hyperglycemia and recurrent severe hypoglycemia as well as due to the associated vasculopathy. The pattern of regional cerebral blood flow using cerebral single photon emission tomography (SPECT) was evaluated in normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetic children and adolescents and its relation to the metabolic control and cognitive functions. Thirty-one type 1 diabetics aged 10-18 yr (mean 14.7 +/- 3.4) were included, 16 males and 15 females, divided into four groups: group I (n = 8) with history of recurrent severe hypoglycemia (> or = 3) group II (n = 8) with history of severe diabetic ketoacidosis (> or = 3)Subclinical alterations in cerebral blood flow (hypoperfusion) are present in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mainly affecting the basal ganglia and frontal regions, usually not associated with measurable alterations of the cognitive functions
