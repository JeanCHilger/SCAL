Quantitative EEG mapping and PET in Alzheimer's disease. Quantitative analysis of topographical EEG was studied in comparison with measurement of regional glucose metabolism by PET in 42 patients with clinical diagnosis of probable dementia of Alzheimer type (AD) and in 15 age-matched normal controls. Measures analyzed included global and regional data from areas typically affected and not affected by AD pathology. While disturbance of metabolism followed a typical regional pattern, relative alpha, theta and delta power were more globally altered without selectivity for specific regions. Separation between AD and age matched controls by relative theta power was correct in 86% and was close to that by temporo-parietal glucose metabolism (correct classification 87%). Relative theta power as well as temporo-parietal glucose metabolism were significantly correlated (tau B = 0.54 and -0.53, respectively) to severity of AD assessed by the global deterioration scale. These results indicate that EEG measures may be used with an accuracy close to metabolic values from PET for the assessment of severity of AD.
