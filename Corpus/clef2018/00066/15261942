The incremental prognostic value of percentage of heart rate reserve achieved over myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography in the prediction of cardiac death and all-cause mortality: superiority over 85% of maximal age-predicted heart rate. We sought to determine whether chronotropic incompetence (CI) adds incremental value in predicting cardiac death (CD) and all-cause mortality and to determine which marker of CI is superior.Chronotropic incompetence, defined by either a low percent heart rate (HR) reserve achieved or failure to achieve 85% maximal age-predicted heart rate (MA-PHR), is a predictor of mortality. These variables have not been examined together in a comprehensive myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT), or MPS, model.A total of 10,021 patients who underwent exercise MPS, evaluated by a summed stress score (SSS), were followed up for 719 +/- 252 days. Percent HR reserve = (peak HR - rest HR)/(220 - age - rest HR) x 100, with <80% considered abnormal.A total of 2,956 patients (29.5%) had low %HR reserve 1,331 (13.3%) achieved <85% MA-PHRIn a comprehensive MPS model, CI was an important predictor of CD and all-cause mortality. Percent HR reserve was superior to the ability to achieve 85% MA-PHR in predicting CD MPS was superior to both. Combined with previous studies, the findings suggest that %HR reserve should become the standard for assessing the adequacy of HR response during exercise testing, and that it should be routinely incorporated in risk stratification algorithms.
