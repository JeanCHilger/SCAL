Evaluation of myocardial disorders in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and left ventricular eccentric hypertrophy--by 201Tl myocardial SPECT. 201Tl myocardial SPECT was performed in cases of dilated cardiomyopathy and valvular heart disease with left ventricular eccentric hypertrophy, and the two groups were compared from the standpoint of the mechanism of onset of myocardial disorders. Significant coefficients of correlation were seen between the Tl score and LVDd (r = 0.792, r = 0.785) and Tl score and LVEF (r = -0.634, r = -0.555) in both dilated cardiomyopathy and valvular heart disease. In cases of valvular heart disease, significant correlation coefficients (r = -0.756, r = -0.720) between LVDd and r-WR (relative-washout rate), and Tl score and r-WR were observed, but no such correlation was seen in dilated cardiomyopathy. In valvular heart disease, a decrease in myocardial perfusion associated with enlargement of the left ventricle appeared, while in dilated cardiomyopathy, there was a marked decrease in LVEF in proportion to the thallium defect. Therefore, it was assumed that left ventricular wall disorders occur due to myocardial metabolic disorders and coronary microcirculation disorders.
