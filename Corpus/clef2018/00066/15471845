Evaluation of 3'-deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine for monitoring tumor response to radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy in mice. 3'-Deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) has been suggested as a new PET tracer for imaging tumor proliferation. We investigated the use of 18F-FLT to monitor the response of tumors to radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) in mice.C3H/He mice bearing an SCCVII tumor were treated with single-dose x-ray irradiation of 20 Gy. Tumor uptake was examined for 18F-FLT, 3H-thymidine (3H-Thd), 18F-FDG, and 14C-deoxyglucose (14C-DG) at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 3 d, and 7 d after radiotherapy. BALB/c nu/nu mice bearing a HeLa tumor were treated with PDT. Tumor uptake was examined for the 4 tracers at 24 h after PDT. Expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was determined in untreated and treated tumors.In the biodistribution study, considerable uptake of 18F-FLT was observed in both tumor types. Tumor volumes decreased to 39.3% +/- 22.4% at 7 d after radiotherapy. The PCNA labeling index was reduced in x-ray-irradiated tumors (control, 53.2% +/- 8.7% 6 h, 38.5% +/- 5.3%In our model system, changes in 18F-FLT uptake after radiotherapy and PDT were correlated with those of 3H-Thd and the PCNA labeling index. The decrease in 18F-FLT uptake after treatments was more rapid or pronounced than that of 18F-FDG. Therefore, 18F-FLT may be a feasible PET tracer for monitoring response to therapy in oncology.
