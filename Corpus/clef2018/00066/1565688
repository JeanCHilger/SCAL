Review of convergent beam tomography in single photon emission computed tomography. Investigation of convergent-beam single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is actively being pursued to evaluate its clinical potentials. Fan-beam, cone-beam, pin-hole and astigmatic collimators are being used with rotating gamma cameras having large crystal areas, to increase the sensitivity for emission and transmission computed tomography of small organs such as the thyroid, brain or heart. With new multi-detector SPECT systems, convergent-beam geometry offers the ability to simultaneously obtain emission and transmission data necessary to quantify uptake of radiopharmaceutical distributions in the heart. The development of convergent-beam geometry in SPECT requires the integration of hardware and software. In considering hardware, the optimum detector system for cone-beam tomography is a system that satisfies the data sufficiency condition for which the scanning trajectory intersects any plane passing through the reconstructed region of interest. However, the major development of algorithms has been for the data insufficient case of single planar orbit acquisitions. The development of these algorithms have made possible the preliminary evaluation of this technology and the imaging of brain and heart are showing significant potential for the clinical application of cone-beam tomography. Presently, significant research activity is pursuing the development of algorithms for data acquisitions that satisfy the data sufficiency condition and that can be implemented easily and inexpensively on clinical SPECT systems.
