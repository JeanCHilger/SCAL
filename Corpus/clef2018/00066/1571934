S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase activity in human myocardium. Measurement of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) accumulation in the heart reflects the concentration of free cytosolic adenosine and is thus a sensitive indicator of regional myocardial ischaemia. To evaluate the possibility of applying this method in combination with 11C-SAH positron emission tomography (PET) to patients with ischaemic heart disease the activity of SAH hydrolase in human heart muscle and its regional distribution were studied.Myocardium from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 4), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM, n = 6), and mitral stenosis (n = 3) was analysed. Additional studies were performed in myocardium, isolated cardiomyocytes, and endothelial cells from dog and guinea pig hearts. Enzyme activity in synthetic and hydrolytic direction including kinetic data (Vmax, KM values, pH dependency) was measured in the cytosolic fraction of myocardial tissue and cell extracts, using high performance liquid chromatography and photometric methods, respectively.Rates of SAH synthesis (Vmax) in the left ventricle in dilated cardiomyopathy, mitral stenosis, and HOCM were 0.8 (SEM 0.1), 1.0(0.2), and 1.7(0.1) nmol.min-1.mg-1 protein respectively. KM values for DL-homocysteine, adenosine, and SAH in HOCM were 187, 2.2, and 3.4 microM, respectively. Enzyme activity was homogeneously distributed among right and left atria, right and left ventricles, and septum. Additional studies in homogenated muscle and isolated cardiomyocytes of guinea pig and canine hearts showed activities similar to man.(1) SAH hydrolase activity in the human heart is quantitatively comparable to that found in other mammals but certain myocardial diseases may go along with changes in SAH hydrolase activity (2) the kinetic properties, absolute amounts, and homogeneous distribution of the enzyme may permit the non-invasive determination of free adenosine in the human heart by PET.
