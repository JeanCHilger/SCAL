Locally advanced thyroid cancer. The purpose of this review is to summarize existing literature with respect to locally advanced thyroid cancer and define the intricacies of preoperative evaluation, surgical management of involved sites and postoperative treatment.Locally invasive thyroid cancer is an uncommon disease process, which carries significant morbidity and mortality. Current treatment modalities include appropriate surgery, radioactive iodine treatment and external beam radiation therapy. Proper evaluation of the extent of disease, with complete gross tumor removal, is paramount in managing this difficult problem. Surgical treatment is still the mainstay for locally advanced thyroid cancer.Little progress has been made in advancing the treatment of locally advanced thyroid cancer. Patient identification, evaluation and proper surgical management with adjuvant therapy, still remain the most effective course of treatment. Aggressive surgical treatment including removal of all gross tumor and still preserving vital structures along with adjuvant therapy is likely to offer the best results. There is a very high incidence of locoregional and distant failure in this group of patients. The understanding and recognition of histopathological variations, such as poorly differentiated thyroid cancer is also important. New molecular markers are needed to help identify and predict aggressive tumor behavior.
