Hemodynamic influences of losartan on the brain in hypertensive patients. The effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers on cerebral hemodynamics in humans have not been well elucidated. The present study evaluated the effects of losartan on cerebral hemodynamics in hypertensive patients using positron emission tomography. Ten patients with essential hypertension (mean age, 60.8 years) were examined. In each patient, regional cerebral blood flow was measured by [O-15] labeled water positron emission tomography before and after the oral administration of losartan for 8 to 23 weeks. In 8 patients, the baseline regional cerebral blood flow measurement was followed by 1,000 mg of acetazolamide challenge to measure the cerebral perfusion reserve. Systemic blood pressures before and after treatment were 153.8 +/- 10.8/96.0 +/- 6.5 mmHg (systolic mean +/- SD/diastolic mean +/- SD) and 133.4 +/- 11.2/83.6 +/- 6.5 mmHg, respectively this difference was significant. The baseline global cerebral blood flow values before and after treatment were 38.4 +/- 6.9 ml/min/100 g and 38.2 +/- 8.2 ml/min/100 g, respectively
