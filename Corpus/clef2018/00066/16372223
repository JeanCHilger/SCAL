Diagnosis and management of tumors of the adrenal medulla. The adrenal medulla consists of chromaffin cells, the site of catecholamine biosynthesis. Pheochromocytomas are chromaffin-cell tumors 80-85 % arise from the adrenal medulla and 15-20 % arise from extra-adrenal chromaffin tissues (paragangliomas). Neuroblastomas are primitive tumors that derive from the same blastic precursor as in pheochromocytomas, and are distributed along the sympathetic nervous system. Pheochromocytomas account for 6.5 % of incidentally discovered adrenal tumors
