Reduced 125I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine uptake and norepinephrine transporter density in the hearts of mice with MPTP-induced parkinsonism. Uptake of (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) is markedly reduced in the hearts of patients with Parkinson's disease. Although the mechanism of this reduction is unclear, (12)(5)I-MIBG uptake is similarly reduced in the hearts of mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydroxypyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism. Three groups of ten 15-week-old C57BL6 mice received intraperitoneal injections of (1) saline (control), (2) 10 mg/kg MPTP or (3) 40 mg/kg MPTP. After 0.185 MBq of (125)I-MIBG was injected, the percent injected dose of (125)I-MIBG per gram of tissue (%ID/g) was determined and cardiac concentrations of norepinephrine were measured. Cardiac concentrations of norepinephrine transporter (NET) were measured in three groups of twenty 15-week-old C57BL6 mice receiving these same treatments. The %ID/g in mice receiving 10 or 40 mg/kg MPTP (5.7 +/- 1.1 and 4.4 +/- 1.2%/g) was significantly lower than that in control mice (11.3 +/- 2.2%/g P < .00001 and P < .0000001, respectively). The norepinephrine concentration in mice receiving 10 or 40 mg/kg MPTP (7.86 +/- 0.67 x 10(5) and 7.50 +/- 0.89 x 10(5) pg/wet g) was significantly lower than that in control mice (9.21 +/- 0.97 x 10(5) pg/wet g
