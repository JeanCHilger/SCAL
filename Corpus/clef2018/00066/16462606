Selection of currently relevant words: an auditory verbal memory study using positron emission tomography. Clinical and imaging studies have shown that the posterior and anterior parts of the limbic system make distinct contributions to memory processing. Whereas the medial temporal lobes and connected structures are important for learning and recognition of new information, the posterior orbitofrontal cortex appears to be crucial for the selection of currently relevant memories, that is, the ability to distinguish between memories that pertain to ongoing reality and memories that do not. Previous studies demonstrating this dissociation used repeated continuous recognition tasks with visual stimuli. In this H2O positron emission tomography study, we demonstrate that this same organizing principle also applies to auditory verbal information, that is, to the processing of auditorily presented words.
