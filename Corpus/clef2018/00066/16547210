Dobutamine-induced hyperaemia inversely correlates with coronary artery stenosis severity and highlights dissociation between myocardial blood flow and oxygen consumption. To compare the relationship between dobutamine myocardial blood flow (MBF), rate-pressure product (RPP) and stenosis severity in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).27 patients with single-vessel CAD were allocated to three groups based on stenosis severity: group 1, 50-69% (n = 9) group 2, 70-89% (n = 9)In group 1, mean dobutamine MBF-Isc (2.48 (SD 0.48 ml/min/g)) and dobutamine MBF-Rem (2.70 (0.50) ml/min/g, NS) were comparable. In groups 2 and 3, dobutamine MBF-Isc (1.91 (0.44) and 1.22 (0.21) ml/min/g) was significantly lower than dobutamine MBF-Rem (2.27 (0.28) and 1.98 (0.25) ml/min/g, p < 0.02 and p < 0.005, respectively). An inverse relation between dobutamine MBF and stenosis severity existed both in Isc (r = 0.79, p < 0.001) and in Rem territories (r = 0.71, p < 0.001). For any given RPP, dobutamine MBF was greater in controls than in Rem (p < 0.05), which in turn was greater than in Isc (p < 0.05).Dobutamine MBF inversely correlated with stenosis severity and achieved significant flow heterogeneity for coronary stenoses > 70%. Dobutamine MBF and RPP were dissociated in both Isc and Rem segments in patients compared with controls.
