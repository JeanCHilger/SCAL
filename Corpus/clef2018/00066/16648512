Prognostic significance of [18F]-misonidazole positron emission tomography-detected tumor hypoxia in patients with advanced head and neck cancer randomly assigned to chemoradiation with or without tirapazamine: a substudy of Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group Study 98.02. To determine the association between tumor hypoxia, treatment regimen, and locoregional failure (LRF) in patients with stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck randomly assigned to radiotherapy (70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks) plus either tirapazamine and cisplatin in weeks 1, 4, and 7 and tirapazamine alone in weeks 2 and 3 (TPZ/CIS) or cisplatin and infusional fluorouracil during weeks 6 and 7 (chemoboost).Forty-five patients were enrolled onto a hypoxic imaging substudy of a larger randomized trial. Pretreatment and midtreatment [18F]-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography scans (FMISO-PET) were performed 2 hours after tracer administration, with qualitative scoring of uptake in both primary tumors and nodes.Thirty-two patients (71%) had detectable hypoxia in either or both primary and nodal disease. In patients who received chemoboost, one of 10 patients without hypoxia had LRF compared with eight of 13 patients with hypoxia the risk of LRF was significantly higher in hypoxic patients (exact log-rank, P = .038Hypoxia on FMISO-PET imaging, in patients receiving a nontirapazamine-containing chemoradiotherapy regimen, is associated with a high risk of LRF. Our data provide the first clinical evidence to support the experimental observation that tirapazamine acts by specifically targeting hypoxic tumor cells.
