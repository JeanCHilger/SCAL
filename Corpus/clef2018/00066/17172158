Microwaving in F-18 chemistry: quirks and tweaks. Since the late 1980s, microwave dielectric heating has been used to speed up chemical transformations, also in radiolabeling tracers for positron emission tomography. In addition to shorter reaction times, higher yields, cleaner product mixtures and improved reproducibility have also been obtained for reactions involving polar components that require heating at elevated temperatures. The conditions used in microwave chemistry can differ considerably from those in conventional heating. Understanding the factors that influence the interaction of the electromagnetic field with the sample is critical for the successful implementation of microwave heating. These parameters are discussed here and exemplified with radiolabelings with fluorine-18.
