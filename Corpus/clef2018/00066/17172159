Micro-reactors for PET tracer labeling. Miniaturization of PET radiosynthesis devices (micro-reactors or microfluidic systems) is an emerging area that has the potential to deliver many advantages, such as more efficient use of hot-cell space for production of multiple radiotracers use of less non-radioactive precursor for saving precious material and a reduced separation challenge
