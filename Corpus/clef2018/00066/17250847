Synthesis of nano-sized TiO(2)/poly(AA-co-MMA) composites by heterocoagulation and blending with PET. Nano-sized TiO(2) or SiO(2)/TiO(2) particles were prepared by hydrolysis and condensation reactions in aqueous media, followed by mixing with poly(AA-co-MMA) latex to form different composites, then blending with poly(ethylene terephthalate), PET. The TGA results of composites indicated that negative charged latexes had greater interaction with TiO(2)/ or SiO(2)/TiO(2) particles through strong electrostatic forces, while cationic latexes incorporated with TiO(2) or SiO(2)/TiO(2) particles by pH induced coagulation, carbonyl group chelation and hydrogen bonding. The soapless latex polymer particles showed lower ability of adsorption to TiO(2) particles due to the decrease of total surface area of these larger particles. If SiO(2)/TiO(2) particles were used instead of TiO(2) particles, unexpected high adsorption result was observed. Morphology results observed by SEM showed that PET blended with positive charged composites was more homogeneous than PET blended with negative charged composites. DSC results also indicated that the T(g) of PET was increased, melting temperatures (T(m) or T(m)(')) were increased, and the temperature range of crystallization was narrowed after blending with the composites. The presence of composites affected the mobility and packing of PET molecular chains therefore changing the thermal properties of PET.
