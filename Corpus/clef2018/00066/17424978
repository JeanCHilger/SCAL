Global and regional evaluation of systolic and diastolic left ventricular temporal parameters using a novel program for ECG-gated myocardial perfusion SPECT--validation by comparison with gated equilibrium radionuclide angiography and speckle-tracking radial strain from echocardiography. A newly developed program, named cardioGRAF, enabled the evaluation of left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic temporal parameters for the estimation of heart failure using ECG-gated myocardial perfusion SPECT (GMPS).The feasibility of those global (g-) and regional (r-) parameters was validated to compare with gated equilibrium radionuclide angiography (ERNA) and speckle-tracking radial strain (STS) from echocardiography.Thirty-three patients were studied using GMPS and ERNA (n=11) or GMPS and STS (n=22). The following g- or r-parameters obtained by cardioGRAF and ERNA or STS were compared: time to end systole (TES), time from end systole to peak filling rate (TPF1), time from 0 to peak filling rate (TPF2), time to peak radial strain (TPS), time from peak strain to peak negative strain rate (TP-SR1), and time from 0 to peak negative strain rate (TP-SR2).All g-parameters were successfully obtained by cardioGRAF and ERNA. The results demonstrated good correlations (g-TES: r = 0.79, p < 0.005 g-TPF1: r = 0.75, p < 0.02The feasibility of evaluating systolic and diastolic temporal parameters by a new program was validated. This program has the potential to evaluate both diastolic and systolic heterogeneous wall motions which express dyssynchrony in heart failure.
