Pt- and Au-catalyzed oxidative cyclization of 2-ethenyl-1-(prop-2'-yn-1'-ol)benzenes to naphthyl aldehydes and ketones: catalytic oxidation of metal-alkylidene intermediates using H2O and H2O2. 2-Ethenyl-1-(prop-2'-yn-1'-ol)benzenes was cyclized through catalytic oxidation with PtCl(2)/CO/H(2)O and PEt(3)AuCl/H(2)O(2) the metal-naphthylidene intermediates were identified and oxygenated with water and H(2)O(2), respectively
