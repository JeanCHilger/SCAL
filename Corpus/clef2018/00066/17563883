Sensitive bioanalysis: combining single-molecule spectroscopy with mono-labeled self-quenching probes. Fluorescence single-molecule spectroscopy is an appropriate tool for modern bioanalysis. This technique enables the development of ultra sensitive assays, especially when combined with self-quenching probes. In this review we report novel DNA, enzyme, and antibody assays based on mono-labeled fluorescent probes that are quenched by photoinduced electron transfer (PET).
