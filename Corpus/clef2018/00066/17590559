Pharmaceutical analysis of synthetic lipid A-based vaccine adjuvants in poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticle formulations. The present study had two main objectives. First, was to compare the immune stimulatory effect of two synthetic lipid A analogues (7-acyl lipid A and pentaerythritol-based lipid A (PET lipid A)) on maturation/stimulation of bone marrow derived dendritic cells (DCs). Our second objective was to develop a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method for the quantitative analysis of lipid A-based vaccine adjuvants. Treatment of immature DCs with 7-acyl lipid A and PET lipid A up regulated the surface expression of CD86 and CD40 molecules, and also induced similar profile of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. LC-MS analyses were performed using a Waters Micromass ZQ 4000 spectrometer, coupled to a Waters 2795 separations module with an autosampler. Calibration curves with R(2)>0.999 were constructed over the concentration range of 1.25-20 microg/ml for the solution of 7-acyl lipid A and PET lipid A. The method was tested in a 3 day validation protocol. The accuracy of the assay at different concentrations tested ranged from 89 to 108% and from 92 to 107% for 7-acyl lipid A and PET lipid A, respectively. The limit of quantification for both 7-acyl lipid A and PET lipid A was 1.25 microg/ml (signal/noise (S/N)) ratio >15:1. The sensitivity of the method (the limit of detection) was 0.35 and 0.15 ng for 7-acyl lipid A and PET lipid A, respectively (S/N ratio between 4:1 or 3:1). As a preliminary application, this method has been successfully applied to the determination of 7-acyl lipid A and PET lipid A content in poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-NP).
