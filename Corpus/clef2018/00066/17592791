Neurobiology of autism: neuropathology and neuroimaging studies. This study performs a review of the last studies in the field of neuropathology and neuroimaging of autism.A search was done in Medline for articles on neuropathology and neuroimaging in autism and the most relevant articles of the last 10 years up to date were selected.The existence of structural abnormalities in the brain of patients with autism, affecting different brain structures such as the cerebellum, limbic system, frontal and temporal cortexes, corpus callosum and basal ganglia seems to be demonstrated.The alterations found with the neuroimaging techniques are identified in the different brain structures. At present, there is almost generalized thinking that brain alterations in autism are not limited to a single brain area but involve different structures within a globally affected neuronal network. Future studies will allow us to increase knowledge on this disorder's pathophysiology.
