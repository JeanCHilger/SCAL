Role of metalloproteins in the clinical management of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Metalloproteins are a group of catalytic proteins, which play significant roles in cell cycle and death. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of endopeptidases that are capable of digesting extracellular matrix components. They have been implicated in carcinogenesis and recent developments have been made to use MMPs clinically to predict outcomes. In the future, selective inhibition of these proteins and their regulatory pathways may prove useful in anticancer therapeutics. We present a review article on the clinical applications of metalloproteins in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Metalopanstimulin is highlighted as a putative metalloprotein of interest for those treating HNSCC. Expression of particular metalloproteins has correlation with lymph node metastasis, tumor invasiveness, and overall prognosis in HNSCC.
