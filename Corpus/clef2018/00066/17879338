Operative probe scintimetry with indium and technetium for colorectal cancer. Surgeons introduced the hand-held gamma detection probe in combination with tumor-directed monoclonal antibodies in patients with colorectal cancer. The clinicians conducted innovative research involving antibody chemistry and variation as well as radioactive dosimetry and decay. The results of these studies represented an era when surgeons began reporting on specific lesion detection and the impact of the antibody administration on the management of the patient. The summary of the important early trials involving monoclonal antibodies and probe scintimetry provides a valuable look into the early development of the antibody technology and a glimpse of potential future applications using the gamma detection probe.
