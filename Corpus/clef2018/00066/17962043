Normal database of dopaminergic neurotransmission system in human brain measured by positron emission tomography. The central dopaminergic system is of interest in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Both pre- and postsynaptic dopaminergic functions can be estimated by positron emission tomography (PET) with different radiotracers. However, an integrated database of both pre- and postsynaptic dopaminergic neurotransmission components including receptors, transporter, and endogenous neurotransmitter synthesis has not yet been reported. In the present study, we constructed a normal database for the pre- and postsynaptic dopaminergic functions in the living human brain using PET. To measure striatal and extrastriatal dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptor bindings, dopamine transporter binding, and endogenous dopamine synthesis rate, PET scans were performed on healthy men after intravenous injection of [(11)C]SCH23390, [(11)C]raclopride, [(11)C]FLB457, [(11)C]PE2I, or L-[beta-(11)C]DOPA. All PET images were anatomically standardized using SPM2, and a database was built for each radiotracer. Gray matter images were segmented and extracted from all anatomically standardized magnetic resonance images using SPM2, and they were used for partial volume correction. These databases allow the comparison of regional distributions of striatal and extrastriatal dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptors, dopamine transporter, and endogenous dopamine synthesis capability. These distributions were in good agreement with those from human postmortem studies. This database can be used in various researches to understand the physiology of dopaminergic functions in the living human brain. This database could also be used to investigate regional abnormalities of dopaminergic neurotransmission in neuropsychiatric disorders.
