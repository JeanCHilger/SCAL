Quantitative measurement of regional cerebral blood flow with I-123 IMP SPECT: a correction of the microsphere model by global extraction between artery and internal jugular vein. Quantitative measurements of regional cerebral blood flow with N-isopropyl-(Iodine 123)p-iodoamphetamine (I-123 IMP) as a microsphere model were performed in forty cases. The regional cerebral blood flow values obtained with I-123 IMP were slightly underestimated compared with those of Xe-133 inhalation methods (y = 0.90x-2.1, r = 0.85, p less than 0.01). After correction by global extraction (87%) between the artery and internal jugular vein, which was measured in four patients by means of a catheter technique, the underestimation of the values obtained with I-123 IMP was improved (y = 1.0x-2.4, r = 0.85, p less than 0.01). Several problems in the accurate quantitative measurement of regional cerebral blood flow with I-123 IMP are discussed.
