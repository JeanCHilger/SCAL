Evaluation of reconstruction techniques for lung single photon emission tomography: a Monte Carlo study. In studies of the distribution of lung function, the image quality of lung single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is important and one factor influencing it is the reconstruction algorithm.To systematically evaluate ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) and compare it with filtered back-projection (FBP) for lung SPECT with Tc.The evaluation of the number of iterations used in OSEM was based on the image quality parameter contrast. The comparison between OSEM and FBP was based on trade-off plots between statistical noise and spatial resolution for different filter parameters, collimators and count-levels. A Monte Carlo technique was used to simulate SPECT studies of a digital thorax phantom containing two sets of activity: one with a homogeneous activity distribution within the lungs and the other with superposed high- and low-activity objects. Statistical noise in the reconstructed images was calculated as the coefficient of variation (CV) and spatial resolution as full width at half-maximum (FWHM).For the configuration studied, the OSEM reconstruction in combination with post-filtering should be used in lung SPECT studies with at least 60 MLEM equivalent iterations. Compared to FBP the spatial resolution was improved by about 1 mm. For a constant level of CV, a four-fold increase in count level resulted in an increased resolution of about 2 mm. Spatial resolution and cut-off frequency depends on what value of noise in the image is acceptable also increased by using a low-energy, high-resolution collimator for CV values above 3%. The choice of noise-reducing filter and cut-off frequency depends on what value of noise in the image is acceptable.
