High-pressure hemarthrosis: possible consequences to the vascularization of the femoral head. The authors both detected hemarthrosis and calculated intraarticular pressure and blood supply to the femoral head using diagnostic tests (ultrasound, arthrography, manometric measurements, and bone scan tomography) in 18 patients with femoral neck fracture. The data obtained, in agreement with other reports in the literature, show a relationship between the condition of the joint capsule, the level of intraarticular pressure, and the arterial blood supply to the femoral head in cases of undisplaced or slightly displaced femoral neck fracture. The potential clinical implications are discussed.
