Imaging noradrenergic influence on amyloid pathology in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Molecular imaging aims towards the non-invasive characterization of disease-specific molecular alterations in the living organism in vivo. In that, molecular imaging opens a new dimension in our understanding of disease pathogenesis, as it allows the non-invasive determination of the dynamics of changes on the molecular level. IMAGING OF AD CHARACTERISTIC CHANGES BY microPET: The imaging technology being employed includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear imaging as well as optical-based imaging technologies. These imaging modalities are employed together or alone for disease phenotyping, development of imaging-guided therapeutic strategies and in basic and translational research. In this study, we review recent investigations employing positron emission tomography and MRI for phenotyping mouse models of Alzheimer's disease by imaging. We demonstrate that imaging has an important role in the characterization of mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases.
