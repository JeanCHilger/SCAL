Preparation and study on the spectra of conductive nano-silver film. The preparation and study on the spectra of conductive nano-silver film were done under mild conditions. The silver citrate emulsion coating on the surface of PET was reduced by ascorbic acid (Vc) aqueous solution to prepare a silver film. The morphology, crystal structure, surface roughness and conductivity of the silver film were measured by FTIR, UV-Vis spectrum, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope, scanning probe microscope system and so on. It was found that the silver citrate emumsion has a homogenous particle distribution from 60 nm-150 nm. The UV-Vis spectrum of the silver film shows a peak at 430 nm, and the silver thin film was considered to have a typical nano-scale structure. By the comparison of the XRD patterns of the films treated and untreated with water, it was concluded that the further deoxidization of silver citrate could be accelerated by water. The crystal structure of the silver film was improved and the surface resistance of the silver film was decreased greatly. The effect of ethanol on the decrease in the resistance of the silver film is much less than that of water.
