Diagnostic utility of 111In-antimyosin Fab scintigraphy in acute myocardial infarction: comparison with 201Tl and 99mTc-pyrophosphate myocardial scintigraphy. To assess the diagnostic accuracy, extent, and characteristics of 111In-antimyosin Fab scintigraphy (In-AM) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we studied In-AM in 17 patients with AMI and compared with In-AM, 99mTc-PYP and 201Tl scintigraphy. Intensity of In-AM uptake was classified into 3 grades. Fourteen of 17 patients (82%) showed positive uptake of In-AM. The locations of infarct area diagnosed by In-AM were in accordance with those by electrocardiography. There was a good correlation between the extent score of In-AM planar and that of SPECT (r = 0.72), In-AM SPECT and Tl SPECT (r = 0.79), In-AM planar and PYP planar (r = 0.92), In-AM SPECT and PYP SPECT (r = 0.76), respectively (p less than 0.01). Thus, In-AM is a useful method for diagnosis of AMI.
