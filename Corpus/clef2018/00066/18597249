Comparative adrenocortical suppression in dogs with otitis externa following topical otic administration of four different glucocorticoid-containing medications. The safety of using otic formulations is often of concern for practitioners and pet owners alike, with "safe" in this context meaning no adrenocortical suppression. This study evaluated the effect of four glucocorticoid-containing otic formulations on plasma cortisol concentrations, measured by corticotropin stimulation testing (plasma cortisol concentrations before and after corticotropin injection), in dogs presented with otitis externa. Dexamethasone tended to have larger adrenocortical suppression compared with the other three formulations (betamethasone, triamcinolone, and mometasone), but the difference was not statistically significant. The largest difference among the four drugs was observed between dexamethasone and betamethasone (P=.09).
