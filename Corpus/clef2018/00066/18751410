PET-CT in recurrent ovarian cancer: impact on treatment planning. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is currently not established in the management of recurrent ovarian cancer. Here, its value in diagnosis and therapy planning was evaluated.Seventy patients received PET-CT for suspicion of recurrent ovarian cancer. PET-CT and surgery were reviewed to analyze the accuracy in the diagnosis of recurrence and prediction of full resectability.PET-CT showed disease relapse in 63 of 70 patients, with full sensitivity and specificity. Thirty cases were operated on. PET-CT indicated full resectability in 24, but in fact only incomplete resection was possible in three cases. Thus sensitivity and specificity for the identification of full resectability were 100% and 66%, respectively. Seven negative results in PET-CT were confirmed by a relapse-free follow-up of 1 year.PET-CT offers reliable detection of recurrent ovarian cancer. Although diagnostic accuracy in the prediction of full resectability is limited, surgical planning is improved by identifying sites of intraperitoneal involvement.
