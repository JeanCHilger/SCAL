A new 18F-labeled myocardial PET tracer: myocardial uptake after permanent and transient coronary occlusion in rats. Conventional myocardial perfusion PET tracers require onsite tracer production because of their short radioactive half-lives. To investigate the potential of a new (18)F-labeled pyridazinone analog ((18)F-BMS-747158-02), we characterized this tracer in a rat model of permanent and transient coronary occlusion using small-animal PET.Myocardial (18)F-BMS-747158-02 distribution in healthy rats (n = 7), rats with transient (3-min) left coronary artery occlusion (n = 11), and rats with permanent left coronary occlusion (n = 11) was analyzed with a dedicated small-animal PET scanner.Normal hearts demonstrated intense and almost homogeneous tracer uptake throughout the left ventricle for more than 2 h. During permanent coronary occlusion, PET demonstrated perfusion defects, which remained unchanged (37.6% +/- 8.8%, 37.4% +/- 10.2%, and 36.2% +/- 9.8% left ventricle at 15, 45, and 115 min, respectively, after tracer injection). After transient ischemia, the induced defect size decreased significantly after reperfusion (16.2% +/- 9.3%, 6.0% +/- 6.5%, and 1.4% +/- 1.3% left ventricle). Tracer reinjection after transient ischemia resulted in normalization of the induced defect.Coronary occlusion yielded distinct myocardial (18)F-BMS-747158-02 uptake defects in the area of ischemia, which demonstrated normalization of activity after reperfusion and reinjection. These promising kinetic parameters may allow for assessment of flow using exercise-rest protocols similar to those used in combination with exercise and rest perfusion SPECT.
