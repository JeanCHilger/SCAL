The occurrence of enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens strains in the feces of dogs and cats. A total of 147 faecal specimen of dogs and cats was examined with cultural method for the occurrence of Cl. perfringens and its enterotoxin by using a reversed passive latex agglutination test (Pet-RPLA). Cl. perfringens could be detected in 77.9% of the samples of dogs (n = 68) and 65.6% of cats (n = 32) with diarrhoea in germ counts of 10(4)-10(10) cfu/g faeces. In the group of non diarrhoeic dogs (n = 39) and cats (n = 8) Cl. perfringens was found in 53.9% and 50% of the samples, the germ counts revealed 10(4)-10(8) cfu/g faeces. The enterotoxin of Cl. perfringens was detected in 48.5% of the samples of dogs and 28.1% of cats with diarrhoea. On the other hand this toxin could not be detected in any faecal specimen of non diarrhoeic animals. The in vitro detection of Cl. perfringens enterotoxin was successful at 65% of 20 strains, that had been isolated from faecal samples with enterotoxin. Also 2 Cl. perfringens strains isolated from faeces of non diarrhoeic dogs proved to be enterotoxigenic. The present test results given reason to believe that enterotoxigenic Cl. perfringens strains are involved in the complex of enteric disease of dogs and cats.
