PET detection of the impact of dobutamine on myocardial glucose metabolism in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Our objective was to determine, in the hearts of women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), whether the fate of extracted glucose is altered and, if so, what the impact of dobutamine is on myocardial substrate metabolism. In experimental models of T1DM, myocardial glycolysis and glucose oxidation are reduced with the impairment becoming more pronounced with dobutamine. Whether similar changes occur in humans with T1DM is unclear.Myocardial perfusion, oxygen consumption, and glucose and fatty acid metabolism were measured with positron emission tomography in 19 women, 7 normal volunteers (NVs) and 12 with T1DM. The NVs and 6 T1DM (DM1) patients were studied under baseline metabolic conditions and 6 T1DM patients were studied during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (DM1-C), both at rest and during dobutamine. At rest, myocardial glucose uptake, glycolysis, glycogen storage, and oxidation were reduced by similar levels in DM1 patients compared with NVs (P < .05). During dobutamine, although myocardial glucose uptake was not different from DM1 patients at rest, fractional glycolysis was lower compared with NVs or DM1-C patients and reflected a lower glucose oxidation rate (P < .001). Measurements of myocardial glucose metabolism at rest and during dobutamine were comparable between NVs and DM1-C patients. During dobutamine, myocardial fatty acid uptake and oxidation increased in all 3 groups.In women with T1DM, (1) myocardial glucose metabolism is impaired downstream from initial uptake, (2) these abnormalities become more pronounced with dobutamine and are paralleled by an increase in myocardial fatty acid metabolism, and (3) insulin restores glucose metabolism to levels observed in normal control subjects.
