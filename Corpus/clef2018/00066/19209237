Estimating Live-Time for New PET Scanner Configurations. We present the derivation of a live-time model for predicting count rates in computer simulations of PET scanners. Computer models are frequently used to investigate new PET scanner configurations, but they typically do not account for the count losses caused by scanner-specific electronics and processing. The live-time fraction depends strongly on the photon flux incident on the detector. We modeled the live-time of a clinical PET scanner by relating measured and simulated single photon fluxes. Our model used data from a specific scanner, but the approach is generally applicable.We applied the live-time model to partial collimation on a PET scanner in particular, a scanner with septa positioned between every third detector ring ("2.7D" acquisition mode). The photon flux was measured and simulated for conventional acquisition modes (2D, 3D), and simulated for partial collimation (2.7D). These data were used in the model to predict live-time for partial collimation. The model was then validated against measurements in 2.7D mode. At low activity the model was very accurate at predicting the live-time fraction. Over-estimation of count-rates by the simulations lead to an uncertainly in the live-model. The uncertainty increased with activity concentration, reaching 0.9% and 2.2% at 20 kBq/mL for singles and coincidence live-time, respectively. When applied to 2.7D mode, the model predicted coincidence live-time accurate to 2.2% and 10% at 5 kBq/mL and 20 kBq/mL in the phantom, respectively. The 2.7D singles-counting live-time was predicted to within 0.2% of the measured value for up to 20 kBq/mL in the phantom.
