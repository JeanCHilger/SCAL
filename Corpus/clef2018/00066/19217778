18F]FEAC and [18F]FEDAC: Two novel positron emission tomography ligands for peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor in the brai. [(18)F]FEAC ([(18)F]4a) and [(18)F]FEDAC ([(18)F]4b) were developed as two novel positron emission tomography (PET) ligands for peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). [(18)F]4a and [(18)F]4b were synthesized by fluoroethylation of precursors 8a and 8b with [(18)F]FCH(2)CH(2)Br ([(18)F]9), respectively. Small-animal PET scan for a neuroinflammatory rat model showed that the two radioligands had high uptakes of radioactivity in the kainic acid-infused striatum, a brain region where PBR density was increased.
