Radioactive synthesis and biodistribution study of beta-elemene-99mTc(CO)3 conjugates. Beta-elemene, (5S,7R,10S)-(-)-(1-methyl-1-vinyl-2,4-diisopropenylcyclohexane), is an anticancer agent from traditional Chinese herbal medicine. Three novel (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-beta-elemene conjugates were synthesized successfully, and compared with beta-elemene exhibited improved water solubility. A biodistribution and micro single photon emission computed tomography image study showed there is a visible accumulation in Lewis lung cancer tumors.
