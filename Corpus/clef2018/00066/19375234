Molecular cloning and phylogenetic analysis of Babesia orientalis heat shock protein 70. The heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) gene of Babesia orientalis was obtained from a cDNA expression library by immunoscreening with B. orientalis infected buffalo sera. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA was 2192bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1944bp encoding a polypeptide of 648 amino acid residues. Phylogenetic analysis of the 1944bp sequence together with 30 inter-erythrocytic protozoa hsp70 nucleotide sequences available from GenBank was performed. The results showed that B. orientalis was occurred within the Babesia clade, and most closely related to B. ovis and B. bovis. Similar topologies were obtained from trees based on apicomplexa parasite 18S rRNA sequence. Meanwhile, the BoHsp70 gene was cloned into pET-32a and subsequently expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta strain as a Trx-fusion protein. The recombinant hsp70 of B. orientalis (rBoHsp70) was purified and evaluated as an antigen in the western blot. The serum from B. orientalis infected buffalo recognized the 92kDa rBoHsp70 expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) by western blotting. The rabbit antiserum against rBoHsp70 recognized a specific 70kDa band in lysates of B. orientalis infected buffalo erythrocytes. These results suggested that hsp70 gene was well conserved among inter-erythrocytic protozoa and the BoHsp70 might be a diagnostic and candidate vaccine antigen.
