The nutrition of the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus). Growing interest in the nutrition of the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) has highlighted the paucity of knowledge in this area. The aims of this study were to review the available literature on their individual nutrient requirements and relate this to the nutrient content of their predominantly seed-based diet and to investigate the effect of the bird's daily energy requirement on the fluctuations in body weight. Studies were conducted at the Waltham Centre to measure the relationship between daily metabolizable energy intake (kJ/kg BW) and body weight change (g/d) for groups of adult budgerigars. The birds were found to require daily 48-128 kJ/bird depending on their body mass (birds in our colony typically weigh 30-80 g). During a series of breeding trials the daily energy intake for a breeding pair plus their three chicks, at peak energy intake, was found to be 483-505 kJ (at pairing, the mean daily energy intake of the breeding pairs was 231 kJ). Apparent metabolizability of the major nutrients from a seed diet were generally found to be greater than 80%, which allows these birds to assimilate the high levels of energy needed for their basal metabolism. In summary, the nutrient requirements of the budgerigar (where known) were found to be similar to those of other avian species, however, further work is needed, especially in the area of availability of key nutrients. Further developments in the dietary management of these birds will only be possible if researchers can overcome the birds' poor acceptance of novel foods and satisfy their high basal energy requirements before establishing their requirements for individual nutrients.
