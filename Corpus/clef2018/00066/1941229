Evaluation of the energy requirements of adult kennel dogs. The objective of this experiment was to compare the energy requirements of healthy adult kennel dogs to those recommended by the National Research Council (NRC). The energy requirements of six beagles, six Siberian huskies and six Labrador retrievers were determined over a 54-wk period. Dogs were housed in groups of three in heated indoor-outdoor runs and fed a complete and balanced commercial dry dog food. Beagles had an average daily energy intake of 3414 kJ/dog with monthly averages ranging from 3146 to 3740 kJ/dog. Siberian huskies had an average daily energy intake of 5021 kJ/dog. Average monthly energy intakes ranged from 4715 to 5238 kJ/dog. Labrador retrievers had an average daily intake of 5611 kJ/dog with monthly averages ranging from 5063 to 6623 kJ/dog. Seasonal variation appeared to affect the breeds differently, with long-haired Siberian huskies showing less seasonal variation than the shorter-haired breeds. For all dogs energy intake (kJ/kg body weight 0.75) declined with age. The energy intake of each group of dogs was considerably below that recommended by the NRC. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown, although these data suggest that environmental conditions, breed and/or age play an important role.
