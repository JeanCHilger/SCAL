Positron emission tomography (PET) and PET-CT in renal, bladder and prostate cancer: update. PET has demonstrated its utility in management decisions in several types of tumors. In urologic tract tumors and prostate cancer its diagnostic performance has been lower due to the urinary excretion of the radiotracer, which can mask the presence of lesions. However, specific protocols must be applied that improve the diagnostic performance of PET with 18F-FDG in the evaluation of pelvic lesions. Furthermore, prostate cancer is a low-grade tumor with low avidity for 18F-FDG. In spite of these limitations, with PET new and interesting possibilities have been presented. The availability of PET-CT systems has improved its diagnostic performance. On the other hand, the development of new radiotracers that allow targeting other molecular processes and that are metabolized by pathways different to the urinary tract signifies an important advantage compared to 18F-FDG and has evidenced interesting results.
