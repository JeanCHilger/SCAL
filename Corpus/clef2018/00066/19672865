Usefulness of peripheral arterial tonometry in the detection of mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia. Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) identifies a subset of coronary arterial disease (CAD) patients at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events. Peripheral arterial vasoconstriction has been consistently reported as an underlying mechanism for ischemia development in this setting and as such affords a unique opportunity for the noninvasive detection of this phenomenon.We studied the usefulness of a peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) technique in the detection of MSIMI. We sought to identify response patterns that would predict the development of MSIMI.Participants were 211 patients with documented CAD. Mental stress testing was performed using a public speaking task. Rest-stress myocardial perfusion imaging was the gold standard for ischemia detection. PAT responses were assessed during the 2 phases of the stressful task (stress anticipation and the task performance) and were calculated as a ratio of stress to the resting pulse wave amplitude.Vascular response during the stress anticipation period (speech preparation) was more pronounced than during the actual speaking task (the mean preparation index was 0.64 +/- 0.53 the mean speech index was 0.72 +/- 0.60We identified a pattern of peripheral arterial response to mental stress that has a relatively modest accuracy in predicting MSIMI. Further research is needed to validate the findings of this study.
