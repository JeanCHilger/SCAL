Animal model of metastatic pheochromocytoma: evaluation by MRI and PET. The development of metastatic pheochromocytoma animal model provides a unique opportunity to study the physiology of these rare tumors and to evaluate experimental treatments. Here, we describe the use of small animal imaging techniques to detect, localize and characterize metastatic lesions in nude mice.Small animal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to detect metastatic lesions in nude mice following intravenous injection of mouse pheochromocytoma cells. [18F]-6-fluoro-dopamine ([18F]-DA) and [18F]-L-6-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, which are commonly used for localization of pheochromocytoma lesions in clinical practice, were selected as radiotracers to monitor metastatic lesions by PET.MRI was able to detect liver lesions as small as 0.5mm in diameter. Small animal PET imaging using [18F]-DA and [18F]-DOPA detected liver, adrenal gland, and ovarian lesions.We conclude that MRI is a valuable technique for tumor growth monitoring from very early to late stages of tumor progression and that animal PET confirmed localization of metastatic pheochromocytoma in liver with both radiotracers.
