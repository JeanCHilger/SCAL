Bilateral thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy and laparoscopy, in addition to CT, MRI and PET imaging, are essential to correctly stage and treat patients with mesothelioma prior to trimodality therapy. Trimodality therapy (TMT extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP), chemotherapy and radiation therapy) offers the potential of optimal survival in selected patients with Brigham stage I-II epitheliod mesothelioma based on CT, MRI and PET scanning. We hypothesized that these scanning modalities were inadequate to accurately stage these patients.Patients suitable for TMT, in addition to CT, MRI and PET scanning, prior to EPP, underwent bilateral thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy and laparoscopy (surgical staging). Follow-up CT scans were performed, six monthly, quality of life assessments yearly.From 1 June 2004 to 28 February 2007, 34 patients were referred mean age was 66 years (range: 44-69). Surgical staging was performed in 30 patientsSurgical staging identified 26% of patients who would have received no benefit from TMT.
