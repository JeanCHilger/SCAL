Features of carcinoid heart disease identified by 2- and 3-dimensional echocardiography and cardiac MRI. Carcinoid heart disease is a rare form of valvular heart disease. We sought describe the spectrum of carcinoid heart disease identified by echocardiography and cardiac MRI.Two hundred fifty-two patients with carcinoid syndrome underwent a range of investigations including 2D transthoracic echocardiography, 3D transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography, and cardiac MRI. Fifty-two patients had evidence of carcinoid heart disease. Involvement of the tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic valves were found in 47 (90%), 36 (69%), 15 (29%), and 14 (27%), respectively. Myocardial metastases were found in 2 (3.8%) patients. Several patterns of disease were identified depending on the extent and severity to which each leaflet and its associated subvalvular apparatus was affected. Thirteen of 15 (87%) patients with left-sided carcinoid involvement had a patent foramen ovale. Three patients with severe degree of shunting had severe valvular regurgitation. Patients with mild/moderate degree of shunting had mild or moderate valvular regurgitation. Three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography/transesophageal echocardiography provided detailed anatomic information particularly for the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Cardiac MRI allowed complementary assessment of valvular heart disease and delineation of myocardial metastases. Gallium-68 octreotide positron emission tomography identified neuroendocrine metastases.Carcinoid heart disease is a heterogeneous disease with a wide spectrum of echocardiographic findings. A multimodality approach is needed in patients with this complex pathology.
