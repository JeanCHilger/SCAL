Parkinson's disease spatial covariance pattern: noninvasive quantification with perfusion MRI. Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with elevated expression of a specific disease-related spatial covariance pattern (PDRP) in radiotracer scans of cerebral blood flow and metabolism. In this study, we scanned nine early-stage patients with PD and nine healthy controls using continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI). Parkinson's disease-related metabolic pattern expression in CASL pMRI scans was compared with the corresponding (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography values. The PDRP expression was abnormally elevated (P<0.01) in patients scanned with either modality, and the two values were highly intercorrelated (P<0.0001). Perfusion MRI methods can be used for accurate quantification of disease-related covariance patterns.
