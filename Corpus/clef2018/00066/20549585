Diagnosis of and surgical therapy for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare chromaffin tumours that represent an exceptional challenge for the surgeon because of the concomitant secretion of catecholamines. Recent findings on the genetic background of hereditary tumours have challenged the rule of the 10 % -tumour and significantly changed the requirements for preoperative work-up and surgical strategy. Early detection of malignant growth or multiple hereditary tumours is the goal of imaging techniques such as CT/MRI, (123)I-MIBG-(SPECT) or (18)F-DOPA-PET. However, in the absence of metastasis, reliable differentiation between -benign and malignant growth is preoperatively and even histopathologically rarely possible. An essential precondition for successful surgical therapy with low operative risks is an adequate pretreatment with alpha-adrenergic antagonists which should slowly be increased to 3-5 mg/kg BW/day prior to resection. Dopamine-secreting paragangliomas represent the sole exception. Minimally invasive techniques using a transabdominal or retroperitoneal approach have become the gold standard for the resection of unifocal benign pheochromocytomas. In addition, most paragangliomas located below the diaphragm can be resected with a minimally invasive approach which, however, demands exceptional expertise. Open transabdominal resections are an approved therapy for large or potentially -malignant tumours and for settings with multi-focal tumour sites. Even for advanced malignant tumours, surgical debulking may be reasonable to improve the patient's quality of life and prognosis.
