9-(4-[ A potential approach to the treatment of diseases and genetic disorders in humans is gene therapy [PubMed]. This is a technique whereby the absent or malfunctioning gene is replaced by a working gene to produce an enzyme or a protein to correct the progression of disease. Noninvasive molecular imaging technologies play an important role in the fields of gene therapy by monitoring gene expression continuously in living animals (1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical imaging, ultrasound imaging, and radionuclide imaging (positon emission tomography (PET)/single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)) modalities have been applied for gene therapy of cancer, cardiovascular, neurological, musculoskeletal, hepatic, immunological, diabetic, and inherited diseases in small animals (2-10). These noninvasive imaging technologies allow quantitative assessments of the magnitude, location, and duration of the transgene expression. Gene therapy can be achieved either by
