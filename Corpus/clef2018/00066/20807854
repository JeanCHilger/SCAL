Impact of 18F-FDG PET/CT with retrograde filling of the urinary bladder in patients with suspected pelvic malignancies. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of selective pelvic PET/CT with retrograde bladder irrigation in evaluating pelvic pathologies.Thirty-eight patients (22 women and 16 men), with a mean age of 61 y (range, 41-81 y) and a neoplastic background (most of them of pelvic pathology), were assessed with PET/CT. The most prevalent findings were urothelial (14 cases), gynecologic (12 cases), and rectal (7 cases) cancers. All but 3 patients had undergone previous surgical procedures or radio- or chemotherapy. Twenty-two patients had suspected pelvic pathology on a previous diagnostic CT scan. All the patients underwent a standard PET/CT protocol (from head to upper thighs) 60 min after the intravenous injection of 370 MBq of (18)F-FDG. Additional delayed pelvic PET/CT images were acquired with a filled-bladder technique. Both series of images were assessed by 2 experienced observers. A lesion was classified as malignant if it showed a standardized uptake value greater than 2.5 or, in the case of subcentimetric lesions, any uptake greater than background activity that persisted or increased on delayed pelvic imaging. All lesions were evaluated histologically or by clinical follow-up.Twenty-seven of 43 studies were categorized as pathologic using PET/CT. Nineteen studies showed abnormalities in the pelvis the findings of 5 of these studies were false-positive. Ten studies showed pathologic (18)F-FDG uptake in the bladder wallIn (18)F-FDG PET studies, retrograde filling of the urinary bladder is recommended to assess bladder wall lesions and malignancies in other pelvic locations.
