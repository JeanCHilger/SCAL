Post-treatment [¹⁸F]FDG maximum standardized uptake value as a prognostic marker of recurrence in endometrial carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to determine whether post-treatment [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake measured as the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) by integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging has prognostic significance in patients with endometrial carcinoma.Patients previously treated by primary surgical staging for endometrial carcinoma were imaged with integrated FDG PET/CT during surveillance. PET/CT findings were compared with histological or clinical evaluation, and the relationship between SUV(max) on PET/CT and recurrence was examined.A total of 61 patients were eligible for analysis. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for clinical data, treatment modalities and outcome. The median duration of follow-up was 31 months (range 6-102 months) post-treatment. SUV(max) levels were inversely associated with disease-free survival (DFS). Patients were divided into two groups according to SUV(max) (< 4.25 versus ≥ 4.25). The Kaplan-Meier survival graph showed a significant difference in DFS between groups [p < 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) 12.959, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.650-46.011]. In multivariate analyses, post-treatment SUV(max) (uncategorized values) evaluated by surveillance PET/CT (p = 0.001, HR 1.199, 95% CI 1.077-1.334) and serous adenocarcinoma histology (p = 0.028, HR 5.594, 95% CI 1.207-25.931) were significantly associated with recurrence.Post-treatment FDG uptake as measured by SUV(max) showed a significant association with recurrence in patients with endometrial carcinoma and may be used as a new useful prognostic marker.
