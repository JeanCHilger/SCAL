Early quantitative detection of vascularity of the reduced femoral head of congenital hip dislocation by scintigraphy. Vascularity of the femoral head of CDH was detected by 99mTc-MDP scintigraphy before and after reduction. The results showed that a decrease of second time-activity, intersection of minute time-activity and remarkable decrease of relative ratio and corrected relative ratio on the part of femoral head which closed to the acetabulum is the diagnosis criterion for the obstruction of blood supply of the reduced femoral head. We confirmed that the mechanical pressure was the factor which caused the obstruction of blood supply of the reduced femoral head.
