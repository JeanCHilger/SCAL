Intrapericardial, but not extrapericardial, fat is an independent predictor of impaired hyperemic coronary perfusion in coronary artery disease. To measure intrapericardial fat (IPF), extrapericardial fat (EPF), and myocardial perfusion (MBF) in patients with and without coronary artery disease (CAD), hypothesizing that perfusion is more strongly associated with IPF because it is in direct anatomic contiguity with the myocardium or coronary arteries.Fat surrounding the heart may increase the risk of CAD and calcification, but little is known about the role of MBF in this relationship. The study included 107 patients with an intermediate likelihood of CAD. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography was used to measure IPF and EPF volumes and coronary artery calcium level, together with MBF at rest and during adenosine-induced hyperemia. Subsequently, all subjects underwent coronary angiography and were grouped for presence/absence of CAD and severity of myocardial hypoperfusion. IPF and EPF levels were higher in men and in patients with CAD (n=85) than in those without CAD (n=22) (P<0.001). EPF was increased regardless of the degree of stenoses (n=45), whereas IPF was selectively increased in subjects with obstructive stenoses (n=40). IPF and EPF levels were both associated with coronary artery calcium scores (R=0.25 and R=0.26, respectively P<0.02), coronary flow reserve (R=-0.37 and R=-0.38, respectivelyCAD is accompanied by augmented fat depots surrounding the heart, which are negatively related to coronary flow hyperemia. Among fat depots, IPF was the only independent predictor of hyperemic MBF, supporting the hypothesis of a direct paracrine/vasocrine effect.
