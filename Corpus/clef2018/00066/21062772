Prognostic value of cardiac sympathetic nerve activity evaluated by [123I]m-iodobenzylguanidine imaging in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Many studies have shown that cardiac sympathetic nerve activity evaluated by [(123)I]m-iodobenzylguanidine ([(123)I]MIBG) scintigraphic study during a stable period is useful for determining the prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure.To examine whether results of this imaging method performed 3 weeks after the onset of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are a reliable prognostic marker for patients with STEMI.The study analysed findings for 213 consecutive patients with STEMI undergoing [(123)I]MIBG scintigraphy. The left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and end-systolic volume and LV ejection fraction (EF) were determined by left ventriculography or echocardiography 3 weeks after the onset of STEMI. The delayed total defect score, heart-to-mediastinum ratio and washout rate (WR) were also determined from [(123)I]MIBG scintigraphy at the same time.Of the 213 patients, 46 experienced major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during the study. The median follow-up period was 982 days. Patients were divided into an event-free group (n = 167 78.4%) and a MACE group (n = 46WR evaluated by [(123)I]MIBG scintigraphy 3 weeks after the onset of STEMI is a significant predictor of MACE in patients with STEMI, independent of LVEF.
