Evaluation of [18F]-tetrafluoroborate as a potential PET imaging agent for the human sodium/iodide symporter in a new colon carcinoma cell line, HCT116, expressing hNIS. Accumulation of iodide and other substrates via the human sodium/iodide symporter (hNIS) is fundamental to imaging and therapy of thyroid disease, hNIS reporter gene imaging and hNIS-mediated gene therapy. There is no readily available positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for hNIS. Our aim was to develop a colon carcinoma cell line stably expressing hNIS, and use it to evaluate a novel hNIS PET tracer, [18F]-tetrafluoroborate.Colon carcinoma cell line, HCT116, was stably transfected with hNIS, thus producing a cell line, HCT116-C19, with high hNIS expression. A Fisher rat thyroid cell line, FRTL5, which expresses rat sodium/iodide symporter when stimulated with thyroid-stimulating hormone, was used for comparison. Accumulation of [188Re]-perrhenate, [99mTc]-pertechnetate and [18F]-tetrafluoroborate was evaluated with and without perchlorate inhibition using an automated radioimmune assay system, LigandTracer. The affinity of [18F]-tetrafluoroborate for hNIS, and its half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for the inhibition of [99mTc]-pertechnetate transport were determined from the plateau accumulation of [18F]-tetrafluoroborate and [99mTc]-pertechnetate, respectively, as a function of tetrafluoroborate concentration.[18F]-tetrafluoroborate accumulated effectively in both FRTL5 and HCT116-C19 cells. The accumulation in HCT116-C19 cells (plateau accumulation 31%) was comparable to that of [188Re]-perrhenate (41%) and [99mTc]-pertechnetate (46%). Its affinity for hNIS and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for the inhibition of pertechnetate uptake was approximately micromolar.We have produced a human colon cell line with a stable constitutive expression of functional hNIS (HCT116-hNIS-C19). [18F]-tetrafluoroborate accumulates in cells expressing hNIS or rat sodium/iodide symporter and is a potential PET imaging agent in thyroid disease and hNIS reporter gene imaging.
