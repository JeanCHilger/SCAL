Cloning and expression of novel swine gene BCL-G(L) in E.coli and preparation of its polyclonal antibody in guinea pigs. In order to express a novel gene named as BCL-G(L) of swine in E.coli and prepare its polyclonal antibody.The contig sequence of the gene was predicted and in silicon cloned by blasting the human BCL-G(L) in swine ESTs database in NCBI. The cloning sequence was obtained by RT-PCR from swine spleen. The cloning sequence was identified by sequencing and compared with the contig sequence. Then the gene was cloned into a prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a to construct a recombinant plasmid named as pET32a-BCL-G(L)The titer of the antibody was 1:800 detected by ELISA. The protein BCL-G(L) can be specifically detected by western blot assay using the polyclonal antibody.The novel swine gene BCL-G(L) was cloned and expressed in E.coli and its polyclonal antibody was prepared successfully.
