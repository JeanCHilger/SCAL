Environmental risk factors in the first year of life and childhood asthma in the Central South of Chile. Childhood asthma has a high prevalence in South America--a region of the world currently undergoing a thorough modernization and transition process. Asthma in South America is mainly associated with poor urban environment, which actually may challenge the role of the hygiene hypothesis. We systematically assessed the impact of environmental factors in the first year of life on asthma.A case-control study including 188 asthmatics and 294 hospital-based controls aged 6-15 years was carried out in the Central South of Chile. Parents of study participants completed a computer-assisted interview on environmental factors (such as birth order, day-care attendance, pneumonia infection, regular animal and furry pet contact, and environmental tobacco smoke exposure) in the first year of life and potential confounders. Atopy was assessed using skin prick tests. Multivariate logistic regression models were calculated to assess the association between exposures and asthma, adjusting for potential confounders.Day-care attendance (OR = 0.31 95% CI: 0.10, 0.94) and regular farm animal contact (OR = 0.38Our results suggest that the hygiene hypothesis is also applicable in the Chilean setting, a South American country in epidemiological transition.
