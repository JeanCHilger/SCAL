Clinical and histopathologic correlates of 11C-alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT) PET abnormalities in children with intractable epilepsy. Interictal increase of (11) C-alpha-methyl-l-tryptophan (AMT) on positron emission tomography (PET) can be seen in cortical epileptic foci, and is particularly common in cortical developmental malformations. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the clinical and histopathologic correlates of AMT-PET abnormalities in children with intractable epilepsy undergoing resective surgery.Thirty children (mean age: 6.7 Â± 3.2 years) were included in this study. All patients received AMT-PET as part of their presurgical evaluation and subsequently underwent epilepsy surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were normal in 15, showed nonspecific changes in 8, and suggested malformations of cortical development (MCDs) in nine children. Asymmetry indices (AIs) were calculated to determine increased AMT uptake.Histopathology revealed MCDs in 16 (53%) children, including 12 with cortical dysplasia (CD) [mild MCD = 3 CD type IA = 2Increased AMT uptake in children with CD may predict type IIB dysplasia (with balloon cells) and good surgical outcome. Histopathologic similarities between CD type IIB and epileptogenic cortical tubers may imply a common role of the inflammatory kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism in these lesions. In children with normal histopathology, there is a subgroup with increased AMT uptake and poor surgical outcome.
