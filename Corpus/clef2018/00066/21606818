ACR appropriateness CriteriaÂ® pretreatment evaluation and follow-up of endometrial cancer of the uterus. Endometrial cancer is one of the common malignancies in the female genital tract. Imaging in pretreatment evaluation may play an important role in an assessment of morphological prognostic factors including tumor size, depth of myometrial invasion, endocervical extent, and lymph node status. Imaging is also useful in posttreatment evaluation of patients with clinically suspected recurrence. Various modalities including MRI, CT ultrasound and FDG PET-CT-CT have been used for evaluation of the endometrial cancer in both before and after treatment settings. Literature on the indications and usefulness of these imaging studies for endometrial cancer is reviewed.
