Labelled agents for PET studies of the dopaminergic system--some quality assurance methods, experience and issues. Practical methods are described for the quality assurance of three labelled agents (L-6-[18F]fluoro-DOPA, S-[N-methyl-11C]nomifensine and [O-methyl-11C]raclopride) now produced regularly for PET studies of the dopaminergic system in man. These include indirect methods for the initial determination of label position (e.g. 13C-NMR spectroscopy) and also direct methods for the assessment of chiral purity (TLC and HPLC) and the routine determination of radiochemical purity, chemical purity and specific activity (HPLC). Mass spectrometry has been used to identify some impurities. L-6-hydroxy-DOPA (a precursor in vivo of the neurotoxin, L-6-hydroxydopamine) has been detected by HPLC in some preparations of L-6-[18F]fluoro-DOPA. Formulated S-[N-methyl-11C]nomifensine has been found to decrease in radiochemical purity with storage, whereas formulated [O-methyl-11C]raclopride has been found to be stable. Some quality assurance issues are discussed in relation to experience in the application of the described methods and the obtained results.
