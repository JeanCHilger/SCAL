Insights from darkness: what the study of blindness has taught us about brain structure and function. Vision plays a central role in how we represent and interact with the world around us. Roughly, one-third of the cortical surface in primates is involved in visual processes. The loss of vision, either at birth or later in life, must therefore have profound consequences on brain organization and on the way the world is perceived and acted upon. In this chapter, we formulate a number of critical questions. Do blind individuals indeed develop supra-normal capacities for the remaining senses in order to compensate for their loss of vision? Do brains from sighted and blind individuals differ, and how? How does the brain of someone who has never had any visual perception form an image of the external world? We discuss findings from animal research as well from recent psychophysical and functional brain imaging studies in sighted and blind individuals that shed some new light on the answers to these questions.
