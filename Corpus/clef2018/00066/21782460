Assessing the performance and longevity of Nb, Pt, Ta, Ti, Zr, and ZrO₂-sputtered Havar foils for the high-power production of reactive [18F]F by proton irradiation of [18O]H2O. As water-soluble ionic contaminants, which arise following proton irradiation of [18O]H2O have been associated with decreased [18F]FDG yields, the minimization of these contaminants is an asset in improving the [18F]F reactivity. To this end, we have previously demonstrated that the use of Nb-sputtered Havar foils results in decreased radionuclidic and chemical impurities in proton irradiated [18O]H2O, improved [18F]FDG yields, and improved [18F]FDG yield consistency when compared with non-sputtered Havar. Resulting from the highly reactive chemical microenvironment within the target however, this niobium layer is observed to degrade over time. To find a material that displays increased longevity with regards to maintaining high [18F]F reactivity, this project extensively investigated and compared Havar foils sputtered with Nb, Pt, Ta, Ti, Zr and ZrO₂. Of the materials investigated, the results of this study suggest that Ta-sputtered Havar foil is the preferred choice. For similar integrated currents (~1,000,000 μA min), when comparing the Ta-sputtered Havar with Nb-sputtered Havar we observed: (i) greater than an order of magnitude decrease in radionuclidic impurities, (ii) a 6.4 percent increase (p=0.0025) in the average TracerLab MX [18F]FDG yield, and (iii) an overall improvement in the FDG yield consistency. Excellent performance of the Ta-sputtered foil was maintained throughout its ~1,500,000 μA min lifetime.
