Spatial distribution of seroprevalence for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia canis, and Dirofilaria immitis in dogs in Washington, Oregon, and California. In the US little spatially defined information regarding exposure to most vector-borne pathogens in dogs is available for the states of California (CA), Oregon (OR), and Washington (WA).The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the spatial distribution of seroprevalence for 4 vector-borne pathogens, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia canis, and Dirofilaria immitis, across the 3 western coastal states of the contiguous United States that extend from the northern Mexican to the southern Canadian border.A convenience sample, targeting blood from 20 pet dogs per county across CA, OR, and WA, was evaluated using a canine point-of-care ELISA kit. Geographic coordinates of home zip code were displayed using a geographic information system. A total of 2431 dogs from CA, OR, and WA were tested.The overall seroprevalence was highest for A. phagocytophilum (2.4%), followed by B. burgdorferi (1.2%), and E. canis (0.7%). The prevalence of infection with D. immitis was 0.7%. At the individual dog level, there was a significant association between seropositivity to B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum (odds ratio=18.7, 95% confidence interval=6.8-47.1). For most positive results, prevalence tended to decrease with increasing latitude thus, the highest rates of seropositivity occurred in CA, followed by OR, and then WASeropositivity for vector-borne pathogens is broadly but patchily distributed in dogs in CA, OR, and WA.
