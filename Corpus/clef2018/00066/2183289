Ga-67 SPECT before and after treatment of lymphoma. The results of planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) gallium-67 scintigraphy performed before and after treatment were compared in 77 patients with lymphoma at 240 sites. Before treatment, the sensitivity of planar scintigraphy was 78% and the specificity was 97% after treatment, 84% and 96%, respectively. Before treatment, SPECT had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 98%
