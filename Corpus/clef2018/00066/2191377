Definitive diagnosis of hepatic hemangiomas: MR imaging versus Tc-99m-labeled red blood cell SPECT. Thirty-seven patients with 69 suspected hemangiomas found by means of computed tomography (CT) and/or ultrasound were studied with both 0.5-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and single photon emission CT (SPECT) with technetium-99m-labeled red blood cells. Using a criterion of "perfusion-blood pool mismatch," SPECT readers diagnosed 50 of 64 hemangiomas and all five "nonhemangiomas" (sensitivity, 78% [95% confidence interval, 0.664 - 0.864] accuracy, 80% [0.69 - 0.877]). Qualitative analysis of lesion signal intensity on T2-weighted spin-echo MR images allowed readers to diagnose 58 of 64 hemangiomas and four of five nonhemangiomas (sensitivity, 91% [0.814 - 0.96]
