Prospects for imaging-related biomarkers of human epileptogenesis: a critical review. To facilitate the study of epileptogenesis in humans, noninvasive biomarkers of epileptogenesis are required. No validated biomarker is currently available, but brain imaging techniques provide many attractive candidates. In this article we examine the imaging features of temporal lobe epilepsy, focusing on those that may precede the onset of epilepsy and correlate with epileptogenesis. Hippocampal volumetry and T(2) relaxometry are proposed as candidate biomarkers of epileptogenesis in temporal lobe epilepsy following febrile status epilepticus. Preliminary data suggest that these have promise, and the ongoing Consequences of Prolonged Febrile Seizures in Childhood (FEBSTAT) study will provide more conclusive evidence as to their validity. At this time there are no other clear candidates for imaging-related biomarkers of epileptogenesis in human studies.
