Diagnosis and initiation of treatment in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common cause of parkinsonism, yet the diagnosis and management can be a challenge. The United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria and dopamine transporter/single-photon emission computed tomography (DaT-SPECT) are diagnostic aids that can improve diagnostic accuracy. Even though PD is a progressive disease, for years, physicians and patients have delayed treatment until functional disability occurs. However, studies of monoamine oxidase-type B (MAO-B) inhibitors, dopamine agonists, and levodopa, all of which can be used as initial therapy, have demonstrated that PD patients receiving treatment do better than those who do not receive treatment, and some studies have shown that those receiving treatment earlier do better long term. Therefore, the management strategy for PD has moved toward earlier initiation of treatment. Although treatment for each patient should be individualized and based on their specific symptoms, severity, and lifestyle, in general MAO-B inhibitors may be used initially to treat mild symptoms, adding a dopamine agonist in younger patients or levodopa in older patients, as symptoms become more severe.
