Long-term outcome of angioplasty or stent placement for stenosis of the cavernous or petrous portion of the internal carotid artery. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stent placement are effective in patients with stenosis of the cavernous or petrous portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA), but the long-term outcomes remain unclear. The present study evaluated long-term outcomes in 54 patients treated by PTA or stent placement for stenotic lesions involving more than 50% of the cavernous or petrous portion of the ICA with ischemic symptoms or without ischemic symptoms if cerebral blood flow on single photon emission computed tomography images was decreased by 20% compared with the contralateral side. Follow-up magnetic resonance, three-dimensional computed tomography, and conventional angiography were performed. Patient condition in the follow-up period was investigated using telephone interviews or questionnaires. PTA was used to treat 13 lesions and stent placement for 41 lesions. Permanent and transient complications occurred in 2 and 5 patients, respectively. The morbidity rate was 13% (7 of 54 patients). The follow-up period ranged from 3 to 80 months (mean 29.9 months), and restenosis and occlusion were recognized in 4 patients (7.4%). Five patients died (2 of malignancy and 3 of myocardial infarction) during the follow-up period. PTA and stent placement are safe and effective in patients with stenosis of the cavernous or petrous portion of the ICA, and result in low long-term rates of restenosis.
