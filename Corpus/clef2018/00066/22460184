Peritoneal phosphate removal varies by peritoneal dialysis regimen: an underestimated parameter of phosphate control. The optimization of phosphate (P) removal by peritoneal dialysis (PD) is often underestimated. Our objective was to investigate peritoneal P clearance and its relationship with standard adequacy targets, hyperphosphatemia and automated PD (APD) parameters.Dialysis dose, P clearances (24-hour urine and effluent samples), estimated percentage of diffusive P removal and peritoneal transport rate (PET) were evaluated in 77 adult prevalent PD patients.Total P removal strongly correlated with residual renal function parameters, dissociated from peritoneal Kt/V urea (r=-0.36 p=0.02) and creatinine clearance (r=-0.32P peritoneal clearance is a modifiable parameter of P control in PD regimens and an additional adequacy target. Prescription skills are recommended in APD patients, particularly in anurics, to take into account peritoneal transport rate.
