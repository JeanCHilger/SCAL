Theranostics: evolution of the radiopharmaceutical meta-iodobenzylguanidine in endocrine tumors. Since 1981, meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), labeled with (131)I and later (123)I, has become a valuable agent in the diagnosis and therapy of a number of endocrine tumors. Initially, the agent located pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PGLs), both sporadic and familial, in multiple anatomic sites surgeons were thereby guided to excisional therapies, which were previously difficult and sometimes impossible. The specificity in diagnosis has remained above 95%, but sensitivity has varied with the nature of the tumor: close to 90% for intra-adrenal pheochromocytomas but 70% or less for PGLs. For patients with neuroblastoma, carcinoid tumors, and medullary thyroid carcinoma, imaging with radiolabeled MIBG portrays important diagnostic evidence, but for these neoplasms, use has been primarily as an adjunct to therapy. Although diagnosis by radiolabeled MIBG has been supplemented and sometimes surpassed by newer scintigraphic agents, searches by this radiopharmaceutical remain indispensable for optimal care of some patients. The radiation imparted by concentrations of (131)I-MIBG in malignant pheochromocytomas, PGLs, carcinoid tumors, and medullary thyroid carcinoma has reduced tumor volumes and lessened excretions of symptom-inflicting hormones, but its value as a therapeutic agent is being fulfilled primarily in attacks on neuroblastomas, which are scourges of children. Much promise has been found in tumor disappearance and prolonged survival of treated patients. The experiences with therapeutic (131)I-MIBG have led to development of new tactics and strategies and to well-founded hopes for elimination of cancers. Radiolabeled MIBG is an exemplar of theranostics and remains a worthy agent for both diagnosis and therapy of endocrine tumors.
