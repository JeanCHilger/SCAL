Peptides and receptors in image-guided therapy: theranostics for neuroendocrine neoplasms. Theranostics of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) based on molecular imaging using receptor positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with (68)Ga-labeled somatostatin (SMS) analogs and molecular radiotherapy applying peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRNT) with (90)Y- and/or (177)Lu-labeled peptides has paved the way to personalized medicine. SMS receptor PET/CT enables very accurate detection of NENs and their metastases with high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and provides quantitative, reproducible data that can be used for selecting patients for PRRNT and evaluation of therapy response. Among other advantages are the fast imaging protocol (total study time, 60-90 minutes), low radiation burden (10-12 mSv), flexibility in daily use, and lower cost than octreotide scintigraphy. As we move toward personalized medicine, the diagnostic information obtained from PET/CT must be improved, that is, by fast routine quantification of lesions. PRRNT is highly effective for the treatment of NENs, even in very advanced cases, and lends a benefit in overall survival of several years. In addition, significant improvement in clinical symptoms and excellent palliation can be achieved. In patients with progressive NENs, fractionated, personalized PRRNT with lower doses of radioactivity given over a longer period (Bad Berka Concept) results in good therapeutic responses. By this concept, severe hematologic and/or renal toxicity can be reduced or completely avoided, and the quality of life can be improved. Sequential (DUO-PRRNT) and concurrent (TANDEM-PRRNT) administrations of radiopeptides are more effective in progressive NEN than using either radionuclide alone. PRRNT should only be performed at specialized centers, as NEN patients need highly individualized interdisciplinary treatment and long-term care.
