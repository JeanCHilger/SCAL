Preoperative evaluation of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity: fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography and ultrasonography versus histopathology. The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and ultrasonography (US) in the staging of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.We compared preoperative evaluations regarding lymph nodes using PET/CT, US, and both methods. The cutoff for the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) in PET/CT was set at 2.7 by a receiver operating characteristic analysis that was based on the histopathological diagnosis. US was used to examine internal structural changes on B-mode and hilar vascularity on power Doppler.The performance of PET/CT and US in combination was better than that of each modality separately. However, there were histopathological changes that could not be detected on PET/CT or US. PET/CT could not detect nodes with necrotic or cystic changes. US could not detect lymph nodes that did not have abnormal structures.PET/CT and US are complementary tools to evaluate preoperative patients.
