Extragranular storage of the neuron blocking agent meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) in human neuroblastoma cells. Human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells accumulate and store the adrenal imaging agent metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) with minor involvement of specialized cytoplasmic storage granules (Smets LA et al., Active uptake and extravesicular storage of meta-iodo-benzylguanidine in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. Cancer Res 49: 2941-2944, 1989). In the present study the mechanism of extravesicular MIBG retention was investigated and compared with granular storage of MIBG and norepinephrine (NE) in PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells. SK-N-SH cells concentrated both MIBG and NE by neuron-specific Uptake-1 but long-term retention was only observed with MIBG. Retention of accumulated NE was, however, promoted by inhibition of intracellular catecholamine degradation with pyrogallol. Drug release by controlled cell permeabilization and by KCl-induced exocytosis indicated that MIBG was mainly stored as freely diffusible, cytoplasmic molecules. SK-N-SH cells were depleted from stored MIBG by the Uptake-1 inhibitor imipramine but poorly so by the granule-depleting drug reserpine. Conversely, PC-12 cells were depleted by reserpine but insensitive to imipramine. The data suggest that extravesicular retention of MIBG in SK-N-SH cells is not based on intracellular sequestration but is solely due to efficient re-uptake of accumulated drug after leaking from the cells. The accumulation of MIBG in SK-N-SH cells, reflecting "pure" Uptake-1, appears to be a powerful system for exploring various cellular and molecular aspects of catecholamine uptake.
