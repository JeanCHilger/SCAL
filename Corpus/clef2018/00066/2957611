The combined use of positron emission tomography and DNA polymorphisms for preclinical detection of Huntington's disease. Twenty-three persons at risk for Huntington's disease (HD) have been studied using a polymorphic human linked DNA marker (D4S10) and positron emission tomography (PET). We determined the likelihood of inheritance of the gene for HD in 13 persons, using DNA polymorphism studies. Of these, eight persons had a greater than 90% probability of being presymptomatic heterozygotes for HD. Three of these eight subjects had caudate glucose utilization detected by PET that was more than 2 standard deviations (SD) below the age-matched control mean. Measurement of caudate glucose utilization in the other five presumed presymptomatic heterozygotes revealed results between 1 and 2 SD below the mean. Five persons had a less than 10% likelihood of having inherited the abnormal gene for HD. Of these, four had normal rates of glucose utilization in the caudate nuclei. However, one individual with DNA results indicating a low risk of developing HD had abnormally low measures of caudate glucose utilization. This suggests that a recombination had occurred between the linked marker and the gene in this person. These studies suggest that PET studies of caudate glucose utilization may help to confirm results of DNA studies in some persons, and may provide an opportunity to detect when DNA results may be incorrect due to recombination.
