Isolation and characterization of the yeast gene coding for the alpha subunit of mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. The respiratory defect of pet mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae assigned to complementation group G120 has been ascribed to their inability to acylate the mitochondrial phenylalanyl tRNA. A fragment of wild type yeast genomic DNA capable of complementing the genetic lesion of G120 mutants has been cloned by transformation with a yeast genomic recombinant library of a representative mutant from this complementation group. The gene designated as MSF1 has been subcloned on a 2.2-kilobase pair fragment and its nucleotide sequence determined. The predicted protein product of MSF1 has a molecular weight of 55,314 and has several domains of high primary sequence homology to the alpha subunit of the Escherichia coli phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. Based on the phenotype of G120 mutants and the homology to the bacterial protein, MSF1 is proposed to code for the alpha subunit of yeast mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. Disruption of the chromosomal copy of MSF1 in the respiratory-competent haploid strain W303-1B induces a phenotype similar to G120 mutants but does not affect cell viability, indicating that the cytoplasmic phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase of yeast is encoded by a separate gene. Although the E. coli and yeast mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are sufficiently similar in their primary sequences to suggest a common evolutionary origin, they have undergone significant changes as evidenced by the low homology in some regions of the polypeptide chains and the presence in the mitochondrial enzyme of two domains that are lacking in the bacterial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase.
