Fast chemical synthesis of [75Se]L-selenomethionine. A fast chemical synthesis of high specific activity [75Se]L-selenomethionine (10 Ci/mmol--370 GBq/mmol) is described with a view to 73Se labeling and PET studies. The overall radiochemical yield of the preparation is better than 80%. The purification method uses commercially available reverse phase HPLC columns and 9% NaCl as mobile phase. The final labeled compound is obtained in less than 3 h and the chemical, radiochemical and optical purities of the L-isomer are higher than 99.0%.
