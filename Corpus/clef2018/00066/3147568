Effect of glycosylation inhibitors on the binding of insulin and lectins and on hormonal imprinting in Tetrahymena. Treatment of the unicellular Tetrahymena with inhibitors of glycosylation (glucosamine or 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose) leads, with a few exceptions, to enhancement of the binding of FITC-labelled insulin and lectins (Con-A, Helix, Datura). The development of insulin-evoked imprinting (i.e., the enhancement of binding at subsequent contacts) is not prevented by the administration of glucosamine. Meanwhile the administration of fluoroglucose results, on its own, in enhanced binding. This increased binding capacity cannot be further enhanced by imprinting.
