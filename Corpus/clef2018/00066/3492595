SPECT thallium-201 scintigraphy for the detection of left-ventricular aneurysm. We have noted that the presence of left ventricular anterior/apical aneurysm on contrast ventriculography or echocardiography correlates well with the finding of failure of convergence of the left ventricular walls toward the apex on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) thallium-201 images. To assess this observation, we analyzed the SPECT thallium scans of 74 sequential patients who had SPECT thallium scintigraphy and contrast ventriculography and/or echocardiography for evaluation of coronary artery disease. Immediate post-stress and 4-hr redistribution thallium-201 SPECT images, obtained following i.v. administration of 2 mCi of thallium-201, were reconstructed with no attenuation correction using three-dimensional linear and nonlinear filters and displayed in short, vertical-long, and horizontal-long axes. Of the 74 patients, contrast ventriculography and/or echocardiography showed anterior/apical aneurysms in 15 and a posterolateral aneurysm in one. SPECT thallium scans detected 14 of the 16 aneurysms, based on the criterion of failure of convergence of the ventricular walls toward the apex. There were two false-positives. Thus SPECT thallium-201 scintigraphy for the detection of left-ventricular aneurysm in this series had a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 97%, and an accuracy of 96%.
