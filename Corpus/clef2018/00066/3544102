Application of the Talairach stereotaxic system for the purpose of establishing a common reference plane for brain imaging technics (CAT scan, NMRI, PET scan). Confrontation of data obtained from several modern imaging techniques (CAT Scan, NMR Scan, PET Scan) is a fundamental problem in actual neurological practice and must be correlated with histology. For that purpose, we use the referential plane of the stereotactic Talairach frame. Using teflon intraosseous buttons, the referential plane and a common zero reference point can be objectivated by CAT, NMR and/or PET Scans. A computer program gives the exact coordinates of the chosen target. These coordinates are immediately usable in the operating room for stereotactic serial biopsies.
