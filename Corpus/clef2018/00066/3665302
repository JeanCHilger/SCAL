Diagnosis and treatment of neuroblastoma using metaiodobenzylguanidine. Neuroblastoma is a lethal and not uncommon tumor in childhood. Early detection and display of the spread of the tumor is highly desirable for proper treatment. Nine children suspected of having neuroblastomas were examined by I-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (I-131 MIBG) imaging. In two recent studies I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (I-123 MIBG) was used. A primary adrenal neuroblastoma was correctly identified in three cases. In two patients additional tumor sites were found. In one patient, who was in complete remission, no pathologic accumulation of I-131 MIBG was found. I-131 MIBG images were also normal in four patients with other types of neoplastic diseases. A boy with multiple metastases was treated with 100 mCi of I-131 MIBG. He developed transient gastrointestinal illness and there was no regression of the tumor deposits. In one girl with a large adrenal neuroblastoma high uptake of I-131 MIBG was observed. She received two therapy doses of I-131 MIBG (35 mCi and 75 mCi) with curative intention giving a total absorbed dose in the tumor of approximately 76 Gy. In spite of high retention of radioactivity in the tumor, regression did not occur, but her general condition was improved. In the present study, images of superior quality were obtained with I-123 MIBG imaging. It is concluded that imaging using I-131 MIBG or I-123 MIBG should be used in both the initial evaluation and the follow-up of children with neuroblastoma.
