Evaluation of an automatic clot-sensing instrument : Coag A Pet 200 (author's transl). The Coag A Pet 200 is an automatic clot-sensing instrument, with two channels the variation in the optical density is detected by a photoelectric system. The results are sequentially printed out with the sample number. A critical evaluation of its performance in hospital use over 7 month, is reported. The series of tests thus automated consists of: one stage prothrombin-time, Owren test, activated partial thromboplastin time, analytical determinations of factors II, V, VII + X, VII, IX, XI, XII. The repeatibility is good: CV ranged between 0.5 to 1.5% or 2%, and a high degree of correlation with the standard manual techniques was found: R: 0.93 TO 0.99. This instrument was easy to master, use and maintain.
