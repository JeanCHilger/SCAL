Inhibitors of protein glycosylation inhibit the differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia cells. Tunicamycin, 2-deoxy-D-glucose and 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose inhibit dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation of Friend cells. This inhibition, characterized by inhibition of hemoglobin synthesis, is accompanied by a specific inhibition of protein glycosylation. The results of cloning experiments indicate that this inhibition specifically affects cells in the period preceding their commitment. These results suggest that glycoprotein synthesis is a requirement for Friend erythroleukemia cells in order to initiate the expression of the terminal differentiation program.
