Measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction from gated technetium-99m sestamibi myocardial images. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and single-photon emission tomographic (SPET) imaging of the myocardium can be performed after a single technetium-99m sestamibi (MIBI) injection. Sixty patients underwent SPET imaging with MIBI. Immediately after SPET acquisition ECG-gated 99mTc-MIBI perfusion images were acquired using 24 planar images per R-R interval. A new method for measurement of LVEF from the ECG-gated 99mTc-MIBI perfusion images was developed. To validate the method, LVEF derived from MIBI perfusion images was compared with that from conventional radionuclide ventriculography in all 60 patients. Forty patients had evidence of myocardial infarction and 20 had normal perfusion on MIBI imaging. There was no statistically significant difference between LVEF computed from 99mTc-MIBI perfusion images and that from radionuclide ventriculography (r = 0.7062, P < 0.001). There was little difference associated with the technique (intraobserver variability r = 0.9772, P < 0.001). Interobserver variability was also good (r = 0.8233, P < 0.001). LVEF from 99mTc-MIBI perfusion images can be obtained at the same time as assessment of myocardial perfusion and in the same orientation and metabolism of the myocardium, thereby permitting more accurate and realistic prognosis and diagnosis in patients with coronary artery disease.
