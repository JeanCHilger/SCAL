A comparative cerebral blood flow study in a baboon model with acetazolamide provocation: 99mTc-HMPAO vs 123I(IMP). Pharmacological interactions are important when nuclear medical procedures are applied to patients under drug therapy, or drug provocation. This study compares in baboon models (regional) cerebral blood flow [(r)CBF] results from 99mTc-HMPAO and 123I-iodoamphetamine [123I(IMP)] each with and without acetazolamide, the latter a suggested drug for testing cerebrovascular reserve. Expected differences in cerebral uptake were observed between the two radio-tracers without acetazolamide. The increase in tracer uptake resulting from acetazolamide is significantly enhanced for 123I(IMP), which could have diagnostic implications.
