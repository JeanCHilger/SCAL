Pharyngeal disorders. Pharyngeal disorders are diverse and can include developmental, traumatic, immune-mediated, infectious, metabolic, endocrine, neurologic, neoplastic, and inflammatory etiologies. Although the clinical history and signalment frequently can localize a disease process to the pharynx, only a careful examination, usually in conjunction with diagnostic tests, can identify the problem. Pharyngeal disorders are of important diagnostic significance. If left untreated, life-threatening respiratory impairment or debilitation and malnutrition may result. For effective treatment, therapy must be aimed at the primary disease process.
