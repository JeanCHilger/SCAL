Specific beta-adrenergic receptor binding of carazolol measured with PET. Carazolol is a promising high-affinity beta-adrenergic receptor ligand for the noninvasive determination of beta receptor status using PET. Earlier investigations demonstrated specific receptor binding of carazolol in mice. These PET studies with S(-)-[2"-11C]carazolol in pigs were performed to explore the utility of the tracer for PET receptor studies.Tracer uptake in the heart and lung was measured by PET as a function of time. Receptors were blocked with propranolol and different doses of ICI 118,551 to estimate specific binding. Fluorine-18-1"-Fluorocarazolol and the less active R-enantiomer of [11C]-carazolol were also studied.Specific receptor binding was 75% of the total uptake in the heart, preventable and displaceable by propranolol. Dose-dependent competition showed that carazolol binds in vivo to beta 1 and to beta 2 subtypes. Uptake of the labeled R(+) enantiomer of carazolol was not receptor-specific.Carazolol labeled with 11C or 18F is a strong candidate for use in receptor estimation with PET. The in vivo observations were consistent with its known high affinity and slow receptor dissociation rate. Its high specific receptor uptake and low metabolism allow existing kinetic models to be applied for receptor measurements. The 11C label is convenient for repeated administrations, though 18F allowed the long observation periods necessary for measurement of the receptor dissociation rate. If needed, nonspecific uptake can be estimated without pharmacologic intervention by using the labeled R enantiomer.
