Follow-up with bone scintigraphy using tomography emission technique (SPECT) after reconstruction of the mandible with iliac crest transplants. Fifteen patients who underwent mandibular reconstruction with iliac bone grafts where studied by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Six of these patients underwent mandibular reconstruction with revascularized iliac bone grafts. Long-term follow up data by free bone grafts and revascularized bone grafts where very different. The single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is an excellent method for the assessment of the vascular patency and bone viability.
