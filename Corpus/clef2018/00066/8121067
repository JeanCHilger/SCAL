Assessment of vascularity and permeability in brain tumor using SPECT and 99mTc-DTPA-human serum albumin in relation to 201Tl SPECT. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using technetium-99m-DTPA-human serum albumin (99mTc-HSA-D) and thallium-201 chloride (201Tl) was simultaneously performed on 25 patients with brain tumors 10 with brain metastasis, 8 with astrocytoma (Gr. 3) and 7 with meningioma. The early image was obtained 10 minutes after 99mTc-HSA-D (740 MBq) injection, and the delayed image was taken 5 hours after the injection. HSA-D index, based on the ratio of 99mTc-HSA-D uptake in the tumor versus the cortical area, was calculated on each image, and compared with Tl index (tumor/contralateral cerebrum ratio). HSA-D delayed index was significantly greater than HSA-D early index in all tumor types (p < 0.05 by the Wilcoxon ranked sign test). Linear correlation between HSA-D early index and HSA-D delayed index was significant in astrocytoma (Gr. 3) (p < 0.01) and meningioma (p < 0.001), and a linear correlation between HSA-D delayed index and Tl index was significant in astrocytoma (Gr. 3) (p < 0.05). It is concluded that HSA-D early index and delayed index could reflect tumor vascularity and permeability, respectively, and provide supplementary information for Tl index.
