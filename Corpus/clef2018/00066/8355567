16 beta-[18F]fluoromoxestrol: a potent, metabolically stable positron emission tomography imaging agent for estrogen receptor positive human breast tumors. 16 beta-[18F]Fluoromoxestrol (beta FMOX, 1) is a highly selective, metabolically stable estrogen with potential as a receptor imaging agent. It demonstrates receptor-mediated uptake in the immature rat in the estrogen receptor-rich primary target tissues, uterus and ovaries, as well as, in receptor-poor secondary target tissues, muscle, thymus and kidneys uptake in the uterus is nearly four times that of the clinically useful 16 alpha-[18F]fluoroestradiol (FES), most likely due to the extended lifetime of the labeled beta FMOX in the blood afforded by its relatively slow metabolism. In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate a nearly four-fold decrease in metabolism rate between beta FMOX and FES. Dosimetry studies indicate radiation absorbed doses comparable to FES. beta FMOX possesses desirable imaging characteristics and may prove to be a clinically useful imaging agent.
