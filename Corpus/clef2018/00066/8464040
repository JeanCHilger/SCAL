Substituted 3-phenyltropane analogs of cocaine: synthesis, inhibition of binding at cocaine recognition sites, and positron emission tomography imaging. It is now accepted that (-)-cocaine binds to specific recognition sites associated with monoamine transporters in the mammalian brain. In this study, several analogs of 3 beta-phenyltropane-2 beta-carboxylic acid methyl ester were prepared and their potency for inhibiting the binding of [3H]-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane-2 beta-carboxylic acid methyl ester to primate caudate-putamen was evaluated. The synthesis and binding affinity of 3 beta-(3,4- dichlorophenyl)tropane-2 beta-carboxylic acid methyl ester, one of the most potent cocaine congeners yet reported, is presented. The feasibility of synthesizing high-affinity ligands for cocaine recognition sites and their suitability as PET imaging ligands for cocaine receptors in vivo is demonstrated.
