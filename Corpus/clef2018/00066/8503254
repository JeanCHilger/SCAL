SPET imaging of cerebral perfusion in patients with non-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. The pattern of regional cerebral blood flow was assessed by single photon emission tomography and (99mTc)HM-PAO in 28 patients with clinical diagnosis of non-refractory cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsy on chronic treatment with carbamazepine. Each patient underwent a magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain. An EEG was performed concurrently with the assessment of cerebral blood flow. Areas of focal hypoperfusion were observed in 8/28 patients, and a concurrent EEG focus was identified in 10/28 patients. Areas of hypoperfusion and the EEG foci were consistent in 6 of the 10 patients with EEG abnormalities in 2 patients hypoperfusion and the EEG abnormalities were on opposite sides, though in homologous areas
