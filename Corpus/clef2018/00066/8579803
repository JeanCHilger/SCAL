D2-receptor imaging with [123I]IBZM and single photon emission tomography in psychiatry: a survey of current status. D2-dopamine receptors can be visualized in the human brain in vivo by Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) and the radiolabeled benzamide [123I]IBZM. The present paper reviews the current status of this type of functional brain imaging with respect to basic methodological aspects, data analysis and quantification. The results from published clinical studies in different psychiatric patient populations and normal controls with [123I]IBZM are reviewed. [123I]IBZM-SPECT is a powerful tool for the investigation of D2-dopamine receptor status in psychiatric disorders, different types of drug treatment as well as therapeutic and side effects of pharmacologic agents. However, there still is a need for standardized imaging times and image-processing procedures. Advantages and disadvantages of SPECT with special regard to Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are also discussed.
