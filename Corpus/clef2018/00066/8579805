99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT in the diagnosis of senile dementia of Alzheimer's type--a study under clinical routine conditions. This study was designed to evaluate, whether investigations of cerebral blood flow can be a helpful diagnostic tool in the differential diagnosis between (senile) dementia of Alzheimer's type [(S)DAT] and geriatric depression with cognitive impairment. Under clinical routine conditions we performed Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) using 99mTc-Hexamethylpropyleneamine Oxime (HMPAO) in 23 patients with (S)DAT (14f, 9m mean age 68.9 y), 17 patients with geriatric depression (9 f, 8 m
