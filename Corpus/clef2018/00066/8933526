Assessment of myocardial viability in persistent defects on thallium-201 SPECT after reinjection using gradient-echo MRI. This prospective study assessed myocardial viability in 30 patients with coronary heart disease and persistent defects despite reinjection on TI-201 single-photon computed tomography (SPECT). In each patient, three observers graded TI-201 uptake in 7 left ventricular wall segments. Gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging in the region of the persistent defect generated 12 to 16 short axis views representing a cardiac cycle. A total of 120 segments were analyzed. Mean end-diastolic wall thickness and systolic wall thickening (+/-SD) was 11.5 +/- 2.7 mm and 5.8 +/- 3.9 mm in 48 segments with normal TI-201 uptake, 10.1 +/- 3.4 mm and 3.7 +/- 3.1 mm in 31 with reversible lesions, 11.3 +/- 2.8 mm and 3.3 +/- 1.9 mm in 10 with mild persistent defects, 9.2 +/- 2.9 mm and 3.2 +/- 2.2 mm in 15 with moderate persistent defects, 5.8 +/- 1.7 mm and 1.3 +/- 1.4 mm in 16 with severe persistent defects, respectively. Significant differences in mean end-diastolic wall thickness (p < 0.0005) and systolic wall thickening (p < 0.005) were found only between segments with severe persistent defects and all other groups, but not among the other groups. On follow-up in 11 patients after revascularization, 6 segments with mild-to-moderate persistent defects showed improvement in mean systolic wall thickening that was not seen in 6 other segments with severe persistent defects. These data indicate that most myocardial segments with mild and moderate persistent TI-201 defects after reinjection still contain viable tissue. Segments with severe persistent defects, however, represent predominantly nonviable myocardium without contractile function.
