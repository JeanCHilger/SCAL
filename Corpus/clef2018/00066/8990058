Comparison of transcranial sonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and single photon emission computed tomography findings in idiopathic spasmodic torticollis. Various lines of evidence suggest that the basal ganglia and thalamus are involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic dystonia, but unfortunately neuroradiological and pathological data are sparse and controversial. In this study, we have examined 10 patients with spasmodic torticollis by neuroimaging techniques, including transcranial sonography (TS n = 10), conventional (n = 10) and diffusion-weighted (n = 5) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT
