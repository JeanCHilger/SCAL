Compartmental analysis of asialoglycoprotein receptor scintigraphy for quantitative measurement of liver function: a multicentre study. A multicentre study on multicompartmental analysis of hepatic scintigraphy using technetium-99m labelled galactosyl serum albumin (GSA), which binds to the asialoglycoprotein receptor, was carried out at seven institutions in Japan. Seventy-four patients with liver disease received 3 mg (185 MBq) of 99mTc-GSA by intravenous injection. Sequential scanning was performed 30 min after injection to obtain anterior images of the heart and liver, followed by single-photon emission tomography (SPET). The indices included in this analysis were hepatic blood flow (Q) and maximal receptor binding rate (Rmax), which showed a good correlation with semiquantitative ratio indices for 99mTc-GSA, namely the retention rate in blood (HH15) and the hepatic uptake rate (LHL15). Q and Rmax also showed a significant correlation with other measures of hepatic function. When patients were grouped according to the severity of chronic liver damage (hepatocellular functional damage), Q was reduced in the moderate and severe groups, while Rmax was reduced in proportion to the functional stage. Both parameters showed no inter-institution difference using analysis of co-variance with the functional stage as a co-variant. With regard to the hepatic uptake rate, anterior planar images and SPET images gave similar results for Q and Rmax. Acquisition times of 15 or 30 min provided the same results. The multicompartmental model analysis permitted comparable results to be obtained at institutions using different gamma cameras, and is therefore considered a universally applicable method. These results indicate that Q and Rmax are useful general indices for evaluating the functional reserve capacity of the liver.
