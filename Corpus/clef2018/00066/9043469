Early localization and reoperation for persistent primary hyperparathyroidism. Reoperation for persistent primary hyperparathyroidism is often performed after a delay of 4-6 months. Success can be expected in over 90 per cent of cases but exploration is technically difficult and there is the possibility of creating permanent hypoparathyroidism and vocal cord paralysis. This is a study of early localization and reoperation.In a consecutive series of 273 patients who had surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism, three remained hypercalcaemic and in three the abnormal parathyroid was not found at initial exploration. They underwent early (6-48 h) single-tracer 99mTc Sestamibi scintigraphy with factor analysis of dynamic structures (FADS) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) followed by reoperation within 24-72 h.Scintigraphy with FADS and SPECT was helpful in all six patients, who were cured by reoperation with no morbidity or symptomatic hypocalcaemia.Reoperation for persistent primary hyperparathyroidism is possible and may be easier within days of an initially unsuccessful procedure. With the intact 1-84 parathyroid hormone measurement, the diagnosis is accurate. Single-tracer 99mTc Sestamibi scintigraphy with FADS and SPECT is non-invasive, easily and rapidly performed, and was accurate in these six patients.
