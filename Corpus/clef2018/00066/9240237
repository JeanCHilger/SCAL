Neuropsychological evaluation in epilepsy surgery. Neuropsychology has played a prominent role throughout the modern era of epilepsy surgery. Neuropsychology, including the Wada test, has been of benefit in documenting dysfunction associated with a lateralized temporal lobe seizure onset. In addition, neuropsychological results have some predicative power regarding seizure outcome following anterior temporal lobectomy. The current status of neuropsychology in patient evaluation and outcome prediction will be presented. Differences between the Wada test, an inactivation procedure, and functional magnetic resonance imaging, which is an activation procedure, will be discussed. This paper will also present preliminary information about the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III, the recent revision of the most commonly used test of intellectual function, and its effects on neuropsychological performance results.
