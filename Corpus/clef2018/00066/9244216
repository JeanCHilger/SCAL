Intracoronary Doppler assessment of moderate coronary artery disease: comparison with 201Tl imaging and coronary angiography. FACTS Study Group. Coronary angiography may not reliably predict whether a stenosis causes exercise-induced ischemia. Intracoronary Doppler ultrasound may enhance diagnostic accuracy by providing a physiological assessment of stenosis severity. The goal of this study was to compare intracoronary Doppler ultrasound with both 201Tl imaging and coronary angiography.Fifty-five patients with 67 stenotic coronary arteries underwent coronary angiography with intracoronary Doppler ultrasound and had exercise 201Tl testing within a 1-week period. Coronary flow reserve was measured, and analyses were performed by independent core laboratories. The mean stenosis was 59+/-12% 51 of 67 stenoses were intermediate in severity (40% to 70%). A coronary flow reserve < 1.7 predicted the presence of a stress 201Tl defect in 56 of 67 stenoses (agreement=84%Doppler-derived coronary flow reserve accurately predicts the presence of exercise-induced ischemia on stress 201Tl imaging, and coronary angiography does not reliably assess the physiological significance of an intermediate coronary stenosis.
