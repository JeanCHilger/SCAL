Low back pain and nuclear medicine. Low back pain (LBP) is a major cause of disability in many patients during some time of their lives. In this article the role of nuclear medicine, and more in particular the role of single photon emission tomography (SPECT), in the investigation of LBP is discussed by reviewing the literature. Because of the improved anatomical localization of lesions in the vertebral body when up-to-date SPECT is used, this technique is a powerful imaging modality in patients with LBP. Bone scintigraphy therefore can contribute significantly in the diagnosis of patients with LBP. In cases where conventional radiological techniques fail to elucidate the cause of LBP performing a bone scintigraphy with SPECT should strongly be recommended.
