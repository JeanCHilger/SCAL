A study of dementia in adults with Down's syndrome using 99Tc(m)-HMPAO SPET. Twenty-six people with Down's syndrome (DS) were investigated using 99Tc(m)-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99Tc(m)-HMPAO) and single photon emission tomography (SPET). Dementia was diagnosed using a structured carer interview giving a deterioration score and by studying the case notes. Five subjects were clinically demented, 7 showed mild deterioration and 14 no deterioration. Increased deterioration correlated with advancing age (correlation coefficient 0.5425 P<0.02), but there was no significant difference between older (>40 years) and younger (<40 years) patients. Only one of the subjects with dementia had a regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) abnormality that was of the dementia of Alzheimer type. Three subjects with mild deterioration and three with no deterioration had abnormal SPET scans. There was no association between the SPET abnormality and clinical dementia or with evidence of deterioration.
