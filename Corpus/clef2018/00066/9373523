An ultraviolet spectrophotometric method as an alternative test for determining overall migration from aromatic polyester packaging materials into fatty food oils. The generic test method developed by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) Sub Committee 1 (SC1), CEN ENV 1186, for determining overall migration from plastics into fat simulants is complex, time consuming and the test precision is poor. An ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometric test method that utilizes the first derivative of absorbance (d[A]/d[lambda]) has been developed for determining overall migration into oil from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and other aromatic polyester packaging materials which correlates with overall migration values obtained by the CEN method. The UV method can be used as a control method instead of the CEN method for overall migration testing in most instances and may require only about 10% of the time needed to conduct the CEN test. For modified polyester packaging materials such as foamed articles, the UV test method is a better test for overall migration. In addition to the overall migration information, the UV data also indicate if additional testing for the specific migration of terephthalic acid (TPA) into the fat simulant is required. HB 307 oil is the preferred fatty food simulant but olive oil can also be used.
