Study of aroma scalping through thermosealable polymers used in food packaging by inverse gas chromatography. Scalping of aroma components in polymers used for food packaging was determined by solubility experiments. Aromas were selected from different families: esters, alcohols, hydrocarbons and ketones. Polymers were a linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), an ionomer and a new thermosealable polyester (PET). Polymers were selected from thermosealable materials because of their resistance to fats and oils. Sorption isotherms (low sorbate activity range) for every system aroma (vapour)/polymer were determined by inverse gas chromatography. Isotherms were found to be linear. Hence, solubility coefficients (S) as defined by Henry's law were calculated from the isotherm slopes. According to S values, PET appears to be the best choice to minimize aroma scalping by sorption in the packaging inner layer, Ionomers improve the barrier to aroma when compared with LLDPE except for polar sorbates. Sorption of aroma components was shown to be selective, e.g. limonene was preferentially sorbed in LLDPE. The value of S for the limonene/LLDPE system was 2.5 times the value of S for ethyl caproate/LLDPE. This selectivity may lead to an imbalance in the flavour and may be more important than the prevention of overall scalping.
