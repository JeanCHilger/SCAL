Study on heart-protecting musk pill in improving myocardial ischemia evaluated by nuclear myocardial imaging. The effect of Heart-protecting Musk Pill (HMP) on blood perfusion of the ischemic myocardium by intravenous dipyridamole 99mTc-MIBI single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in 17 patients with coronary heart disease was observed. Results showed that sublingual administration of HMP prior to injection of dipyridamole could remit the cardiac symptoms induced by dipyridamole, such as angina, chest distress, etc. With a remission rate of 85%. HMP could also improve the SPECT image defect significantly, 8 of 11 cases with reversible image defects and 4 of 6 irreversible image defects were improved. It suggested that HMP could improve the blood perfusion of the ischemic myocardium, the total effective rate was 70.6%. No adverse reaction was found.
