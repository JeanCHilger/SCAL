Nuclear medicine approaches for detection of axillary lymph node metastases. In breast cancer patients the detection of axillary lymph node involvement is a very critical issue, in view of the earlier diagnosis of the disease in recent years, and the increased frequency of very small tumors at first presentation. The size of cancer is related to the risk of axillary metastases, and this may affect the prognosis and the therapeutic strategies. Axillary lymph node involvement is generally recognized as an index of distant microdiffusion, and as it affects overall and disease-free survival, represents the basis for adoption of adjuvant chemotherapy. Routine axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is expensive, and does not benefit about 70% of early breast cancer patients which are node negative (pN-). Today most of these patients have to sustain the potential morbidity and the economic costs of ALND. The clinical approach is known to be an unreliable diagnostic tool, and for the detection of axillary metastases, conventional X-ray techniques are also unable to solve the problem. By contrast, nuclear medicine procedures have revealed a very interesting diagnostic potential in recent years. This paper analyzes the numerous studies conducted in the field of lymph node visualization and the heterogeneity of the published experiences, taking into account the different approaches proposed in the literature: a) imaging with gamma-emitting tumor seeking agents b) radioimmunoscintigraphy intravenous (i.v.) or by the interstitial route
