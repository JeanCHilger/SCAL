Count-rate statistics of the gamma camera. The temporal distribution of decay events recorded by a gamma camera in 'list mode' differs from the Poisson distribution because of dead-time effects. We propose a new model for the dead-time behaviour of a gamma camera. The most important feature of our model is that the loss of events occurs in pairs or higher multiples due to the so-called 'pile-up' effect. We analyse the consequences of pile-up for the temporal distribution of events recorded by a gamma camera. The probability distribution for the time intervals between events recorded by the camera is calculated from first principles. We construct estimators for the parameter of the new distribution. We distinguish between the estimation of the total count rate and the estimation of a certain subset of the total count rate. Computer simulation confirms that our estimators are less influenced by dead-time effects than the standard estimator.
