Presurgical contribution of quantitative stereotactic positron emission tomography in temporo limbic epilepsy. We quantified the interictal metabolic changes associated with temporal lobe epilepsy by using an accurate stereotactic method.We selected 16 patients who had proven unilateral focal or regional temporal onset defined by SEEG criteria. Each patient underwent stereotactic MRI and stereotactic [18 fluoro] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET).Asymmetries (mean, +/- SD) were found in mesio-temporal structures: amygdala (-0.033+/-0.027, p = 0.0002), hippocampus (-0.035+/-0.032, p = 0.0006), and superior temporal gyrus (-0.036+/-0.032, p = 0.0004). Four of the sixteen patients had previously had unlocalized qualitative nonstereotactic PET analysis.The quantitative stereotactical PET method allows a higher resolution study of mesio-temporal structures.
