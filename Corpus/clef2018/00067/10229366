Overt signs of toxicity to dogs and cats of dietary deoxynivalenol. Studies were conducted to determine the dietary amounts of deoxynivalenol (DON vomitoxin) in dog and cat food that are required to produce overt signs of toxicity (e.g., vomiting or reduced food intake). Wheat naturally contaminated with 37 mg of DON/kg was used to manufacture pet foods containing 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mg of DON/kg. Deoxynivalenol concentration in pet food following manufacture was unchanged, indicating that the toxin was stable during conventional extrusion processing. Dogs previously fed DON-contaminated food were able to preferentially select uncontaminated food. Dogs not previously exposed to DON-contaminated food consumed equal quantities of contaminated and uncontaminated food. There was no effect of 6 mg of DON/kg on dog food digestibility. Food intake of dogs was significantly reduced by DON concentrations greater than 4.5 +/- 1.7 mg/kg, and DON greater than 7.7 +/- 1.1 mg/kg reduced cat food intake. Vomiting by dogs and cats was commonly observed at the 8 and 10 mg DON levels.
