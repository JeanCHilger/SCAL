Technetium Tc 99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging: current role for evaluation of prognosis. Like 201Tl imaging, technetium Tc 99m sestamibi (MIBI) myocardial imaging can be used with exercise and pharmacologic testing to assess the presence of coronary artery disease. An increasing body of literature indicates that MIBI can also be used to assess risk of future cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or death. This article summarizes the current status of MIBI imaging for evaluating prognosis in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.
