Dynamic changes in glucose metabolism induced by thiamine deficiency and its replenishment as revealed by a positron autoradiography technique using rat living brain slices. Dynamic changes in the cerebral glucose metabolic rate (CMRglc) before and after thiamine replenishment were investigated in living brain slices obtained from pyrithiamine-treated (PT) and pair-fed control rats by use of a positron autoradiography technique. Fresh rat brain slices (300 microm thick) were incubated with [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) in oxygenated Krebs-Ringer solution at 36 degrees C, during which serial two-dimensional images of [18F]FDG uptake in the slices were constructed on the imaging plates. The net influx constant (=K) of [18F]FDG was determined by a Patlak graphical method of the image data. Prior to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-loading, the K value in the neurologically symptomatic PT was higher in all brain regions except the thalamus and mammillary body than the control, suggesting compensatory enhanced glycolysis. The rapid decrease in this heightened net influx constant immediately after TPP-loading was surmised to be due to activation of pyruvate oxidation with lactate as the substrate, with this inhibiting the glycolysis. From > or = 150 min after TPP-loading, the K value continued to show low values in the thalamus and mammillary body, which are regarded as the responsible sites for Korsakoff syndrome, whereas in all other sites recovery to control values was observed. These findings suggest that using this technique the quantitative evaluation of serial local changes in CMRglc from thiamine deficiency to after its replenishment may be useful in elucidating the pathophysiology and prognosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy.
