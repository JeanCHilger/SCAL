Assessment of regional blood flow in patients after mild head trauma. Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) using radioisotope markers was applied for analysis of regional blood flow in the brain. The method makes possible demonstration of the presence and extent of damage to the nervous tissue caused by trauma. The degree of blood flow impairment is of prognostic significance in cases of cerebral concussion. In the present study the regional brain blood flow was assessed shortly after trauma and one year in cases of mild cerebral concussion. In the studied group immediately after trauma blood flow impairment was found mostly in the left temporal area and in frontal areas. Changes of rCBI were present also late after trauma. In 7 out of 16 cases SPECT image failed to change one year after trauma. In 8 cases the rCB improved up to normalization. In 1 case the changes progressed, in another case hyperperfusion focus changed to hypoperfusion. In 2 cases the pattern was normal early and lata after trauma. In the studied group in cases with changed rCBF no changes were found in CT and MRI examinations. This evidence a greater sensitivity and usefulness of SPECT in the assessment of early and late consequences of head trauma.
