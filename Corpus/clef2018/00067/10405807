Correlation of CT-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the liver with fluoride-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the assessment of metastatic hepatic abnormalities. Imaging studies using the fluoride-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan have recently become available for patient neoplasia evaluation. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is a well-described diagnostic method for hepatic lesion evaluation. Correlation of these testing modalities in hepatic abnormalities has not been previously reported. Pathology files of Saint Louis University Hospital were retrospectively searched for patients with FNA biopsy of the liver. Thirty-one patients with a total of 32 FNA biopsies of the liver with corresponding FDG-PET scans were identified. Twenty-five patients had 25 cases of metastatic malignant neoplasia diagnosed by FNA biopsy. Of these cases, all but one had an FDG-PET scan positive for malignancy, yielding a sensitivity of 96% (24/25) for the FDG-PET scan. Combined positivity of the two testing modalities yielded a sensitivity of 100% (24/24). Seven patients did not demonstrate neoplasia by FNA biopsy, and the FDG-PET scan was negative in 6 of these 7 cases. The FDG-PET scan is an important imaging technique and, combined with FNA biopsy, can provide reliable diagnostic results and assist in the guidance of oncologic patient management.
