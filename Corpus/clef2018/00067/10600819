Development of a test to measure gastric accommodation in humans. Postprandial symptoms of bloating, distension, early satiety, and nausea are associated with impaired postprandial gastric accommodation, which is detectable by means of an intragastric, barostatically controlled balloon in the proximal stomach and by ultrasound in the distal stomach. Our aim was to develop a noninvasive method to measure the entire gastric accommodation reflex. In 10 healthy volunteers, we used single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to measure fasting and postprandial gastric volumes. This method involved intravenous injection of (99m)Tc pertechnetate and gastric reconstruction of tomographic images with Analyze software. SPECT-Analyze imaging detects the postprandial gastric accommodation reflex in vivo. Mean fasting gastric volume was 182 +/- 11 (SE) ml and mean postprandial volume was 690 +/- 32 ml (P < 0.001). Both proximal and distal segments of stomach showed a two- to almost fourfold difference in volumes postprandially. Intraobserver coefficients of variation in estimated fasting and postprandial volumes were 9 and 8% interobserver variations were 13 and 12%, respectively. SPECT-Analyze noninvasively measures postprandial gastric (total, proximal, and distal) accommodation in humans. This method appears promising to compare the accommodation response in health and disease and to perform mechanistic studies of the accommodation response.
