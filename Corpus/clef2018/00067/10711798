Increased limbic blood flow and total sleep deprivation in major depression with melancholia. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium-99m-d,l-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime (99Tcm-HMPAO) was carried out in 20 melancholic patients before and after total sleep deprivation. Findings in 11 responders to total sleep deprivation (defined by > or = 40% improvement on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) were compared with findings in nine nonresponders. On the basis of a semiquantitative evaluation of SPECT findings, responders showed relative hyperperfusion before sleep deprivation in the right anterior cingulate cortex and in the right and left fronto-orbital cortex and basal cingulate gyrus. Responders who showed > or = 50% improvement also showed hippocampal overactivation before sleep deprivation. It is possible that limbic overactivation may characterize depressed responders to total sleep deprivation as a distinct subtype. Another possibility is that the pattern of limbic hyperactivation reflects the increased number of bipolar patients in the responder group, with response to total sleep deprivation being only a covariate of this bipolar-unipolar distinction.
