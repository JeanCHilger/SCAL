Autosomal dominant temporal lobe epilepsy in a Japanese family. We described autosomal dominant familial temporal lobe epilepsy in a Japanese family in which three individuals (one man and his two children) were affected. Their seizures commonly consisted of auditory symptoms and infrequent nocturnal generalized seizures. Repeated EEGs did not provide confirmative epileptiform discharges, but cranial MRI in one patient showed mild left hippocampal atrophy, and decreased glucose metabolism in the left temporal area was demonstrated by 18F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). A confirmative diagnosis in one of the patients by FDG-PET was helpful for diagnosis in other patients in the same family. Seizure onset was adolescent commonly among the three patients, but better seizure control was achieved in the father as compared with the two children.
