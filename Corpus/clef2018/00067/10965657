Correlation of pulmonary perfusion volume analysis with pulmonary function in emphysema. Pulmonary perfusion single photon emission tomography with 99mTc MAA was performed on 13 pulmonary emphysema patients and 6 controls. We calculated perfusion volume with lower 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% of the highest counts/boxels in the lung cut-off. And perfusion index (PI) was defined as follows PI = ((A% cut-off volume) - (B% cut-off volume))/(A% cut-off volume)
