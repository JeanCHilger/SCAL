Desorption behavior of sorbed flavor compounds from packaging films with ethanol solution. Desorption behavior of sorbed flavor compounds such as ethyl esters, n-aldehydes, and n-alcohols from LDPE and PET films was investigated in 0 to 100% (v/v) ethanol solutions at 20 degrees C, 50 degrees C, and 60 degrees C. In both films, the desorption apparently increased with increasing ethanol concentration and treatment temperature, depending on the compatibility of the flavor compound with the solvent. Namely, the partition coefficient of ethyl esters, n-aldehydes, and n-alcohols in the LDPE film turned out to be approximately zero at >/=60%, >/=80%, and >/=40% (v/v) ethanol, respectively (for PET film, >/=80%, >/=80%, and >/=40% (v/v) ethanol concentrations were required for complete desorption, respectively). As for physical properties (heat of fusion, melting point, and tensile strength and elongation at break) of LDPE and PET films, there were no significant differences between intact film and the treated film with 60% (v/v) ethanol for 30 min at 60 degrees C. These results suggest that it is possible to apply a desorption solvent such as ethanol solution for desorption of sorbed flavor compounds from packaging films with no physical change in the film properties by this desorption treatment.
