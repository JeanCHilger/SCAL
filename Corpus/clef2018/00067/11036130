Is (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in recurrent colorectal cancer a contribution to surgical decision making? Accuracy of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and contribution to surgical decision making in recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer were evaluated.One hundred whole-body PET tests in colorectal cancer patients (1994 to 1998) were compared with computed tomography (CT), liver ultrasonography, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test. Mean follow-up was 12 months.Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FDG-PET for malignant findings were, respectively, 98%, 90% and 95% for 87 CT scans, 91%, 72%, and 82%FDG-PET adds relevant accuracy to the conventional staging of patients with colorectal cancer and may cost-effectively help to select the appropriate treatment.
