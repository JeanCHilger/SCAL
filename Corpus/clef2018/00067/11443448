Diagnostic laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography optimize the staging and resectability of intraabdominal neoplasms. Despite technical improvements, preoperative imaging studies often fail to predict intraoperative findings. We investigated the potential use of diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) and laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) for the assessment of disease in patients with abdominal neoplasms.Fifty consecutive patients with abdominal neoplasms underwent spiral computed tomography with oral and intravenous contrast using 5-mm contiguous sections. In addition, eight patients underwent ultrasonography, six underwent magnetic resonance imaging, and eight underwent positron emission tomography. All patients then underwent DL and LUS using a 7.5-MHz ultrasound probe.There were 29 men and 21 women with a mean age of 63 years (range, 35-84). Most had a diagnosis of colorectal cancer (19 cases), melanoma (12 cases), or hepatoma (five cases). In nine cases (18%), DL revealed peritoneal metastatic implants not shown on preoperative images. In 18 cases (36%), LUS was more accurate than preoperative imaging. Combined DL and LUS findings radically changed the operative management in 16 patients (32%).As compared with preoperative imaging, the combination of DL and LUS provides more accurate information regarding staging and resectability. Moreover, it helps to determine the extent of operation and reduces the number of unnecessary laparotomies. DL and LUS should be used as an adjunct to preoperative imaging studies in patients with primary or metastatic intraabdominal neoplasms.
