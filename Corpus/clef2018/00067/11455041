Subcortical hypoperfusion following surgery for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage: implications for cognitive performance? The incidence and severity of cognitive deficits after surgery for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage and their relationship to aneurysm site remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of regional cerebral blood flow which exists in patients one year post-surgery and to identify whether different patterns exist which may be related to the type of cognitive deficit or the location of the aneurysm. 62 patients underwent cognitive assessment and HMPAO SPECT imaging at a mean time of 12 months following surgery. Results were compared to those from healthy control subjects (n = 55 for neuropsychological testing n = 14 for SPECT imaging). In the patient group, significant stable cognitive deficits occurred in all cognitive domains but no cognitive measure differentiated aneurysm site. On SPECT images, statistical parametric mapping identified a large common area of subcortical hypoperfusion in the patient group as a whole. The findings of this study suggest a possible link between reduced subcortical function and the extent and severity of cognitive deficits.
