Influence of ligustrazine-contained peritoneal dialysate on efficiency of dialysis. To observe the influence of ligustrazine on efficiency of peritoneal dialysis.A prospective, self-controlled study was adopted, 24 stable continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients were divided into 4 groups according to their peritoneal membrane solute transport types identified by peritoneal equilibration test (PET), the high transport group (H group, 4 cases), the high-average transport group (Ha group, 11 cases), the low-average transport group (La group, 8 cases) and the low transport group (L group, 1 case). After treated with standard dialysis for 2 weeks, patients were treated by peritoneal dialysis with ligustrazine (240 mg/d) contained dialysate for another 2 weeks, and changes on mean net ultrafiltration volume (UF) per exchange, and urea kinetics (KT/V) per week of patients were observed.After ligustrazine treatment, the UF and KT/V raised significantly, P < 0.01. In comparison of groups with different transportation, except change on UF of the H group was insignificant, increment of both parameters before and after treatment were significant (P < 0.01 or 0.05).By adding ligustrazine in standard dialysate can enhance the efficiency of peritoneal dialysis, raise the UF, so is worth further study.
