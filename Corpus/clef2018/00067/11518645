In vivo evaluation of 4-[123I]iodo-N-[2[4-(6-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridinyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]benzamide, a potential SPECT radioligand for the 5-HT1A receptor. 4-[123I]Iodo-N-[2-[4-(6-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridinyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]benzamide (1.123I), a potential SPECT 5-HT(1A) radioligand, was evaluated in vivo in rats. Biodistribution studies were performed leading to a % ID in the brain of 0.22 at 5 min p.i. No significant differences in % ID/g tissue of the different isolated brain regions (hippocampus, hypothalamus, striatum, cortex and cerebellum) could be demonstrated. Blocking experiments with 8-OH-DPAT, WAY100635 and ketanserin could not show any significant change in tracer uptake in the isolated brain regions. These data suggest that uptake in the brain does not represent binding of 1.123I to the 5-HT(1A) receptor.
