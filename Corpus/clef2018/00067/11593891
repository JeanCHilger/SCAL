Treatment results in 25 patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy between 1998 and 2001. In our outpatient clinic 25 patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy were treated, 21 women, mean age 58.8 years (range 19-74 years) and 4 men, mean age 47.5 years (range 38-56 years). In the female group two showed euthyroid Graves' ophthalmopathy and one Hashimoto's disease in the male group one showed euthyroid ophthalmopathy. Treatment was done depending on the findings of the NOSPECS-classification in identical way for each group. Final results were obtained three and six months after therapy, at that time all patients were euthyroid. In five patients (two men and three women) sicca-treatment was sufficient because the ophthalmopathy improved by therapy of the thyroid disease only. Three women were treated by oral steroids over three months and had a complete remission. Nine women were treated by oral steroids and external radiation, six of them showed major improvement but in one case orbital decompression had to be done. Somatostatin therapy was done over six months in six women who showed no change after oral steroids plus radiation. Out of them five showed major improvement but in spite of a positive octreoscan in one case orbital surgery had to be performed. Two men were treated by oral steroids and external radiation without change of disease, somatostatin therapy was not done because of a negative octreoscan. With the exception of one nonsmoking woman in whom orbital surgery had to be done, the treatment results were worse in smokers.
