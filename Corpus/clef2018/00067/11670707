Neutral Guest Capture via Lewis Acid/Base Molecular Square Receptors. X-ray Crystal Structure of {Cyclobis[(cis-(dppp)Pt(4-ethynylpyridyl)(2))(cis- (PEt(3))(2)Pt)]Ag(2)}(+6)(phenazine)- ((-)OSO(2)CF(3))(6). Interaction of {cyclobis[(cis-(dppp)Pt(4-ethynylpyridyl)(2))(cis-(L)M)]Ag(2)}(+6)((-)OSO(2)CF(3))(6), where M = Pt(II) or Pd(II) and L = dppp or 2PEt(3), with pyridine, pyrazine, phenazine, or 4,4'-dipyridyl ketone results in coordination Lewis acid/base host-guest assemblies via the "pi-tweezer effect" and mono or bis neutral guest coordination. All host-guest complexes are air stable microcrystalline solids with decomposition points greater than 170 degrees C. The homometallic Pt(II) receptors are more stable than the heteroaromatic Pt(II)-Pd(II) receptors toward heteratom-containing aromatic guests. The X-ray crystal structure of the host-guest complex {cyclobis[(cis-(dppp)Pt(4-ethynylpyridyl)(2))(cis-(PEt(3))(2)Pt)]Ag(2)}(+6)(phenazine)((-)OSO(2)CF(3))(6) is reported. The crystals with the empirical formula C(62)H(68)AgF(9)N(3)O(9)P(4)Pt(2)S(3) are triclinic P&onemacr with a = 12.3919(8) Å, b = 17.160(1) Å, c = 18.932(1) Å, alpha = 90.892(1) degrees, beta = 97.127(1) degrees, gamma = 89.969(1) degrees, and Z = 2.
