Alzheimer's disease: scintigraphic appearance of Tc-99m HMPAO brain spect. To investigate the value of Tc-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (Tc-99m HMPAO) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as a diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease.Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT was performed on 140 patients and 20 controls. A final diagnosis was established for 115 patients, 58 of whom had Alzheimer's disease. The probability of AD was determined for seven scintigraphic patterns. The probability of Alzheimer's disease was 14% for patients with memory loss and normal perfusion. For patients with abnormal perfusion patterns, the probability of Alzheimer's disease was 87% with bilateral temporoparietal defects, 73% with bilateral temporoparietal defects plus additional defects, 62% with a unilateral temporoparietal defect, 33% with a frontal defect only, 0% with other large defects, and 0% with multiple small cortical defects. In 115 patients with the complaint of memory loss or cognitive abnormalities, bilateral temporoparietal hypoperfusion with or without additional hypoperfusion was more frequent than other scintigraphic patterns in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT offers the clinician the possibility of differentiating dementias on the basis of differences in perfusion patterns.
