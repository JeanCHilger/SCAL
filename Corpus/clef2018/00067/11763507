The impact of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) on planning of radiotherapy. To determine the impact of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) on patient management in radiotherapy.One hundred sixty-nine consecutive patients with different malignant tumors were analyzed. Whole-body FDG-PET was performed for staging before radiotherapy. The strategy of radiotherapy before and after PET scanning was compared and the change in the treatment management determined.In 47(28%) of 169 patients PET results changed patient management in radiotherapy. In 19 patients (11%) radiotherapy was not performed after PET. In 16 patients (10%) PET results changed the intention of radiation treatment (curative/palliative). Correction of radiation dose was made in 16 patients (10%). Correction of the volume of the exposure area was made in 12 patients (7%). Tumor outside the field of view was missed in only 2 patients with a regional PET scan.In this retrospective analysis the information provided by FDG-PET contributes to a substantial change in radiotherapy strategy.
