Pathophysiology of infantile spasms. Infantile spasms--seen in West's Syndrome--are often associated with cortical abnormalities. The spasms themselves, however, appear to be generated subcortically. Dr. Chugani reviews the clinical data related to the pathophysiology of infantile spasms and proposes a hypothesis which involves both cortical and subcortical mechanisms.
