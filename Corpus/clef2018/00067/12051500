Characteristics of free-roaming cats and their caretakers. To describe the characteristics of unowned, free-roaming cats and their caretakers who participated in a trap-neuter-return (TNR) program and to determine the effect of the program on free-roaming cat colonies.Prospective study.101 caretakers of 920 unowned, free-roaming cats in 132 colonies in north central Florida.Most (85/101 84%) caretakers were female. The median age was 45 years (range, 19 to 74 years). Most (89/101The decrease in the surveyed free-roaming cat population was attributed to a reduction in births of new kittens, adoptions, deaths, and disappearances. Recognition of the human-animal bond that exists between caretakers and the feral cats they feed may facilitate the development of effective control programs for feral cat populations.
