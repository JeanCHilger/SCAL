F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in evaluation of tumors of the ENT area: personal results and review of the literature. The incidence of head and neck cancer is increasing world-wide. In addition to clinical investigation including palpation and endoscopy with biopsy, conventional morphological imaging methods, i.e. ultrasonography, radiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have a routine role in the diagnosis of malignant head and neck cancer. However, the primary tumour often cannot be found despite extensive examination of the head and neck by means of diverse techniques. Furthermore, for staging purposes as well as for the detection of tumour recurrence after chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, morphological examination techniques such as CT and MRI are of limited accuracy.
