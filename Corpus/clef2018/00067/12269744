Role of inorganic chlorides in formation of PCDDs, PCDFs, and coplanar PCBs from combustion of plastics, newspaper, and pulp in an incinerator. The total amounts of dioxins found in exhaust gases from combustion of polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) with approximately 3% (w/ w) NaCl were 6.07, 17.7, and 28.9 ng/g, respectively. Plastics containing benzene rings produced more dioxins than plastic containing no benzene ring. The amounts of dioxin formed in the exhaust gases from the combustion of newspapers impregnated with CaCl2, KCl, and NaCl were 18.6, 28.6, and 49.0 ng/g, respectively. Dioxin formation was associated with the bond energy between metal atom and chlorine atom. When newspapers impregnated with four different amounts of NaCl were combusted, the highest NaCl content newspaper (chlorine content 4.08%, w/w lignin content 19.8%, w/w) produced the greatest amount of dioxins (174 ng/g). Pulp with NaCl (chlorine content 4.25%, w/w
