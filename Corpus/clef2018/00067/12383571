Plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine and hyperemic myocardial blood flow in young subjects with borderline hypertension or familial hypercholesterolemia. The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) level and hyperemic myocardial blood flow (MBF) in subjects with borderline hypertension (BHT) and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).Asymmetric dimethylarginine is an endogenous competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase that may modulate vascular function. We measured plasma ADMA levels and myocardial flow in 77 young men (mean age 35 +/- 5 years), including 47 healthy controls, 16 men with BHT, and 14 men with FH. Basal and dipyridamole-induced myocardial flow was measured using positron emission tomography. Plasma ADMA levels were measured using high-pressure liquid chromatography.Asymmetric dimethylarginine levels were significantly elevated in the BHT group compared with controls (0.59 +/- 0.13 micromol/l vs. 0.43 +/- 0.12 micromol/l, p < 0.001), and they had significantly lower dipyridamole flow (2.85 +/- 1.20 ml/min/g vs. 3.69 +/- 1.68 ml/min/g, p < 0.05). In a multivariate regression model adjusted for the study group, dipyridamole flow was inversely associated with ADMA (p < 0.05), age (p < 0.05), and apolipoprotein B concentration (p < 0.05).We conclude that plasma ADMA concentration is related to dipyridamole-induced vasodilatory function in young men, independently of blood pressure elevation and hypercholesterolemia. Subjects with BHT have significantly increased plasma ADMA levels, which may partly explain the impaired hyperemic MBF in this condition.
