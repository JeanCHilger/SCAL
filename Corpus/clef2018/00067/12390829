Study on the cloning, expression and the immunogenicity of helicobacter pylori heat shock protein 60 gene. To construct a recombinant strain of bacteria expressing heat shock protein of (Hsp) Helicobacter pylori (Hp) and study the immunogenicity of Hsp60.PCR amplification of Hsp60 DNA was performed before it was inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-22b(+) to transform BL21(DE3) E.coli strain. Hsp60 expressed by the recombinant E.coli was collected and purified for immunogenicity assessment in mice.DNA sequence analysis showed identical DNA sequence of Hsp60 thus produced to that published in Genbank. Accounting for a ratio of 27.2% among the total protein production in the bacterium, recombinant Hsp60 protein was recognized by the serum from Hp-infected patients and produced corresponding antibody in Balb/c mice in response to immunization.Recombinant Hsp60 protein can be used potentially as a vaccine for controlling and treating Hp infection.
