Effect of biventricular pacing on metabolism and perfusion in patients affected by dilated cardiomyopathy and left bundle branch block: evaluation by positron emission tomography. Evaluate the possible changes in myocardial metabolism and perfusion induced by biventricular pacing (BIVP) in patients affected by dilated cardiomyopathy (DC) and left bundle branch block (LBBB).Eight male patients (aged 60-79 years, mean 69) affected by DC (NYHA functional class III and ejection fraction <40%) were submitted to cardiac PET in basal condition and 3 weeks after the implantation of a biventricular device. Metabolism was evaluated using F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), by the glucose load-insulin technique, and perfusion by N13-ammonia (NH3), injected at rest. Visual and a semi quantitative analyses were performed, calculating by ROIs the septum to lateral uptake ratio (SLR). The myocardial blood flow (MBF) was also calculated in ml/min/g using a dynamic acquisition and a modified Patlak method. In all 8 patients a selective defect in FDG uptake in the septum was present in basal condition (mean SLR 0.59+/-0.17) with a 'reverse mismatch' effect with respect to NH3 (mean SLR 1.07+/-0.18). During BIVP the distribution of FDG in the septal area significatively improved (mean SLR 0.86+/-0.15 P=0.011 with respect to basal) on the contrary, no significant changes were found in NH3 uptake (mean SLR 1.02+/-0.23, P=ns). On quantitative analysis the mean MBF in the septum was 1.05+/-0.37 in basal condition and did not significantly change during BIVP (0.95+/-0.34, P=0.06).Our results suggest that, in patients affected by DC and LBBB, BIVP improves the septal glucose metabolism without significant changes in myocardial perfusion.
