Regional left ventricular wall thickening. Relation to regional uptake of 18fluorodeoxyglucose and 201Tl in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. In previous studies comparing regional 201Tl (201Tl) and 18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) activity in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, we hypothesized that regions with mild-to-moderate reduction in FDG activity and regions with mild-to-moderate irreversible 201Tl defects after 3- to 4-hour redistribution represent viable myocardium. In the present study, regional FDG and 201Tl activities were compared with regional systolic wall thickening by gated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to confirm the presence of viable myocardium in these territories.Twenty-five patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction, 28 +/- 10) underwent exercise 201Tl tomographic imaging (SPECT), using a reinjection protocol, positron emission tomography (PET) with FDG and H2(15)O, and gated MRI. Matched SPECT, PET, and MRI tomograms were analyzed. From the PET data, 105 regions had matched reduction in FDG and blood flow, of which 69 regions had moderately reduced FDG uptake (50-79% uptake relative to a normal reference region) and 36 had severely reduced FDG uptake (less than 50% of normal activity). Regions with moderately reduced as compared with severely reduced FDG activity had greater end-diastolic wall thickness (9.4 +/- 2.6 versus 8.0 +/- 3.7 mm p less than 0.05) and regional systolic wall thickening (1.7 +/- 2.7 versus -0.7 +/- 2.1 mmTherefore, preserved wall thickness and systolic wall thickening in regions with moderate reduction in blood flow and FDG activity, and in irreversible 201Tl defects that are only mild-to-moderate, provide additional evidence that such regions represent viable myocardium. Moreover, the finding of metabolic activity and 201Tl uptake in regions with reduced blood flow and absent wall thickening provides clinical evidence of hibernating myocardium in humans.
