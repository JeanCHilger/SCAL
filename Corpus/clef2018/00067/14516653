Changes in FDG Tumor Uptake during and after Fractionated Radiation Therapy in a Rodent Tumor Xenograft. OBJECTIVE: The uptake of FDG was measured before, during, and after fractionated radiation in order to evaluate the potential of FDG-PET imaging as an indicator of tumor response.METHODS: The study was performed with nude rats bearing the human neuroblastoma BE(2)C tumor xenografts. Tumors were irradiated with 10 fractions of 2 Gy using a 320 kV(p) X-ray unit. Following a baseline FDG-PET scan, repeat scans were performed weekly until animal sacrifice. The rodents were given up to 10 FDG-PET scans, over a period of up to 75 days posttreatment.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Neither, the average and maximum activity/cc of FDG tumor uptake, nor the respective standardized uptake values (SUV), correlated with tumor response. Instead, the total FDG uptake (defined as the product of the average FDG activity/cc with the tumor volume) correlated better with tumor response.
