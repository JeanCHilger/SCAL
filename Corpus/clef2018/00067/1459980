Current and future applications of SPECT in clinical psychiatry. Over the past 10 years several studies have been conducted in psychiatric and neurologic patients with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to determine if patterns of brain dysfunction exist that characterize the different mental diseases. Although there has not been any finding that can be referred to as specific for a particular disease, SPECT studies have been able to demonstrate evidence of brain dysfunction in patients who, when tested with other means, showed no evidence of brain abnormalities. In this manuscript, the current and future applications of SPECT in the clinical practice of psychiatry are analyzed.
