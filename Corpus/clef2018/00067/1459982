An introduction and overview to clinical applications of neuroSPECT in psychiatry. This brief paper introduces the reader to the materials presented in other manuscripts of this issue of The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a dynamic brain imaging technique that grew out of the evolution of increasingly more sophisticated approaches to understanding the pathophysiology and biology of neurologic and psychiatric disorders over the past two decades. SPECT is a practical tool that is more available than positron emission tomography (PET), which is found primarily at academic centers. While SPECT has drawbacks that relate to levels of resolution and the possible impact of altered brain physiology on interpretation of results, it offers advantages of decreased cost, the need for less intensively trained technicians, and the ability to carry out clinical testing in facilities lacking a cyclotron. These factors raise the hope of more routine use of this imaging technique in clinical settings related to cognitive disorders, schizophrenia, affective disorders, and problems associated with substance use.
