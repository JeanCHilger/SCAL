Cytoplasmic expression of the Achromobacter xylosoxidans blue copper nitrite reductase in Escherichia coli and characterisation of the recombinant protein. The gene of the Achromobacter xylosoxidans (DSM 2402) blue copper-containing nitrite reductase was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. DNA sequence analysis reveals that the amino acid sequence is identical to those of the GIFU1051 and the NCIMB11015 A. xylosoxidans nitrite reductases. The gene encoding the mature coding region for DSM 2402 nitrite reductase was cloned into a pET-vector, overexpressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and the expressed holoprotein was purified to apparent homogeneity by cation-exchange chromatography. The recombinant blue copper-containing nitrite reductase was obtained in high yields of 70mgL(-1) of culture. The specific catalytic activity as well as the electronic absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra agree with corresponding data for the native protein. Mass spectroscopic analysis of the recombinant nitrite reductase gave a molecular weight of 36659.1Da for the apo-protein monomer, in agreement with the expected molecular mass based on the amino acid sequence.
