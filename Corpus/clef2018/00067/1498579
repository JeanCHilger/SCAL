Cerebral metabolic dysfunction in AIDS: findings in a sample with and without dementia. Positron-emission tomography was coupled with neurological and neuropsychological evaluation to study regional cerebral activity and neurologic status in two groups. Seventeen patients with full-blown AIDS and 14 seronegative control subjects were studied using [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose in a resting state. The AIDS group had relative regional hypermetabolism in the basal ganglia and thalamus stepwise multiple-regression analyses revealed a significant relationship for the AIDS group between temporal lobe metabolism and severity of dementia on the AIDS Dementia Complex Rating Scale. These results suggest that the basal ganglia, thalamus, and temporal lobes are differentially affected in AIDS.
