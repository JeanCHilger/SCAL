Detection and grading of soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities with (18)F-3'-fluoro-3'-deoxy-L-thymidine. The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of (18)F-3'-fluoro-3'-deoxy-L-thymidine positron emission tomography (FLT-PET) for the detection and grading of soft tissue sarcoma (STS).Nineteen patients with 20 STSs of the extremities were scanned, using attenuation corrected whole-body FLT-PET. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) and tumor:nontumor ratios (TNTs) were compared with histopathological parameters using French and Japanese grading systems.Mean SUV, maximal SUV, and TNT could differentiate between low-grade (grade 1 n = 6) STS and high-grade (grade 2 and 3FLT-PET is able to visualize STS and differentiate between low-grade and high-grade STS. The uptake of FLT correlates with the proliferation of STS.
