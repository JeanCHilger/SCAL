Recent advances in imaging hepatocellular carcinoma: diagnosis, staging and response assessment: functional imaging. Historically, nuclear medicine has had an important role in the differential diagnosis of liver tumors but has been largely superseded by other forms of conventional imaging, in particular computed tomographic portography. It remains helpful in difficult cases because it has characteristic features in both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and benign conditions. 131I is an important therapeutic tool. FDG-PET is useful in certain cases, especially for finding metastases and monitoring response to therapy.
