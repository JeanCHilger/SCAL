The coronary microcirculation in health and disease. Apart from being the site of nutrient and gas exchange for the myocardium, the capillary bed is a dynamic participant in the regulation of coronary and myocardial blood flow. MBV also responds to changes in myocardial oxygen demand. Because MCE can be used to assess MBF and MBV in vivo, it can be used to provide unique insights into tissue perfusion.
