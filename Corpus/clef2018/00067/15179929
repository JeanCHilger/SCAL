Transfusion medicine in exotic pets. The decision to transfuse a patient should always be based on the packed cell volume and clinical status of the patient. This article discusses indications for transfusion and blood substitutes in exotic animal patients. The administration of blood products requires careful donor selection, knowledge of blood groups, cross-matching, and use of anticoagulants. Collection sites, volume, and administration techniques are given for different species of animals including birds, rabbits, and ferrets. Blood-transfusion therapy is not without risk. The frequency with which transfusion reactions occur in exotic pets is unknown. The most common transfusion reactions seen in small animals, along with suggested treatment, are discussed. The availability of blood products is limited in exotic pet medicine therefore, the use of blood substitutes (Oxyglobin) has the advantage of long storage potential, no need for cross-matching, and no potential for disease transmission. General principles of blood substitutes and administration techniques will be discussed.
