Serum nitrate levels as an index of endothelial function in pre-eclamsia and normal pregnancy. The study was conducted in St. John's Medical College Hospital and Department of Physiology, with the aim of studying the serum nitrate levels in pre-eclampsia and normal pregnancy. The total number of subjects studied in various groups were 159, control (n = 55), first trimester (n = 13), second trimester normal (n = 42), second trimester pre-eclampsia/PET (n = 5), third trimester normal (n = 32), third trimester pre-eclampsia/PET (n = 12). The serum nitrate was measured by one step enzymatic assay using Nitrate reductase from Aspergillus species. The nitrate levels in the third trimester pre-eclamptic group was found to be significant lower (P = 0.02), as compared to normal subjects, however the renal functions were normal in all the subjects.
