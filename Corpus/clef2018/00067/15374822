Gene therapy for chronic myocardial ischemia using platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor in dogs. Platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), also known as thymidine phosphorylase (TP), has been reported to possess angiogenic activity and to inhibit apoptosis. This study was performed to determine whether PD-ECGF/TP can be used to ameliorate chronic myocardial ischemia. Myocardial ischemia was created in 40 mongrel dogs by placement of an ameroid constrictor on the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Plasmid vector encoding human PD-ECGF/TP cDNA (pCIhTP group n = 12), empty vector pCI (pCI group
