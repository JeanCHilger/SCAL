Combined radiofrequency and alcohol injection for percutaneous hepatic tumor ablation. We sought to determine if alcohol potentiates radiofrequency energy by obtaining larger ablative volumes in 30 liver tumors in human patients.We compared two groups of patients: one group treated with radiofrequency ablation alone (radiofrequency-alone group), and a second group treated with radiofrequency ablation and immediate prior injection of alcohol (combined group). The radiofrequency-alone group comprised 20 ablations (mean diameter, 8.4 cm colorectal cancer metastases [n = 15]The mean ablation volumes for the radiofrequency-alone group were 32.3 cm(2) (median, 28.6 cm(2) range, 14.4-61.8 cm(2)) and for the combined group, 84.6 cm(2) (median, 78.3 cm(2)Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation appears to be potentiated by immediate prior alcohol injection into the tumor. Consistently larger lesions are obtainable in fewer sessions, without any increase of complications, using the combined method.
