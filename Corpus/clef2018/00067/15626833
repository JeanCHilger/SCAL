Clinical utility of 11C-flumazenil positron emission tomography in intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. 11C-flumazenil (FMZ) positron emission tomography (PET) is a new entrant into the armamentarium for pre-surgical evaluation of patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).To analyze the clinical utility of FMZ PET to detect lesional and remote cortical areas of abnormal benzodiazepine receptor binding in relation to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 2-Deoxy-2 [18F] fluoro-D-glucose, (18F FDG) PET, electrophysiological findings and semiology of epilepsy in patients with intractable TLE.Patients underwent a high resolution MRI, prolonged Video-EEG monitoring before 18F FDG and 11C FMZ PET studies. Regional cortical FMZ PET abnormalities were defined on co-registered PET images using an objective method based on definition of areas of abnormal asymmetry (asymmetry index {AI}>10%).Prospective.Student's "t" test.Twenty patients (Mean age: 35.2 years [20-51] M:F=12:8) completed the study. Mean age at seizure onset was 10.3 years (birth-38 years)FMZ-binding asymmetry is a sensitive method to detect regions of epileptic foci in patients with intractable TLE.
