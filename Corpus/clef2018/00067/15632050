Effect of perfusion pattern and imaging sequence on gated perfusion SPECT evaluation of myocardial stunning. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of perfusion defect and imaging sequence on the evaluation of myocardial stunning with gated perfusion SPECT.A dynamic mathematic cardiac torso phantom was used to create 100 gated SPECT simulations (50 stress-rest and 50 rest-stress sequences) with a wide range of perfusion defects. No segmental wall motion abnormalities were created. After generating projection images, 2 additional acquisitions were simulated by thresholding the projected data to 25% and 75% of the maximum. Finally, gated SPECT projections were grouped by 2s to generate 2 series of phantoms corresponding to stress-rest and rest-stress imaging sequences. For each sequence, the first dataset was the 25% thresholded gated SPECT. Both 75% thresholded and 100% signal intensity were used as a second dataset. Each simulated gated SPECT image differed from others in the extent of myocardial scar or ischemia, but all had the same end-diastolic volume (EDV) (125 mL), end-systolic volume (ESV) (48 mL), and ejection fraction (EF) (62%). Left ventricular perfusion and function were each assessed using validated software.Mean stress EDV was decreased when compared with rest-simulated data (111 +/- 4.7 and 112.4 +/- 4.8 mL, respectively P < or = 0.05), and mean stress ESV was increased when compared with rest-simulated data (44 +/- 4.2 and 42.7 +/- 4 mL, respectivelyPerfusion defects and imaging sequence had significant effects on the evaluation of myocardial stunning using gated perfusion SPECT.
