MIBG and somatostatin receptor analogs in children: current concepts on diagnostic and therapeutic use. Nuclear imaging techniques such as bone scans, metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scans, and (111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-octreotide scans have greatly increased the sensitivity and specificity of both diagnostic and follow-up protocols for pediatric solid tumors. Molecular targets that are specific for certain pediatric tumors are now being developed. Targets include cell membrane receptors targeted by specific ligands, subcellular organelles targeted by false transmitters, and cellular proteins targeted by antibodies. This review focuses on the use of MIBG (which is a false transmitter) and octreotide (which is a ligand for G protein receptor) in the diagnosis and treatment of solid tumors that affect children and young adults.
