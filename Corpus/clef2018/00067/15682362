Can the reversible regional wall motion abnormalities on stress gated Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT predict a future cardiac event? Myocardial stunning has recently been demonstrated by use of stress gated technetium 99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. However, its prognostic value is less well determined. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of reversible regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs).We studied 303 consecutive subjects with known or suspected coronary artery disease who underwent 2-day stress-rest gated Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT and were followed up for 19 +/- 16 months. Clinical and test-derived variables were evaluated to predict cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina, and early or late coronary revascularization. Reversible RWMAs were identified in 102 patients. On Cox analysis, the presence, site, degree, and extent of reversible RWMAs did not identify an adverse outcome, except in patients without prior MI. After adjustment for prescan data, the strongest predictors of hard events and all cardiac events were poststress RWMAs and the amount of ischemia. The addition of poststress RWMAs to the combined model of prescan and perfusion data yielded incremental prognostic value.Poststress RWMAs and ischemia by perfusion were the most powerful predictive parameters of cardiac events. However, myocardial stunning should always be considered, particularly in patients without prior MI and in the referral of patients for early revascularization.
