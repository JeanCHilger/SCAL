Regional perfusion, oxygen metabolism, blood volume and immunoglobulin G accumulation at focal sites of infection in rabbits. Infection causes remarkable changes in extracellular fluid volume, blood flow and oxygen consumption in the region of the lesion. To determine the sequence and magnitude of these changes, we performed serial scintigraphic measurements in 10 rabbits with experimental Escherichia coli abscesses. Positron emission tomography with C15O2, 15O2 and 11CO was used to measure regional blood flow, oxygen extraction (OEF) and blood volume extracellular fluid volume was evaluated by single photon scintigraphy with indium-111 immunoglobulin G (IgG). Images were recorded following tracer administration at 1 and 7-10 days after infection. At the first imaging time, blood flow to infected muscle had increased by 40% compared with control sites (7.4 +/- 0.6 to 10.8 +/- 3.8 ml/min.100 g), OEF had decreased from 55% +/- 34% to 45% +/- 14%, and the infected-to-contralateral (I/C) ratio of IgG had increased to 3.34 +/- 1.85. At the later imaging time, flow had increased by almost threefold compared with day 1 (29.4 +/- 9.8 ml/min.100 g), OEF had decreased to 29% +/- 14%, and the I/C ratio for IgG had remained constant. Although OEF fell, oxygen delivery (OEF x flow) increased from 4.07 ml/min (control value) to 4.86 ml/min on day 1 and 8.64 ml/min on days 7-9. The infected-to-contralateral (IC) ratio of 15O2/C15O2 was 0.74 +/- 0.15 on day 1 and 0.77 +/- 0.10 at 7-9 days. These studies indicate that expansion of the extracellular fluid volume increases early in the evolution of the infection and exceeds changes in regional perfusion and oxygen delivery.
