Evaluation of I-123-BMIPP myocardial SPECT on the detection of ischemic heart disease by comparing with stress thallium-201 myocardial SPECT. To evaluate the usefulness of I-123-BMIPP as a tracer of fatty acid metabolism in ischemic heart disease, we performed both rest BMIPP myocardial SPECT and stress thallium-201 (Tl) SPECT in 15 patients with prior myocardial infarction, and compared the segmental findings each other. The abnormality of BMIPP images was more intense than that of Tl redistribution images (Tl-RD) in more than 60% of the abnormal segments. The degree of myocardial uptake of BMIPP was more concordant with that of Tl stress scan (Tl-EX) than with that of Tl-RD. This agreement of the findings between BMIPP and Tl-EX was found more remarkably in the regions of incomplete Tl redistribution or in the collateralized regions. These results revealed that ischemia in the jeopardized regions was able to be detected even by rest BMIPP scan. Abnormal findings in BMIPP were observed in more than 95% of segments with persistent defects or incomplete redistribution in Tl, but observed in only 41 or 45% of segments with complete redistribution. Normal findings in BMIPP were observed in 94% of normal segments in Tl. From these results, we can speculate that abnormal regions in BMIPP may have necrotic or ischemic myocardial tissue and normal regions in BMIPP may not have necrotic tissue. These results suggest that I-123-BMIPP may be available to detect myocardial ischemia or infarction in the clinical study. Additionally, the difference in findings between the early images and the delayed images in rest BMIPP scan was observed with relatively high incidence (14% of regions and 73% of patients). More detailed analysis will be required to reveal the importance of this difference.
