Fusion image of positron emission tomography and computed tomography for the diagnosis of local recurrence of rectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and therapeutic value of digital fusion image (FI) of positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)F-fluorodeoxy glucose and computed tomography (CT) in patients who were suspected of having a local recurrence of rectal cancer.Forty-two patients (32 men and 10 women mean age, 61.4 years, range, 40-79 years) with a suspicion of local recurrence after curative resection of rectal cancer were prospectively recruited and underwent (18)F-fluorodeoxy glucose-PET and CT. The FI was reconstructed with a commercially available digital software program, T-B Fusion. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare FI with CT alone or PET alone.FI yielded a correct diagnosis in 39 (93%) of 42 patients, whereas CT alone and PET alone did so in 33 (79%) and 37 (88%) patients, respectively. FI had better diagnostic accuracy than CT alone (P = .0138) and PET alone (P = .0156). Overall, FI altered patient management in 11 (26.2%) patients on the basis of additional information, including differentiation of the tumor from the postoperative scar in 6 patients, exact anatomical location in 3 patients, and both in 2 patients.FI has a potential clinical value in the treatment of suspected local recurrence of rectal cancer.
