Electrokinetic control of fluid in plastified laser-printed poly(ethylene terephthalate)-toner microchips. The application of plastified laser-printed poly(ethylene terephthalate)(PET)-toner microchips to capillary electrophoresis was investigated. Electroosmotic flow was observed in the direction of the cathode for the buffer system studied (phosphate, pH 3-10). Average electroosmotic mobilities of 1.71 x 10(-4) to 4.35 x 10(-4) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) were observed from pH 3 to 10. This variation suggests that silica fillers in the toner and on the surface of the polymer dominate the zeta potential of the material, which is also confirmed by XPS measurements. Dopamine and catechol were used as model analytes for microchip electrophoresis in combination with electrochemical detection. Results show that these two analytes can be efficiently separated and detected electrochemically with the plastified laser-printed PET-toner microchips.
