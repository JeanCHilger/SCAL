Brain abnormalities underlying altered activation in dyslexia: a voxel based morphometry study. Voxel-based morphometry was used to assess the consistency among functional imaging and brain morphometry data in developmental dyslexia. Subjects, from three different cultural contexts (UK, France and Italy), were the same as those described in a previous PET activation paper, which revealed a common pattern of reduced activation during reading tasks in the left temporal and occipital lobes. We provide evidence that altered activation observed within the reading system is associated with altered density of grey and white matter of specific brain regions, such as the left middle and inferior temporal gyri and the left arcuate fasciculus. This supports the view that dyslexia is associated with both local grey matter dysfunction and with altered connectivity among phonological/reading areas. The differences were replicable across samples confirming that the neurological disorder underlying dyslexia is the same across the cultures investigated in the study.
