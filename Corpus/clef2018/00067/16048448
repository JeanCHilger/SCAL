Clinical application of single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of depression. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been recently suggested for the treatment of patients with major depression. Based on the results of the authors' pilot study showing a possible antidepressive effect of single-pulse TMS, a clinical trial was conducted involving patients with major depression. For the present study single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was recorded for six of the target patients to study the effects of TMS on the local blood flow volume. Twenty-three inpatients meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edn DSM-IV) criteria for major depression were invited to participate in the study. Depressive symptoms were rated using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Patients were given 10 stimuli over the frontal area of both sides for a total of 20 stimuli in a session. The subjects had daily TMS session for 5 days as an add-on therapy. In addition, six patients had their quantitative (99m)Tc-ethyl cysteinate dimer SPECT images measured before and after TMS treatment. Compared with the value 2 days prior to the start of TMS therapy (24.2 +/- 4.9), the average HAM-D scale dropped significantly to 15.3 +/- 6.6 on the day after completion of such therapy. The results of SPECT showed that the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the bilateral frontal region had increased in four out of six patients when comparing before and after treatment. The present study shows that single-pulse TMS, which is widely used as a neurological test method, possesses a wide range of antidepressive effects without inducing adverse reactions. The results suggest that although repetitive TMS is steadily becoming the mainstay technique today, single-pulse TMS also possesses sufficient antidepressive effects.
