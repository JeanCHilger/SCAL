What do neurologists think about their role in neuroimaging training and practice? In 1996, a survey of the members of the American Academy of Neurology revealed the following facts and opinions: (1) On an average month, each respondent ordered 15 computed tomography, 22 magnetic resonance imaging, 13 ultrasound and 1 single-photon emission computerized tomography studies. (2) Most respondents did not read their own studies for reimbursement, but relied on their own reading for patient management. (3) Respondents felt that neurologists are appropriate specialists to read imaging studies however, they favored certification for neurologists credentialed in neuroimaging. (4) Organized neurology should provide certification in neuroimaging for neurologists with appropriate training and defend their right and their need to practice neuroimaging, including endovascular procedures.
