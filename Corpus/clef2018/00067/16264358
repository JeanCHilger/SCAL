FDG PET imaging in the evaluation of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder following renal transplantation. To assess the usefulness of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) in the evaluation of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) following renal transplantation.Staging FDG PET examinations were reviewed in five patients with biopsy proven post-renal allograft PTLD and compared with conventional imaging. Follow-up PET examinations of three patients at various points during their therapy for PTLD were also reviewed and compared with clinical outcome.PET imaging identified all disease sites seen at cross-sectional imaging, clarified sites of uncertain significance and detected additional disease in two out of five patients. Early follow-up imaging impacted PTLD management in two of three patients.In this limited series FDG PET was an effective imaging modality in the staging and follow-up of PTLD.
