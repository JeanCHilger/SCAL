Sporadic infections of Salmonella Paratyphi B, var. Java associated with fish tanks. Identify a source of contamination to explain the increase in the number of cases of S. Paratyphi B var. Java infection.A descriptive study was conducted to gather more information about cases and potential risk factors for infection. Between January 2000 and June 2003, we identified and interviewed by questionnaire 53 people with S. Paratyphi B infection. Due to the suspected link with fish tanks, an environmental investigation was conducted for each case at patients' homes as well as at pet stores and wholesalers. Various samples were taken from fish tanks. The fish were purchased at different pet shops. The pulsed field gel electrophoresis method was used to compare the human and aquarium strains.Of those infected, 60% had bought or had contact with an aquarium or tropical fishes before becoming ill. More than 50% of the samples taken from fish tanks in homes, pet shops, and wholesaler operations contained a number of serotypes of Salmonella in addition to Salmonella Paratyphi B var. Java. There were similarities between the PFGE patterns of human strains and aquarium samples.Contact with fish tanks could be a risk factor for developing a Salmonella infection and the public may be unaware of this risk. It was recommended that information be produced and distributed to pet shops and their customers to inform them of safety precautions in order to reduce the risk of contamination from bacterial pathogens that may be present in aquarium water.
