Diagnosis and treatment of infections associated with fracture-fixation devices. The pathogenesis of infections associated with fracture-fixation devices is related to microorganisms growing in biofilms, which render these infections difficult to treat. These infections are classified as early (<2 weeks), delayed (2-10 weeks) or late infections (>10 weeks) according to the implant surgery. Most infections are caused by staphylococci and are acquired during trauma (in penetrating injuries) or subsequent fracture-fixation procedures. A combination of clinical, laboratory, histopathology, microbiology, and imaging studies are usually needed to accurately diagnose infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans are often used to diagnose infection and plan surgical treatment. Positron emission tomography (PET) and PET-CT are promising new tools for diagnosing implant-associated osteomyelitis. The treatment goal is achieving bone consolidation and avoiding development of chronic osteomyelitis. Successful treatment requires adequate surgical procedures combined with 6-12 weeks of antimicrobial therapy acting on adhering stationary-phase microorganisms. In chronic osteomyelitis, orthopedic and plastic- reconstructive surgery is combined in the same procedure or within a short time span. In this article, pathogenesis, classification, diagnosis, and treatment of infections associated with intramedullary nails, external-fixation pins, plates, and screws are reviewed.
