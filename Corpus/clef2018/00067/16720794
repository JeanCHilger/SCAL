Donepezil effects on cerebral blood flow in older adults with mild cognitive deficits. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was assessed during a verbal recall task using [(15)O]water positron emission tomography (PET) in older adults with mild cognitive deficits participating in a placebo-controlled donepezil trial. The placebo group demonstrated reduced CBF in the left frontal and temporal regions over the 6-month period, while those receiving donepezil did not. The placebo group's performance did not change on a list-learning task, while the donepezil group's performance improved, despite having had lower performance at intake. These findings suggest that donepezil treatment may be associated with a relative maintenance of CBF and improved list-learning.
