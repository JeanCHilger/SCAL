Imaging markers of mild cognitive impairment: multivariate analysis of CBF SPECT. This study aimed to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal changes of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in preclinical dementia using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). SPECT and cognitive function were investigated in 39 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects and 20 age-matched controls. All subjects were followed longitudinally 19 months on average, 16 MCI subjects progressed to Alzheimer's disease (AD), who were retrospectively defined as progressive mild cognitive impairment (PMCI) at baseline and 23 MCI subjects remained stable and were defined as stable mild cognitive impairment (SMCI) at baseline. SPECT was performed both at the initial investigation and at follow-up. Image data were analyzed using multivariate analysis, SPM and volume of interest (VOI)-based analysis. Significant covariate patterns were derived, which differentiate among PMCI, SMCI and controls at baseline as well as describe the longitudinal progression of PMCI. The combined SPECT and neuropsychology increased the diagnostic accuracy of PMCI at baseline. SPECT and neuropsychological testing can be used objectively for both baseline diagnosis and to monitor changes in brain function during very early AD.
