Construction of antibacterial multilayer films containing nanosilver via layer-by-layer assembly of heparin and chitosan-silver ions complex. Antibacterial multilayer films containing nanosilver were prepared via layer-by-layer fashion. PET film was aminolyzed with 1,6-hexanediamine to introduce amino groups on PET film surface chitosan-silver nitrate complex and heparin were alternately deposited onto an aminolyzed PET film surface, and subsequently, the silver ions within the multilayer films were reduced with ascorbic acid to form silver nanoparticles. UV-visible spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the formation of well-dispersed nanosilver particles with sizes (10-40 nm) that depended on the initial concentration of silver ions in chitosan solution and the pH of ascorbic acid solution. The chitosan/heparin multilayer films were possessed of bactericidal effect on Escherichia coli (E. coli), and this antibacterial effect could be significantly enhanced by the incorporation of silver nanoparticles into the multilayer films. The multilayer films containing nanosilver were not only effective as antibacterial but also as anticoagulant coating. And cell toxicity evaluation suggested that the multilayer films containing nanosilver did not show any cytotoxicity. The multilayer films containing nanosilver may have good potentials for surface modification of medical devices, especially for cardiovascular implants.
