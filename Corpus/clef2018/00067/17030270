Evolving role of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the management of esophageal carcinoma. Positron emission tomography (PTE) and PET/CT imaging with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose are metabolic imaging modalities that depict tissues based on their level of glucose uptake. PET provides useful information in the primary staging of disease. PET performance in detecting locoregional nodal metastases is limited however, it is the most accurate single noninvasive modality for detecting distant metastases. It is the imaging modality of choice for whole-body scanning in high-risk patients or patients who have clinically suspected recurrence, and is particularly helpful in determining which patients are the best candidates for surgical cure.
