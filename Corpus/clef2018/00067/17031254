Muscle perfusion and metabolic heterogeneity: insights from noninvasive imaging techniques. Recent developments in noninvasive imaging techniques have enabled the study of local changes in perfusion and metabolism in skeletal muscle as well as patterns of heterogeneity in these variables in humans. In this review, the principles of these techniques along with some recent findings on functional heterogeneity in human skeletal muscle will be presented.
