An analytical algorithm for skew-slit collimator SPECT with uniform attenuation correction. To replace the conventional pinhole (normal cone-beam) collimator, a novel skew-slit collimator was previously proposed and a Novikov-type algorithm developed to reconstruct images using the skew-slit geometry. The goal of this paper is to develop a reconstruction algorithm that has better noise control than the Novikov-type algorithm. The new algorithm is able to compensate for uniform attenuation, and computer simulation results show that reconstructed images are less noisy.
