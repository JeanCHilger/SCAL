Monitoring of humans and animals for the presence of various Rickettsiae and Coxiella burnetii by serological methods. Serological examination of humans in Slovakia suspected of having rickettsial infections revealed the presence of antibodies to spotted fever group rickettsiae (R. conorii, R. slovaca, and R. typhi). Of interest is the finding of serological positivity to the newly recognized "IRS" agent. Antibodies to these rickettsiae and to C. burnetii were demonstrated also in domestic and hunting dogs and pet animals. These results confirm the occurrence and possible circulation of these rickettsiae and C. burnetii in the Slovak Republic.
