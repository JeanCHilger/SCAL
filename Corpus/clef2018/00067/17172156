Carbon-11 labeling chemistry based upon [11C]methyl iodide. Radiochemistry with the short-lived positron emitter 11C (half-life 20.38 min) represents special challenges in terms of synthesis time and labeling techniques. The recent developments in 11C radiochemistry have steadily expanded the number of 11C labeled compounds. This chapter addresses selected chemical and technical aspects of 11C chemistry based on the readily available labeling precursors [11 C]methyl iodide and, to a lesser extent, [11C]methyl triflate. Special emphasis is placed on heteroatom methylation reactions and 11C-C bond formations.
