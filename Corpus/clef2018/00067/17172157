68Ga-PET radiopharmacy: A generator-based alternative to 18F-radiopharmacy. Positron emission tomography (PET) is becoming a dominating method in the field of molecular imaging. Most commonly used radionuclides are accelerator produced 11C and 18F. An alternative method to label biomolecules is the use of metallic positron emitters among them 68Ga is the most promising as it can be produced from a generator system consisting of an inorganic or organic matrix immobilizing the parent radionuclide 68Ge. Germanium-68 has a long half-life of 271 days which allows the production of long-lived, potentially very cost-effective generator systems. A commercial generator from Obninsk, Russia, is available which uses TiO2 as an inorganic matrix to immobilize 68Ge in the oxidation state IV+. 68Ge(IV) is chemically sufficiently different to allow efficient separation from 68Ga(III). Ga3+ is redox-inert
