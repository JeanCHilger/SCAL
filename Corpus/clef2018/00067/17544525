N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide as a predictor of repeat coronary revascularization. Recent studies suggest that natriuretic peptides are potential biomarkers for myocardial ischemia. However, little is known about the value of NT-proBNP as a predictor of repeat revascularization (RR) at follow-up angiography in patients with normal LV systolic function.We collected and analyzed the clinical and angiographic data from 445 consecutive patients (62.5+/-10.1 years 73% males) who showed normal LV systolic function and no regional wall motion abnormalities on transthoracic echocardiogram performed at baseline and follow-up angiography.Overall, NT-proBNP level on admission for follow-up angiography was significantly higher in patients with RR (n=55) than those without RR (n=390) [92.4 (47.5-178.5) pg/ml vs. 54.8 (30.6-93.1) pg/ml, P<0.001]. In asymptomatic patients, NT-proBNP did not show significant difference between patients with RR and those without RR (P=0.42). An elevated NT-proBNP level, especially in symptomatic patients (n=77) (>87.5 pg/ml as an optimal cut off value) was a strong independent predictor for RR at follow-up angiography (OR, 12.3 95% CI, 3.25-46.2Our data show that NT-proBNP level at follow-up is a strong independent predictor for RR especially in symptomatic patients. Although routine measurement may be not useful for predict RR, NT-proBNP may help to identify patients with low risk of repeat revascularization.
