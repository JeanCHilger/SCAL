Low serum adiponectin is associated with high circulating oxidized low-density lipoprotein in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. Decrease in adiponectin level, a common feature in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, is considered to predict cardiovascular events. Elevated oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), formed within the arterial wall, is commonly seen as part of the atherogenic profile. We investigated the association of adiponectin and oxLDL in 58 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and ischemic coronary artery disease. In addition to adiponectin, the serum lipid profile (including oxLDL), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and whole-body glucose uptake determined by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp were evaluated. The average adiponectin level was 7.1 +/- 3.5 microg/mL and was higher in female than in male patients (P = .011). Adiponectin level correlated with whole-body glucose uptake (P = .037) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration (P = .007) and was inversely associated with oxLDL (P = .005), triglycerides (P = .010), and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (P = .004). No association was found between adiponectin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or LDL cholesterol levels. In multiple linear regression analysis, adiponectin contributed to oxLDL concentration, whereas total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides did not. In conclusion, our results suggest that low adiponectin concentration indicates increased oxidative state in the arterial wall, which further supports previous data on the role of adipose tissue in atherogenesis.
