SPECT scan is a reliable tool for selection of patients undergoing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Was to determine the relationship between pre-operative SPECT and intra-operative assessments of tibio-femoral chondral changes.One hundred cases had been selected on the following criteria: (1) marked Tc-99 m uptake on the medial compartment and (2) its normal uptake laterally. The cartilage macroscopic condition of tibio-femoral compartments were then recorded during the surgery.A total of 73% of Grade 0, 24% of Grade I, and 3% of Grade II chondral injuries were detected laterally 100% of Grade IV chondral lesions were detected medially. Statistically very significant relationship was demonstrated between SPECT and the mcroscopic cartilage condition.SPECT bone scan provides very useful information regarding the degree of osteoarthritis in knee weight-bearing compartments for pre-operative planning.
