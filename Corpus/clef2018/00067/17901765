18F-FDG PET/CT in primary central nervous system lymphoma in HIV-negative patients. To determine the value of F-FDG PET/CT in the different manifestations of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) in HIV-negative patients.All PCNSL and HIV-negative patients referred for PET/CT in our institution from July 2001 to June 2006 were retrospectively studied. PET/CT examinations were reviewed by two experienced readers and evaluated for each possible anatomical site of nervous system involvement: cerebral, spinal/nerve and ocular. PET/CT results were characterized as true positive or negative and false positive or negative according to the status of the disease, which was determined after the evaluation of biopsies, laboratory, clinical and imaging examinations, and follow-up.Forty-two PET/CT examinations were carried out in 25 PCNSL patients. For intracerebral disease, PET/CT was true positive in 13 cases, true negative in 27 and false negative in two. For disease involving spinal cord and/or nerves, PET/CT was true positive in four cases, true negative in 37 and false negative in one. For ocular disease, PET was true positive in only one case and false negative in four. The sensitivity of PET/CT in detecting active disease in the brain was 87% (13/15), in the spine/nerves 80% (4/5), and in the eyes only 20% (1/5).PET/CT seems to be sensitive for the detection of viable intracerebral as well as for spinal and peripheral nerve disease, but not for the detection of ocular involvement.
