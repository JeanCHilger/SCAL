Assessment myocardial perfusion and contraction by Karhunen-Loeve transform on scintigraphic images. Theory and previous studies showed that KLT (an application of principal component transform for imaging) can be use for analysis of cardiac function. This paper presents the results of our studies concerning the applications of KLT for images smoothing, quantification of myocardial contraction, and improvement of inter-observer reproducibility in cardiac imaging. The paper also describes the use of 4D cardiac phantom to quantify Karhunen-Loeve images.
