Role of low-dose, noncontrast computed tomography from integrated positron emission tomography/computed tomography in evaluating incidental 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose-avid colon lesions. To assess the contribution of concurrent low-dose, noncontrast CT in the assessment of the malignant potential of incidental focal 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)-avid colonic lesions on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT).Routine FDG-PET/CT scans were reviewed for identification of focal FDG-avid colon lesions, and the CT component was independently reviewed for an anatomical lesion and malignant potential based on CT criteria. Clinical, endoscopic, and histopathology follow-up was obtained.A total of 85/2,916 (3%) oncology FDG-PET/CT scans had incidental focal colon lesions. Clinical and/or endoscopic follow-up was available in 83/85 (98%) patients. Focal, corresponding CT lesions were found in 44/83 (53%) patients, but features of malignancy were not assessable. Of the 44 patients with a final diagnosis, 32/44 (73%) were FDG-PET/CT true positives 5/44 (11%) were false positivesConcurrent low-dose, noncontrast CT improves localization, but does not provide independent information on the malignant potential of incidental focal colonic activity on FDG-PET/CT.
