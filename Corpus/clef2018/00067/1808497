Comparison of SPECT and quantified EEG features in Alzheimer's type dementia. Forty-one patients with probable dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) have been studied by computerized EEg (C-EEG) and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) using 123-IMP. Four groups have been distinguished according to SPECT hypoperfusion topography: frontal, temporo-parietal, fronto-parietal and fronto-temporo-parietal. C-EEG parameters were much more disturbed in the 2 latter than in the 2 former groups. Thus a normal C-EEG could indicate a dominant frontal or temporo-parietal form of DAT. Therefore some bias due to duration or rate of disease progression cannot be excluded. So far the important finding is that EEG changes are diffuse and do not reflect the topography of SPECT hypoperfusion questioning the value of EEG topographical analysis in DTA.
