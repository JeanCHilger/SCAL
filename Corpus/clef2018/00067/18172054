Positron-emission tomography imaging of the angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor in swine renal artery stenosis. The angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor (AT(1)R) has been linked to the development and progression of renovascular hypertension. In this study we applied a pig model of renovascular hypertension to investigate the AT(1)R in vivo with positron-emission tomography (PET) and in vitro with quantitative autoradiography. AT(1)R PET measurements were performed with the radioligand [(11)C]KR31173 in 11 control pigs and in 13 pigs with hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis 4 were treated with lisinopril for 2 weeks before PET imaging. The radioligand impulse response function was calculated by deconvolution analysis of the renal time-activity curves. Radioligand binding was quantified by the 80-minute retention of the impulse response function. Median values and interquartile ranges were used to illustrate group statistics. Radioligand retention was significantly increased (P=0.044) in hypoperfused kidneys of untreated (0.225
