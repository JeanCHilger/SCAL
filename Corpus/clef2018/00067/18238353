3D image understanding in radiology. The role of 3-D imaging in medicine and the questions it raises regarding what should be automated and how the information is to be used are addressed. The discussion then turns to imagery generated by equipment using computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) images, or positron/single-photon emission tomograms (PET/SPECT). Such image data are considered as spatial image sequences. Low-level and high-level processing for spatial image sequence understanding are examined. Conclusions are drawn regarding the value of 3-D imaging and the issues to be considered in its future development.
