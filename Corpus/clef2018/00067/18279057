Indium-111 capromab pendetide in the management of recurrent prostate cancer. The provision of accurate prognostic information is a long-standing goal for effective management of prostate adenocarcinoma. Nontargeted imaging modalities are less efficient at detecting slow-growing prostate cancers. Prostate-specific membrane antigen has emerged as a superior biomarker, especially for the evaluation of metastatic spread. Advances in imaging technology have focused clinical interest on indium-111 capromab ((111)In capromab) pendetide, a radioimmunoconjugate that detects prostate-specific membrane antigen expression in vivo. Single-photon emission computed tomography capromab pendetide images, fused with those generated by computed tomography or magnetic resonance, have engendered improvements in localization accuracy by correlating high signal intensity with anatomic structures. In long-term outcomes studies, fused (111)In capromab pendetide scans have delivered significant benefits for patient selection and improved treatment of prostate cancer.
