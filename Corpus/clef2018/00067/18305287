Changes in regional cerebral blood flow after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in treatment-resistant depression. High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is effective in treatment-resistant depression, although its mechanism is still not completely elucidated. To clarify the neuroanatomical alteration of function elicited by rTMS, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with (99m)Tc-ECD was performed on 12 male inpatients with treatment-resistant unipolar depression before and after high-frequency rTMS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that the manifestation of the antidepressant effect of high-frequency rTMS is associated with changes in the neuroanatomical function of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as of the limbic-paralimbic region, including the ipsilateral subgenual cingulate, and the basal ganglia.
