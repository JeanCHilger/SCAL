Photon-emission tomography (SPECT) in the detection of hepatic hemangiomas of small size. By means of ultrasonography it is possible to detect hepatic lesions of few millimeters, however, it doesn't give a precise diagnosis. The role of planar scintigraphy in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma has already been established, although it has limitations which are partially solved by means of SPECT. 46 patients with different pathologies and 9 healthy volunteers have been studied. In the 19 confirmed hemangiomas, planar scintigraphy showed a sensitivity of 73.6% versus 84.2% for SPECT, mostly due to lesions less than 2.5 cm. Besides that, SPECT allowed a correct visualization of abdominal and intrahepatic major vessels, although lesions less than 1.5 cm are difficult to evaluate.
