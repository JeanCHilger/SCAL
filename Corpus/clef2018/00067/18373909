18FDG-PET in patients with in situ breast carcinomas. A cause of false negative results. To study the behaviour of 18F-FDG-PET in patients with in situ breast carcinomas.The study group included 19 women with a tumor size between 0.8 and 2.2 cm. An uptake in breast with a SUV > 1.9 was considered as positive.18F-FDG-PET was positive in 8 patients (SUV range 0.6-2.8The percentage of positive results of 18F-FDG-PET in in-situ breast carcinomas and the SUV are lower than those observed in infiltrating ductal carcinomas, regardless of tumor size. Those carcinomas can be a source of false negative results with such imaging technique.
