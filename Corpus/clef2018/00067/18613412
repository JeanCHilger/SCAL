Clinical role of FDG-PET for HCC: relationship of glucose metabolic indicator to Japan Integrated Staging (JIS) score. The purpose of this study was to validate the usefulness of positron emission tomography with fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) in predicting degree of malignancy and prognosis, evaluated in terms of Japan Integrated Staging (JIS) score, in cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).FDG-PET was performed in 50 patients with HCC. The activity within regions of interest placed over tumors was measured, and standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated by dividing the tissue activity by injected dose of radioactivity per unit body weight. SUV ratio (SUVR) was expressed as tumor-to-nontumor ratio of SUV. Patients were allocated to 3 groups of similar size: group A, SUVR < or = 1.1 group B, 1.1 < SUVR < 1.6SUVR significantly correlated with tumor node metastasis stage score (p < 0.001) or JIS score (p = 0.022). Survival rate in SUVR group C was significantly lower than that in group A (p < 0.001), and close to being significantly lower than that in group B. On multivariate analysis, JIS scores 2 and > or = 3, SUVR group C were significantly related to survival (All p < 0.05).SUVR was well associated with a tumor staging which is the factor of JIS score and with survival, and indicated malignancy and prognosis of patients especially with high-grade HCC.
