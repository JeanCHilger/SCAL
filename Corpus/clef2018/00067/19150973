Alterations in regional brain volume and individual MRI-guided perfusion in normal control, stable mild cognitive impairment, and MCI-AD converter. Regional differences in tissue volume and perfusion in brains of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus normal healthy age-matched controls (NC), and the differences between MCI-AD converters and stable MCI patients were investigated. MRI and SPECT scans were performed on 13 MCI (74+6 years) and 12 NC (75+4 years). Of the MCI patients, 10 were followed for up to three years and 4 subsequently converted to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Episodic memory function was assessed using tests of delayed recall for word lists and stories. The volume reductions and hypoperfusion were mainly confined to the medial temporal lobe (MTL) of MCI patients and associated with worse scores on memory tests. Perfusion in the corpus callosum and the gray matter of frontal, lateral temporal, parietal or occipital lobe was not significantly affected in MCI. The 4 MCI-AD converters had relatively low MTL structural volume and perfusion compared to their stable peers.
