Prediction of pulmonary function after lung lobectomy by subsegments counting, computed tomography, single photon emission computed tomography and computed tomography: a comparative study. The aim of the present study was to determine the optimal method of predicting postoperative pulmonary function (PPF) after lung lobectomy.The forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV(1)) was measured in 37 patients before and after lobectomy, and the following three methods of predicting the PPF were evaluated: (1) the number of functioning subsegments to be resected were counted (subsegments counting [SC]) (2) the volume of the functioning lung was calculated using CT images (quantitative CT)While a paired t-test showed the SPECT/CT method to have the smallest difference between the measured and the predicted FEV(1) values (0.05 l, p=0.33), followed by the quantitative CT method (0.07 l, p=0.07), and finally the SC method (0.15 l, p<0.001), the difference between the two values was not significantly different between the quantitative CT and SPECT/CT method (p=0.22).While the SC method is inferior to both the quantitative CT and the SPECT/CT methods for predicting the PPF after lobectomy, the latter two methods are almost equally accurate.
