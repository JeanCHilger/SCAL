Labeling monocytes for imaging chronic inflammation. With growing interest in cell-based scintigraphic diagnosis or therapy monitoring, there is an increasing demand for non-invasive observation and quantification of cell trafficking in the preclinical and clinical setting. Monocytes are members of the human mononuclear phagocyte system originating from a myeloid precursor in the bone. Labeled monocytes are being used for investigation of pathogenesis like atherosclerosis and for monitoring of therapeutic intervention in inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Labeling mononuclear cells at high specific activity without affecting their biological functions allows (delayed) non-invasive imaging with g or PET cameras. Monocytes labeled before their final differentiation into macrophages or dendritic cells may reveal centers of inflammation in a patient and, thereby, contribute to scintigraphic diagnosis. Macrophages or dendritic cells may be in vitro cultured and by means of genetic transformation specified towards specific targets prior to re-injection, an approach with therapeutic potency. This review addresses issues on autologous monocytes, particularly their properties and labeling for non-invasive in vivo radionuclide imaging of chronic inflammation.
