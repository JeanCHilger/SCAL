Successful outcome of patients with relapsed/refractor Hodgkin lymphoma treated with high dose chemotherapy at the National Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at St. James's Hospital. Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma who relapse or are refractory to first line multi-agent chemotherapy can be successfully salvaged with high dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Twenty-six patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma have been treated with HDT and ASCT at St James Hospital between 2000 and 2005. At day 100 post HDT-ASCT, 23 patients were in complete remission. This group included all 6 patients transplanted at first relapse, 8 of 9 with advanced disease and 9 of 11 with primary refractory disease. Patients treated in first relapse had the best outcome with an overall and progression free survival of 100% (median, 37 months). Patients with primary refractory disease had the poorest outcome with an overall survival of 76% (median, 28 months). All patients with primary refractory disease responsive to salvage chemotherapy were in remission at a median of 28 months. The presence of chemosensitive disease prior to transplantation was the most important determinant of outcome. PET-CT imaging is useful to assess chemosensititvity prior to HDT and thus predict which patients will do well post HDT-ASCT. No patient died of treatment related toxicity. The outcome of this patient series compares favourably with international figures.
