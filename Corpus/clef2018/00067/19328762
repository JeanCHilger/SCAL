Costal chondrosarcoma. Report of five cases. We report five cases of coastal chondrosarcoma (CS) in four women and one man between 28 and 49 years of age. In four cases, the tumor had spread and infiltrated the adjacent structures (soft tissues, thoracic vertebrae, mediastinum, etc.). CS was diagnosed based either on wide surgical resection specimens in three patients, or on tumor biopsies in two cases. The CS was grade I in one patient, grade II in three cases, and grade III in one case. Wide surgical resection which was performed in three patients was associated in one case with adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In the three cases, the disease natural history appeared favorable after a follow-up duration ranging from 1 month to 4 years. Two patients died, one after radiotherapy and chemotherapy done immediately after diagnosis as a result of the large size and invasive nature of the tumor. Coastal CS is characterized by a distinct potential for locoregional and distant metastasis. Diagnosis remains anatomopathological. Wide surgical resection is the only demonstrated curative treatment, even for high-grade CS.
