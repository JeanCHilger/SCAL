Stability of resting deoxyglucose metabolic values in PET studies of schizophrenia. Positron emission tomography (PET) and the deoxyglucose method were used to determine the test-retest stability of regional cerebral glucose metabolism in 8 male schizophrenic patients and 11 normal control subjects, scanned twice under baseline (resting) conditions. Normal and schizophrenic subjects showed comparable stability of regional metabolism. When the regional values were scaled to compensate for the effects of changes in whole brain metabolism, the resulting mean regional changes were reduced to about 1-2% in both groups. This study demonstrates that the baseline resting state is an appropriate reference state for schizophrenic subjects in deoxyglucose PET experiments.
