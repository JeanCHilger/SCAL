Clinical diagnosis of primary unknown cancer-the present situation and problems. The first step of diagnosis of primary unknown cancer(PUC)the detailed history intake and physical examination including breast, genitourinary system and rectum. Laboratory test, chest X-p and systemic computed tomography are allowed to be performed for all patients with PUC. Other tests should be performed according to the results of clinical and pathological evaluation. Utility of the tumor marker is limited, and this test is not recommended as a routine usage. There is not enough evidence on the utility of FDG-PTT or FDG-PET/CT for patients with PUC. Diagnosis of PUC should be made within one month from a patient's first visit to a hospital.
