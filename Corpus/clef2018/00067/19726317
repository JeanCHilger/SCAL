Clinical value of (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography-computed tomography in local liver neoplasm ablation. To assess the value of (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET-CT) in ultrasound-guided local ablation of malignant liver tumors.Thirteen patients with 35 local residual tumor foci following previous tumor ablation underwent (18)F-FDG PET-CT and ultrasound-guided local ablation with intratumoral alcohol injection.After the second local ablation guided by (18)F-FDG PET-CT and ultrasound, radioactive defects were detected in the corresponding location in 31 of the 35 residual foci, and after the third local ablation, the other 4 foci also showed radioactive defects.(18)F-FDG PET-CT can sensitively and accurately identify tissue necrosis and residual tumors, and serves as an excellent approach for ultrasound-guided local ablation of local residual tumors.
