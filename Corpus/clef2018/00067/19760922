The impact of PET/CT on therapeutic strategy of patients with colorectal cancer metastasis. The study's aim was to assess the impact of the PET/CT on the therapeutic strategy of the patients with colorectal cancer metastasis.Fifteen patients who were suspicious of postoperative colorectal cancer metastasis were included in the study. Each patient received a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) after received contrast-enhanced computed tomography (ceCT). The therapeutic strategies were made before and after the PET/ CT respectively. The lesions confirmed by pathology or periodic follow up of ceCT (3 and 6 mo).Intrahepatic metastases were present in 5 of the 15 patients, total 9 lesions. The specificities of the PET/CT and ceCT were 100%. The patients with intrahepatic metastases were detected by PET/CT and ceCT with a sensitivity of 100% and 80%, respectively (p = 0.0009). Extrahepatic metastases were present in 11 of the 15 patients, total 32 lesions. The specificities of the PET/CT and ceCT were 75% and 50%, respectively. PET/ CT and ceCT were with a sensitivity of 100% and 63.6%, respectively (p = 0.0177). The therapeutic strategies were changed after received PET/CT in 6 (40%) of the 15 patients.PET/CT is superior to ceCT for the detection of the metastatic lesions of the colorectal cancer, and is a valuable tool to help select the correct therapeutic strategies.
