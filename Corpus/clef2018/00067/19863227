Dose prescription and optimisation based on tumour hypoxia. INTRODUCTION. Tumour hypoxia is an important factor that confers radioresistance to the affected cells and could thus decrease the tumour response to radiotherapy. The development of advanced imaging methods that quantify both the extent and the spatial distribution of the hypoxic regions has created the premises to devise therapies that target the hypoxic regions in the tumour. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The present study proposes an original method to prescribe objectively dose distributions that focus the radiation dose to the radioresistant tumour regions and could therefore spare adjacent normal tissues. The effectiveness of the method was tested for clinically relevant simulations of tumour hypoxia that take into consideration dynamics and heterogeneity of oxygenation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. The results have shown that highly heterogeneous dose distributions may lead to significant improvements of the outcome only for static oxygenations. In contrast, the proposed method that involves the segmentation of the dose distributions and the optimisation of the dose prescribed to each segment to account for local heterogeneity may lead to significantly improved local control for clinically-relevant patterns of oxygenation. The clinical applicability of the method is warranted by its relatively easy adaptation to functional imaging of tumour hypoxia obtained with markers with known uptake properties.
