Performance of integrated FDG-PET/contrast-enhanced CT in the diagnosis of recurrent pancreatic cancer: comparison with integrated FDG-PET/non-contrast-enhanced CT and enhanced CT. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D: -glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast for depiction of recurrent pancreatic cancer, compared with PET/non-enhanced CT and CT.Forty-five patients previously treated for pancreatic cancer underwent PET/CT for suspected recurrence. Lesion status was determined on the basis of histopathology and radiological imaging follow-up.Patient-based analysis showed that sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PET/contrast-enhanced CT were 91.7%, 95.2%, and 93.3%, respectively, whereas those of PET/non-enhanced CT were 83.3%, 90.5%, and 86.7%, respectively, and those of enhanced CT were 66.7%, 85.7%, and 75.6%, respectively. In 21 patients whom the final diagnosis was obtained from the histopathologic examination, those figures of PET/contrast-enhanced CT were 94.7%, 50.0%, and 90.4%, respectively. The sensitivity of PET/contrast-enhanced CT in detecting local recurrence, abdominal lymph node metastasis, and peritoneal dissemination were 83.3%, 87.5%, and 83.3%, respectively.PET/contrast-enhanced CT is an accurate modality for assessing recurrence of pancreatic cancer.
