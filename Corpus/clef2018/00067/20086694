Advantages of diagnostic nuclear medicine part 2: cardiac and other nonmusculoskeletal disorders. Advances in nuclear medicine have improved the detection and localization of very small abnormalities. Radionuclide imaging of myocardial perfusion is very useful for detecting coronary artery disease in patients who have an ambiguous presentation, such as those with chest pain syndrome and a nondiagnostic exercise test. Scintigraphy is also useful for diagnosing pulmonary thromboembolism, hyperthyroidism, testicular torsion, and fevers of unknown origin. In addition, improvements in positron-emission tomography and imaging with isotope-labeled monoclonal antibodies now permit detection and staging of prostate and brain malignancies and diagnosis of infections such as osteomyelitis.
