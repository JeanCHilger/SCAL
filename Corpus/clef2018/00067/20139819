Attenuation correction of somatostatin receptor SPECT by integrated low-dose CT: is there an impact on sensitivity? Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) is an established imaging modality for neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Additional single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT) not only permits image fusion but also attenuation correction (AC) of SPECT data. This study evaluated whether attenuation corrected SPECT-images (SPECT[AC]) are more sensitive than nonattenuation corrected SPECT-reconstructions (SPECT[NAC]) for the detection of NET lesions.The imaging data (planar In-111-octreotide scintigraphy and SPECT-CT) of 50 consecutive patients (28 male 22 femaleA total of 222 pathologic foci were detected by SPECT(NAC) and 227 foci by SPECT(AC), respectively. In 67 of 227 foci (29.5%), focus intensity/contrast increased after AC, whereas only 5 foci showed a decrease (P < 0.001). Sensitivity increased by 2.2% (P = 0.025 95% CI: 0.02%-4.1%) as 5 foci were detected only by SPECT(AC). However, as these 3 patients were already diagnosed with systemic disease, there was no influence on the therapeutic strategy chosen.Attenuation correction of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy-SPECT significantly improves focus visualization and, albeit slightly, also significantly increases sensitivity.
