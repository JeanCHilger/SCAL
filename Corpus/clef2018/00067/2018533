Phospholipase D activity and phosphatidylethanol formation in stimulated HeLa cells expressing the human m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor gene. The human m1 and m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) genes were subcloned, permanently expressed in HeLa cells and analyzed for their pharmacological and biochemical profiles. Both subtypes displayed saturable, high affinity binding of [3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) which was displaced by muscarinic agonists and antagonists. Stimulation of intact HeLa cells expressing the human m1 AChR gene by the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M, in the presence of ethanol, resulted in the activation of phospholipase D (PLD) and the formation of phosphatidylethanol (PEt). In contrast, oxotremorine-M did not activate PLD in the HeLa cells expressing the human m2 AChR subtype. These data suggest that the human m1 AChR is linked to the signal transduction mechanism of PLD activation, whereas the human m2 AChR interacts with a different guanine nucleotide regulatory binding protein (G-protein) which does not cause the activation of PLD or the formation of PEt.
