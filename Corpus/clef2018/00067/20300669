Benchmarking methods of enhanced heavy oil recovery using a microscaled bead-pack. A microscaled bead-pack is capable of simulating two-phase fractional flow within porous media and can be applied to simulating interactions between fluids and geological materials under dynamic conditions within the laboratory.
