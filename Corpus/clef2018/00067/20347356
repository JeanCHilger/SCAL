Recognition of anatomical predilection sites in canine elbow pathology on bone scans using micro-single photon emission tomography. The limited resolution of planar bone scintigraphy precludes exact anatomical localisation within a joint. Micro-single photon emission tomography (μ-SPECT) has a much higher resolution, and in this study the use of μ-SPECT in the evaluation of the canine elbow joint and fusion with structural imaging data were tested. Twelve elbows of seven normal dogs were included. μ-SPECT was performed with a conventional triple head gamma camera adapted with three multi-pinhole collimators (HiSPECT). Radiographs, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed on all elbows and data from CT and MRI were fused to the HiSPECT data using dedicated software. Different important anatomical regions could be recognised on the HiSPECT images. The improved resolution of the HiSPECT system allowed better differentiation of the anatomical areas in the elbow joint. Two case studies were included to demonstrate the potential of this methodology. Fusion software facilitated the use of combined structural and functional information.
