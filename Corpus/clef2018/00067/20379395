Current management strategy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is an unique head and neck cancer. It is common among the southern Chinese and is closely associated with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV). To diagnose the disease in its early stage is infrequent as the symptoms are usually trivial and patients only present in late stages. Testing the blood for elevated EBV DNA has now become a screening test for the high risk group of patients, aiming to diagnose the disease in its early stages. Imaging studies, positron emission tomography scans in addition to clinical examination provide information on the extent of the disease. The confirmation of the disease still depends on endoscopic examination and biopsy. Radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy has been the primary treatment modality. The application of intensity modulated radiotherapy and the use of concomitant chemoradiation have improved the control of nasopharyngeal carcinoma together with the reduction of long term side effects. The early detection of residual or recurrence tumor in the neck or at the primary site has allowed delivery of salvage treatment. The choice of the optimal surgical salvage, either for neck disease or primary tumor depends on the extent of the residual or recurrent disease. The outcome of these patients have improved with the application of the appropriate surgical salvage.
