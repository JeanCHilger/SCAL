PET features of aortic diseases. Recently, several reports have highlighted the potential role of (18)F-FDG PET for the assessment of various aortic diseases based on FDG accumulation. In this article, we divided various aortic diseases into the following three groups on the basis of the mechanism of FDG accumulation: atherosclerosis, aortitis or periaortitis, and thrombus. Elucidating the mechanisms and patterns of FDG uptake in various aortic diseases provides valuable information for clinical management.PET findings can provide additional information for the diagnosis of aortic diseases and valuable information for clinical management. It is essential to understand the characteristics of FDG uptake in various aortic diseases for proper appreciation of PET findings.
