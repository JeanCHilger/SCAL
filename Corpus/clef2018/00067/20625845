Targeted therapies in renal cell cancer: recent developments in imaging. Targeted therapy has significantly improved the perspectives of patients with metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC). Frequently, these new molecules cause disease stabilization rather than substantial tumor regression. As treatment options expand with the growing number of targeted agents, there is an increasing need for surrogate markers to early assess tumor response. Here, we review the currently available imaging techniques and response evaluation criteria for the assessment of tumor response in mRCC patients. For computed tomography (CT), different criteria are discussed including the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), the Choi criteria, the modified Choi criteria, and the size and attenuation CT (SACT) criteria. Functional imaging modalities are discussed, such as dynamic contrast-enhanced CT (DCE-CT), dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (DCE-US), and positron emission tomography (PET).
