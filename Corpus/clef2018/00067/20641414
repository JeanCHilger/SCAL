 Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a characteristic feature of a variety of cancers such as breast, ovarian, lung, head and neck, bladder, and colon cancers (1). The EGFR is a 170-kDa transmembrane protein that promotes cell proliferation on binding of the autocrine epidermal growth factor (EGF) or the transforming growth factor α (TGFα). The EGFR operates through a receptor-associated tyrosine kinase–mediated signal transduction pathway. The progression of some cancers is attributed to both an increased level, and activation of EGFR by EGF and TGFα or to a constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase pathway caused by the development of a mutated receptor kinase. In an effort to develop therapy against cancers that develop as a result of increased EGFR activity or a mutated receptor kinase, a variety of EGFR inhibitors have been developed that either compete with EGF and TGFα for receptor binding (e.g., monoclonal antibodies (MAb) that target the receptor) or are small molecules that inhibit activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway (2). The murine MAb ior egf/r3, which binds to the external domain of the human EGFR, was generated at the Center of Molecular Immunology in Havana, Cuba (3), and has been shown to inhibit the EGF-dependent growth of various cell lines (4). This MAb was also labeled with metastable radioactive technetium (
