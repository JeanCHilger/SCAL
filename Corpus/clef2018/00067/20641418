[5'-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)[2,2’-bithiophen]-5-yl]methylene]-propanedinitrile NIAD. [[5’-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)[2,2’-bithiophen]-5-yl]methylene]-propanedinitrile (NIAD-4) is a fluorophore that was developed for optical imaging of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the central nervous system (CNS) in basic and pre-clinical research for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ-peptide was sequenced from the meningeal blood vessels of AD patients and individuals with Downs syndrome (1). Aβ peptides contain 40-42 amino acid residues and are metabolic products of Aβ precursor protein (APP) from cleavage by β− and γ−secretases . Aβ is also identified as the primary component of the neuritic plaques of AD patient brain tissue (2). The cloning of the gene encoding the APP and its localization to chromosome 21 led to the hypothesis that Aβ accumulation is the primary event in AD pathogenesis (1, 3). This hypothesis proposes that neuronal death in AD is related to toxic effect of Aβ on the adjacent cell bodies or cell processes (4). AD is a progressive, neurogenerative disorder of the CNS, and is characterized by a common set of clinical and pathological features . In addition to Aβ, the microtubule-associated protein, tau (זּ), is also found in the cell body and axons of neurons as neurofibrillary tangles. The search for a cure or effective treatment of AD requires
