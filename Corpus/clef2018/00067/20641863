 Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) is a characteristic feature of a variety of cancers, and HER2 levels in tumors (primary or metastatic) are often used to screen for patients who would benefit from anti-HER2 antibody (Ab) therapy (e.g., for breast cancer, etc.), to determine the efficacy of a treatment regimen, or to predict the prognostic outcome for a patient (1). Positron emission tomography or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging with labeled ligands that target HER2 are often used to detect, diagnose, and develop a treatment regimen for cancers that overexpress this receptor in research studies (this is not a Food and Drug Administration approved indication for human as yet) (2). Although many Abs (monoclonal, recombinant, etc.) and their derivatives have been developed and used in the clinical setting for the imaging or radioimmunotherapy of such cancers, these agents have low efficacy because of their immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic properties (long circulating time), and inability to penetrate deep into tissue (due to the large size (~150 kDa)) (3). Consequently, investigators are constantly developing and evaluating new alternatives to the Ab-based imaging agents (3). Recently, a small (~7 kDa) â€œZ
