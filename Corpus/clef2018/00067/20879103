Positron-emission tomography in the diagnosis of middle cerebral artery lesions. The regional brain glucose metabolism after the intravenous drop-by-drop infusion of saline and 50 mg of cavinton was measured with positron-emission tomography (PET) in the right middle brain artery in 5 patients with ischemic stroke. The increase of glucose metabolism was found in the region of post stroke cystic-focal and perifocal changes as well as in contralateral regions. The dose of cavinton (50 mg) was safe and well-tolerated by patients. The use of PET in evaluating of glucose metabolism changes in the brain helps in prognosis of the disease.
