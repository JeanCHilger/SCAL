CT, MR, (18)F-FDG PET/CT, and their combined use for the assessment of mandibular invasion by squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity. a reliable assessment of mandibular invasion is crucial for treatment planning to obtain both radical tumor resection and good functional results.to retrospectively compare the diagnostic value of three different imaging methods - computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT - and their combined use for detection of mandibular invasion by squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity.forty-six patients (39 men and 7 women mean age, 59.4 years) suspected of having mandibular invasion by SCC of the oral cavity underwent CT, MR, and PET/CT within 2 weeks before surgery. First, each study was reviewed separately for the presence of mandibular invasion by tumors. Then, the value of combined images was assessed based on a confidence rating score for each modality assigned by observers. These results were verified with histopathologic findings.HIstopathologic examination revealed mandibular invasion in 12 of 46 SCCs. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 41.7%, 100%, and 84.8% for CT 58.3%, 97.1%, and 87.0% for MRthe combined analysis of CT, MR, and PET/CT can improve sensitivity in the detection of mandibular invasion by SCC of the oral cavity.
