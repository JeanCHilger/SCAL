Pathophysiologic correlates of 82Rb biodistribution in cardiac PET/CT. PET perfusion imaging with (82)Rb is a powerful tool for evaluating coronary artery disease (CAD). Little is known about normal patterns or significance of (82)Rb lung distribution in the setting of heart disease. Herein, PET/CT hybrid imaging was used to obtain insights into the frequency and potential radiomorphologic correlates of altered (82)Rb distribution.Myocardial perfusion PET/CT studies of 58 patients referred for workup of CAD were analyzed [28 normal and 30 patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)]. Organ regions of interest were placed on PET images, and (82)Rb uptake was measured and compared under resting and stress conditions.Qualitatively increased lung uptake was observed in 13 patients-5 with normal LVEF(R) and 8 with reduced LVEF(R) 12 of 13 had lung infiltrates/atelectasis on CT. Lung to heart ratios in the normal and low EF groups were (mean ± SD) 0.168 ± 0.047 and 0.171 ± 0.075 at rest, and 0.128 ± 0.035 and 0.147 ± 0.067 during stress (p = 0.87 and 0.18, respectively). Lung to liver ratios were not significantly different between the two groups under stress or rest conditions.Increased lung uptake of (82)Rb occurs in a subset of patients referred for workup of CAD by PET/CT and may be influenced by primary parenchymal abnormalities and LV dysfunction. Thus, the relevance of pulmonary (82)Rb uptake as a marker of cardiac outcome may be limited. Larger studies are needed to determine how non-cardiac (82)Rb uptake and CT findings may be integrated to increase the diagnostic and prognostic value of cardiac PET/CT.
