Desmoplastic small round cell tumor: impact of F-FDG PET induced treatment strategy in a patient with long-term outcome. The desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is an uncommon and highly aggressive cancer. The role of (18)F-FDG PET in management of DSRCT is little reported. We report a case of metastasized abdominal DSRCT detected in a 43-year old patient whose diagnostic and therapeutic approaches were influenced by (18)F-FDG PET-CT. The patient is still alive ten years after diagnosis. (18)F-FDG PET-CT seems to be a useful method for assessing therapeutic efficiency and detecting early recurrences even in rare malignancies such as DSRCT.
