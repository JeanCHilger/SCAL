Rosai-Dorfman disease in neuroradiology: imaging findings in a series of 10 patients. Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare disorder characterized histologically by lymphatic sinus dilatation due to histiocyte proliferation. Our goal was to describe the CT, MRI, and (18)F-FDG (FDG) PET findings in a series of patients with this diagnosis.We retrospectively reviewed the imaging studies of 10 patients with pathologically confirmed Rosai-Dorfman disease who were treated in our institution between January 2004 and December 2007.We found the following areas of general involvement: three intracranial, seven head and neck, and three spinal, with some patients having more than one site. Specific sites of involvement included the following: intracranial meninges, n = 2 pituitary, n = 2Rosai-Dorfman disease has a protean imaging appearance but most frequently presents as neck lymphadenopathy. The disease is frequently multifocal, and a diagnosis in one area should prompt suspicion that other sites may be involved also.
