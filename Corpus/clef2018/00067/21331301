Characterizing the MTF in 3D for a Quantized SPECT Camera Having Arbitrary Trajectories. The emergence of application-specific 3D tomographic small animal and dedicated breast imaging systems has stimulated the development of simple methods to quantify the spatial resolution or Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) of the system in three dimensions. Locally determined MTFs, obtained from line source measurements at specific locations, can characterize spatial variations in the system resolution and can help correct for such variations. In this study, a method is described to measure the MTF in 3D for a compact SPECT system that uses a 16 Ã— 20 cm(2) CZT-based compact gamma camera and 3D positioning gantry capable of moving in different trajectories. Image data are acquired for a novel phantom consisting of three radioactivity-filled capillary tubes, positioned nearly orthogonally to each other. These images provide simultaneous measurements of the local MTF along three dimensions of the reconstructed imaged volume. The usefulness of this approach is shown by characterizing the MTF at different locations in the reconstructed imaged 3D volume using various (1) energy windows (2) iterative reconstruction parameters including number of iterations, voxel size, and number of projection views
