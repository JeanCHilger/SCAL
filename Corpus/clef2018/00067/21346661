Differentiating suspected nasopharyngeal infection from carcinoma using dual-tracer and multiple time-point technetium-99m sestamibi and white blood cell SPECT/CT imaging. The role of molecular and functional imaging lies in its capability to more accurately define and characterize pathologies, with a host of varied radiotracers and techniques being available to the clinician for use. We present a case in which dual-tracer and multiple time-point single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography imaging using technetium-99m sestamibi and white blood cell radiotracers was used to characterize an indeterminate base of skull lesion.
