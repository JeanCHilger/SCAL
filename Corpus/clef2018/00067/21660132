Molecular imaging, pharmacokinetics, and dosimetry of In-AMBA in human prostate tumor-bearing mice. Molecular imaging with promise of personalized medicine can provide patient-specific information noninvasively, thus enabling treatment to be tailored to the specific biological attributes of both the disease and the patient. This study was to investigate the characterization of DO3A-CH(2)CO-G-4-aminobenzoyl-Q-W-A-V-G-H-L-M-NH(2) (AMBA) in vitro, MicroSPECT/CT imaging, and biological activities of (111)In-AMBA in PC-3 prostate tumor-bearing SCID mice. The uptake of (111)In-AMBA reached highest with 3.87 ± 0.65% ID/g at 8 h. MicroSPECT/CT imaging studies suggested that the uptake of (111)In-AMBA was clearly visualized between 8 and 48  h postinjection. The distribution half-life (t(1/2α)) and the elimination half-life (t(1/2β)) of (111)In-AMBA in mice were 1.53  h and 30.7  h, respectively. The C(max) and AUC of (111)In-AMBA were 7.57% ID/g and 66.39  h % ID/g, respectively. The effective dose appeared to be 0.11 mSv/MBq(-1). We demonstrated a good uptake of (111)In-AMBA in the GRPR-overexpressed PC-3 tumor-bearing SCID mice. (111)In-AMBA is a safe, potential molecular image-guided diagnostic agent for human GRPR-positive tumors, ranging from simple and straightforward biodistribution studies to improve the efficacy of combined modality anticancer therapy.
