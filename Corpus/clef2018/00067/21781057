Correlation between crossed cerebellar diaschisis and clinical neurological scales. A common consequence of unilateral stroke is crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD), a decrease in regional blood flow (CBF) and metabolism (CMRglu) in the cerebellar hemisphere contralateral to the affected cerebral hemisphere. Former studies indicated a post-stroke time-dependent relationship between the degree of CCD and the clinical status of acute and sub-acute stroke patients, but no study has been performed in post-stroke patients.The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the quantitative correlation between the degree of CCD and the values of clinical stroke scales in post-stroke patients.We measured with positron emission tomography (PET) regional CBF and CMRglu values in the affected cortical regions and the contralateral cerebellum in ten ischaemic post-stroke patients. Based on these quantitative parameters, the degree of diaschisis (DoD) was calculated, and the DoD values were correlated with three clinical stroke scales [Barthel Index, Orgogozo Scale and Scandinavian Neurological Scale (SNS)].There were significant linear correlations between all clinical stroke scales and the CCD values (Barthel Index and Orgogozo Scale: P < 0.001, for both CBF and CMRglu SNS: P = 0.007 and P = 0.044The findings indicate that DoD can be used as a quantitative indicator of the functional impairments following stroke, i.e. it can serve as a potential surrogate of the severity of the damage.
