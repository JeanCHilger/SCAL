Treatment outcome after low intensity chemotherapy [CVP] in children and adolescents with early stage nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma - an Anglo-French collaborative report. To examine whether three cycles of a low-intensity chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide [500 mg/m(2) - day 1], vinblastine [6 mg/m(2) - days 1 and 8] and prednisolone [40 mg/m(2) - days 1-7] (CVP) is safe and therapeutically effective in children and adolescents with early stage nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma [nLPHL].Fifty-five children and adolescents with early stage nLPHL [median age 13 years, range 4-17 years] diagnosed between June 2005 and October 2010 in the UK and France are the subjects of this report. Staging investigations included conventional cross sectional as well as 18 fluro-deoxyglucose [FDG] PET imaging. Histology was confirmed as nLPHL by an expert pathology panel.Of the 45 patients, who received CVP as first line treatment, 36 [80%, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: (68 92)] either achieved a complete remission [CR] or CR unconfirmed [CRu], the remaining nine patients achieved a partial response. All nine subsequently achieved CR with salvage chemotherapy [n=7] or radiotherapy [n=2]. Ten patients received CVP at relapse after primary treatment that consisted of surgery alone and all achieved CR. To date, only three patients have relapsed after CVP chemotherapy and all had received CVP as first line treatment at initial diagnosis. The 40-month freedom from treatment failure and overall survival for the entire cohort were 75.4% (SE Â± 6%) and 100%, respectively. No significant early toxicity was observed.Our results show that CVP is an effective chemotherapy regimen in children and adolescents with early stage nLPHL that is well tolerated with minimal acute toxicity.
