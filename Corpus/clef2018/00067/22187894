Twelve years' clinical experience in using positron emission tomography: advances and prospects. The paper describes 12 years' experience in using positron emission tomography (PET) at the Russian Research Center of Radiology and Surgical Technologies to detect cancer, cardiac, and psychoneurological diseases, to make their differential diagnosis, and to evaluate the efficiency of their treatment. It shows the capacities of PET using various radiopharmaceutical agents in a broad spectrum of the above abnormalities and defines prospects for further development of the technique.
