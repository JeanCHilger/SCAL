Evaluation of coronary bed function by positron emission tomography using 13N-ammonium during cold stimulation. The present investigation was to study the time course of changes in myocardial blood flow (MBF) in response to cold stimulation. Thirty-eight patients having risk factors of cardiovascular complications were examined. The time course of MBF changes was estimated by positron emission tomography (PET) using 13N-ammonium at rest and during a cold test (CT). Endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the brachial artery was determined from the results of a reactive hyperemia test, by applying ultrasonic duplex scanning. No significant MBF increase in response to the cold test was an indicator of coronary arterial endothelial dysfunction at cardiac 13N-ammonium PET. Agreement of the results of brachial arterial ultrasonography during reactive hyperemia and cardiac 13N-ammonium PET in the presence of the cold test suggests that endothelial dysfunction is generalized. Cardiovascular risk factors, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, smoking, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, substantially affect coronary arterial function. Left ventricular hypertrophy is an independent factor that influences the size of the coronary reserve and, in combination with endothelial dysfunction, worsens coronary microcirculation.
