Lack of association between prior depressive episodes and cerebral [11C]PiB binding. Depressive symptoms are frequent in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it is controversial whether depression is a risk factor for AD. This study measured for the first time cortical amyloid-β (Aβ) levels using [(11)C] Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) in a group of nondemented patients with prior depressive episodes. Twenty-eight elderly patients (mean age 61 years, range 51-75, 18 women) with onset of first depressive episode more than 6 years ago but now remitted from depression and 18 healthy subjects (mean age 61 years, range 50-76, 12 women) were included. All subjects were investigated with cognitive testing, 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and [(11)C]PiB high resolution research tomography (HRRT) positron emission tomography scan. There was no between-groups difference in [(11)C]PiB binding (p = 0.5) and no associations to number of depressive episodes, cognitive performance, or antidepressant treatment. Patients with late onset of depression had increased severity of white matter lesions (p = 0.04). In this study depressive episodes were not associated with increased levels of [(11)C]PiB. Thus, our results do not support the notion that depressive episodes previously in life are a risk factor for developing AD.
