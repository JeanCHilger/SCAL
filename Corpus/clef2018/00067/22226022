Synthesis and preliminary evaluation of [18F]-labeled 2-oxoquinoline derivatives for PET imaging of cannabinoid CB2 receptor. The cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB(2)) is an important target for development of drugs and imaging agents for diseases, such as neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and cancer. Recently, we reported synthesis and results of in vitro receptor binding of a focused library of fluorinated 2-oxoquinoline derivatives as CB(2) receptor ligands. Some of the compounds demonstrated to be good CB(2)-specific ligands with Ki values in the nanomolar to subnanomolar concentrations therefore, we pursued the development of their (18)F-labeled analogues that should be useful for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of CB(2) receptor expression. Here, we report the radiosynthesis of two (18)F-labeled 2-oxoquinoline derivatives and the preliminary in vitro and ex vivo evaluation of one compound as a CB(2)-specific radioligand.4-[(18)F]fluorobenzyl amine [(18)F]-3 was prepared by radiofluorination of 4-cyano-N,N,N-trimethylanilinium triflate salt followed by reduction with LiAlH(4) and then coupled with acid chlorides 11 and 12 to afford [(18)F]-13 and [(18)F]-14. In vitro CB(2) receptor binding assay was performed using U87 cells transduced with CB(2) and CB(1) receptor. Ex vivo autoradiography was performed with [(18)F]-14 on spleen and on CB(2)- and CB(1)-expressing and wild-type U87 subcutaneous tumors grown in mice.The radiochemical yields of [(18)F]-13 and [(18)F]-14 were 10%-15.0% with an average of 12% (n=10) radiochemical purity was >99% with specific activity 1200 mCi/Î¼mol. The dissociation constant Kd for [(18)F]-14 was 3.4 nM. Ex vivo autoradiography showed accumulation of [(18)F]-14 in the CB(2)-expressing tumor.Two new [(18)F]-labeled CB(2) ligands have been synthesized. Compound [(18)F]-14 appears to be a potential PET imaging agent for the assessment of CB(2) receptor expression however, poor solubility restrain its use in vivo.
