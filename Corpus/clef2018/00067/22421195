Phase I study of vincristine, irinotecan, and ¹³¹I-metaiodobenzylguanidine for patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma: a new approaches to neuroblastoma therapy trial. (131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a targeted radiopharmaceutical with activity in patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. Irinotecan is a known radiosensitizer with activity in neuroblastoma. This phase I study aimed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of MIBG together with fixed doses of vincristine and irinotecan.Patients 1 to 30 years old with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma and MIBG-avid tumors were eligible. All patients had autologous hematopoietic stem cells (PBSC) available and met standard phase I organ function requirements. Irinotecan (20 mg/m(2)/dose IV) was given on days 0 to 4 and 7 to 11, with vincristine (1.5 mg/m(2) IV) on days 0 and 7. MIBG was given on day 1 following a 3 + 3 phase I dose escalation design starting at 8 mCi/kg MIBG. PBSCs were administered at dose level 8 mCi/kg for prolonged myelosuppression and for all patients at 12 mCi/kg or more.Twenty-four patients evaluable for dose escalation (median age, 6.7 years range, 1.9-26.8 years) received 1 (n = 17), 2 (n = 5), or 3 (n = 2) cycles of therapy. Myelosuppression and diarrhea were the most common toxicities. Two of 6 patients at the 18 mCi/kg dose level had dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), including one with protocol-defined DLT with prolonged mild aspartate aminotransferase elevation. Eighteen mCi/kg was the recommended phase 2 dose. Six additional patients were treated at 18 mCi/kg, with one additional DLT. Responses (2 complete and 4 partial responses) occurred in 6 of 24 (25%) evaluable patients.MIBG is tolerable and active at 18 mCi/kg with standard doses of vincristine and irinotecan.
