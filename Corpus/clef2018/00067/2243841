Implementation of three-dimensional image reconstruction for multi-ring positron tomographs. In view of the number of PET studies involving low count rate acquisitions, there has been increasing interest recently in the development of positron cameras capable of fully three-dimensional acquisition and reconstruction. This interest has given impetus to the study of algorithms for 3D reconstruction, including those algorithms suitable for application to multi-ring PET scanners. While 2D reconstruction methods can often be generalised to 3D, a number of implementation problems arise which are unique to the 3D approach. This paper examines some of the difficulties associated with the generalisation of the filtered backprojection algorithm to 3D, paying particular attention to the approximations and variable transformations required for application to data from a multi-ring scanner.
