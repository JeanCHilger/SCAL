Multilayer film assembled from charged derivatives of chitosan: physical characteristics and biological responses. Polyelectrolyte multilayer films were successfully assembled from each of the three charged derivatives of chitosan N-[(2-hydroxyl-3-trimethylammonium)propyl]chitosan chloride (HTACC), N-succinyl chitosan (SCC) and N-sulfofurfuryl chitosan (SFC), paired with one of the two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) on surface-treated poly(ethylene terephthalate) (treated PET) substrates by alternate layer-by-layer adsorption. Surface coverage and wettability of the multilayer films were determined by AFM and water contact angle measurements, respectively. Analysis by quartz crystal balance with dissipation (QCM-D) has suggested that all multilayer films are relatively rigid and have a high water content associated within their structures, accounting for up to 85-90% (w/w) for films having 7-10 layers. In vitro cytocompatibility tests for the fibroblast-like L929 cell line revealed a slight dependency for cell adhesion and proliferation on the outermost layer. The multilayer film containing HTACC exhibited moderate antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. Bearing negative charges, the multilayer films terminating with SFC and having at least 10 layers were capable of suppressing the adsorption of plasma proteins and platelet adhesion at a comparable level to the multilayer film assembled from heparin, a well-known antithrombogenic polymer.
