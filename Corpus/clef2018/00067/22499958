Quantification of diagnostic accuracy using nitrate enhanced Tc-99m sestamibi gated myocardial SPECT in assessing myocardial viability: prospective analysis. The aim of this prospective study was to assess myocardial viability with nitrate-enhanced Tc-99m sestamibi gated single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with known coronary artery disease. We enrolled 48 consecutive patients (39 men, 9 women) aged 24-82 years, with coronary artery disease and history of myocardial infarction. A Tc-99m sestamibi study was conducted at rest as baseline, followed by a nitrate-enhanced study the next day. Of 960 segments analyzed, 244 of 480 in the left anterior descending coronary artery territory showed viability on the baseline study, and 276 were viable according to the nitrate-enhanced study. Similarly, of 192 right coronary segments analyzed, 148 showed viability on the baseline study compared to 153 on the nitrate study. Of 288 left circumflex territory segments analyzed, 206 showed viability on the baseline study compared to 241 on the nitrate study. The overall improvement of viability with the nitrate study was 12.04%. On the gated studies, the overall improvement with nitrate was 2.02%. The gated study also allowed grading of wall motion and thickness. It was concluded that nitrate-augmented Tc-99m sestamibi myocardial imaging significantly improved the detection of hibernating myocardium, with gated images further improving the accuracy of detection in borderline cases.
