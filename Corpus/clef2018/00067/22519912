New (99m)Tc(CO)(3) mannosylated dextran bearing S-derivatized cysteine chelator for sentinel lymph node detection. The aim of the present study is to synthesize new mannosylated dextran derivative that can be labeled with Tc-99m for potential use in sentinel lymph node detection (SLND). The compound was designed to have a dextran with molecular weight of 10 kDa as a backbone, mannose for binding to mannose receptors of the lymph node and S-derivatized cysteine as a suitable chelator for labeling with [(99m)Tc(H(2)O)(3)(CO)(3)](+) precursor. Reaction of allyl bromide with dextran (MW 11800) yielded the intermediate allyl-dextran (1) with about 40% coupling. Addition of cysteine to allyl-dextran resulted in the S-derivatized cysteine, compound DC15 (2). The final product DCM20 (3) was obtained in good yield after in situ hydrolysis and activation of cyanomethyl tetraacetyl-1-thio-d-mannopyranoside and coupling to DC15. All derivatives were purified by ultrafiltration and characterized by NMR. DC15 and DCM20 were quantitatively labeled with (99m)Tc (>95% radiochemical purity) using the fac-[(99m)Tc(OH(2))(3)(CO)(3)](+) precursor and ligand concentration of 1.5 × 10(-6) M at neutral pH. Both (99m)Tc-labeled compounds (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-DC15 (6) and (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-DCM20 (7) remained stable after 6 h incubation at 37 °C in the presence of excess histidine or cysteine, as well as even after 20-fold dilution and incubation for 24 h at room temperature. The characterization of the compounds 6 and 7 was performed by comparing their HPLC radiochromatograms with those of their rhenium surrogates Re(CO)(3)-DC15 (4) and Re(CO)(3)-DCM20 (5) respectively that were prepared using the precursor [NEt(4)](2)fac-[ReBr(3)(CO)(3)] and characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy. When injected subcutaneously from the foot pad of mice, (99m)Tc-labeled mannosylated dextran (7) showed accumulation in the popliteal lymph node (SLN in this model) higher than that of non-mannosylated analogue (6) and the (99m)Tc-phytate serving as standard. Compound 7 also exhibited lower radioactivity levels at the injection site compared to (99m)Tc-phytate. The SPECT/CT studies in mice confirmed that 7 accumulated in the popliteal lymph node allowing its clear visualization. The present findings demonstrate that compound 7 ((99m)Tc(CO)(3)-DCM20) is promising and merits further evaluation as a radiopharmaceutical for sentinel lymph node detection.
