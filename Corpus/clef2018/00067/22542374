18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in evaluating treatment response to imatinib or other drugs in gastrointestinal stromal tumors: a systematic review. To systematically review the role of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in evaluating treatment response to imatinib or other drugs in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).A comprehensive literature search of published studies through February 2011 in PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed.We identified 19 studies including 628 patients with GIST. Main findings of included studies are presented.(18)F-FDG PET has a significant value in assessing treatment response to imatinib or other drugs in GIST patients. (18)F-FDG PET allows an early assessment of treatment response and is a strong predictor of clinical outcome.
