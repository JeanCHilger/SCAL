Imaging features of urinary dysfunction associated with ketamine abuse. To summarize the imaging features of urinary dysfunction associated with ketamine abuse (KAUD) for imaging diagnosis of KAUD.We analyzed the imaging findings in 45 patients with KAUD, all having a history of ketamine abuse and presenting with severe lower urinary tract symptoms. The patients underwent imaging examinations with ultrasonography (n=45), X-ray (n=38), computed tomography (n=28), magnetic resonance imaging (n=10) or single photon emission computed tomography (n=25), and the results were classified and evaluated to identify the common imaging findings.The imaging changes of KAUD were found primarily in the urinary and biliary system. The most common imaging characteristics included thickening of the bladder wall, contracture and decreased functional volume of the bladder, dilation of the ureter and hydronephrosis, stricture of the upper ureter, renal impairment, dilation of the biliary system, and inflammation or swelling of the adjacent organs and lymph nodesKAUD presents with typical imaging changes. Radiologists should be aware of KAUD if the typical imaging features are detected, especially in cases with a history of ketamine abuse.
