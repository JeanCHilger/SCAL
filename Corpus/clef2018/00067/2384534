Effects of unilateral lesion of the nucleus basalis of Meynert on brain glucose utilization in callosotomized baboons: a PET study. Prior work has demonstrated that unilateral lesions of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM) in baboons induce a marked reduction in glucose utilization of the ipsilateral cerebral cortex, linearly proportional to the depression in cortical choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity achieved. Unexpectedly, there was also marked hypometabolism of the contralateral cerebral cortex, and glucose utilization recovered gradually on both sides despite persistent deficit in cortical ChAT activity. To investigate the role of the corpus callosum (CC) in this bilateral metabolic effect and subsequent recovery, three baboons were subjected to unilateral electrolytic NbM lesion greater than 3 months following section of the anterior CC. Brain glucose utilization was sequentially studied by positron emission tomography ChAT activity was measured and histological sections obtained after death. In these animals, the NbM lesion also induced significant metabolic depression over the ipsilateral cortex, proportional to the reduction in ChAT activity. Corpus callosotomy did not prevent the contralateral metabolic effects, suggesting that the latter do not normally operate through the CC. However, there was no significant recovery of glucose utilization, suggesting that, following unilateral NbM lesion, the CC normally mediates, at least in part, the recovery of cortical glucose utilization.
