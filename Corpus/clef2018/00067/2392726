A comparison of the clinical relevance of thallium-201 and technetium-99m-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile for the evaluation of myocardial blood flow. Thallium-201 is at present the radiotracer of choice for the clinical evaluation of myocardial blood flow. Although different technetium-99m-isonitrile agents have been synthesised recently, only 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) has proved to hold promise for clinical implementation. The myocardial distribution of 201Tl and 99mTc-MIBI was compared in a group of 20 patients, who underwent both 201Tl single photon emission computed tomography and 99mTc-MIBI study as well as coronary angiography. The sensitivity for predicting a lesion ranged from 25% to 88% in different areas of the heart and was comparable for the two radiopharmaceuticals. The specificity was greater than 80% for all regions except the inferior region where a specificity of 58% obtained by 99mTc-MIBI was better than the low specificity of 17% obtained with 201Tl (P less than 0.008).
