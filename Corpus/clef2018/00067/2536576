Common receptors for hallucinogens in rat brain: a comparative autoradiographic study using [125I]LSD and [125I]DOI, a new psychotomimetic radioligand. The S and R enantiomers of the psychotomimetic 5HT2 agonist DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenylisopropylamine) were labeled with 125I at high-specific activity. The regional distribution of binding sites for each of the enantiomers was investigated using in vitro quantitative autoradiography and compared to the regional distribution of [125I]LSD in the rat brain. Saturable, specific binding of the radioligands was determined in cortical membrane homogenates. All radioligands exhibited specific binding in localized regions throughout the rat brain. Binding of [125I]DOI enantiomers was completely displaced (greater than 90%) by 1 microM of the corresponding unlabeled enantiomer [125I]LSD was completely displaced by 1 microM LSD. The choroid plexus showed the highest-density binding. Other regions showing high-density binding included the frontoparietal cortex (motor and somatosensory areas), anterior cingulate gyrus, lateral olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, caudate nuclei, claustrum, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, dentate gyrus, mamillary nuclei, and motor trigeminal nuclei. In most regions, [125I]S-DOI, the less active enantiomer, exhibited 25-40% of the amount of total binding as [125I]R-DOI. In some regions, [125I]R-DOI and [125I]LSD had similar binding densities
