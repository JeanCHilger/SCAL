Imaging of cerebral blood flow and metabolism in amblyopia by positron emission tomography. We used positron emission tomography to study monocular visual activation of various brain regions in four amblyopic and two normally sighted adults. Imaging of relative cerebral blood flow using the tracer H2(15)O showed reduced activation of primary visual cortex by the amblyopic as compared with the sound eye. Imaging of relative cerebral glucose metabolism using the tracer [18F]-2-deoxyglucose showed equal activation of primary visual cortex by either eye in the control subject, but reduced activation of primary and accessory visual cortex by the amblyopic as compared with the sound eye in two amblyopic subjects. Relative glucose metabolism was consistently higher in the frontal and temporal lobes contralateral to the viewing eye, both in normal and amblyopic subjects.
