Integration of digital angiography, magnetic resonance, x-ray computed tomography and positron emission tomography in stereotaxy. Consecutively to drastic changes which occurred in cerebral imagery techniques, we have developed a stereotactic apparatus and system based on the integration of several new techniques allowing visualisation of the brain: tomodensitometry (TDM), digital subtraction angiography (DSA), magnetic resonance (MR) and positron emission tomography (PET). TDM, DSA and MR can be performed in stereotactic conditions with the apparatus in situ. They give the computer the anatomic references necessary for all calculations. MR and PET images obtained without stereotactic apparatus can also be integrated into the stereotactic study at the condition that DSA was formerly performed in stereotactic conditions, i.e. with the apparatus in situ. The visualisation of the corpus callosum makes this integration possible. An optimal definition of cerebral tumors or target-structures for intracerebral electrode recording is thus obtained.
