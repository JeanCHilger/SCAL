Regional cerebral glucose metabolism in anorexia nervosa measured by positron emission tomography. Regional cerebral glucose metabolism was measured in five female anorectic patients, during the anorectic state and after weight gain, using the fluorodeoxyglucose method and positron emission tomography. In addition, these results were compared with those of 15 young male normals. During the anorectic state, significant caudate hypermetabolism was found bilaterally, unlike the finding in repeat measurements or in male normals. In some other brain structures (temporal cortex, lentiform nucleus, thalamus, and brainstem), significant hypermetabolism was also found during the anorectic state, but these results were not concordant for both sides and in both comparisons. There was no difference between patients after improvement and young male normals.
