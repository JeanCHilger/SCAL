A rotating double-headed positron camera. Based on a double-headed rotating uncollimated scintillation camera system, a positron imaging device was developed. After a rotating data acquisition in coincidence mode, 16 transverse section images are reconstructed by back projection. To obtain a uniform response, a limited angle reconstruction option is incorporated in this process. After correction for the system response by a three-dimensional deconvolution technique, the 16 transverse section images are stored on disk as a standard patient study for further analysis. The system can also be operated in a stationary mode. In this mode longitudinal tomographic images are obtained. Return to single photon scintigraphy is possible by remounting the collimators and by switching off the coincidence electronics.
