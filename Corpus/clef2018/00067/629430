Epizootiologic aspects of viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease in six pet bird species. Pet birds of 6 species were exposed to a psittacine isolate to viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease (VVND) virus to evaluate the impact of VVND in those species. Species examined were the budgerigar, yellow-headed Amazon parrot, canary, halfmoon conure, lesser hill mynah, and blackheaded nun. Five of the 6 species were highly susceptible to infection with VVND virus. Canaries were relatively refractory to infection with the virus. Contact birds of the same species developed infections almost as rapidly as did the birds directly exposed to nebulized VVND virus. Mortality was most marked for the conures. Less than half of the parrots exposed to nebulized virus died of VVND. Of the directly exposed budgerigars, mynahs, and nuns, 16% to 22% died during an observation period of postexposure days 0 through 28.
