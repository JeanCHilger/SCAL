Neuroradiological studies of JCV-induced astrocytomas in nonhuman primates. Astrocytomas in nonhuman primates following JC virus inoculation provides a model which can be used to evaluate diagnostic and therapeutic techniques used in humans. The CT scan appearance of astrocytomas in nonhuman primates closely resembles that seen in humans. Our studies have shown that tumors may be detected in asymptomatic monkeys. Serial scans have shown astrocytomas to grow rapidly with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. CT scanning has demonstrated the presence of tumor which was undetectable by gross examination at necropsy but confirmed by light microscopy. Studies are in progress to further define the radiological appearance of gliomas, to evaluate contrast-tagged anti-tumor antibodies as a diagnostic tool in evaluating gliomas by computerized tomography, and to evaluate metabolic parameters of actrocytomas by positron emission tomography.
