Hepatic imaging: positron emission tomography, digital angiography, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Major advances in diagnostic imaging of the human body have been made in recent years. Positron emission tomography, a technique founded on advances in radiopharmaceuticals and radionuclide imaging apparatus, permits imaging regional metabolism, metabolite distribution, and flow. Thus far, its major applications have been in the study of the brain, and to a lesser extent, the heart however, it is also finding a role in the study of the liver. Digital angiography is being applied to fluoroscopic systems which permits visualization of relatively low doses of intravascular iodinated radiographic contrast media. Imaging of the major arteries is possible using simple intravenously administered contrast media
