Real-time PET analysis of metastatic tumor cell trafficking in vivo and its relation to adhesion properties. Although a number of studies have indicated that highly metastatic cells tend to adhere more to target endothelium in vitro than low or non-metastatic cells, direct evidence about the correlation between cellular adhesiveness and organ disposition of the cells has not been obtained. Using positron emission tomography (PET), we have developed a novel technique that enables the non-invasive detection of the real-time tumor cell trafficking. The present study shows the correlation between trafficking of murine large cell lymphoma RAW117 and the adhesion properties of the cells in vitro. Cells accumulated in the liver time-dependently, and accumulation of RAW117-H10, liver metastatic subline cells, was more intense than that of RAW117-P, the parental cells, indicating that the metastatic potential is correlated with the in vivo accumulation of the cells in the target tissue. To examine whether the adhesion properties of the cell membrane determine the cell trafficking, we performed PET analysis after altering the adhesion properties on the cell membrane by means of cellular protein kinase C modulation, since the modulation of this enzyme is known to alter the surface adhesion molecules, i.e., those of the integrin superfamily. The treatment of RAW117-P with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, which caused augmentation of adhesion to hepatic sinusoidal microvessel endothelial cells (HSE) in vitro, enhanced the hepatic accumulation of the cells in vivo. On the contrary, treatment of RAW117-H10 with the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride, which reduced the adhesion activity of the cells to HSE, suppressed their accumulation in the liver, although the suppression was observed only during the first 30 min after administration of the cells. These data suggest that the adhesion properties of metastatic lymphoma cells are critical for the accumulation of these cells in the target tissue.
