Functional caudate imaging in symptomatic Huntington's disease: positron emission tomography versus single-photon emission computed tomography. Functional neuroimaging with positron emission tomography previously demonstrated reduced caudate glucose metabolism in virtually all symptomatic patients with Huntington's disease (HD). Single-photon emission computed tomography studies of brain blood flow also have shown caudate abnormalities in patients with HD. The present study compared these two functional imaging modalities in 6 patients with HD who had been symptomatic for fewer than 5 years. All patients had significantly impaired caudate-thalamus and caudate-whole-slice glucose metabolism ratios as measured by positron emission tomography. However, only 3 had clearly abnormal caudate-thalamus activity ratios and 2 had clearly abnormal caudate-whole-slice ratios on single-photon emission computed tomography. These findings indicate that single-photon emission computed tomography imaging of caudate blood flow is a less sensitive indicator of caudate dysfunction in early HD than is positron emission tomography imaging of caudate glucose metabolism.
