Quantitative SPECT imaging: a review and recommendations by the Focus Committee of the Society of Nuclear Medicine Computer and Instrumentation Council. This article is a review of the physics principles, instrumentation and reconstruction methods behind SPECT imaging. Particular attention is paid to the mechanisms that can significantly affect the accuracy of a SPECT image. We describe instrumentation advances and reconstruction methods used to correct images to improve image quality and produce quantitative images. The clinical importance of improved image quality and quantitation are also reviewed.
