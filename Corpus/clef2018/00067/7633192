Diagnosis of coronary artery disease using dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging. Dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging, using single-photon emission computed tomography, was evaluated for its safety and diagnostic efficacy in 109 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease and 35 normal subjects. The most common side effects after the intravenous administration of dipyridamole thallium-201 (0.56 mg/kg) included chest pain in 41 patients, dizziness in 20 patients, headache in 16 patients, and ST segment depression > or = 1 mm in 15 patients. Aminophylline was required to reverse the side-effects in 46 patients, and 45 of the 46 patients experienced complete relief of symptoms. Of the 109 patients with coronary artery disease, 104 had abnormal dipyridamole thallium images. The per patient sensitivity was 95%. Of the 35 normal subjects, 27 had normal thallium images. The per patient specificity was 77%. The sensitivity and specificity for the individual vessels were 84% and 87% for the left anterior descending artery, 67% and 97% for the left circumflex artery, and 89% and 85% for the right coronary artery, respectively. Dipyridamole thallium-201 imaging is a relatively safe noninvasive method and is an effective alternative to exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.
