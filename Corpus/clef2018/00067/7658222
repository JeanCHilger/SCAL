Chronic (exertional) compartment syndrome of the legs diagnosed with thallous chloride scintigraphy. Over the past 4 yr, we obtained 201Tl lower leg scans on 14 patients with suspected chronic exertional compartment syndrome. Qualitative assessment of the images revealed that 12 scans showed reversible compartment ischemia. Retrospective quantitation confirmed redistribution in seven of nine patients. Seven patients had surgery with partial or complete resolution of their symptoms.
