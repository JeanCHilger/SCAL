The use of PET in evaluating patients with primary brain tumours: is it useful? During an 18 month period 39 patients were evaluated with [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET) for primary brain tumours. These included patients with suspected newly diagnosed tumours and patients with known tumours who were being evaluated for possible recurrence or increasing tumour grade. Scans were performed on a 951-31 Siemen's PET scanner with 4 mm resolution. Scanning time was about 20 minutes per patient. All patients had undergone recent cerebral MRI. These patients were divided into two groups. In the first group (30) MRI and PET concurred on the diagnosis. The second group (nine) comprised those where the interpretation of MRI and PET was different or there was a question of the diagnosis on MRI. This group comprised three patients in whom MRI suggested recurrent tumour and PET inaccurately suggested radiation necrosis two patients with newly diagnosed enhancing lesions on MRI in whom PET was useful in distinguishing strokes from tumour
