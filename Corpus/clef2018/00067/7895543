Perfused Kupffer cell mass. Correlation with histology and severity of chronic liver disease. The perfused Kupffer cell mass determines sulfur colloid distribution by liver spleen scan (LSS) and is proportional to the perfused hepatocyte mass. This accounts for the correlation of sulfur colloid distribution with tests of hepatic function and raises the question of whether the LSS can be used as a quantitative test of hepatic function. The recent ability to precisely measure sulfur colloid distribution by single-photon-emission computerized tomography (SPECT) prompted us to evaluate the clinical value in 329 consecutive patients with adequate LSS and clinical information, of which 27 apparent normals and 220 patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) were included in this study. The liver-bone marrow index (LBI) indicated the distribution of counts between the liver and bone marrow. The liver-spleen index (LSI) indicated the distribution between liver and spleen adjusted for spleen size. The LBI and LSI correlated with each other (r = 0.753 P < 0.001). The arithmetic mean of LBI and LSI was defined as the severity score. Detailed clinical evaluation was available in these patients and included 109 who had liver biopsy. A severity score in 27 normals was 102 +/- 5 (mean +/- SD) with all values > 85. The severity score correlated with hepatic fibrosis (r = -0.694
