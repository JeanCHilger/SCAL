Endothelin release and enhanced regional myocardial ischemia induced by cold-air inhalation in patients with stable angina. This study was designed to determine the influence of cold-air inhalation on regional myocardial perfusion in patients with ischemic heart disease. A selected group of vasoactive hormones was measured to investigate their possible roles as ischemic agents. Ten men who had recently had a myocardial infarction and anginal symptoms and with verified pathologic ST deviations during a preceding exercise test volunteered to participate in this randomized cross-over study. Two identical exercise tests were performed on different days one with inhalation of cold (-22 degrees C) air and the other one with inhalation of thermoneutral air (22 degrees C). Scintigraphic imaging (single-photon emission computed tomography) of regional myocardial blood flow was performed with technetium 99m isonitrile flowtracer and a Bull's eye visual display with calculation of the scintigraphic ischemic severity score. The score was significantly higher during exercise with inhalation of cold air as compared to exercise with inhalation of thermoneutral air. Furthermore, only with cold-air inhalation did arterial plasma endothelin concentration increase significantly from rest to exercise and correlate with the change of ischemic severity score. In contrast, no change was observed under thermoneutral conditions. There was no significant difference between peak values of heart rate, systolic blood pressure, adrenaline, and noradrenaline concentrations in the two situations. We conclude that inhalation of cold air during exercise increases the degree of regional myocardial ischemia and that this is not caused by an increased myocardial oxygen demand. We suggest that cold air directly influences the vasomotor tone of the myocardial resistance vessels and that endothelin may be involved in the ischemic response.
