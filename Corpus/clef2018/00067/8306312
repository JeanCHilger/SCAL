3D simulations of radiotracer uptake in deep nuclei of human brain. The accuracy of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for measuring in vivo concentrations of radiolabelled pharmaceuticals is affected by the limited tomograph resolution. Using computer simulations, we developed a model reproducing the distribution of the tracer [18F]fluoroDOPA which is specifically taken up in the normal human striatum. Validation of the model was performed by comparing the simulated images with real PET scans of the same brain. The simulation was used to examine the effect of axial displacement of the brain relative to the PET imaging planes, and that of image contrast on signal recovery (partial volume effects).
