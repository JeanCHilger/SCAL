Partition of the human cerebellum in sensory-motor activities, learning and cognition. The circuitry of the cerebellum is quite well understood. The computation takes place in the cerebellar cortex, which functions in synchronized strips to provide excellent timing signals to the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord. The cerebellar cortex is also the site where error signals from other parts of the central nervous system are incorporated. For voluntary limb movements the cerebellar cortex is important for the timing of the innervation of the agonist and antagonist anterior horn neurons. It is also important for the temporal order of and precision in the execution of motor programs. As will be apparent, the cerebellum is not only a computer taking care of motor programs.
