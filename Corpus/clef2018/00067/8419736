Functional MRI of human brain activation at high spatial resolution. Functional activation maps of the human visual cortex were obtained at a spatial resolution almost two orders of magnitude better than achievable by positron emission tomography and within measuring times of a few seconds. Transient alterations in the concentration of paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin were conveniently detected at 2.0-T with use of RF-spoiled FLASH MRI sequences employing gradient echo times of 6 to 60 ms and voxel sizes of 2.5 to 39 microliters.
