The clinical value of MIBG myocardial spect before and after CABG--comparison with TI myocardial spect. To evaluate the clinical usefulness of MIBG scintigraphy, 25 CABG patients underwent myocardial imaging using MIBG and TI. The result of this study indicated that the sensitivity of the MIBG was equivalent to that of the stress TI in detection of ischemic lesions. In spite of successful recanalization, only 14 patients showed improvement of MIBG uptake, indicating that MIBG is not useful for detecting myocardial ischemia just after CABG. The decreased postoperative uptake of MIBG suggests that the CABG procedure may have caused denervation of the region.
