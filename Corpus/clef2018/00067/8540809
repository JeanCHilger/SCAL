Single photon emission tomography in temporal epilepsy: interictal and ictal studies with visual and semi quantitative analysis. Single photon emission tomography (SPECT) was performed in 27 patients with refractory complex partial seizures from the temporal lobes due to mesial temporal sclerosis. Independent blinded observers assessed the 28 interictal studies and 9 ictal/postictal studies. Visual analysis of interictal studies detected hypoperfusion in 22, ipsilateral to the epileptogenic zone in 19 (67%) and contralateral in 3 (10.7%). Quantified temporal lobe asymmetry, greater than a previously derived normal range, correctly identified the epileptogenic zone in 16 (61.5%) with false lateralization in 4 (15.3%). In all 9 cases in which they were performed, ictal/postictal studies showed hyperperfusion at the region of epileptic focus. In 3 patients with complex partial seizures followed by symmetric generalized tonic-clonic seizures, hyperperfusion restricted to the temporal lobe was demonstrated. In 5 of these patients the interical studies were unable to demonstrate localized changes. There were no significant correlations between SPECT findings and clinical parameters or EEG slowing in the temporal lobes.
