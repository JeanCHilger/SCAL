Additive value of thallium single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial imaging for prediction of perioperative events in clinically selected high cardiac risk patients having abdominal aortic surgery. The present study was designed to prospectively evaluate whether reinjection thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has a significant additive predictive value for occurrence of perioperative cardiac events in clinically selected patients at high cardiac risk undergoing abdominal aortic surgery. Of a group of 517 consecutive patients referred, 134 had > or = 2 of the following clinical or electrocardiographic cardiac risk variables: age > 70 years history of myocardial infarction, angina, or congestive heart failure
