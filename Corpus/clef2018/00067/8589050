Reciprocal effects of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and glucose on their metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae studied by multi-nuclear NMR spectroscopy. The effects of various concentrations of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) on the aerobic metabolism of glucose and the reciprocal effect of glucose on the metabolism of FDG in glucose-grown repressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were studied at 30 degrees C in a standard pyrophosphate medium containing 5 x 10(7) cells/ml by 1H-, 19F-, 31P-NMR and biochemical techniques. The glucose consumption rate is reduced by about 57% and 71% in the presence of 5 mM FDG and 10 mM FDG respectively. Under the same conditions, the ethanol production rate also decreases about 54% and 68%, respectively. When FDG is the unique carbon source, the alpha- and beta-anomers of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-6-phosphate (FDG6P) and a much smaller quantity of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-gluconic acid (FDGA) were observed. The quantities of alpha- and beta-FDG6P reach their maximum values within 1 h of incubation and then decrease continuously. In contrast, Glc favors the consumption of FDG and the synthesis of FDG6P and uridine-5'-diphosphate fluorodeoxy-glucose (UDP-FDG). In the presence of Glc, FDG6P reaches a plateau after 1 h or 2 h of incubation while UDP-FDG increases regularly with time. Apart from trehalose, no other disaccharide such as fluoro-dideoxy-trehalose (FDG-FDG) or fluoro-deoxy-trehalose (FDG-Glc) were observed. Thus, in contrast to UDP-Glc, UDP-DG, Glc6P and DG6P, UDP-FDG and FDG6P are not good substrates for trehalose-6-P synthetase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
