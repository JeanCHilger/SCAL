Exercise myocardial perfusion SPECT in patients without known coronary artery disease: incremental prognostic value and use in risk stratification. We evaluated the incremental prognostic value, the role in risk stratification, and the impact on patient management of myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in a population of patients without prior myocardial infarction, catheterization, or revascularization.We examined 2200 consecutive patients who at the time of their dual-isotope SPECT had not undergone catheterization, coronary artery bypass surgery, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and had no known history of previous myocardial infarction. Follow-up was performed at a mean of 566 +/- 142 days (97% complete) for hard events (cardiac death and myocardial infarction) and for referral to cardiac catheterization or revascularization within 60 days after nuclear testing. Examination of clinical, exercise, and nuclear models by use of pre-exercise tolerance test (ETT), post-ETT, and nuclear information using a stepwise Cox proportional hazards model and receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that nuclear testing added incremental prognostic value after inclusion of the most predictive clinical and exercise variables (global chi2 = 12 for clinical variables 31 for clinical + exercise variablesIn a patient population with no evidence of previous coronary artery disease at overall low risk (1.8% hard event rate), myocardial perfusion SPECT adds incremental prognostic information and risk-stratifies patients even after clinical and exercise information is known. It appears that referring physicians use this test in an appropriate manner in selecting patients to be referred to catheterization or revascularization.
