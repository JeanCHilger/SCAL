Registration and alignment of three-dimensional images: an interactive visual approach. A three-dimensional registration and alignment algorithm was developed to align single photon emission computed tomography examinations and magnetic resonance images. Operators manipulated images interactively with real-time visual feedback, with use of both internal and surface features to achieve accurate alignment. Operators aligned five brain phantom examinations (accuracy, 1.6 pixels consistency, 0.7 pixels) and eight patient brain examinations (consistency, 0.5 pixels).
