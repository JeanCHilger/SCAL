Radiation pneumonitis imaged with indium-111-pentetreotide. Early recognition of radiation pneumonitis enables adequate treatment with a reasonable chance to prevent late sequelae. The feasibility of 111In-pentetreotide in detecting this condition was explored in this study.The degree of lung uptake of 111In-pentetreotide, evaluated both visually and quantitatively by irradiated-to-nonirradiated area ratios (INIA ratio) from planar images after 24 hr, was analyzed in relation to the radiation field and compared with ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) images and chest radiographs or CT in 11 patients who had received radiotherapy to the mediastinum or to the internal mammary nodes, 10 of whom were suspected of having clinical radiation pneumonitis. Additional SPECT studies were used to map lung uptake distribution.Indium-111-pentetreotide scans were positive in nine symptomatic patients examined 2-5 mo after radiotherapy strongly or moderately positive in eight patients, one of whom was receiving steroid therapy without clinical responseIndium-111-pentetreotide can detect radiation pneumonitis and may have a role in both the differential diagnosis of patients who have complaints after radiotherapy, and when supported by quantification in the monitoring of response to steroid therapy.
