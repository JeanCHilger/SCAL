Effect of alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade on resting and hyperemic myocardial blood flow in normal humans. In the present study we aimed to assess the effect of alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade on resting and hyperemic myocardial blood flow in normal humans. Myocardial blood flow, at baseline and after dipyridamole, was measured with positron emission tomography and 15O-labeled water in 11 normal volunteers at control and during alpha 1-blockade with doxazosin. Baseline myocardial blood flow during alpha 1-blockade was not different from control, whereas coronary resistance was significantly lower (73.48 +/- 18.31 vs. 89.84 +/- 27.96 mmHg.min.ml-1.g-1 P < 0.05). After dipyridamole, myocardial blood flow during alpha 1-blockade was significantly higher (3.50 +/- 0.75 vs. 2.58 +/- 0.54 ml.min-1.g-1
