Clinical use of positron emission tomography in cerebrovascular diseases. In this article the author reviews the state-of-the-art regarding the clinical applications of positron emission tomography (PET) in cerebrovascular diseases. First, the basic methodology and physiology of cerebral blood flow and metabolism as it pertains to cerebrovascular disease are summarized. The reader is then given an account of the main findings from this technique with respect to (1) the assessment of the hemodynamic and metabolic effects of carotid artery disease in the perspective of surgical versus medical management, (2) the changes in brain perfusion and metabolism in acute ischemic stroke as they relate to the issue of patient management, outcome predictability, and screening in therapeutic trials, and (3) mapping of the remote metabolic effects of stroke and their clinical relevance.
