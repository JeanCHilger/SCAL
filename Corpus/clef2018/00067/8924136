A reassessment of Doppler pressure indices in the detection of arterial lesions in proximity penetrating injuries of extremities: a prospective study. This prospective study assessed the role of Doppler pressure indices (Ankle-Brachial Index [ABI] or Brachial Brachial Index [BBI]) in the evaluation for occult arterial injury from penetrating proximity extremity trauma (PET). A total of 258 patients with 323 PETs were evaluated by physical examination and Doppler pressure (ABI/BBI) determination. An ABI/BBI of < 0.9 was considered abnormal. The findings were compared with those of arteriography in all patients. Eleven injuries (3.4%) found on arteriography were associated with normal indices. Five of these injuries were treated by repair (4 patients) or angiographic embolization of a bleeding vessel (1 patient), all in lesions proximal to the knee or elbow joints. The other six lesions were observed without intervention. All of the 29 injuries associated with abnormal indices had positive arteriographic findings. The 4 lesions that were treated operatively were proximal and the remaining 25, all with distal penetration, were observed without observation. As compared to angiography, Doppler indices yielded the following results: 283 true-negative, 11 false-negative, 29 true-positive, and 0 false-positive, for a sensitivity of 72.5%, a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 96%. These data suggest that Doppler indices should be an integral part of the physical examination and can screen patients with proximal injuries for further studies such as duplex sonography or arteriography.
