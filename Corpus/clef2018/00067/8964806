Transport of D-glucose and 2-fluorodeoxyglucose across the blood-brain barrier in humans. The deoxyglucose method for calculation of regional cerebral glucose metabolism by PET using 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) requires knowledge of the lumped constant, which corrects for differences in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport and phosphorylation of FDG and glucose. The BBB transport rates of FDG and glucose have not previously been determined in humans. In the present study these transport rates were measured with the intravenous double-indicator method in 24 healthy subjects during normoglycemia (5.2 +/- 0.7 mM). Nine subjects were restudied during moderate hypoglycemia (3.4 +/- 0.4 mM) and five subjects were studied once during hyperglycemia (15.0 +/- 0.7 mM). The global ratio between the unidirectional clearances of FDG and glucose (K1*/K1) was similar in normoglycemia (1.48 +/- 0.22), moderate hypoglycemia (1.41 +/- 0.23), and hyperglycemia (1.44 +/- 0.20). This ratio is comparable to what has been obtained in rats. We argue that the global ratio is constant throughout the brain and may be applied for the regional determination of LC. We also determined the transport parameters of the two hexoses from brain back to blood and, assuming symmetrical transport across the BBB, we found evidence of a larger initial distribution volume of FDG in brain (0.329 +/- 0.236) as compared with that of glucose (0.162 +/- 0.098, p < 0.005). The difference can be explained by the very short experimental time, in which FDG may distribute both intra- and extracellularly, whereas glucose remains in a volume comparable to the interstitial fluid of the brain.
