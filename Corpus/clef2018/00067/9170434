Influence of chemotherapy on FDG uptake by human cancer xenografts in nude mice. This study evaluated the use of PET with 18F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) for monitoring chemotherapy effects, using a human cancer xenograft (poorly differentiated human gastric cancer) in vivo model.Tumor 18F-FDG uptakes and sizes were measured after administrating mitomycin (MMC), cisplatin (CDDP) and adriamycin (ADR) to xenograft-bearing nude mice and compared with 18F-FDG tumor uptake and tumor size in a non-therapy group. The correlation between the uptake and size was also assessed.The largest reduction in tumor size after chemotherapy occurred in the MMC administered group, followed by the CDDP case, with no reduction in the ADR group as compared to the controls. Fluorine-18-FDG tumor uptake after chemotherapy was also decreased in the MMC and CDDP groups, in that order, but not in the ADR case. With MMC and CDDP, size reduction became significant on Days 8 or 11, whereas 18F-FDG tumor uptake had already been decreased on Days 3 or 7.Fluorine-18-FDG uptake decreases in parallel to the efficacy of anticancer agents and correlates with subsequent morphologic changes. We conclude that 18F-FDG PET tumor images are indeed useful for monitoring the effects of cancer chemotherapy.
