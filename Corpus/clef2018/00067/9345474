The effect of varying stimulus rate and duration on brain activity during reading. The effect of the presentation rate and exposure duration of visually presented words on brain activity was investigated using positron emission tomography. Subjects either read aloud or silently mouthed the names of words. In regions associated with early visual analysis, activity increased with both rate and duration in regions associated with response generation, activity increased with increasing rate but was unaffected by duration
