Effects of monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibition on dopamine turnover: a PET study with 6-[18F]L-DOPA. The consequences of monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibition on the effective turnover of dopamine were investigated using 6-[18F]L-3-4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (6-[18F]L-DOPA) and positron emission tomography. The effective dopamine turnover was expressed as the ratio between the rate of reversibility of 6-[18F]L-DOPA trapping (k[loss]) and the rate of uptake of 6-[81F]L-DOPA (Ki) in the striatum of normal cynomolgus monkeys. The monkeys received 6-[18F]L-DOPA scans, untreated or after pretreatment with either the peripheral catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor nitecapone the peripheral and central catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor tolcapone
