Assessment of myocardial viability in patients with previous myocardial infarction by using single-photon emission computed tomography with a new metabolic tracer: [123I]-16-iodo-3-methylhexadecanoic acid (MIHA). Comparison with the rest-reinjection thallium-201 technique. We compared the ability of rest single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [123I]-16-iodo-3-methylhexadecanoic acid (MIHA) and the thallium-201 (Tl-201) rest-reinjection technique to detect myocardial viability after infarction.After myocardial infarction, MIHA frequently shows increased uptake in the areas with exercise Tl-201 defects (mismatch), even in patients with an irreversible Tl-201 reinjection defect. Whether such increased uptake is indicative of ischemic but viable myocardium is not known.We studied 38 patients who 1) underwent exercise SPECT Tl-201 with rest-reinjection and rest SPECT with MIHA before undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of an infarct-related coronary artery, and 2) were found to have successful revascularization at follow-up angiography. The relation between SPECT results before PTCA and subsequent improvement in left ventricular wall motion was assessed.A mismatch was evident before PTCA in 51 of 76 infarct-related segments and correlated with subsequent improvement in wall motion (overall accuracy 71%), even for the 27 segments whose exercise defects remained irreversible after Tl-201 reinjection (overall accuracy 81%). The finding of a mismatch clearly enhanced the results provided by the finding of > or = 50% Tl-201 uptake as determined at redistribution (p < 0.05), but not as determined at reinjection, although there was a trend toward a better specificity for the findings of a mismatch.MIHA is an efficient marker of viability inside exercise-underperfused areas after infarction, even in patients with irreversible Tl-201 reinjection defects. Assessment by conventional SPECT of a mismatch between results obtained with a metabolic tracer (MIHA) and a flow tracer analyzed at exercise (Tl-201) as a marker of myocardial viability is a promising area of research.
