Regional hippocampal [11C]flumazenil PET in temporal lobe epilepsy with unilateral and bilateral hippocampal sclerosis. Using statistical parametric mapping and [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) PET we have previously shown reduction of central benzodiazepine receptor (cBZR) binding restricted to the hippocampus in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy due to unilateral hippocampal sclerosis. However, bilateral hippocampal pathology can be present in up to 50% of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Additionally, the limited spatial resolution of PET results in a partial volume effect that affects quantitative analysis of cBZRs and such an effect can mask hippocampal dysfunction. We analysed changes in the [11C]FMZ volume of distribution (FMZ-Vd) before and after correction for partial volume effect in six patients with refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and a quantitative MRI diagnosis of bilateral hippocampal sclerosis, which appeared either symmetrical on MRI (bilateral symmetrical hippocampal sclerosis three patients) or bilateral but asymmetrical (asymmetrical hippocampal sclerosis
