Semi-quantitative assessment of 99Tcm-sestamibi uptake in lung cancer: relationship with clinical response to chemotherapy. The objectives of this study were to measure semi-quantitatively uptake of 99Tcm-sestamibi (99Tcm-MIBI) by tumour tissue in patients with lung cancer and to investigate its relationship with clinical response to chemotherapy. 99Tcm-MIBI single photon emission tomography was performed at the time of diagnosis in 31 patients with biopsy-proven lung cancer (19 small cell carcinomas, 12 non-small cell carcinomas), all of whom were undergoing chemotherapy. Fifteen patients were also investigated 2 weeks after the first and third cycles of chemotherapy. To quantify 99Tcm-MIBI uptake, a tumour/lung (T/L) ratio was calculated for the tomographic slices. The response to chemotherapy was rated as complete remission, partial remission or no remission using dimensional criteria. The results were expressed as the median and inter-quartile range non-parametric statistical analyses were used. Forty one neoplastic localizations (31 primary tumours and 10 hilar or mediastinal lymph node masses) were assessed. The median T/L ratio of the primary tumours was 1.85 (range 1.7-2.4). Patients with a different response to chemotherapy had a significantly different median T/L ratio before chemotherapy: complete remission (n = 8), T/L ratio = 2.95 (range 2.20-3.25)
