Influence of OSEM, elliptical orbits and background activity on SPECT 3D resolution recovery. In maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (MLEM) reconstruction of SPECT images, if both attenuation correction (AC) and detector response correction (DRC) are included, the reconstruction can be too time consuming to be clinically useful. With use of the ordered-subset expectation-maximization (OSEM) reconstruction, it has been reported that the reconstruction time can be substantially reduced. We investigated the reconstruction of point sources in a non-uniform attenuation medium in terms of the normalized FWHM of these sources. We compared MLEM versus OSEM reconstructions circular versus elliptical orbits
