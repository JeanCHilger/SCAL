Outcome of subarachnoid haemorrhage. An analysis of surgical variables, cognitive and emotional sequelae related to SPECT scanning. A group of 48 patients, consecutive apart from exclusions, from a 1-year series of 60 cases of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), was reviewed, in respect of clinical and radiological features, surgical management, clinical outcome, psychological distress and psychometric status, the neuropsychological assessment being compared with a closely-matched group of controls, the postoperative assessment being accompanied by a single positron emission computed tomogram (SPECT) scan. A review of those features which might have been expected to have a bearing on cognitive outcome (CT abnormalities at the outset, angiographic vasospasm, operative aneurysmal leakage, temporary vessel occlusion) failed to show a significant difference on cognitive tests. There was, however, a cognitive deficit shown by the patient group as a whole, when compared with the controls. Thus, SAH itself, the initial insult, would appear to be the essential factor in the production of persistent cognitive deficits.
