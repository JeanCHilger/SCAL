Perfusion-contraction mismatch during inotropic stimulation in hibernating myocardium. The aims of this study were to assess the value of dobutamine echocardiography in identifying myocardial hibernation versus stunning and to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of the contractile impairment.Twenty-one patients with isolated stenosis of the left anterior descending artery were evaluated 1 mo after thrombolysed acute anterior infarction. Regional function and blood flow were measured using echocardiography and PET at rest and during dobutamine administration (10 microg/kg/min).Defined by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, 36 of 102 dyssynergic segments were necrotic, and 66 were viable. The latter segments were subdivided according to their [13N]ammonia flow distribution: 30 hibernating regions with perfusion defects (flow of <80% of maximum) and 36 stunned areas with preserved resting perfusion (flow of > or =80% of maximum). Resting flows were similar in necrosis and hibernation (0.43 +/- 0.18 versus 0.47 +/- 0.16 ml x min(-1) x g(-1) not significant), and both resting values were lower than those seen in stunning (0.79 +/- 0.24Dobutamine improves function mainly in stunned myocardium and does not reliably identify hibernation. The lack of functional response in hibernation is not related to an exhausted vasodilating capacity.
