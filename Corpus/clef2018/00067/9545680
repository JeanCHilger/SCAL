Simplified method to quantitate regional cerebral blood flow by 123I-IMP microsphere model: validity of input counts by using the whole brain time-activity curve and one point arterial blood sampling. We developed a new microsphere method using 123I-IMP in which arterial blood is collected at one time point early after 123I-IMP injection instead of conventional continuous arterial blood sampling, and the input count is estimated using a whole brain time-activity curve until that time point. The differential curve dCb(t)/dt of the brain time-activity curve Cb(t) early after 123I-IMP injection (when the microsphere model is established) approximates the arterial time-activity curve Ca(t) as an input function. The input count as the integral value of Ca(t) at 0-5 min was estimated using the 50 min whole brain activity Cb(5 min) and the differential value dCb(5 min/dt and the 5-min octanol-extracted count of arterial samples obtained at one time point Ca(5 min). The input counts calculated by this method were very closely correlated with measurement values obtained by continuous arterial sampling. This method is more convenient and less invasive than the continuous arterial sampling method.
