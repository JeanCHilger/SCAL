A new method for reliable and efficient reconstruction of 3-dimensional images from autoradiographs of brain sections. Valuable information on metabolism and function of distinct brain regions can be extracted from autoradiographs of 2D brain sections, e.g. after labelling with the non-metabolisable sugar derivate [14C]-2-fluoro-deoxyglucose (2-FDG). For a more complete comprehension of the data and for a comparison with information obtained by modern functional imaging techniques it is essential to have a reliable and efficient method for the 3D reconstruction of autoradiographs of serial sections. This paper describes a new method for the alignment of 2D 2-FDG images, that combines two established algorithms, i.e. principal axes alignment followed by consistent matrix transformation. The power and efficiency of this new 2-step method is compared to those of various previously described procedures.
