Changes in the cerebral blood flow in postlingual cochlear implant users. Five postlingually deaf patients (age range 28-58 years) with multichannel cochlear implants were examined with single photon emission tomography (SPECT) (triple-head rotating gamma camera). Changes in the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) after intravenous administration of technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer (Tc-99m ECD) were assessed through a stimulation paradigm, consisting of: i) click stimuli (75 dB SPL) in the ear that was to be implanted, 2 weeks before surgery ii) stimulation with the same click, one month after initial fitting
