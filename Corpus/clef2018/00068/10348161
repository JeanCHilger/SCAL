Cardiac sympathetic denervation in early stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis demonstrated by 123I-MIBG-SPECT. Involvement of the autonomic cardiac nervous system in early stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was evaluated in 40 patients. I-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine-single photon emission computed tomography (MIBG-SPECT) and heart rate variability (HRV) yielded information about sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation of the heart. MIBG-SPECT is a sensitive diagnostic method for demonstration of early cardiac sympathetic denervation. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction was observed in 16 (40%) out of 40 patients. Mean cardiac MIBG uptake as demonstrated by the heart/mediastinum ratio was significantly reduced in all ALS patients in comparison with controls (P<0.01). The global MIBG-SPECT score was clearly abnormal in 29% and slightly abnormal in 22% of patients. HRV was diminished in 6 of 38 patients, 4 of whom having an abnormal MIBG-SPECT score as well. The presented results indicate that ALS patients with mild to moderate impairment may have evidence of postganglionic sympathetic adrenergic cardiac or cardiovagal denervation. To our knowledge, this is the first study indicating possible postganglionic sympathetic denervation in ALS. The original concept of ALS as an isolated degeneration of motor neurons seems to extend to a more widespread understanding of the disease which possibly represents different entities.
