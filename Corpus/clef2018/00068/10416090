Correlation of gallium-67 SPECT and CT findings in primary gynecologic lymphoma. Primary gynecologic malignant lymphomas are rare and gallium (Ga)-67 imaging has proven to be useful to differentiate viable lymphoma from fibrotic or necrotic tissue. Computed tomographic (CT) scan is often used in initial localization and staging of the lymphoma. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the findings of Ga-67 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) correlated with those of CT scan for staging initial disease and also differentiation between active lymphoma and post-treatment changes in the follow-up studies.
