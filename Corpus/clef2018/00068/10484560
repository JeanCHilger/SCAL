Effects of hyper- and hypoventilation on gastric and sublingual PCO(2). We investigated the effects of hyper- and hypoventilation on gastric (Pg(CO(2))) and sublingual (Psl(CO(2))) tissue PCO(2) before, during, and after reversal of hemorrhagic shock. Pg(CO(2)) was measured with ion-sensitive field-effect transistor sensor and Psl(CO(2)) with a CO(2) microelectrode. Under physiological conditions and during hemorrhagic shock, decreases in arterial (Pa(CO(2))) and end-tidal (PET(CO(2))) PCO(2) induced by hyperventilation produced corresponding decreases in Pg(CO(2)) and Psl(CO(2)). Hypoventilation produced corresponding increases in Pa(CO(2)), PET(CO(2)), Pg(CO(2)), and Psl(CO(2)). Accordingly, acute decreases and increases in Pa(CO(2)) and PET(CO(2)) produced statistically similar decreases and increases in Pg(CO(2)) and Psl(CO(2)). No significant changes in the tissue PCO(2)-Pa(CO(2)) gradients were observed during hemorrhagic shock in the absence or in the presence of hyper- or hypoventilation. Acute changes in Pg(CO(2)) and Psl(CO(2)) should, therefore, be interpreted in relationship with concurrent changes in Pa(CO(2)) and/or PET(CO(2)).
