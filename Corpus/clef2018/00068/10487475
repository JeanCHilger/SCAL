Interictal hyperperfusion observed in infants with cortical dysgenesis. We investigated increases of interictal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with intractable epilepsy caused by cortical dysgenesis. Using single photon emission computed tomography, we measured interictal rCBF of epileptic foci in 24 patients with cortical dysgenesis who achieved Engel Class I or II outcomes at least 1 year after surgical intervention. The patients included 14 males and ten females, ranging in age from 2 months to 34 years (mean 6 years and 5 months). In the interictal period, dysplastic areas showed hyperperfusion in four patients (17%), hypoperfusion in 15 (62%), and isoperfusion patterns in five (21%). Interictal hyperperfusion was found in four infants aged 3-4 months three with focal cortical dysplasia and one with hemimegalencephaly. Our results suggest that interictal hyperperfusion may indicate the presence of an active epileptic focus in infants with cortical dysgenesis, but not in older children or adults with the same disorder. Given the risk of misinterpreting the normal side as hypoperfused, the phenomenon of interictal hyperperfusion in the epileptogenic area should be taken into account when diagnosing pediatric epilepsy caused by cortical dysgenesis.
