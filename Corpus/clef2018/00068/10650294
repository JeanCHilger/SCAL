Accuracy of dobutamine technetium 99m sestamibi SPECT imaging for the diagnosis of single-vessel coronary artery disease: comparison with echocardiography. Recent experimental studies have shown that technetium 99m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) underestimates flow heterogeneity induced by dobutamine and that this might have an impact on the sensitivity of dobutamine MIBI in patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD). This study compares the accuracy of dobutamine MIBI single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and simultaneous echocardiography in the diagnosis of single-vessel CAD.Ninety-one patients (age 57 +/- 12 years) with single-vessel CAD or without significant CAD were studied with dobutamine (up to 40 microg/kg per minute)-atropine (up to 1 mg) stress echocardiography (DSE) and simultaneous MIBI SPECT imaging. CAD was predicted on the basis of myocardial ischemia (transient wall motion abnormalities by DSE and reversible perfusion defects by MIBI). Ischemia was detected by MIBI in 30 of the 54 patients with and in 10 of the 37 patients without significant single-vessel CAD (sensitivity 56%, confidence interval [CI] 45 to 66 specificity 73%, CI 64 to 82DSE and MIBI SPECT imaging have similar moderate sensitivity for the diagnosis of single-vessel CAD. Sensitivity of each of these techniques is higher in patients with left anterior descending than in patients with left circumflex or right coronary artery stenosis. There is no improvement of diagnostic accuracy by use of the combination of both techniques.
