Values and limitations of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography with preoperative evaluation of patients with pancreatic masses. The aim of this study was to determine the value and limitations of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-position-emission tomography (PET) for differentiating benign and malignant pancreatic disease and for staging malignant disease. One hundred fifty-nine patients with 89 malignant and 70 benign pancreatic lesions all received PET, computed tomography (CT), and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) before pancreatic surgery. The original reports were compared for all patients (group I N = 159), for a subgroup that neither had fasting plasma glucose levels > or =130 mg/dL or known elevated levels of C-reactive protein ([CRP], group II
