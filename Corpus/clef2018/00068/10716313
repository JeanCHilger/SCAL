Response to percutaneous transhepatic portal embolization: new proposed parameters by 99mTc-GSA SPECT and their usefulness in prognostic estimation after hepatectomy. Accumulation of 99mTc-galactosyl human serum albumin (GSA) in the liver correlates well with the parameters of hepatic function tests. We performed 99mTC-GSA SPECT before and after percutaneous transhepatic portal embolization (PTPE) to induce compensatory hypertrophy of the remnant lobe before extensive hepatic resection and analyzed the responses of new proposed parameters in the future remnant lobe that showed hypertrophy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of these parameters in prognostic estimation after hepatectomy.We studied 10 patients with cholangiocarcinoma and 1 patient with metastatic liver tumor from sigmoid colon cancer. 99mTc-GSA SPECT was performed immediately before and 2 wk after PTPE. We analyzed the responses of the liver uptake ratio (LUR), functional volume (FV), and liver uptake density (LUD) in the future remnant lobe and evaluated their relationship with the prognosis after subsequent hepatic resection.LUR and FV increased slightly but were not associated with the prognosis after hepatic resection. LUD increased significantly after PTPE in the group showing a good outcome after hepatic resection but decreased after PTPE in the group showing a poor outcome (post-PTPE LUD, 0.064+/-0.017%/cm3 versus 0.035+/-0.006%/ cm3, P<0.05 response rate, 22.2%+/-11.9% versus -8.9%+/-17.6%, P<0.01).Responses of LUD to PTPE before hepatic resection in the future remnant lobe represent changes in asialoglycoprotein receptor activity per hepatocyte and predict responses to subsequent hepatic resection. LUD may be an important parameter for determining the outcome after hepatic resection.
