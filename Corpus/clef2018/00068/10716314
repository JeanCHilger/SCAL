Use of 99mTc-furifosmin scintigraphy--planar and SPECT--to evaluate suggestive palpable and nonpalpable breast lesions. Our objective was to evaluate the role of 99mTc-furifosmin scintigraphy--planar and SPECT--in discriminating benign from malignant breast disease.The trial was prospective, open, and diagnostic. We recruited 30 consecutive patients with 14 palpable and 16 nonpalpable breast lesions. After receiving informed consent, we injected 555-640 MBq 99mTc-furifosmin intravenously in the arm contralateral to the breast lesion. Planar imaging and SPECT were performed. All patients underwent excision of the tumor within 2 wk. Using histology as the gold standard, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for 99mTc-furifosmin in planar and SPECT technique.For 18 malignant and 12 benign breast lesions, a sensitivity of 50% for planar imaging and 72% for SPECT was seen. Specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 83%, 82%, and 53%, respectively, for planar imaging and 50%, 68%, and 55%, respectively, for SPECT. For the 14 palpable tumors (10 malignant, 4 benign), which averaged 17+/-10 mm in size (size range, 4-45 mm), a sensitivity of 60% for planar imaging and 80% for SPECT was achieved. Sixteen lesions were not palpable (median size, 9+/-3 mm [size range, 4-13 mm]). In this subgroup, 99mTc-furifosmin scintigraphy yielded a sensitivity of 37% for planar and 62% for SPECT technique (P>0.05).99mTc-furifosmin scintigraphy is not a potent competitor to established scintigraphic procedures. In comparing this tracer with 99mTc-sestamibi and 99mTc-tetrofosmin, we cannot recommend 99mTc-furifosmin for the diagnosis of breast cancer.
