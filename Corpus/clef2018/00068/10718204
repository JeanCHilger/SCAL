Cerebral blood flow in corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy. To compare brain perfusion between corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), we investigated regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) semiquantitatively with single-photon emission computed tomography and [123I]iodoamphetamine in six patients with CBD and five with PSP. Compared with 12 age-matched control subjects, the average of the left and right rCBF values for the CBD patients was significantly reduced in the inferior prefrontal, anterior cingulate, medial premotor, sensorimotor, posterior parietal, and superior temporal cortices as well as in the basal ganglia and thalamus, whereas only the medial premotor cortex was significantly hypoperfused in the PSP patients. Compared with the PSP patients, the CBD patients showed significantly decreased rCBF in the inferior prefrontal, sensorimotor, and posterior parietal cortices, but not in the subcortical regions. Compared with the controls, interhemispheric differences of rCBF were significant in the inferior prefrontal, sensorimotor, and posterior parietal cortices of the CBD patients but in only the medial prefrontal cortex of the PSP patients. These results indicate that rCBF reductions are more extensive and asymmetric in CBD than in PSP, although the two diseases share medial frontal involvement.
