Increased cortical activation during hearing of speech in cochlear implant users. To investigate the cortical activities while listening to noise and speech in cochlear implant (CI) users, we compared cerebral blood flow in postlingually deafened CI users with that in normal hearing subjects using positron emission tomography. While noise activation in CI users did not significantly differ from that in normal subjects, hearing speech activated more cortical areas in CI users than in normal subjects. A comparison of speech activation in these two groups revealed higher activation in CI users not only in the temporal cortices but also in Broca's area and its right hemisphere homologue, the supplementary motor area and the anterior cingulate gyrus. In postlingually deafened subjects, the hearing of speech coded by CI may be accompanied by increased activation of both the temporal and frontal cortices.
