Imaging of soft-tissue tumors using L-3-[iodine-123]iodo-alpha-methyl-tyrosine single photon emission computed tomography: comparison with proliferative and mitotic activity, cellularity, and vascularity. The radiolabeled amino acid L-3-[123I]-iodo-alpha-methyltyrosine (IMT) is a new tumor tracer that accumulates in many tumors and is suitable for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Using IMT SPECT, we studied 32 patients with a soft-tissue tumor suspected to be a soft-tissue sarcoma to determine whether: (a) tumors can be visualized (b) benign and malignant lesions can be distinguished
