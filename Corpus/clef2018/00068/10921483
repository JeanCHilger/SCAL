Resting 123I-BMIPP scintigraphy for detection of organic coronary stenosis and therapeutic outcome in patients with chest pain. Resting 123I-BMIPP scintigraphy can detect coronary artery disease based on persistent abnormality of myocardial fatty acid metabolism after transient ischemia. The present study aimed to determine the value of resting 123I-BMIPP scintigraphy in diagnosing coronary artery disease and predicting the therapeutic outcome in patients with chest pain symptom.Five hospitals participated in this study, and scintigraphic and angiographic studies were performed in 104 patients without myocardial infarction. Twenty of them had non-coronary artery disease (chest pain syndrome), 26 had stable effort angina, 35 had unstable angina with organic coronary lesions, and 23 had vasospastic angina without significant organic stenosis.Overall sensitivity for diagnosing angina pectoris (stable, unstable and vasospastic) was 45%, and overall specificity for excluding non-coronary artery disease was 80%. The incidence of positive 123I-BMIPP was 54% among patients with organic coronary stenosis (50% in stable angina and 61% in unstable angina with organic stenosis), but it was low (22%) in vasospastic angina without organic stenosis. Patients with advanced coronary stenosis and multi-vessel disease were found to have a higher incidence of positive 123I-BMIPP. A positive 123I-BMIPP result was correlated with a higher rate of subsequent intervention therapy (catheter intervention or CABG) than a negative result (48% versus 27%, p = 0.03 at one month and 63% versus 35%, p = 0.008 at one year).Resting 123I-BMIPP scintigraphy was valuable in detecting advanced coronary lesions in angina patients associated with a high incidence of subsequent intervention therapy.
