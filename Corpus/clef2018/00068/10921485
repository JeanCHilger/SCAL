Relationship between striatal [123I]beta-CIT binding and four major clinical signs in Parkinson's disease. We investigated the correlation between clinical severity and striatal [123I]-CIT binding in 12 patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD: 6 men and 6 women, age: 65 +/- 7 years, Hoehn & Yahr stage: 1 to 3). The clinical severity of PD patients was measured with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) after withdrawal of antiparkinsonian medication at least 12 hours before assessment. [123I]beta-CIT binding in the caudate and putamen was measured at 3 hours [V''3 (day 1)], and at 24 hours [V''3 (day 2)) after tracer injection with small square ROIs. The specific striatal uptake index (day 2) was calculated with large square ROIs that encompassed the whole striatum. The best correlation (r = -0.82, p < 0.0012) was between putamenal V''3 (day 2) and the motor UPDRS scores. When the motor UPDRS scores were divided into four subscales, bradykinesia was the only sign that correlated significantly with putamenal V''3 (day 2) (r = -0.81, p < 0.002). [123I]beta-CIT SPECT is a useful marker of disease severity in PD with potential utility in the serial monitoring of disease progression.
