Working memory control in patients with schizophrenia: a PET study during a random number generation task. The authors' goal was to investigate brain regions involved in the deficiency of working memory control processes in patients with schizophrenia.Regional cerebral blood flow was measured with positron emission tomography in eight men with stabilized schizophrenia and eight healthy men while they were performing a graded random number generation task. Twelve scans were made for each subject. Covariations between randomness of responses and regional activation were analyzed.The pattern of covariation between randomness of responses and activation in the anterior cingulate and superior parietal regions differed between patients and healthy subjects.These results suggest a cinguloparietal dysfunction underlying the impairment of working memory control processes during a random number generation task in patients with schizophrenia.
