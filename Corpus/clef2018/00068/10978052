Noninvasive measurement of cerebral blood flow with (99m)Tc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography and 1-point venous blood sampling. The arterial and venous blood concentration of technetium 99m-labeled hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime ((99m)Tc-HMPAO) reaches an equilibration more rapidly than other CBF tracers. We hypothesized that (99m)Tc radioactivity of a venous sample at equilibrium, which is similar to that of an arterial sample, would allow estimation of the integrated input function for the clinical measurement of CBF by use of single-photon emission CT.In 53 patients with stable cerebrovascular disease, the radioactivity of a venous sample 5 minutes after injection of (99m)Tc-HMPAO was correlated with 5-minute arterial blood radioactivity and the first 5 minutes of the integrated arterial curves of the lipophilic tracer. The measured CBF values were compared with those of xenon 133.The radioactivity of 5-minute venous blood was almost equivalent to that of 5-minute arterial blood (r(2) = 0.987 y = 0.993x + 1.63This approach is fast, simple, and an alternative to continuous blood sampling in clinical quantitative (99m)Tc-HMPAO CBF studies.
