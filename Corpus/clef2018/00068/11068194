A voxel-by-voxel analysis of [18F]setoperone PET data shows no substantial serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor changes in schizophrenia. Several postmortem studies have reported regionally localized decreases in serotonin(2A) receptors (5-HT(2A)R) in schizophrenia. This was not confirmed by two recent [18F]setoperone positron emission tomography (PET) studies. In these two studies relatively large regions of interest (ROIs) were used hence, 5-HT(2A)R changes may have been missed in some brain areas. Therefore, data from one study were analyzed on a voxel-by-voxel basis using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). We also used this method to examine the relationship between 5-HT(2A)R binding potential (BP) and five PANSS-derived factors: negative, positive, activation, dysphoric and autistic preoccupation. Thirteen schizophrenic patients (10 antipsychotic-na√Øve, 3 antipsychotic-free
