Clinical investigation of inhomogeneity of washout rate in dipyridamole stress thallium scintigraphy: implication of new parameter for the indication of coronary intervention. The standard deviation of the washout rate in dipyridamole stress thallium-201 myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was correlated with the severity of coronary artery lesions and the viability of ischemic myocardium to provide a new quantitative parameter for judging indications for coronary intervention therapy.Dipyridamole stress thallium-201 SPECT was performed in 233 patients for differential diagnosis of angina pectoris during the 40 months beginning in October 1995, and 57 patients were investigated who underwent coronary angiography within 6 months of the SPECT. The washout rate standard deviation (WRSD) in 720 fractions in the bull's-eye view of the SPECT was determined. The conventional washout rate extent score (WRES) and washout rate severity score (WRSS) on the washout rate map were also determined. Based on the coronary angiography findings, patients were divided into 3 groups: zero-vessel group (zero-vessel disease, n = 20), one-vessel group (one-vessel disease, n = 18), and multivessel group (two- or three-vessel disease, n = 19). The patients were also divided into 2 other groups: Int group (n = 21), who underwent coronary intervention therapy, and Med group (n = 36), in whom intervention therapy was not indicated.All 3 parameters, WRSD, WRES and WRSS, showed significant differences between the 3 groups, and more coronary arteries affected by coronary artery stenosis were associated with higher WRSD (zero-vessel group: 5.4 +/- 1.5, one-vessel group: 7.0 +/- 3.7, multivessel group 11.4 +/- 6.7 p < 0.001), WRES (3.3 +/- 5.0, 15.5 +/- 18.1, 23.0 +/- 25.4A new quantitative parameter, WRSD > 9.0, suggests the presence of viable and curable ischemic myocardium as an indication for coronary intervention therapy.
