Is abnormal iodine-123-MIBG kinetics associated with left ventricular dysfunction in patients with diabetes mellitus? Although autonomic neuropathy is frequently recognized in patients with diabetes mellitus, it is uncertain whether cardiac sympathetic neuropathy may play a role in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.In 10 control subjects and 61 patients with diabetes mellitus who did not have coronary artery disease, cardiac sympathetic function and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were evaluated by using iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging and echocardiography, respectively. Dynamic acquisitions and planar images obtained 15 and 150 minutes after injection were used as a means of measuring early and late myocardial uptake and clearance rates of MIBG from the heart. Eight patients with an LVEF less than 50% demonstrated a lower late myocardial MIBG uptake (0.0043% +/- 0.0017% vs. 0.0024% +/- 0.0009%/pixel, P = .002) and a higher clearance rate (22.9% +/- 17.7% vs. 49.3% +/- 12.2%, P<.0001) than the 53 patients with an LVEF of 50% or greater, although the age, sex, type of diabetes mellitus, and frequency of neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy were not significantly different between the 2 subgroups. The LVEF correlated weakly but significantly with early and late myocardial uptake and clearance rate (r = 0.277, P = .03 r = 0.421, P = .001Marked MIBG abnormalities are associated with left ventricular dysfunction in patients with diabetes mellitus. However, long-term follow-up of patients with diabetes mellitus who have marked MIBG abnormalities and normal LVEF will be required to determine whether these patients would demonstrate systolic dysfunction earlier than patients without an MIBG abnormality.
