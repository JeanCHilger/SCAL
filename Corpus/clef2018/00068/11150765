8. A Spherical Coordinate System for Tumor Identification in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging. Purpose: PET can be useful in determining the progression of malignant disease over time as well as the response to therapy. To achieve this, the physician must be able to unambiguously identify and characterize individual tumors among several different scans.Methods: We have developed a spherical coordinate system for identifying individual tumor sites on PET scans, using the carina on the transmission scan as a point of origin. Using this system, each tumor is given a set of spherical coordinates that identifies its position: a rho (rho, displacement from carina), a theta (&theta, angle between the A-P axis and the tumor), and a phi (&phi
