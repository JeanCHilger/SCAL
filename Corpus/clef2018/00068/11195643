Hematologic and clinical chemistry reference values in red lories (Eos spp.). We established reference ranges for three hematologic and 15 clinical chemistry parameters of 40 clinically healthy birds of the genus Eos. The following species were included to the study: Eos histrio (n = 19), Eos squamata (n = 8), Eos bomea (n = 5), Eos reticulata (n = 4), Eos cyanogenia (n = 4). Detailed information concerning methodology, which is often missing in papers dealing with reference values, is included. As far as possible, data are compared with literature, and some thoughts on obvious deviations are given. The problem of establishing reference values in rare species is reviewed.
