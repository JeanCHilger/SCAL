CPD - education and self-assessment: functional imaging in epilepsy. Functional imaging plays a growing role in the clinical assessment and research investigation of patients with epilepsy. This article reviews the literature on functional MRI (fMRI) investigation of EEG activity, fMRI evaluation of cognitive and motor functions, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) in epilepsy. The place of these techniques in clinical evaluation and their contribution to a better neurobiological understanding of epilepsy are discussed.
