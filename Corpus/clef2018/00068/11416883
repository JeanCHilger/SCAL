Tetrahydrobiopterin increases myocardial blood flow in healthy volunteers: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a regulatory cofactor for the activity of nitric oxide synthases. Vasodilating properties of BH4 have been reported in vitro and in vivo. The influence of BH4 on myocardial blood flow (MBF), however, is largely unknown. We therefore performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the effect of intravenous BH4 on MBF in healthy volunteers.Resting MBF was assessed in 15 subjects receiving either intravenous BH4 (10 mg/kg) or placebo using positron emission tomography (PET) and [13N]ammonia. From a mean baseline MBF of 0.91 +/- 0.09 ml/min/g, MBF increased to 1.18 +/- 0.10 ml/min/g after BH4 (n = 10 p = 0.0042). In contrast, in the group receiving placebo mean MBF remained unchanged (non-significant decrease from 0.97 +/- 0.19 to 0.84 +/- 0.11 ml/min/gSystemically administered BH4 is safe and effectively increases resting MBF in healthy volunteers.
