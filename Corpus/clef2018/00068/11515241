A nonimpact article about nonimpact injury. If reports of this caliber are required to insinuate that significant "brain damage" may ensue from rather mild nonimpact injury, there is some a priori reason to believe that this is not the case. The introduction of security belts, head rests, side-impact protection, and air bags has made driving safer yet, the incidence of "brain injury" is allegedly rising. To definitely settle this issue, we will have to wait for other, preferably prospective, randomized, double-blind studies yielding a higher class of evidence. So, what do we learn from this study? First, in the United States, it is possible to select a sample of litigants that after a car accident or similar injury behaves and complains the way they did, even if there was no proof of morphological brain damage. Second, reports like this headed by a misleading title should better go unpublished until certain minimal standards of scientific scrutiny are met.
