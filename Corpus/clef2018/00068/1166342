Serologic study of toxoplasmosis in Taiwan. Toxoplasma gondii antibody titers as determined by either the indirect hemagglutination test or the methylene blue dye test were determined for a group of aborigines and for Chinese as well as for swine, cats, rats, dogs and one bovine, all resident on the island of Taiwan. None of the 194 aborigines and  only 3 (1.97%) of the 152 Chinese were found to be positive. Of 433 swine tested 132 (30.5%) were positive. Thirteen (27.7%) of 47 domestic pet cats were positive while none of 11 feral cats were positive. None of the 29 rats, 3 dogs or the one bovine were positive. Possible reasons for the lack of infection in Chinese is discussed.
