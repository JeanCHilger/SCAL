The relationship between effects and radiation doses of intra-arterial phosphorus-32 glass microspheres embolization therapy for patients with advanced liver cancer. To evaluate the relationship between effects and internal radiation of phosphorus-32 glass microspheres embolization therapy for liver cancer patients.From 1994 to 1998, 44 patients with unresectable liver cancer received intra-arterial radio-embolization therapy using (32)P-GMS. Preoperative and postoperative function and energy level of the liver were tested by liver function test and arterial blood ketone body ratio (AKBR). CT, single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT), and AFP were used to judge the effect of the therapy multivariate analysis was made.In the moderate dose group, low incidence of complication, high tumor shrinking rate and AFP decreasing rate, and long-term survival rate were observed. In the larger dose group, high incidence of liver failure, high tumor shrinking rate and AFP decreasing rate, and long-term survival rate were also observed. In the low dose group, low incidence of complication, but low tumor shrinking rate and AFP decreasing rate and long-term survival rate were not observed.The reasonable radiation doses for liver cancer patients may be about 30 Gy if liver cirrhosis is serious, the doses can be reduced.
