Tetrofosmin imaging in the detection of myocardial viability in patients with previous myocardial infarction: comparison with sestamibi and Tl-201 scintigraphy. Technetium 99m tetrofosmin has been introduced as a myocardial perfusion agent, providing similar results to those of thallium 201 and sestamibi in the identification of patients with coronary artery disease. No data are available comparing tetrofosmin and sestamibi imaging in the identification of reversible left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in the same patients. This study compared the results of tetrofosmin, thallium, and sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography at rest in detection of myocardial viability in patients with previous myocardial infarction.Seventeen patients with previous myocardial infarction who were undergoing coronary revascularization were studied. Echocardiography was performed at baseline and 3 months after revascularization to evaluate recovery of LV function. The optimal threshold cutoffs to separate reversible from irreversible dysfunction, as determined by receiver operating characteristic analysis, were 55% of peak activity for both tetrofosmin and sestamibi and 60% for thallium. In all asynergic segments (n = 77) analyzed, tetrofosmin uptake correlated with both sestamibi (r = 0.90, P <.0001) and thallium (r = 0.85, P <.0001) activity. The sensitivity and specificity for reversible dysfunction were, respectively, 70% and 70% for tetrofosmin, 70% and 66% for sestamibi, and 60% and 68% for thallium imaging (all P = not significant). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves constructed for tetrofosmin, thallium, and sestamibi activity were 0.74 +/- 0.06 (mean +/- SD), 0.75 +/- 0.06, and 0.74 +/- 0.06, respectively (all P = not significant). Concordance for detecting myocardial viability between tetrofosmin and thallium imaging was found in 67 regions (87%) (kappa = 0.74), and concordance between tetrofosmin and sestamibi imaging was found in 69 regions (90%) (kappa = 0.79).The diagnostic performance of quantitative rest tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography in predicting functional recovery after revascularization is comparable to that of both thallium and sestamibi scintigraphy in patients with myocardial infarction and chronic LV dysfunction.
