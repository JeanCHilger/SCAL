Neuroradiologic findings in focal cortical dysplasia: histologic correlation with surgically resected specimens. We investigated the neuroradiologic characteristics of focal findings of surgically resected specimens obtained from 47 patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD).Forty cases were detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and two cases were detected only by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), but five cases could not be detected before operation.MRI revealed abnormal gyri and sulci in 34 patients (pachygyric in 18, polymicrogyric in 10, both in six), and blurring of the gray matter-white matter junction in 29 (72%) patients. Signal abnormalities were found in 36 (90%) patients, in the gray matter in 32, with white matter in 30, and at the gray matter-white matter junction in 13. Moreover, peculiar patterns of abnormal signals in the white matter were recognized, including remarkably abnormal subcortical signals of T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity adjacent to the dysplastic cortex in 15 cases, high radiated T2 signals extending from the ependymal surface of the lateral ventricle to the overlying cortex in 11 cases, and widespread abnormal signals in the white matter with gray matter involvement in four cases. Histologically, these abnormal signals corresponded to various degrees of dyslamination and morphologic abnormalities of neurons and glial cells in the gray matter, and to dysmyelination, ectopic clustering of dysplastic neurons, glial proliferation, and necrotic change in the white matter. Regional cerebral blood flow SPECT showed interictal hypoperfusion in 29 (62%) of the 47 patients, interictal hyperperfusion in two, and ictal hyperperfusion in 28 of the 34 patients associated with FCD. [123I]iomazenil SPECT demonstrating the distribution of central benzodiazepine receptors showed low accumulations localized spatially corresponding to the epileptogenic foci associated with FCD in seven of eight patients.These results demonstrate that neuroimaging reflects various structural and functional changes closely related to epileptogenesis in FCD.
