Sex chromosome anomalies in pancreatic endocrine tumors. We have investigated the status of sex chromosomes in 40 pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) using 2 complementary techniques: microsatellite and interphase FISH analysis. Twenty-five tumors were from female and 15 from male patients and included 31 nonfunctioning and 9 functioning PET (6 insulinomas, 2 glucagonomas and 1 VIPoma). Microsatellite and FISH analysis showed concordant results in all cases. PETs from females showed frequent loss of chromosome X (40%) whereas PETs from males showed relatively frequent loss of chromosome Y (36%) but never loss of the X chromosome. Statistical analysis showed significant association of sex chromosome loss with metastases (Spearman correlation test, r = 0.5, p < 0.001), local invasion (r = 0.33, p < 0.05) and high proliferation rate measured as Ki-67 index with a 5% cut-off (r = 0.42, p < 0.02). The analysis also showed that local invasion and metastases were highly correlated (r = 0.86). Multivariate survival analysis was therefore carried out including local invasion and loss of sex chromosomes. The presence of local invasion increased the risk of death almost 9 times whereas sex chromosome loss was an independent variable associated with a shorter survival period and an increased risk of death of approximately 4-fold.
