Indications and results of liver transplantation in patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Metastases from neuroendocrine (NE) tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, carcinoids, and endocrine pancreatic tumors (EPTs) can be confined to the liver for long periods and may exhibit slow growth. When considering liver transplantation (LTx) for patients with NE tumors, the expected results with conventional treatment must be weighed against the risk of LTx and immunosuppression. The following indications for LTx may be considered for patients with metastatic NE tumors limited to the liver: (1) tumors not accessible to curative surgery or major tumor reduction (2) tumors not responding to medical or interventional treatment
