Measurement of ventricular volumes and function: a comparison of gated PET and cardiovascular magnetic resonance. The aim of this study was to compare cardiac volume and function assessment using PET with the reference technique of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR).Left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume (SV), and ejection fractions (EF) were measured in 9 patients using both CMR and PET with inhaled C(15)O.Correlation between the techniques was generally reasonable (r values ranged from 0.63 to 0.99). Best agreement was seen for ESV (LV and RV). With PET, there was a tendency to underestimate LV EF and EDV, and RV EDV and SV. Agreement was worst for LV SV. Percentage difference between CMR and PET measurements ranged from -2% to 15% Bland-Altman limits of agreement ranged from 24% to 75%.Although small systematic differences exist, the agreement between PET and CMR suggests useful information regarding function, and volumes may be obtained from a standard PET protocol.
