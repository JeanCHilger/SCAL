Different striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy in alcohol dependent patients with or without physical withdrawal symptoms --a study using IBZM-SPECT. Ten male patients with type I alcohol dependency fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependency were investigated twice using IBZM-SPECT after alcohol withdrawal (day 2 and day 28 after withdrawal). Five patients had a history of physical withdrawal symptoms, 5 patients had no such history. The group with physical withdrawal symptoms showed higher IBZM binding in both scans indicating differences of dopaminergic neurotransmission in different subtypes of alcohol dependency.
