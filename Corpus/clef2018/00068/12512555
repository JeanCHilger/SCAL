Toxoplasma gondii infection of cats in epizootiological and clinical aspects. A total of 200 cats from a south-western region of Poland were tested for antibodies to T. gondii. 105 (52.5%) examined cats were seropositive for T. gondii. Positive results were found in 16 (50%) out of 30 homeless cats, 33 (55%) out of 60 cats kept in shelters, and 56 (51.85%) out of 108 pet cats visiting outpatients clinics. 70 of pet cats stayed indoor and never left house, the others (38 cats) lived at house, but frequently abided outdoor. The seroprevalence in the last group was higher than in cats kept indoor, in shelters or homeless cats, however the differences were not statistically significant. Among the cats kept exclusively indoor the statistically significant difference in seropositivity was noted between the cats fed raw meat (69.23%) and the ones eating only commercial feed or cooked meat (19.35%), chi2 = 17.24, P < 001. Males were more frequently infected than females, but the differences were not statistically significant. In cats over 5 years old the percentage of positive results was significantly higher than in the younger ones. The ranges of antibody titres measured by LAT (latex agglutination test) were in agreement with ranges estimated by IFAT (indirect fluorescent antibody test). The LAT titres over 1980 IU/ml and IF IgG titres over 1:4000 were found only in cats, in which clinical toxoplasmosis was confirmed.
