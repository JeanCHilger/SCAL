Studies on prenatal infections in children with unknown cause of mental retardation and examination of their mothers. Specific IgG antibodies against Toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex (TORCH agents) were investigated in 32 infants and children with unexplained mental retardation (MR) and their mothers. 16 mentally normal infants and children of the same age group and their mothers were chosen as controls. Specific Toxoplasma IgG antibodies were 43.75% for MR cases and 37.5% for their mothers. Six (18.75%) mothers gave history of eating raw meat and canned food, while 8 (25%) had pet cats. 56.25% of the MR cases, and 81.25% of their mothers were positive to specific rubella IgG antibodies. 75% of MR cases and 81.25% of their mothers were positive for CMV specific IgG antibodies. Also, 18.75% of the MR cases and 25% of their mothers showed positivity to herpes simplex specific IgG antibodies. 93.75% showed positivity to one or more of the mentioned pathogenic agents.
