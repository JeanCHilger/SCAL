Structure-activity relationships of dimethindene derivatives as new M2-selective muscarinic receptor antagonists. A series of 2,3-disubstituted indenes, which are analogues of the widely used histamine H(1) receptor antagonist dimethindene, have been synthesized and studied as muscarinic and histamine receptor antagonists. The affinities of these compounds for the five human muscarinic receptor subtypes (M(1)-M(5)) and for human histamine H(1) receptors were determined in radioligand binding studies using membranes from transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and [(3)H]N-methylscopolamine ([(3)H]NMS). The results demonstrate that the diisopropyl analogue 19 has a similar high affinity as (S)-dimethindene at M(2) receptors ((S)-dimethindene: pK(i) = 7.52 (-)-19: pK(i) = 7.37) with an improved selectivity pattern ((S)-dimethindene: M(2)/M(1) = 6-fold, M(2)/M(3) = 5-fold, M(2)/M(4) = 10-fold, M(2)/M(5) = 25-fold
