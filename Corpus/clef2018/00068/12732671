An intrapatient comparison of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC with 111In-DTPA-octreotide for diagnosis of somatostatin receptor-expressing tumors. The aim of this study was to compare the imaging abilities of the recently developed somatostatin analog, (99m)Tc-hydrazinonicotinyl-Tyr(3)-octreotide ((99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC [(99m)Tc-TOC]), with (111)In-diethylenediaminepentaacetic acid-D-Phe(1)-octreotide ((111)In-OCT [Octreoscan]) in patients undergoing routine somatostatin receptor (SSTR) scintigraphy.Forty-one patients (20 men, 21 women age range, 29-75 y(111)In-OCT and (99m)Tc-TOC showed an equivalent scan result in 32 patients (78%), 9 cases showed discrepancies (22%), false-negative results with (111)In-OCT were seen in 6 cases (14.6%), whereas (99m)Tc-TOC was false-positive in 2 cases (4.9%). (111)In-OCT was true-negative in both cases. The false-positive findings of the (99m)Tc-TOC studies were caused by nonspecific uptake in the bowel. In 1 case, (99m)Tc-TOC correctly identified a metastasis in the lumbar spine but both scan results were false-positive because of an inflammatory process. In 21 patients with SSTR-expressing tumors, the semiquantitative region-of-interest analysis showed that (99m)Tc-TOC achieved higher tumor-to-normal tissue ratios than (111)In-OCT.This study revealed a higher sensitivity of (99m)Tc-TOC as compared with (111)In-OCT as an imaging agent for the localization of SSTR-expressing tumors. To avoid false-positive findings with (99m)Tc-OCT due to nonspecific tracer accumulation, additional scanning at 1-2 h after injection should be done.
