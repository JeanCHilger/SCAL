Imaging techniques for diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Cardiac imaging, specifically echocardiography, has greatly enhanced the ability of clinicians to effectively diagnose and manage IE. Echocardiograms should generally be obtained in all patients suspected of having IE, both to establish the diagnosis and to identify complicated cardiac involvement that may warrant surgical intervention. Transesophageal imaging is more sensitive and specific than the transthoracic approach and currently represents the optimal approach to echocardiographic imaging. Manifestations of endocardial involvement include vegetations, abscesses, aneurysms, fistulae, leaflet perforations, and valvular dehiscence. The roles of other imaging modalities including CT, MRI, and nuclear imaging have yet to be fully established.
