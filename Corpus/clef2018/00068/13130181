Improvement of cerebral blood flow by olprinone, a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, in mild heart failure. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is reduced in heart failure (HF). For the treatment of acute HF, a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, olprinone (OL), yields an increase in myocardial contractility and a decrease in arterial afterload. During a 15-min intravenous infusion of OL (0.2 microg/kg/min), regional CBF at 6 sites of each cerebral cortex was examined using technetium-99m-ethylcysteinate dimer brain SPECT in 18 HF patients and 7 age-matched normal subjects. The baseline CBF was significantly reduced in HF (43.0 +/- 3.9 ml/min/100 g) compared to that in normal subjects (48.0 +/- 4.6 ml/min/100 g, p < 0.01). The baseline CBF showed a significant negative correlation with the increase in CBF during the OL infusion in HF (r = -0.38, p < 0.01) and normal subjects (r = -0.65, p < 0.01). The percent increase in CBF was significantly greater in HF (13.7%) than in normal subjects (9.8%, p < 0.046). In patients with HF, the CBF of the cerebral cortex was decreased, but was increased by OL infusion.
