67Ga-9N3 uptake by xenografts of human melanotic melanoma in mice. Tumour uptake of the inert, neutral complex 67Ga-9N3 and the tumour:blood concentration ratio (1,4,7,triazacyclononane-1,4,7, triacetic acid) were measured in mice bearing xenografts of the human melanotic melanoma HX118. Between 1 and 4 h after the injection the tumour:blood ratio increased from 3.5 to 21 and the concentration of 67Ga-9N3 in the tumour decreased from 0.43 to 0.13% g-1. During the first 24 h the concentration of 67Ga-9N3 in the tumour exceeded that in all other tissues except the liver and kidneys. The tumour:blood ratio and tissue distribution of 67Ga-9N3 at 4 h were compared with those of four other complexes. The results indicated that of the five complexes 67Ga-9N3 would be the most suitable for tumour imaging at early times after administration. Imaging would not be restricted to gamma emitting 67Ga as there is also the possibility of using the 9N3 ligand to bind 111In for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), 68Ga for positron emission tomography (PET) or even stable Ga for direct in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) detection.
