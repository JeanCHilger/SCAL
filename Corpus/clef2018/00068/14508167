Procedure guidelines for radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging. Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is an established and non-invasive imaging technique with diagnostic and prognostic efficacy in the investigation of coronary artery disease. It is the only widely available test for assessing myocardial perfusion directly but there are variations in the way it is performed in different centres. Harmonization of practice, at least at a national level, is therefore essential, and clinical governance now makes it mandatory for practice to be based upon evidence whenever possible [ 1]. This is best achieved by expert analysis of the evidence and to this end the British Nuclear Cardiology Society (BNCS) in association with the British Cardiac Society (BCS) and the British Nuclear Medicine Society (BNMS) have developed procedure guidelines for tomographic myocardial perfusion imaging. A systematic literature search was performed and every effort was made to conform with the AGREE recommendations [ 2]. All recommendations are therefore based on either evidence from clinical studies, previous published guidelines or expert consensus of the writing and advisory groups. The guidelines cover the clinical indications of MPI, the methods used for stress testing, the radiopharmaceuticals and the injected activities and also issues related to acquisition, processing and interpretation of images. They do not cover the benefits or drawbacks of the technique in specific circumstances neither do they address its cost effectiveness in clinical diagnosis and management nor its potential impact on clinical outcomes. The guidelines aim to assist medical practitioners and other health care professionals in recommending, performing, interpreting and reporting single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of myocardial perfusion.
