Assessment of cardiac function and left ventricular regional wall motion by 99mTc multigated cardiac blood-pool emission computed tomography. Forty-three patients underwent the analysis of left and right ventricular (LV and RV) volumes, and LV regional wall motion by multigated cardiac blood pool single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc. To calculate the cardiac volume correctly, the optimal cutoff level in relation to background level was first obtained by a phantom study. Left ventricular end-diastolic, end-systolic volume (EDV and ESV) and ejection fraction (EF) calculated thus with SPECT were correlated well with the data obtained with left ventriculography (LVG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially using horizontal long axial image. RV stroke volume (SV) without shunt or valvular diseases was also correlated well with that of LV when it was calculated using horizontal long axial image. However, SV ratio (LVSV/RVSV) was not necessarily ideal numerical 1. In addition LV wall motion was evaluated by multicontour systolic display and phase analysis in SPECT and gated planar images. The results obtained with SPECT were better correlated with those of LVG than gated planar images. It is concluded that multigated cardiac blood pool SPECT is a clinically useful method for an evaluation of cardiac function and left ventricular regional wall motion.
