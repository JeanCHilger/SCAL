Phase 2 clinical study of 99mTc-ECD--a multicenter study. A phase 2 clinical study of a newly developed brain perfusion agent, 99mTc-ECD, was performed in 166 cases of cerebrovascular diseases and impairment of brain function to evaluate effectiveness, usefulness, optimum dose and optimum timing of imaging as a multi-center study involving 10 institutions in Japan. All cases were judged as no problems on safety and any side effects due to the administration of the compound were not observed. Out of 163 cases evaluated for the clinical usefulness, valuable information for clinical diagnosis was obtained in 160 cases (98.3%), and 154 cases (94.5%) were judged as "extremely useful" or "useful". Although SPECT imaging was possible from 5 min after injection, images obtained between 60 and 90 min after injection showed relatively better image quality in many cases. Regarding standard administration dose, 400 to 800 MBq were considered to be appropriate. 99mTc-ECD is considered to be a promising radiopharmaceutical as a brain perfusion agent.
