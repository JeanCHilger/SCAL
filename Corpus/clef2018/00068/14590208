Quantitative PET scan findings in carbon monoxide poisoning: deficits seen in a matched pair. Quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) was utilized to establish the degree and localization of central nervous system dysfunction in 2 adult patients 3 years status postchronic carbon monoxide poisoning. The individual PET scans were compared against a composite scan made up of 32 normals using a z transformation statistical parametric map. Neuropsychological findings indicated marked anterior frontal lobe syndrome in the context of far-above-average intelligence, memory, and language. They also showed manifest frontal symptoms in activities of daily living that resulted in vocational disability in each case. PET analysis revealed substantially decreased metabolism in the orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as in areas of the temporal lobe for each individual. Individual scans were very similar and consistent with patient's presenting symptoms, and changed life circumstances. This report represents the first quantitative functional neuroimaging study relevant to carbon monoxide poisoning.
