Potential use of DPCPX as probe for in vivo localization of brain A1 adenosine receptors. The suitability of (3H)DPCPX (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine), a xanthine derivative, as an vivo probe for labelling adenosine A1 receptors was studied in rats. [3H]DPCPX (nM) penetrated largely into the brain (0.8% of the injected dose per gram of brain tissue 5 min after injection). Brain concentrations stayed at a plateau level from 5 to 15 min after the injection. The distribution in the different brain regions was heterogeneous with the highest amount of [3H]DPCPX in cerebellum and hippocampus and the lowest concentrations in hypothalamus and brain stem. Displacement (45-70% of total radioactivity) was obtained by the injection of 250 nM of cold DPCPX or cyclopentylxanthine, an analog of DPCPX. The ex vivo autoradiographic distribution of [3H]DPCPX was similar to the in vitro autoradiographic distribution of tritiated A1 adenosine receptor ligand as [3H]CHA. These results suggest the potential use of DPCPX for further in vivo investigation of A1 adenosine receptors with techniques such as positron emission tomography.
