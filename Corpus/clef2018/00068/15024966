Positron emission tomography in central nervous system drug discovery and development. Genetics, neuroscience, and imaging science have advanced greatly in the last few years. These advances can be brought together and applied in creative new ways to make available better drugs for treating neuropsychiatric disorders and for getting candidate drugs through the development process faster. One particular approach, built around [18F]fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, is described.
