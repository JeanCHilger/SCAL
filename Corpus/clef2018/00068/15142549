11C]Choline as a PET biomarker for assessment of prostate cancer tumor model. [(11)C]Choline has been evaluated as a positron emission tomography (PET) biomarker for assessment of established human prostate cancer tumor models. [(11)C]Choline was prepared by the reaction of [(11)C]methyl triflate with 2-dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) and isolated and purified by solid-phase extraction (SPE) method in 60-85% yield based on [(11)C]CO(2), 15-20 min overall synthesis time from end of bombardment (EOB), 95-99% radiochemical purity and specific activity >0.8 Ci/micromol at end of synthesis (EOS). The biodistribution of [(11)C]choline was determined at 30 min post iv injection in prostate cancer tumor models C4-2, PC-3, CWR22rv, and LNCaP tumor-bearing athymic mice. The results showed the accumulation of [(11)C]choline in these tumors was 1.0% dose/g in C4-2 mouse, 0.4% dose/g in PC-3 mice, 3.2% dose/g in CWR22rv mice, and 1.4% dose/g in LNCaP mice the ratios of tumor/muscle (T/M) and tumor/blood (T/B) were 2.3 (T/M, C4-2), 1.4 (T/M, PC-3), 2.5 (T/M, CWR22rv), 1.2 (T/M, LNCaP) and 2.6 (T/B, C4-2), 2.6 (T/B, PC-3), 7.8 (T/B, CWR22rv), 3.2 (T/B, LNCaP), respectively. The micro-PET imaging of [(11)C]choline in prostate cancer tumor models was acquired from a C4-2, PC-3, CWR22rv, or LNCaP implanted mouse at 30 min post iv injection of 1 mCi of the tracer using a dedicated high resolution (<3 mm full-width at half-maximum) small FOV (field-of-view) PET imaging system, IndyPET-II scanner, developed in our laboratory, which showed the accumulation of [(11)C]choline in C4-2, PC-3, CWR22rv, or LNCaP tumor implanted in a nude athymic mouse. The initial dynamic micro-PET imaging data indicated the average T/M ratios were approximately 3.0 (C4-2), 2.1 (PC-3), 3.5 (CWR22rv), and 3.3 (LNCaP), respectively, which showed the tumor accumulation of [(11)C]choline in all four tumor models is high. These results suggest that there are significant differences in [(11)C]choline accumulation between these different tumor types, and these differences might offer some useful measure of tumor biological process.
