Potential of [11C]TMSX for the evaluation of adenosine A2A receptors in the skeletal muscle by positron emission tomography. We examined the potential of [7-methyl-11C]-(E)-8-(3,4,5-trimethoxystyryl)-1,3,7-trimethylxanthine ([11C]TMSX) for the assessment of adenosine A2A receptors in muscle. In rodents, specific binding of [11C]TMSX was observed in muscle and heart by blockade with A2A-selective CSC and non-selective theophylline, but not with A1-selective DPCPX. Swimming exercise fluctuated radioligand-receptor binding in these tissues. In a PET study of two subjects, theophylline-infusion slightly deceased the distribution volume of [11C]TMSX in the heart (20% reduction) and muscle (10% reduction), which suggested the specific binding.
