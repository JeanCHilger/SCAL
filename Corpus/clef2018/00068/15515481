Urinary fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose excretion with and without intravenous application of furosemide. Twenty patients suffering from malignancy received furosemide, twenty patients were examined by FDG-PET without diuretics. Urine volume and radioactivity were measured before and after acquisition. Bladder activity was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively.Radioactivity in the bladder was lower and the image quality higher in the furosemide group. SUV values showed a median of 3.0 in the furosemide and 6.0 in the control group. With furosemide, a larger excreted volume was seen compared to the control group. The furosemide group showed a significantly higher ratio of excreted/ injected radioactivity early after injection. However, the totally excreted radioactivity was not significantly different (p = 0.93).Diuretics cause a higher urine volume with a diluted FDG concentration leading to an improved image quality. Furosemide accelerates early renal FDG elimination, reducing radiation exposure.
