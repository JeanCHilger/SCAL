Persistent foreign body reaction around inguinal mesh prostheses: a potential pitfall of FDG PET. FDG PET has been recognized as an efficient imaging technique for the treatment of oncology patients. However, false-positive results can occur. The purpose of this study is to describe three oncology patients with persistent FDG up-take around inguinal mesh prostheses that occurred up to 10 years after the surgical repair of inguinal hernias and led to false-positive results.Remote mesh prostheses can induce FDG uptake because of persistent foreign body reaction. Consequently, each time an unexpected pelvic focus is noticed on FDG PET, the medical history of patients should be carefully reviewed to avoid false-positive results.
