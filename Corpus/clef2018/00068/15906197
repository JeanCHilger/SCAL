Functional imaging in drug discovery and development. The use of in vivo imaging with radioisotope- and magnetic resonance-based methods is increasing for all stages of drug development. The primary role for these methods has, and continues to be, clinical diagnosis, although the technology itself is highly versatile and can be adapted to very different applications. Techniques may be developed to measure the drug target, tissue-specific drug disposition and action, and to pursue basic investigations of the pathophysiology of disease. The sensitivity, spatial resolution, temporal resolution and frequency of measurement with radioisotope and magnetic resonance imaging are significantly different. Whether the application is related to the drug target, action or disease response, must first be considered before selecting which functional imaging approach can be used.
