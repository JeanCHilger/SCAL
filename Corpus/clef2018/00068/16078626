Positron emission tomography in the diagnosis of recurrent growth of brain tumors. The authors analyzed the results of 11C-methionine positron emission tomography (PET) in 101 patients with suspected recurrent brain tumor. The diagnosis was confirmed in 72 patients. The increased 11C-methionine uptake in the initial tumor area is considered to be a crucial PET evidence of a recurrent tumor. On the other hand, brain tissue histological changes associated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy were characterized by the low uptake of the tracer. The sensitivity and specificity of PET scanning in detecting tumor recurrence were found to be 95.8 and 96.5%, respectively. 11C-methionine PET is proposed as a reliable technique for early differentiating between a recurrent brain tumor and treatment-induced nonneoplastic changes.
