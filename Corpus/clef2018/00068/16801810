New technologies applied to stress echocardiography: myocardial contrast echocardiography. The development of new echocardiographic contrast agents that can be injected intravenously and can opacify left-sided cardiac chambers has offered a contribution in the field of stress-echocardiography for two main reasons: (1) the improvement of visualization of the endocardial border and thus facilitating recognition of wall motion abnormalities during pharmacological stress or physical exercise and (2) the obtaining of information on myocardial perfusion during stress examinations. This review will consider: (1) the improvement of diagnostic accuracy during pharmacological stress or physical exercise obtained with the administration of echo-contrast agents
