Novel spiro-configured PET chromophores incorporating 4,5-diazafluorene moiety as an electron acceptor. [reaction: see text] We have synthesized novel spiro-bridged chromophores incorporating a 4,5-diazafluorene unit as the electron acceptor (A) and aryl amino groups as donor (D) moieties. The orthogonal D-A configuration limits ground-state D-A interactions but allows efficient PET reactions. The PET efficiency was modulated by the electronic characteristics of the donor and by the D-A distance. Preliminary studies showed that the PET process can be manipulated through metal ion complexation of the 4,5-diazafluorene moiety.
