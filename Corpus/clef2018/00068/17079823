On-axis sensitivity and resolution of a slit-slat collimator. A slit-slat collimator combines a slit along the axis of rotation with a set of axial septa, offering both magnification in the transaxial direction and complete sampling with just a circular orbit. This collimator has a sensitivity that increases for points near the aperture slit. The literature treats this collimator as having the same sensitivity as a single-pinhole collimator, ignoring the effect of the axial septa. Herein, the sensitivity and resolution of this collimator are reevaluated.Experimental and Monte Carlo methods are used to determine the sensitivity and resolution in both the transaxial and axial directions as a function of distance from the slit (h). Eight configurations are tested, varying the slit width, septal spacing, and septal height.Both the experimental and the Monte Carlo sensitivities agree reasonably with an analytic form that is the geometric mean of the pinhole and parallel-beam formulas, disagreeing with previous literature. Transaxial resolution is consistent with the pinhole-resolution formula. Axial resolution is consistent with the parallel-beam resolution formula.The sensitivity of this collimator is proportional to h(-1) and has resolution in the transaxial direction that is consistent with pinhole resolution and in the axial direction that is consistent with parallel-beam resolution.
