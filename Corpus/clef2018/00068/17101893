Assessing whole brain perfusion changes in patients with REM sleep behavior disorder. To investigate the regional cerebral perfusion in patients with idiopathic REM behavior disorder (RBD) in order to establish the topography of networks involved.We performed cerebral blood flow evaluation using (99m)Tc-Ethylene Cysteinate Dimer (ECD) SPECT on eight patients with polysomnographically confirmed RBD and nine age-matched controls. Comparisons were made using SPM2.We found increased perfusion in the pons and putamen bilaterally and in the right hippocampus. In addition, we observed a decreased perfusion in frontal (Brodmann area [BA] 4, 6, 10, 43, 44, 47 bilaterally and left BA 9, 46) and temporo-parietal (BA 13, 22, 43 bilaterally and left BA 7, 19, 20, 21, 39, 40, 41, 42) cortices.Perfusional abnormalities in patients with REM behavior disorder were located in the brainstem, striatum, and cortex. These abnormalities are consistent with the anatomic metabolic profile of Parkinson disease.
