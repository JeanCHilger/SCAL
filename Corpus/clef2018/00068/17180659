Integrated PET/CT as a first-line re-staging modality in patients with suspected recurrence of ovarian cancer. The aims of this study were to compare CT with PET/CT results in patients with suspected ovarian cancer recurrence and to assess the impact of the PET/CT findings on their clinical management.Thirty-two consecutive patients with suspected ovarian cancer recurrence were retrospectively included in the study. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT and PET/CT with [(18)F]FDG, in addition to conventional follow-up, were performed in all 32 patients. After the comparison between CT and PET/CT results, based on clinical reports, changes in the clinical management of patients (intermodality changes) due to PET/CT information were analysed.Twenty of the 32 patients were positive at CT (62.5%) versus 29 (90.6%) at PET/CT. Intermodality changes in management, i.e. use of a different treatment modality, after PET/CT examination were indicated in 14/32 (44%) patients. In particular, before PET/CT study, the planned management was as follows: wait-and-see in 7/32 (22%), further instrumental examinations in 4/32 (12%), chemotherapy in 10/32 (31%), diagnostic surgical treatment in 6/32 (19%) and surgical treatment in the remaining 5/32 (16%). After PET/CT study, wait-and-see was indicated in 1/32 (3%), further instrumental examinations in 7/32 (22%), chemotherapy in 16/32 (50%), diagnostic surgical treatment in 2/32 (6%) and surgical treatment in the remaining 6/32 (19%).Integrated PET/CT could detect tumour relapse in a higher percentage of patients than could CT. A change in the clinical management was observed in 44% of cases when PET/CT information was added to conventional follow-up findings.
