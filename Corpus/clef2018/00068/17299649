Improved non-invasive T-Staging in non-small cell lung cancer by integrated 18F-FDG PET/CT. In this prospective study, reliability of integrated (18)F-FDG PET/CT for staging of NSCLC was evaluated and compared to MDCT or PET alone.240 patients (pts) with suspected NSCLC were examined using PET/CT. Of those patients 112 underwent surgery comprising 80 patients with NSCLC (T1 n = 26, T2 n = 37, T3 n = 11, T4 n = 6). Imaging modalities were evaluated independently.MDCT, PET and PET/CT diagnosed the correct T-stage in 40/80 pts (50% CI: 0.39-0.61), 40/80 pts (50%Integrated PET/CT was significantly more accurate for T-staging of NSCLC compared to MDCT or PET alone. The advantages of PET/CT are especially pronounced combining T1- and T2-stage as well as in advanced tumors.
