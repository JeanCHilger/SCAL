The value of radioimmunoscintigraphy compared to computed tomography in the diagnosis and relapse diagnosis of colorectal tumors. Radioimmunoscintigraphy (= RIS, scintigraphic "specific" imaging of benign and malignant diseases by means of radioactively marked monoclonal antibodies) has been performed in Germany in clinical studies since 1985 in patients suffering from colorectal cancer. After having been successfully proven in primary studies, RIS is now being used in the early diagnosis of recurrences and metastases. In the prospective study presented here the clinical usefulness of RIS was assessed in comparison against well-tried diagnostic methods including computed tomography in patients suffering from colorectal cancer. It was shown that RIS in SPECT technique (= single photon emission computed tomography) with 99mTc-labelled monoclonal CEA antibodies can visualise local recurrences if diagnostic findings are doubtful, with a sensitivity of 78% versus 50% for CT findings.
