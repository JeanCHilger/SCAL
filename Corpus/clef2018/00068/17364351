Clinical impact of positron emission tomography (PET) with (18F)fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in head and neck tumours. PET plays an important role in staging, on suspicion of recurrence and for detection of occult primary tumours in the head and neck.Since 1998 we have used positron emission tomography (PET) with (18F)fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to assess selected patients. This procedure has often helped in making decisions on staging and treatment.The case records of the first 80 patients (104 PET examinations) were studied retrospectively.A total of 39 examinations were performed for staging. PET detected all primary tumours except two (stage T1), and staging was adjusted after 13%. In all, 33 PET examinations were performed on suspicion of recurrent tumour. In 52% of these PET determined further treatments in 21% PET had a direct impact on the surgical planning. In 18 patients with metastases from an occult primary tumour, PET detected 39% of those tumours
