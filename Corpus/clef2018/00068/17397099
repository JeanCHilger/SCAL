Effects of smoking marijuana on focal attention and brain blood flow. Using an attention task to control cognitive state, we previously found that smoking marijuana changes regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). The present study measured rCBF during tasks requiring attention to left and right ears in different conditions. Twelve occasional marijuana users (mean age 23.5 years) were imaged with PET using [15O]water after smoking marijuana or placebo cigarettes as they performed a reaction time (RT) baseline task, and a dichotic listening task with attend-right- and attend-left-ear instructions. Smoking marijuana, but not placebo, resulted in increased normalized rCBF in orbital frontal cortex, anterior cingulate, temporal pole, insula, and cerebellum. RCBF was reduced in visual and auditory cortices. These changes occurred in all three tasks and replicated our earlier studies. They appear to reflect the direct effects of marijuana on the brain. Smoking marijuana lowered rCBF in auditory cortices compared to placebo but did not alter the normal pattern of attention-related rCBF asymmetry (i.e., greater rCBF in the temporal lobe contralateral to the direction of attention) that was also observed after placebo. These data indicate that marijuana has dramatic direct effects on rCBF, but causes relatively little change in the normal pattern of task-related rCBF on this auditory focused attention task.
