Neuropsychiatric bases of the methylphenidate-therapy of the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). High prevalence and high co-morbidity rates with frequently aggravating psychosocial problems make the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) of children, adolescents and adults an important target for research and healthcare. Recent findings suggest a dopaminergic fronto-striatal information processing deficit in ADHD-patients (executive functions). This review summarizes and presents, in the context of recent studies (MRI, f-MRI, PET, SPECT, Mapping Genes) the neurobiochemical bases of the methylphenidate-therapy, clinically successfully applied since almost one half century by the ADHD. The increased striatal dopamine transporter density by the ADHD-methylphenidate-responder is reported as a scientifically sound and useful clinical working model.
