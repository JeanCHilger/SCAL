Management of adnexal mass. To assess diagnostic strategies for distinguishing benign from malignant adnexal masses.MEDLINE(R) and reference lists of recent reviews discharge data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample.The major diagnostic methods evaluated were bimanual pelvic examination, ultrasound (morphology and Doppler velocimetry), MRI, CT, FDG-PET, CA-125, and scoring systems that incorporated multiple clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings. Meta-analysis using a random-effects model was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity for discriminating benign from malignant. We reviewed evidence for followup strategies for masses considered benign, and for adverse outcomes of diagnostic surgery. We also reviewed published models of the natural history of ovarian cancer and compared the impact of assumptions about natural history on outcomes.The majority of studies did not describe whether patients presented with asymptomatic masses detected through screening or with symptoms. Prevalence of malignant masses in a U.S. postmenopausal screening population was approximately 0.1 percent, while benign masses were found in 0.8 to 1.8 percent of women. Pooled (a) sensitivity and (b) specificity were: bimanual exam (a) 0.45, (b) 0.90 ultrasound morphology scores (a) 0.86 to 0.91, (b) 0.68 to 0.83All diagnostic modalities showed trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, but the available literature does not provide sufficient detail on relevant characteristics of study populations to allow confident estimation of the results of alternative diagnostic strategies. Although modeling studies may prove useful in evaluating diagnostic algorithms, further work is needed to explore the implications of uncertainty about the natural history of ovarian cancer.
