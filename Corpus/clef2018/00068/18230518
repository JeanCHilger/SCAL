Characterization of the modulation transfer function of discrete filtered backprojection. A mathematical expression for the modulation transfer function (MTF) of image reconstruction by discrete filtered backprojection (DFBP) is derived. A simulation study is used to investigate the dependence of the MTF of DFBP on: (1) the number of projection views (2) the type of ramp filter used
