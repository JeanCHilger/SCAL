Globus pallidus stimulation reduces frontal hyperactivity in tardive dystonia. Tardive dystonia (TD) is a disabling disorder induced by neuroleptics. Internal globus pallidus (GPi) stimulation can dramatically improve TD. The present positron emission tomography and H(2)(15)O study aimed to characterize the abnormalities of brain activation of TD and the impact of GPi stimulation on these abnormalities in five TD patients treated with GPi stimulation and eight controls. Changes of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were determined: (i) at rest (ii) when moving a joystick with the right hand in three freely chosen directions in on and off bilateral GPi stimulation. A significant increase of rCBF was found in TD patients in off-stimulation condition compared to controls: (1) during motor execution in the prefrontal, premotor lateral, and anterior cingulate cortex
