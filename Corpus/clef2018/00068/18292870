PET (positron emission tomography) imaging of biomolecules using metal-DOTA complexes: a new collaborative challenge by chemists, biologists, and physicians for future diagnostics and exploration of in vivo dynamics. Recently, PET has been paid a great deal of attention as a non-invasive imaging method. In this review, the recent advances of PET using biomolecules, such as peptides, monoclonal antibodies, proteins, oligonucleotides, and glycoproteins will be described. So far, PET of biomolecules has been mainly used for diagnosis of cancers. The biomolecules have been conjugated with the DOTA ligand, labeled with radiometals as the beta+ emitter, and targeted to specific tumors, where they have enabled visualization of even small metastatic lesions, due to the high sensitivity of the PET scanners. Some of the biomolecules have been used not only for PET diagnosis, but also for radiotherapeutic treatments by simply changing the radiometals to beta(-) emitters. Collaborative work between chemists, biologists, and physicians will be important for the future of biomolecule-based targeting and diagnosis.
