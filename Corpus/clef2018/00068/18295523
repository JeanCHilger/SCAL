Combatting cancer in the third millennium--the contribution of medical physics. In this invited opening Plenary Lecture at the 1st European Conference on Medical Physics, I indicated some of the roles of medical physics, and specifically medical radiation therapy physics, in the development of improved cancer care for the third millennium. It is said that you are only asked to predict the future if you are seriously old and/or will not be around long enough to know if you were correct. Hopefully, however, I will be able to contribute to this field for many years to come and many of my suggestions will be enacted. "Crystal ball gazing" is, however, a very unscientific process. Scientists are trained to study and analyse situations, report their findings and stop at that. "Future gazing" is not predicting the short-term developments it is about being bold, radical and stating what today is impossible or almost unthinkable. So-called "scientific prophets" can be entertaining (which I also hope I was in this lecture) but at worst look egocentric and possibly ridiculous. I seem to have survived three previous requests to make scientific predictions [Webb S. The future of photon external-beam radiotherapy: the dream and the reality. Physica Medica 2001
