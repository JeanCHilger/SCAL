The impact of 18F-FDG PET/CT on assessment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma at diagnosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of whole-body (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT alters staging and management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) when compared with current staging practice. 52 patients with Stage III-IV NPC without distant metastases on chest X-ray/CT, abdominal ultrasound or bone scan were recruited for the study. Whole-body (18)F-FDG PET/CT and MRI of the head and neck were performed. The scans were compared for extent of the primary tumour (PT), cervical nodal metastases (CNM) and distant metastases (DM). Any discordance in results was assessed with respect to staging and impact on management. MRI and (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans were discordant in 28 (54%) patients. There was discordance in the extent of PT at 28 sites in all sites, MRI showed more extensive tumour involving the nasopharynx (n = 8), skull base (n = 14), brain (n = 4) and orbit (n = 2). There was also variation among the extent of CNM in four nodes of the retropharyngeal region, with the nodes being positive on MRI. (18)F-FDG PET /CT did not identify any additional distant metastases but did identify a second primary tumour in the colon. The additional use of (18)F-FDG PET/CT did not "up-stage" the overall stage or change management in any patient. In conclusion, there is discordance between MRI and (18)F-FDG PET/CT, and the additional use of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for the current assessment of NPC at diagnosis does not appear to be justified in this cohort of patients.
