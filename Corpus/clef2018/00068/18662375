Cervical lymphadenopathy - an unusual presentation of carcinoma of the cervix: a case report. The clinical presentation of carcinoma of the cervix as cervical lymphadenopathy has not been described before. We report a case of this unusual manifestation of cervical cancer.A 51-year-old woman presented to our Head and Neck department with cervical lymphadenopathy. A positron emission tomography scan revealed the primary tumour to be in the cervix and a cervical biopsy confirmed carcinoma of the cervix.Recurrences of carcinoma of the cervix presenting as lymphadenopathy have been described before but this is the first time a clinical presentation of carcinoma of the cervix as cervical lymphadenopathy has been described. Although metastasis from the cervix to the cervical lymph nodes is rare, this can be explained by outlining the drainage of the lymphatic system from the cervix.
