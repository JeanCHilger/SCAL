Radioiodination of 1-(2-deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-2,4-difluoro-5-iodobenzene (dRFIB), a putative thymidine mimic nucleoside for cell proliferation studies. Iodine-124 was produced via the (124)Te(p,n)(124)I reaction by 15 MeV proton irradiation of an in-house solid mass tellurium dioxide target, using the TÃ¼bingen PETtrace (General Electric Medical Systems) cyclotron. 1-(2-Deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-2,4-difluoro-5-iodobenzene (dRFIB), a stable, non-polar thymidine mimic nucleoside, was synthesized in 5 steps following a literature method, for radioiodination with [(124)I] iodide via isotope exchange in the presence of copper sulphate and ammonium sulphate in methanol-water. The radiolabelling procedure was optimized with respect to temperature, amount of dRFIB, amount of sodium hydroxide and reaction time, to produce radiochemical yields of up to 85% with a 1-h reaction at 140 degrees C. With routine I-124 production of 30 MBq/run, relatively high specific activities, approaching 100 MBq/mmol, can be expected. The activation energy for dRFIB radioiodination was calculated from temperature-time RCY data to be approximately 100 kJ/mol using no-carrier-added [(124)I]iodide.
