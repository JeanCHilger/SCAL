An in vivo multimodal imaging study using MRI and PET of stem cell transplantation after myocardial infarction in rats. The purpose of the study is to track iron-oxide nanoparticle-labelled adult rat bone marrow-derived stem cells (IO-rBMSCs) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and determine their effect in host cardiac tissue using 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D: -glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET).Infarcted rats were randomised to receive (1) live IO-rBMSCs by direct local injection, or (2) dead IO-rBMSCs as controls (3) sham-operated rats received live IO-rBMSCs. The rats were then imaged from 2 days to 6 weeks post-cell implantation using both MRI at 9.4T and FDG-PET.Implanted IO-rBMSCs were visible in the heart by MRI for the duration of the study. Histological analysis confirmed that the implanted IO-rBMSCs were present for up to 6 weeks post-implantation. At 1 week post-IO-rBMSC transplantation, PET studies demonstrated an increase in FDG uptake in infarcted regions implanted with live IO-rBMSC compared to controls.Noninvasive multimodality imaging allowed us to visualise IO-rBMSCs and establish their affect on cardiac function in a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI).
