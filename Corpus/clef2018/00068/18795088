Echocardiographic and cardiac single photon emission computed tomography predictors of left ventricle reverse remodeling after surgical revascularization in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and left ventricle systolic dysfunction. The extent of scar or viable hypocontractile myocardial tissue determines postinfarction left ventricle remodeling. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the revascularization effect in a group of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and LV systolic dysfunction indicated for surgical revascularization, based on evidence for multivessel disease on coronarography and viable myocardium (CMR, SPECT).To evaluate the revascularization effect in patients with ischemic LV systolic dysfunction and to find preoperative predictors of revascularization effect.33 patients (64+/-11 years) with baseline LVEF 34.9+/-9.3 % were included in the study. After a follow-up of 10.7+/-1.2 months, ECHO and SPECT were performed again. The whole group of patients was divided according to revascularization effect (postoperative increase LVEF > 5 % and postoperative decrease LVESV > 5 % compared with baseline) into revascularization responders (R, n = 22) and nonresponders (NR, n = 11).At baseline there was no difference between the subgroups in LVEF (R = 35.7+/-11.0 % vs. NR = 34.3+/-8.2 %), EDV (R = 183.6+/-43.2 vs. NR = 180.2+/-80.5 ml), ESV (R = 118.5+/-40.4 vs. NR = 119.7+/-55.2 ml). The responders showed in a revascularization effect subanalysis differences in the values of LVEF (+9.8+/-8.1 %, p < 0.009), reduction of EDV (-39.9+/-50.9 ml, p = 0.05) and ESV (-35.4+/-42.6 ml, p = 0,002) compared with baseline. The only preoperative parameters predicting LV reverse remodeling were the T(E-Em) (R = -10.6+/-44.1 vs. NR = 29.7+/-43.7 ms, p = 0.037) and the size of fixed perfusion defect (FPD) (R = 11.9+/-13.5 vs. NR = 22.9+/-15.3 % of LV, p = 0.044).Patients with ischemic LV systolic dysfunction with a preoperatively determined myocardial viability develop LV reverse remodeling. The only preoperative parameters predicting LV reverse remodeling were echocardiographic T(E-Em) and FPD on SPECT.
