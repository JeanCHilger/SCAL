Positron emission tomography for neurologists. This short review focuses on practical, present day, clinical application of FDG PET, a technology available to practicing neurologists for managing their patients. Indications in the disease states of dementia, neuro-oncology, epilepsy, parkinsonism, and other less common settings are reviewed. Many third-party payers currently make reimbursements based on these indications. By measuring an aspect of brain function, PET provides information that often is unobtainable from other sources, thus facilitating more rationale and cost-effective management, which can only benefit the patient, the referring physician, and the health care system as a whole.
