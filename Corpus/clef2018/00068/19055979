Neuroimaging in neuro-oncology. Neuroimaging is now entering a more mature era, whereby we can ask sophisticated questions concerning the biologic behavior of brain tumors. Multimodality imaging (CT, MRI, PET) offers the most precise information noninvasively on tumor type and grade, guides therapeutic choices, and assesses the effects of therapy. The incorporation of functional MRI (such as diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, proton MR spectroscopy, and perfusion-weighted imaging) has allowed neuro-oncologists a window of opportunity to assess the biologic behavior of brain neoplasms. These new multimodality approaches will be routinely used preoperatively, intraoperatively, and eventually, therapeutically.
