Evaluation of CdZnTe as neutron detector around medical accelerators. The operation of electron linear accelerators (LINACs) and cyclotrons can produce a mixed gamma-neutron field composed of energetic neutrons coming directly from the source and scattered lower energy neutrons. The thermal neutron detection properties of a non-moderated coplanar-grid CdZnTe (CZT) gamma-ray detector close to an 18 MV electron LINAC and an 18 MeV proton cyclotron producing the radioisotope (18)F for positron emission tomography are investigated. The two accelerators are operated at conditions producing similar thermal neutron fluence rates of the order of 10(4) cm(-2) s(-1) at the measurement locations. The counting efficiency of the CZT detector using the prompt 558 keV photopeak following (113)Cd thermal neutron capture is evaluated and a good neutron detection performance is found at the two installations.
