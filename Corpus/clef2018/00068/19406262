Prevalence of coronary heart disease in patients with aortic aneurysm and/or peripheral artery disease. Although the presence of coronary heart disease (CHD) was the major determinant of perioperative mortality and long-term prognosis in patients with aortic aneurysm (AA) and peripheral artery disease (PAD), the prevalence and severity of CHD in patients with individual vascular diseases was unknown. Adenosine triphosphate-loading myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography therefore was performed in 788 patients with vascular diseases of the aorta and peripheral arteries, with AA in 500, PAD localized in the lower-limb arteries in 183, and combined AA and PAD in 105. Patients with known CHD, such as those with previous myocardial infarction or revascularization procedures, were excluded. Myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography was analyzed using a 20-segment model, and summed stress scores and summed difference scores were calculated. Stress-induced myocardial ischemia was defined as a summed difference score >or=2. The presence of myocardial ischemia was highest in patients with combined PAD and AA (73%), followed by PAD (55% p = 0.005), and the lowest in patients with AA (37%
