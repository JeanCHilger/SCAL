Development and physicochemical characterization of copper complexes-loaded PLGA nanoparticles. PLGA nanoparticles were prepared via a modified W/O/W emulsion solvent diffusion process, in which all formulation components were fully biocompatible and biodegradable. Different independent processing parameters were systematically studied. Nanoparticles were characterized by DLS (particle size, polydispersity, zeta-potential) and TEM/AFM (surface morphology). An optimized formulation was used to encapsulate copper complexes of cyclen and DOTA as potential PET imaging agents. Results showed that the predominant formulation factors appeared to be the lactide-to-glycolide (L:G) ratio of PLGA, the nature of the diffusion phase, and the presence of hydroxyl ions in the first-emulsion aqueous phase. By regulating those 3 parameters, PLGA nanoparticles were prepared with very good preparation yields (>95%), a size less than 200 nm and a polydispersity index less than 0.1. TEM pictures showed nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution, a spherical shape and a smooth surface. The optimized formulation allowed to encapsulate Cu-cyclen and Cu-DOTA complexes with an encapsulation efficiency between 20% and 25%.
