Polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene modulates brain and physiological responses to acute stress in Japanese men. A short (S) variant, compared to a long (L) variant, of the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5HTTLPR) has been related to emotional hyper-reactivity. We tested whether the 5HTTLPR could modulate acute stress responses in the brain and, the cardiovascular and neuroendocrine systems. Ten Japanese male participants carrying double copies of the S alleles and 10 Japanese males carrying S and L alleles conducted a mental arithmetic task, and their regional cerebral blood flow by (15)O positron emission tomography and cardiovascular and neuroendocrine parameters were measured. During the acute stress task, the participants with the SS alleles showed stronger reactivity in blood pressure and secretion of epinephrine, compared to the participants with the SL and LL alleles. Furthermore, the SS carriers showed greater activation in stress-related brain regions such as the hypothalamus, cerebellum, midbrain, and pulvinar compared to the SL and LL carriers during the acute stress task. The present findings indicated that the S allele of the 5HTTLPR is associated with greater brain and physiological reactivity to acute stress in Japanese men.
