Managing non-paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: clinical characteristics in 25 German patients. In about 40% of patients LEMS is not a paraneoplastic phenomenon (NT-LEMS). Several clinical aspects important to these patients remain open, especially the question when a LEMS can definitely be diagnosed as NT-LEMS. Here we describe a series of 25 German NT-LEMS patients regarding their clinical characteristics, duration of symptoms, value of serological markers, paraneoplastic antibodies and FDG-PET/CT. Furthermore, we discuss the current diagnostic criteria of NT-LEMS.
