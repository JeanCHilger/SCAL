Serially heterotransplanted human prostate tumours as an experimental model. * Introduction * Serially heterotransplanted human tumours in immunosuppressed mice: similarity to the tumour of origin - Cytological and histological analysis - Karyotype - Marker expression - Other PC markers - Tumour cell proliferation and frequency of mitosis - Vasculature - Stromal compartment - Heterotransplant hormone dependency - Androgen dependent - Partially androgen dependent - Androgen independent - Metastases * Conclusions Preclinical research on prostate cancer (PC) therapies uses several models to represent the human disease accurately. A common model uses patient prostate tumour biopsies to develop a cell line by serially passaging and subsequent implantation, in immunodeficient mice. An alternative model is direct implantation of patient prostate tumour biopsies into immunodeficient mice, followed by serial passage in vivo. The purpose of this review is to compile data from the more than 30 years of human PC serial heterotransplantation research. Serially heterotransplanted tumours are characterized by evaluating the histopathology of the resulting heterotransplants, including cellular differentiation, karyotype, marker expression, hormone sensitivity, cellular proliferation, metastatic potential and stromal and vascular components. These data are compared with the initial patient tumour specimen and, depending on available information, the patient's clinical outcome was compared with the heterotransplanted tumour. The heterotansplant model is a more accurate preclinical model than older generation serially passaged or genetic models to investigate current and newly developed androgen-deprivation agents, antitumour compounds, anti-angiogenic drugs and positron emission tomography radiotracers, as well as new therapeutic regimens for the treatment of PC.
