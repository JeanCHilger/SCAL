Detection and prediction of local recurrence of maxillary sinus cancer using F-18 FDG PET/CT. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of F-18 FDG PET/CT in the detection and prediction of local recurrence of maxillary sinus cancer.Retrospectively, we analyzed F-18 FDG PET/CT images of maxillary sinus cancer patients for the surveillance after treatment. Twenty-two consecutive patients with maxillary sinus cancer, who underwent maxillectomy followed by adjuvant radiation treatment, were included in the study. F-18 FDG PET/CT images were analyzed visually and quantitatively.The median age of the patients included in the current study population was 54.5 years (range, 35-78). Seven patients (29.1%) had local recurrent diseases. Recurrent diseases show statistically significant higher values in SUV(max) (recurrent: 5.09 +/- 3.3, non-recurrent 3.05 +/- 0.7, p < 0.05), L/NL (recurrent: 2.95 +/- 0.9, non-recurrentThe visual assessment of F-18 FDG uptake pattern was potential predictor for local recurrence of maxillary sinus cancer. However, the diagnostic performances were similar between visual assessment and quantitative indices. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and improve statistical accuracy.
