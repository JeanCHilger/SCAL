Diagnostic accuracy of contrast echocardiography during adenosine stress for detection of abnormal myocardial perfusion: a prospective comparison with technetium-99 m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography. Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) utilizes compressible microbubbles behaving similarly to red blood cells. Destruction of microbubbles and observation of the gradual refill into the myocardium are key to evaluating perfusion using real-time MCE. We aimed to assess the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of qualitative MCE utilizing a 17-segment model for localization of myocardial perfusion abnormalities compared with simultaneous technetium-99 m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). From July 2005 through August 2007, 97 patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease underwent simultaneous SPECT and realtime MCE during adenosine stress. Qualitative MCE and tracer uptake were analyzed visually using a 17-segment model in a blinded manner. Diagnostic accuracy and 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined. Myocardial contrast echocardiography was completed in 91 patients (age, mean [SD], 69.3 [10.9] years body mass index, 30.0 [6.3]
