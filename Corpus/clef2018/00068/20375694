Mid-term effect of stem cells combined with transmyocardial degradable stent on swine model of acute myocardial infarction. We aimed to confirm the mid-term results of the new method combined with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation and transmyocardial drilling revascularization (TMDR) with degradable stent incorporated with basic fibroblast growth factor and heparin.The miniswine underwent acute myocardial infarction by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Transmyocardial channels with 3.5 mm diameter (TMDR) were made by mechanical drilling in the infarction territory and basic fibroblast growth factor stents were implanted into the channels. Animals were randomly divided into the following four groups (n=6 in each): control II: MSCs implantationLeft ventricular ejection fraction and myocardial perfusion were significantly improved in group IV than that in other groups (P<0.05). Compared with other groups, vessel density was augmented and cell apoptosis was reduced in group IV (P<0.01). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results showed that the expression levels of von Willebrand factor, transforming growth factor-beta3, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interleukin-1beta were much higher in group IV than that in other groups (P<0.05).Three months after operation, MSCs transplantation combined with TMDR and degradable stent significantly improved cardiac function, enhanced neovascular density, reduced infarcted size, improved ventricular remodeling, and reduced cardiac myocyte apoptosis, and therefore provides strong information for clinical trial.
