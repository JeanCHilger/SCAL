Improved 3D correction for partial volume effects in brain SPECT. An improved method for correction of partial volume effects (PVE) in brain SPECT is proposed. It is fully three-dimensional, does not require particular patient positioning, and works with scans only partially covering the brain. The location of functionally inactive brain regions (primarily cerebrospinal fluid) is extracted from high-resolution MRI. An automatic 3D registration algorithm then determines the geometric transformation between MRI and SPECT. Correction consists of: 1) counting the volumetric active/inactive ratio in each volume element of the functional scan using the measured SPECT point spread function 2) correcting the functional measures according to these ratios
