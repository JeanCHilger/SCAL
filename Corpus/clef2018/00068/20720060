Molecular imaging of the dopamine transporter. The dopamine transporter (DAT) is a transmembrane protein responsible for reuptake of dopamine from the synaptic cleft and termination of dopaminergic transmission. Several radioligands are available for DAT imaging with SPECT and PET. This review summarizes the main SPECT and PET radioligands and the main applications of DAT imaging in neuropsychiatric disorders.
