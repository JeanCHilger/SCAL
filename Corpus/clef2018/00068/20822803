Hybrid imaging by SPECT/CT for sentinel lymph node detection in patients with cancer of the uterine cervix. Conventional lymphoscintigraphy provides planar images with little spatial information on location of pelvic sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). SPECT has better spatial resolution and, in combination with anatomic accuracy provided by CT improves SLN preoperative localization. The aim of the study was to report on the results of hybrid imaging of SLN in early cervical cancer patients treated at Claudius Regaud Cancer Center.Stages IA-IB1 cervical cancer patients undergoing preoperative SPECT/CT for SLN detection were analysed.Forty-one patients were included. A 100% SLN detection rate was achieved when a combined technique (radiotracer and blue dye) was used. At least one SLN was clearly visualized by SPECT/CT in 39 of 41 patients (95%) and full anatomic concordance with intraoperative anatomical location of SLN was found in 37 of the 39 patients with at least one SLN identified by SPECT/CT (95%). Location of removed SLN included the external and internal iliac area in 88% patients, the common iliac area in 10.5%, and the inframesenteric para-aortic area in 1.5%. No SLN was found in the infrarenal para-aortic region. Lymph node involvement was identified in 5 patients (12.1%). SLN correctly predicted lymph node involvement in all node-positive patients. However, SPECT/CT failed to identify 1 of the 5 metastatic SLN.SPECT/CT accurately detected preoperative SLN topography and enhanced diagnostic sensitivity of SLN imaging, improving surgical approach to patients with cervical cancer staging. Diagnostic quality of anatomic landmarks of CT images of SPECT/CT could be further improved by the use of contrast injected CT.
