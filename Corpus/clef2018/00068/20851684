Combined PET/MRI: one step further in multimodality imaging. Given the need for sophisticated in vivo detection techniques to better characterize the cellular and subcellular processes in animals and humans, molecular imaging has become an important discipline. Techniques in molecular imaging have developed from stand alone modalities to multimodality methods. Among these, the combination of positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) is a successful imaging method and has become an important tool in clinical practice. Technological approaches that combine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffuse optical tomography (DOT), fluorescence tomography (FT) and PET have now been introduced. PET/MRI and the resulting combination of molecular, morphological and functional information will pave the way for a better understanding of physiological and disease mechanisms in preclinical and clinical settings.
