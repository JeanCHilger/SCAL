Successful removal of intrathyroidal parathyroid adenoma diagnosed and accurately located preoperatively by parathyroid scintigraphy (SPECT-CT). We describe the case of a large intrathyroidal parathyroid adenoma in a 46-year-old woman who had a history of recently diagnosed hypercalcaemia and a 2-year history of an asymptomatic enlargement of the right lobe of the thyroid. This rare case highlights the potential difficulties that can arise in the evaluation of hyperparathyroidism, especially in cases of multinodular goiter. In some cases, including this one, even a thorough preoperative evaluation that includes radiological studies (ultrasonography and computed tomography [CT]) may not allow for a definitive preoperative diagnosis due to limited sensitivity, especially in multinodular goiter. The overlapping histological features between thyroid and parathyroid lesions can also be problematic at the time of the intraoperative frozen-section evaluation. We present a case in which, with parathyroid scintigraphy and combination of structural and functional imaging (SPECT-CT), we could accurately locate the intrathyroidal parathyroid adenoma in a patient with multinodular goiter.
