Management of perineal ectopic testes. Perineal ectopic testis (PET) is a rare congenital anomaly in which the testis is abnormally situated between the penoscrotal raphe and the genitofemoral fold.we report six patients treated for PET. The epidemiological, clinical, radiological and therapeutic aspects of this rare entity are discussed in light of data of the literature.Between 2000 and 2009, six patients (0, 2%) treated for PET were diagnosed among 2156 patients operated upon for undescended testes in unity of paediatric surgery in Tunis children's hospital. The mean age was 21+/- 25 months. The abnormality was associated with an inguinal hernia in two cases. The diagnosis was based on the presence of an empty scrotum or perineal swelling. In all, orchidopexy in a dartos pouch was easily performed through an inguinal skin crease incision.The length of the testicular vessels and vas deferens was adequate with a favourable course in every case. Although the complications of undescended testes are the same as for PET, the timing of surgery should be different.It is generally accepted that children must not be below 6 months of age for surgical correction of undescended testes, but there is no need to delay surgery in PET, which can easily be diagnosed by physical examination in the neonatal period. Surgery is indicated even if there is no hernia present. The functional prognosis, always difficult to define, appears to be identical to that of other sites.
