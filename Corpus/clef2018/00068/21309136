 Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1, 70 amino acids) is secreted by the liver and target tissues in response to growth hormone stimulation (1). IGF-1 plays an important role in cell growth and development. IGF-1 binds to IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) with ~1,000-fold higher affinity than to insulin receptor. IGF-1R is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor and is also highly expressed in many human cancers (2). IGF-1R plays an important role in tumor proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis (3, 4). Triple negative breast tumors are negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and
