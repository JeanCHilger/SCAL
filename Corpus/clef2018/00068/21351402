Contribution to diagnostics of vascular prosthesis infections. Vascular prosthesis infection is a life-threatening complication in 0.5-5% of cases. Early and reliable diagnosis is a necessity for adequate treatment. Computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard diagnostic method used world-wide with excellent results, but in cases of advanced graft infection. Low grade infections in non-acute patients are a diagnostic challenge requiring a new method with good diagnostic accuracy. The authors describe diagnostic accuracy of currently available methods.
