18F-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine as a tracer of nucleic acid metabolism in brain tumors. The value of 18F-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (18F-FUdR) as a tracer for nucleic acid metabolism was studied using an experimental rat brain-tumor model. The 18F activity in the tumor tissue 45 minutes after intravenous injection of 18F-FUdR was about 12 times higher than that in the contralateral cortex. Double-labeled autoradiography with 18F-FUdR and 14C-thymidine revealed similar brain-tumor images. In contrast, an autoradiographic comparison of 18F-FUdR with 14C-aminoisobutyric acid, which reveals the impairment of the blood-brain barrier, showed very different images. Also, the 18F radioactivity in the tumor tissue was at a constant level for 30 to 120 minutes, whereas a notable increase in 18F activity with time was observed in nucleotides and acid-insoluble fractions. These results suggest that the distribution pattern of 18F-FUdR closely correlates with the metabolism of nucleic acid and that this drug could be a useful tracer for positron emission tomography.
