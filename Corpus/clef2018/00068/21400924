Review of images in children with septo-optic dysplasia based on MRI and SPECT. We reviewed MRI and SPECT images in 10 patients with septo-optic dysplasia (SOD). MRI was performed in all of them. Six of them had bilateral optic nerve atrophy and abnormality of midline brain structures (e. g., septum pellucidum, corpus callosum). Four cases had one-sided optic nerve atrophy. They have ipsilateral or bilateral cortical dysplasia. It may suggest that one of the pathogenesis of SOD is a disruption of the anterior cerebral artery at embryonic site. SPECT was performed in 3 patients with cortical dysplasia. At cortical dysplasia area, CBF-SPECT and IMZ-SPECT showed the same RI count as the normal cortex. This finding is compatible with the fact that few patients with SOD have epileptic seizures.
