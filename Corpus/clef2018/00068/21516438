Enantioselective sensing by luminescence. Enantiomeric analysis is one of the crucial points for the sensor technology, due to the increasing importance that enantiomerically pure compounds and drugs have in pharmaceutic and agrochemical applications. Enantiomeric luminescent sensors give different responses by interaction or reaction with chiral molecules, allowing one to assess their optical purity by spectroscopic measurements. Moreover, chemosensors have been developed to perform enantiomeric analysis of both luminescent and non-luminescent organic compounds. In the present chapter we focus on the recent advances in the sensing of chiral molecules by luminescent sensory systems, with the aim of outlining different mechanisms: fluorescence quenching by metal complexes, photoinduced electron transfer (PET) quenching, fluorescence enhancement by PET inhibition, analyte induced sensor conformational changes, modulation of excimer and exciplex formation, and aggregation induced emission enhancement (AIEE). Recent advances in the use of more elaborate techniques such as anisotropy measurements, gated detection, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and perspectives in the field are also discussed. Emphasis is given to the methods which have provided high enantioselectivity and which are amenable to fast screening procedures.
