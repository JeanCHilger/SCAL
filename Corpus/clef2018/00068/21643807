Clinical implications of the body surface area method versus partition model dosimetry for yttrium-90 radioembolization using resin microspheres: a technical review. Yttrium-90 (Y-90) radioembolization is becoming established as an effective therapeutic modality for inoperable liver tumors. For resin microspheres, the 'body surface area (BSA)' method and the partition model can both be used for Y-90 activity calculation. The BSA method is semi-empirical, but more commonly used due its simplicity. The partition model is more accurate, scientifically sound and personalized, but less popular due to its complexity. This article provides a technical comparison of both methods with an emphasis on its clinical implications. Future dosimetric techniques for Y-90 radioembolization based on emerging technologies are also discussed.
