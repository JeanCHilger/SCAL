Hybrid PET/CT in cancer imaging. Combination of positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) has revolutionized imaging of cancer. The most often used PET tracer is fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). FDG-PET/CT shows the extent of the disease more accurately than either CT or MRI alone. With FDG-PET/CT imaging, up to 30% more patients are presented with unexpected distant metastases. This helps to guide patient management.
