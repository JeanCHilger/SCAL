Brain and systemic glucose metabolism in the healthy elderly following fish oil supplementation. Cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRg) is lower in individuals affected by cognitive decline and dementia, especially in Alzheimer's disease. However, as yet there is no consensus as to whether CMRg decreases during healthy aging. Epidemiological studies show that weekly consumption of fish abundant in ω3 fatty acids has a protective effect on cognition during aging. Thus, the primary objective of this human study was to use positron emission tomography analysis with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose to evaluate whether supplementation with a fish oil rich in ω3 fatty acids increases cerebral glucose metabolism in young or elderly adults. Healthy young (23±5y old n=5) and elderly (76±3y old
