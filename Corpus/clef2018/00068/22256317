The impact of reconstruction algorithms on semi-automatic small lesion segmentation for PET: a phantom study. A robust lesion segmentation method is critical for quantification of lesion activity in positron emission tomography (PET), especially for the cases where lesion boundary is not discernible in the corresponding computed tomography (CT). However, lesion delineation in PET is a challenging task, especially for small lesions, due to the low intrinsic resolution, image noise and partial volume effect. The combinations of different reconstruction methods and post-reconstruction smoothing on PET images also affect the segmentation result significantly which has always been overlooked. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of different reconstruction methods on semi-automated small lesion segmentation for PET images. Four conventional segmentation methods were evaluated including region growing technique based on maximum intensity (RGmax) and mean intensity (RGmean) thresholds, Fuzzy c-mean (FCM) and watershed (WS) technique. All these methods were evaluated on a physical phantom scan which was reconstructed with Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) with Gaussian post-smoothing and Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) with quadratic prior respectively. The results demonstrate that: 1) the performance of all the segmentation methods subject to the smoothness constraint applied on the reconstructed images 2) FCM method applied on MAP reconstructed images yielded overall superior performance than other evaluated combinations.
