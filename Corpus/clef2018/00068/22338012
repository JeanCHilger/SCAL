18F-FDG-PET/CT Imaging as an early survival predictor in patients with primary high-grade soft tissue sarcomas undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy is associated with considerable toxicity and limited survival benefits in patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS). We prospectively evaluated whether 2[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ((18)F-FDG)-PET/computed tomographic (CT) imaging after the initial cycle of neoadjuvant therapy could predict overall survival in these patients.Thirty-nine patients underwent (18)F-FDG-PET/CT before and after one cycle of neoadjuvant therapy. Fifty-six patients underwent end-of-treatment PET. Overall survival was, among others, correlated with changes of SUV(peak) and histopathology.One-, two-, and five-year survival rates were 95% ± 3.0%, 86% ± 4.6%, and 68% ± 6.6%, respectively. Median time to death was 30.9 months (mean, 27.7 range, 6.9-50.1). Optimal cutoff values for early and late decreases in SUV(peak) (26% and 57%, respectively) were significant predictors of survival in univariate survival analysis [P = 0.041(18)F-FDG-PET predicted survival after the initial cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with STS and can potentially serve as an intermediate endpoint biomarker in clinical research and patient care.
