Photosensitization of imidazole derivative by ZnO nanoparticle. A sensitive imidazole based fluorescent sensor like 4, 5-diphenyl-2(E)-styryl-1H-imidazole, for ZnO has been designed and synthesized via simple steps. The absorption, fluorescence, SEM, EDX and IR studies indicate that imidazole derivative is bound on the surface of ZnO semiconductor. Based on photo-induced electron transfer (PET) mechanism, fluorescent enhancement has been explained and apparent binding constant has been calculated. Ligand adsorption on ZnO nanoparticle lowers of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of imidazole derivative and the chemical affinity between the nitrogen atom of the imidazole and zinc ion on the surface of the nano oxide may be a reason for strong adsorption of the ligand on nanoparticle. The electron injection from photo excited imidazole derivative to the ZnO conduction band (S(*)â†’S(+) + e                            (CB)                                      (-)                         ) accounts for the enhanced fluorescence.
