Randomized and double-blind controlled clinical trial of extracorporeal cardiac shock wave therapy for coronary heart disease. Our aim was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of extracorporeal cardiac shock wave therapy (CSWT) for the patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) using a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial design. Twenty-five patients with CHD were enrolled in this study. Fourteen of the patients were randomized into the CSWT group and 11 into the control group. We applied the CSWT procedure to each patient by using nine shock treatments during 3 months, but the shock wave (SW) energy was only applied to the patients in the CSWT group and not to the patients in the control group. Technetium-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion, fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose myocardial metabolism single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed to identify segments of myocardial ischemia, myocardial viability, and ejection fraction before and after CSWT. We also followed the patients to evaluate adverse effects. After CSWT, the New York Heart Association class, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina scale, nitroglycerin dosage, myocardial perfusion and myocardial metabolic imaging scores of dual-isotope SPECT in the CSWT group were reduced significantly (P = 0.019, 0.027, 0.039, 0.000, 0.001, respectively), and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire scale, 6-min walking test, and left ventricular ejection fraction were increased significantly (P = 0.021, 0.024, 0.016, respectively) compared with those before the SW treatment. All of the parameters in the control group did not change significantly after the treatment (all P > 0.05). No serious adverse effects of CSWT were observed. Cardiac shock wave therapy is a safe and effective treatment for CHD patients.
