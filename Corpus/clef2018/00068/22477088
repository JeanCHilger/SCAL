Neural and behavioral endophenotypes in ADHD. In recent years, descriptive symptom-based approaches of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been increasingly replaced by more sophisticated endophenotype-based strategies, better suited to investigate its pathophysiological basis, which is inherently heterogeneous. Measurements derived from neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) constitute endophenotypes of growing interest, capable of providing unprecedented windows on neurochemical and neuroanatomical components of psychiatric conditions. This chapter reviews the current state of knowledge regarding putative neural and behavioral endophenotypes of ADHD, across the lifespan. To this end, recent evidence drawn from molecular and structural neuroimaging studies are discussed in the light of widely accepted neuropsychological and pharmacological models of ADHD.
