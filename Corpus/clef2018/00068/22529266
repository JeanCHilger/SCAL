Phase I study of RO4929097, a gamma secretase inhibitor of Notch signaling, in patients with refractory metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and assess safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and evidence of antitumor activity of RO4929097, a gamma secretase inhibitor of Notch signaling in patients with advanced solid malignancies.Patients received escalating doses of RO4929097 orally on two schedules: (A) 3 consecutive days per week for 2 weeks every 3 weeks (B) 7 consecutive days every 3 weeks. To assess reversible CYP3A4 autoinduction, the expanded part of the study tested three dosing schedules: (B) as abovePatients on schedule A (n = 58), B (n = 47), and C (n = 5 expanded cohort) received 302 cycles of RO4929097. Common grade 1 to 2 toxicities were fatigue, thrombocytopenia, fever, rash, chills, and anorexia. Transient grade 3 hypophosphatemia (dose-limiting toxicity, one patient) and grade 3 pruritus (two patients) were observed at 27 mg and 60 mg, respectivelyRO4929097 was well tolerated at 270 mg on schedule A and at 135 mg on schedule B the safety of schedule C has not been fully evaluated. Further studies are warranted on the basis of a favorable safety profile and preliminary evidence of clinical antitumor activity.
