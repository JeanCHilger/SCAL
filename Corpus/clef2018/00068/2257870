Effect of acute and prolonged treatment with propranolol on cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen metabolism in healthy volunteers. The effect of acute and long-term treatment with propranolol on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) has been studied in 8 young healthy volunteers. CBF was measured by 133Xe-inhalation and single photon emission computer tomography, and CMRO2 was calculated from the arterio-venous oxygen difference and CBF. Studies were done before and 1 h after i.v. injection of 5 mg propranolol and after three weeks on oral propranolol 80 mg/d for 1 week and 160 mg/d for 2 weeks. Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity in terms of the A-V oxygen difference was tested on all three occasions during hypercapnia and hyperventilation. CBF, CMRO2 and cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity remained stable both after acute and after 3 weeks of treatment with propranolol.
