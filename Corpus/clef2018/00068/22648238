Evaluation of a technique for in vivo internal monitoring of (18)F within a Brazilian laboratory network. (18)FDG, an analogue of glucose labelled with the radionuclide (18)F, is the most widely used radiopharmaceutical in positron emission tomography/computed tomography technique. In Brazil, there are currently eight (18)FDG plants in operation and other facilities are expected to start their production in the near future. The growth in the production and clinical use of (18)FDG represents an increasing risk of worker exposures. According to national regulations and international recommendations, internal exposures should be effectively controlled in order to keep doses as low as possible. The implementation of a routine monitoring programme towards the estimation of internal doses related to the incorporation of (18)F is difficult, mainly due to its short physical half-life, the cost of a bioassay laboratory and the need of a monitoring service promptly available near the production plant. This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a methodology for in vivo brain monitoring of (18)F to be applied in cases of suspected incorporation of (18)FDG. The technique presented a minimum detectable effective dose in the order of nanoSieverts, which allows its application for occupational monitoring purposes.
