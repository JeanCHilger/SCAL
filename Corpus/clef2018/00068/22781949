The clinical characteristic of 43 cases of neuroendocrine tumors with liver metastases. To analyze the clinical characteristics of liver metastases of neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and its treatment outcome, so as to further cognition of NET.The clinical data of patients with liver metastases of NET diagnosed by Peking Union Medical College Hospital during January 1996 to July 2010 were analyzed retrospectively.The ratio of male to female was 1:1.15 (20:23). The median age at onset of the patients with liver metastases of NET was 47.5 (26 - 70) years. The median duration from onset to diagnosis was 4 (0 - 120) months. The liver metastases were the first manifestation in 69.8% (30/43) cases. The detection rate of primary lesions with routine abdominal imaging (B-type ultrasonography, CT, MRI) was 65.1% (28/43), while increased to 90.7% (39/43) when combined the following one or more special examinations including somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS), PET-CT, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) (P = 0.004). The definite diagnosis methods mainly depended on surgical specimens (69.8%, 30/43). The ratio of nonfunctional to functional NET with liver metastases was 1.87:1 (28:15). The primary tumors were most commonly located in pancreas [39.3% (11/28) and 73.3% (11/15)], followed by stomach [21.4% (6/28) and 13.3% (2/15)]. Totally 88.4% (38/43) patients received operation, and 9.3% (4/43) patients had reoperation due to missed diagnosis of the primary tumors on earlier operation. Non-surgical treatments included octreotide acetate long-acting release, interventional therapy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which were difficult to be evaluated due to less follow-up cases.Liver metastases of NET are common and even the first manifestation symptom. Primary NET with liver metastases is the most commonly nonfunctional and located in digestive system. The detection rates of primary lesions are increased by special examinations including SRS, PET-CT and EUS. Surgical specimens are helpful to the final diagnosis, but it is necessary to improve the preoperative diagnostic rate of primary tumors to avoid repeat surgeries.
