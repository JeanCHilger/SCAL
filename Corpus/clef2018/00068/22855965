 Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was first identified from extracts of human colon adenocarcinoma (1) and fetal gut (2). CEA is a Î²-glycoprotein, and its predominant expression on the cell surface is increased in a variety of carcinomas and in certain inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (3, 4). CEA has a molecular weight of ~180 kDa, and it can be shed and detected in serum (5). CEA expression is observed in patients with various carcinomas of the colon, lung, thyroid, uterus, ovary, pancreas, and medullary thyroid. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed for both the diagnosis and treatment of tumors (6, 7). However, the pharmacokinetics of intact radiolabeled mAbs, with high liver uptake and slow blood elimination, are generally not ideal for imaging (8, 9). Smaller antibody fragments, such as scFv, Fab, or F(ab')
