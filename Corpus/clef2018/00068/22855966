 Expression of the L1-cell adhesion molecule (L1-CAM) is reported to correlate with and is required for the progression and metastasis of many cancers, including that of the ovaries (1). Therefore, the L1-CAM has been targeted for the therapy of many cancers, as discussed in detail by Weidle et al. (2). The chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) chCE7, directed toward the L1-CAM, has been shown to have a very high affinity for the antigen (
