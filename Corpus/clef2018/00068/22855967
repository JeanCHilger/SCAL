 The three subtypes of the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors (CCKR) belong to the G-protein coupled receptor family and are classified (CCK1R, CCK2R and CCK2i4svR) on the basis of their affinities for the CCK and the gastrin peptides, differential distribution in the tissues and molecular structure (1). The CCK1R (previously known as CCKA) is found mainly on the peripheral cells of the pancreas and has a 500 to 1000-fold higher affinity for sulfated CCK compared with the non-sulfated ligand. In addition, the CCK1R is expressed mainly in organs of the gastrointestinal tract of rodents, but is expressed at low levels in humans (2). The CCK2R (previously known as CCKB) is expressed in the brain, stomach, pancreas and the gallbladder and exhibits an almost equivalent affinity for gastrin and sulfated or non-sulfated CCK (the CCK2R is also known as the gastrin receptor (GR)). Although CCK1R and CCK2R/GR are expressed in various normal tissues the CCK2R is overexpressed in most tumorous tissues such as medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC >90%), astrocytomas (>65%) and stromal ovarian cancers (100%). The CCK2i4svR is a splice variant of the CCK2R that is expressed only in colorectal and pancreatic neoplasms, but not in the normal colorectal mucosa (1). Several gastrin and CCK analogs that have a high affinity for the CCK2R have been developed and labeled with radionuclides for the detection and therapy of these cancers. It has been shown that radiolabeled CCK derivatives and mini gastrin (MG
