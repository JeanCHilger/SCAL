 Copper (Cu) metal is not commonly available in the environment, but is an important micronutrient that is required for the activity of many mammalian intracellular enzymes (1). Presence of free Cu is toxic for the cell because it can exist in the oxidized (Cu(I)) or the reduced (Cu(II)) forms, and conversion of Cu(I) to Cu(II) under physiological conditions leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species that disrupt the normal cellular pathways. Therefore, mammals tend to maintain extremely low concentrations of the metal within tissues, which is achieved by transporting it out of the cells into the circulatory system and eventually into the bile for excretion through the hepatobiliary system (2). In the liver, the Cu transporter 1 helps in the passage of the metal into the hepatocytes, and the
