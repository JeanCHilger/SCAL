Evaluation of an attenuation correction method for PET/MR imaging of the head based on substitute CT images. The aim of this study was to evaluate MR-based attenuation correction of PET emission data of the head, based on a previously described technique that calculates substitute CT (sCT) images from a set of MR images.Images from eight patients, examined with (18)F-FLT PET/CT and MRI, were included. sCT images were calculated and co-registered to the corresponding CT images, and transferred to the PET/CT scanner for reconstruction. The new reconstructions were then compared with the originals. The effect of replacing bone with soft tissue in the sCT-images was also evaluated.The average relative difference between the sCT-corrected PET images and the CT-corrected PET images was 1.6% for the head and 1.9% for the brain. The average standard deviations of the relative differences within the head were relatively high, at 13.2%, primarily because of large differences in the nasal septa region. For the brain, the average standard deviation was lower, 4.1%. The global average difference in the head when replacing bone with soft tissue was 11%.The method presented here has a high rate of accuracy, but high-precision quantitative imaging of the nasal septa region is not possible at the moment.
