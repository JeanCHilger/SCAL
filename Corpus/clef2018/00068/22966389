Usefulness of (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography for the diagnosis of pyothorax-associated lymphoma: A report of three cases. Pyothorax-associated lymphoma (PAL) is a unique and rare non-Hodgkin's lymphoma developing in the pleural cavity following a long-standing history of chronic pyothorax (CP). The development of F-18 2'-deoxy-2fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) has contributed to the evaluation of lymphoma staging. However, only a few studies describing FDG-PET/CT findings in PAL have been published. This study reported three cases of PAL all 3 patients had previously undergone artificial collapse therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis. Both the first case (an 84-year-old male) and second case (an 83-year-old male) complained of abdominal pain. An ultrasound scan revealed a mass shadow in the left chest wall without abnormal findings in the abdomen, and the CT and magnetic resonance imaging scans suggested malignant lymphoma of the left chest. FDG-PET/CT imaging showed extremely intense FDG uptake only in the left pleura and chest wall. Diagnosis was CP in the two patients, showing a high maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax: early, 14.8 and delayed, 19.4 in the first case
