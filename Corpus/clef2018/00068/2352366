Three dimensional model constructed from Tl-201 myocardial SPECT in combination with bull's-eye mapping. Three dimensional images (3D Model) and Bull's-eye maps of Tl-201 stress and redistribution scintigrams were reconstructed from average distances and relative accumulations per unit area. 3D Models viewed from different angles were studied in cine mode, in conjunction with the Bull's-eye map. The accumulations of Tl-201 were classified into five different ranks. ROC curves for 3D Model were computed. The coronary artery stenoses estimated by 3D Model were found to have statistical correlations with the results of coronary angiography, in one and two coronary vessel disease, but not in three. Concerning the areas and the locations of abnormal Tl-201 distributions, 3D Model images offer more comprehensible informations than the conventional Bull's-eye method, especially around the left ventricular outlet.
