Infections associated with pets. Dogs, cats, rodents, reptiles and birds can transmit numerous diseases. Some are localized infections resulting from bites, scratches or other skin contact. Occasionally, a minor scratch or bite can lead to more serious infection, such as cat-scratch disease. Under certain circumstances, serious gastrointestinal, respiratory or multisystem illness can develop. Accurate diagnosis and identification of the pet source are necessary to prevent further transmission.
