Chloroplast mRNA 3' end maturation is biochemically distinct from prokaryotic mRNA processing. We have characterized a chloroplast processing activity that catalyzes the conversion of the plastid cytochrome b6/f subunit IV (pet D) mRNA 3' end precursor to the mature RNA possessing a 3' inverted repeat (IR). In a chloroplast soluble protein extract, the activity requires Mg2+ or Mn2+, but not K+. In the absence of Mg2+, the pet D 3' IR-RNA product does not accumulate, and UV-cross-linking indicates that the 3' IR-RNA precursor binds several new proteins in addition to those previously characterized as part of the 3' IR-RNA: protein complex in vitro. In contrast, high concentrations of Zn2+ or Cu2+ suppress protein binding and inhibit the processing reaction. The purified exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (E.C.2.7.7.8) is not efficient in processing the pet D 3' IR-RNA precursor, whereas Escherichia coli ribonuclease II rapidly processes the pet D IR-RNA precursor to a product of a size similar to that of the mature 3' IR-RNA, but also rapidly degrades the mature RNA in the absence of chloroplast extract. We therefore conclude that the maturation of the pet D mRNA in vitro requires specific chloroplast enzymes which process the mRNA 3' end precursor in the absence of efficient transcription termination. The chloroplast enzyme activities are biochemically distinct from their bacterial counterparts. We also note that specific chloroplast components may be required to stabilize the mature pet D mRNA 3' end against further exonucleolytic degradation.
