Gammagraphic imaging of pheochromocytoma using 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine. The authors present their first experiences with scintigraphic examination of pheochromocytoma by means of 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG). In two of the eight patients examined, the already established diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma was confirmed, in two the examination yielded confirmation of the presumed diagnosis, and in the remaining four patients presence of the tumor was excluded. In conformity with literary data, the authors found the given examination to be suitable for: 1. confirming the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma in cases with unequivocal CT findings, 2. excluding extraadrenal activity, 3. detecting relapses or the occurrence of an extraadrenal tumor, 4. detecting not suspect manifold endocrine neoplasias, 5. establishing the diagnosis of malignant pheochromocytoma, and 6. for examining patients presenting with a family history of pheochromocytoma.
