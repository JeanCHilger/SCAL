Clinical significance of reverse redistribution in exercise thallium-201 SPECT after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Clinical significance of reverse redistribution on thallium image was evaluated in 54 patients who had undergone PTCA. Thallium SPECT imaging was performed one week and three to six months after PTCA. Reverse redistribution was detected eight of 54 patients one week after PTCA and five of 38 patients three to six months after PTCA. In the segments with reverse redistribution, reduced regional wall motion and lesser degree of coronary stenosis was common features (p less than 0.05) angiography. In conclusion, reverse redistribution had a tendency to appear in the region with mild myocardial injury and relatively high coronary blood flow after PTCA. But in cases with new occurrence and disappearance of reverse redistribution during follow up period, we can not assess the factors to explain these phenomena. In these segments, "coronary flow reserve", "stunned myocardium", "hibernating myocardium" or other factors may be related.
