Development of a new quantitative analysis for thallium myocardial SPECT images--quantitative STEREO-VIEW method and evaluation of its clinical usefulness. We have developed a three-dimensional quantitative display method, Quantitative STEREO-VIEW method (STEREO-VIEW method), for analysis of thallium (Tl) myocardial SPECT images and have evaluated its clinical usefulness. SPECT data were obtained immediately and 4 hours after the exercise, and contour lines for outer edges of left ventricular (LV) myocardium were detected from 10 slices of short axial images in delayed scan. LV wall was divided into 510 segments by dividing each slice into 51 sectors and LV myocardium was three-dimensionally reconstructed. Mean Tl counts, %T1 uptake and washout rate (WR) of each segment were calculated and these values were represented such as infarcted area display, redistribution display and WR display on STEREO-VIEW. Furthermore, extent index (EI), severity index (SI) and intensity index (II) were defined to express the degree of perfusion abnormality using WR value of each segment. In the 25 patients with coronary revascularization, improving rate of these indices correlated well with that of double product significantly. STEREO-VIEW method resembled in the original shape of left ventricle of each patient, so STEREO-VIEW method has made it easier to discriminate the accurate extent of ischemic lesion. In addition, EI, SI and II using WR were good indices for coronary perfusion and these were thought to be useful on clinical study.
