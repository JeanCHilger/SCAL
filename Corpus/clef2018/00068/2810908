Different characteristics of 123I-IMP SPECT images of cerebral embolism and cerebral thrombosis. We performed 123I-IMP SPECT in patients with cerebral infarction within 48 hours after onset, to investigate its usefulness in differentiating cerebral embolism from thrombosis. Clearcut wedge-shaped defect was seen on the SPECT image in all six cases of clinically suspected cerebral embolism in our series, while this pattern was not observed among the five cases of cerebral thrombosis.
