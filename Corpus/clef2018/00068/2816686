Use of oral dipyridamole SPECT thallium-201 imaging in detection of coronary artery disease. This study examined the merits of oral dipyridamole SPECT thallium-201 imaging in detecting CAD and multivessel CAD. The 65 patients included in this study (aged 62 +/- 11 years) were not candidates for exercise testing (for the usual reasons). Coronary arteriography revealed no significant CAD in 17 patients and greater than or equal to 50% narrowing of one or more vessels in 48 patients 12 had one-vessel and 36 had multivessel CAD (high-risk group). Thallium-201 was injected intravenously 45 minutes after an oral dose of 375 mg of dipyridamole, and SPECT imaging was performed within 10 minutes and 4 hours after injection. There were no serious side effects
