Positron emission tomography: clinical status in the United States in 1987. ACNP/SNM Task Force on Clinical PET. PET studies are now being used to provide unique clinical information in several conditions. PET is an accurate, noninvasive method of identifying patients with coronary artery disease. Furthermore, PET studies can accurately differentiate patients who will or will not benefit from revascularization procedures. In patients with partial epilepsy being considered for surgery, PET studies provide spatial localization of the focus that complements other tests in improving the surgical management of these patients. PET studies give important diagnostic and prognostic information in the management of patients with gliomas and can direct recurrence of tumor and distinguish it from radiation necrosis. These uses of PET are well documented, and their utility has been independently confirmed in several institutions. Several other areas of research are being pursued with PET, and these will probably develop into clinically useful procedures in the future.
