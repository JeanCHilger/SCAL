Cerebral perfusion imaging in Alzheimer's disease. Use of single photon emission computed tomography and iofetamine hydrochloride I 123. We used single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to study 15 patients with Alzheimer's disease and nine controls. Iofetamine hydrochloride I 123 uptake data were recorded from the entire brain using a rotating gamma camera. Activity ratios were measured for the frontal, posterior parietal, posterior, medial, and lateral cortical temporal regions and striate cortex and were normalized by the activity in the cerebellum. Abnormalities in iofetamine hydrochloride I 123 activity were similar to the abnormalities in glucose metabolism observed with positron emission tomography. Cortical tracer activity was globally depressed in patients with Alzheimer's disease, with the greatest reduction in the posterior parietal cortex.
