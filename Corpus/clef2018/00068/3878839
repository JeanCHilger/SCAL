Tonotopic organization in human auditory cortex revealed by positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to map alterations in local neuronal activity induced in human primary auditory cortex by pure-tone stimulation. Patterns of blood flow were observed in specific regions on the superior temporal plane showing systematic changes in activity depending on the frequency of a stimulating pure tone. The orientation of these regions agrees well with data for non-human primates.
