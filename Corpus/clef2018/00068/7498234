Traditional receptor theory and its application to neuroreceptor measurements in functional imaging. The mathematical, biological discipline of receptor pharmacology and the graphical methods of describing receptor behaviour evolved over a century of painstaking observation and model testing. Laws regarding in vitro theories are classically considered inoperative in vivo. Nevertheless, functional imaging techniques have rapidly evolved to allow receptor measurement and rules of thumb have been developed which clearly prove valid receptor parameters can be derived from functional imaging studies. The field is evolving so rapidly now that nuclear medicine researchers are in danger in applying these techniques without recourse to an understanding of the orthodox discipline of receptor pharmacology. This review attempts to document the basis of receptor pharmacology and to give an account of the theoretical and practical basis on which this can be applied in vivo. The review is targeted towards single-photon emission tomography because of the rapid growth in the area, but many parts draw on the literature relating to positron emission tompgraphy since the first translation of in vitro to in vivo measurement was performed with this technique.
