No-carrier-added iodine-131-MIBG: evaluation of a therapeutic preparation. Iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine ([131I]MIBG) is a radiopharmaceutical for imaging as well as targeted radiotherapy of neuroblastoma. It is predicted that the use of no-carrier-added [131I]MIBG, rather than the conventional low specific activity preparation, will result in an enhanced therapeutic ratio because of different transport processes in neuroblastoma compared with most normal tissues.The main aims of the study were: (1) to determine whether [131I]MIBG of substantially greater specific activity is transported into tumor cells by the same process as the existing compound (2) to evaluate the effect of nonradiolabeled MIBG on the cytotoxicity of no-carrier-added [131I]MIBGActive uptake of no-carrier-added [131I]MIBG was temperature-, sodium- and oxygen-dependent ouabain- and desmethylimipramine-inhibitableThese data indicate that there may be clinical advantages in the use of no-carrier-added [131I]MIBG rather than conventional [131I]MIBG.
