Effects of GABAA receptors activation on brain glucose metabolism in normal subjects and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients. A positron emission tomography (PET) study. Part II: The focal hypometabolism is reactive to GABAA agonist administration in TLE. Positron emission tomography (PET) using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was used to study the metabolic response of focal hypometabolism to the administration of a specific GABAA agonist (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol), THIP, in six temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients. After THIP injection, the increase of glucose metabolism in the hypometabolic focus was larger than the mean increase reported in the whole brain (Part I Epilepsy Res., 19 (1994) 45-54). Within the hypometabolic focus, this increase was significantly higher in regions with the lowest basal metabolic level. This metabolic response in the hypometabolic focus, observed in the absence of any epileptic discharge during FDG accumulation and PET data acquisition, suggests that GABAA receptors are up-regulated or, at least, preserved in TLE.
