Clinical efficacy of octreotide scintigraphy in patients with midgut carcinoid tumours and evaluation of intraoperative scintillation detection. 111In-diethylenetriamine penta-acetate-D-Phe1-octreotide scintigraphy was evaluated in a group of 27 patients with disseminated midgut carcinoid tumour. Additional information gained by the intraoperative use of a scintillation detector was studied in five patients with midgut carcinoid tumours and in two with endocrine pancreatic tumours. In 19 patients tumours not recognized by non-invasive radiological methods were visualized in 27 locations, most commonly in liver and para-aortic lymph nodes. Three false-negative tumour locations were noted (ovarian and peritoneal). With guidance from scintigraphic findings, nine patients underwent surgical tumour reduction, leading to complete remission in three. Clinically suspect tumour lesions were measured by the detector in situ, and ex vivo after excision. After excision the tissue:blood activity concentration ratios were calculated. In situ measurements were helpful in the localization of tumours and in the control of adequate clearance of tumour tissue. High tissue:blood activity concentration ratios at 1, 2 and 5 days in the five patients with midgut carcinoid tumour indicate a potential role for radiation therapy with radiolabelled octreotide in patients with somatostatin receptor-positive tumours.
