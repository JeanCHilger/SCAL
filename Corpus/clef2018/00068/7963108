Physiologic significance of chronic coronary aneurysms in patients with Kawasaki disease. The aim of this study was to determine whether persistent coronary aneurysms in patients with Kawasaki disease are associated with altered myocardial perfusion and function.Some patients with Kawasaki disease have died suddenly because of severe coronary artery stenosis others have chronic coronary aneurysms.Eleven patients with chronic coronary aneurysms were enrolled in the study. The size of the aneurysms and the degree of associated stenosis were determined by angiography in nine patients and by echocardiography in two. All patients underwent simultaneous function and myocardial perfusion assessment during symptom-limited exercise by echocardiography and technetium-99m sestamibi imaging, respectively.Of 33 vascular territories, 18 contained coronary aneurysms measuring 3.5 to 10 mm. Three aneurysms were associated with significant stenosis as detected by angiography. Of the 18 vascular territories, 13 were normal, and 5 manifested stress-induced perfusion defects of the latter 5 areas, 4 had associated wall motion abnormalities. The three territories supplied by stenotic coronary arteries had both abnormal regional function and perfusion demonstrated during exercise.Patients with chronic coronary aneurysms may have associated stenosis, as detected by angiography, with a subjacent myocardium that is subject to abnormal perfusion and function. However, the majority of coronary aneurysms are associated with normal regional coronary flow reserve, as assessed by myocardial perfusion imaging, and even giant coronary aneurysms may be associated with normal coronary flow reserve and preserved regional myocardial function during stress.
