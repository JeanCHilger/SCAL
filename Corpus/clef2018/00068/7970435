Brain SPET and auditory cortex perfusion. Technical notes and preliminary results. Auditory cortex stimulation was studied by 99Tcm-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) single photon emission tomography (SPET) in 11 patients with normal vestibular and auditory tests, as well as computed tomography. Markedly increased temporal and parietal blood flows were found in left brain cortex, contralateral to the stimulus. The right auditory areas showed moderate hyperactivity. The method might be useful for tonotopic mapping of auditory cortex, using various pure tonal stimuli.
