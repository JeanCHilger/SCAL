GTP gamma S and phorbol ester act synergistically to stimulate both Ca(2+)-independent secretion and phospholipase D activity in permeabilized human platelets. Inhibition by BAPTA and analogues. We have tested the hypothesis that phospholipase D (PLD) is the effector of the unidentified G protein (GE) mediating Ca(2+)-independent exocytosis in platelets. Although GTP gamma S, and to a lesser extent phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), caused some secretion of 5-HT from electropermeabilized human platelets in the effective absence of Ca2+ (pCa > 9), these stimuli had much more potent synergistic effects when added together. In all cases, secretion of 5-HT was closely correlated to the stimulus-induced formation of [3H]phosphatidic acid ([3H]PA) from [3H]arachidonate-labelled phospholipids. Addition of ethanol inhibited both secretion and [3H]PA formation and led to the accumulation of [3H]phosphatidylethanol ([3H]PEt), indicating that [3H]PA was formed largely by activation of PLD. BAPTA and analogues caused dose-dependent inhibitions of both GTP gamma S-induced secretion and PLD activity in the permeabilized platelets. This action of BAPTA did not appear to be mediated by chelation of Ca2+ or by direct inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC). The results suggest that PLD is the target of GE in platelets and that BAPTA can block PLD activation.
