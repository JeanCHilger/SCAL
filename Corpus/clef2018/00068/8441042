The bacterial endotoxin test in the PET facility. A method by which the gel-clot Limulus amebocyte lysate test may be performed in 20 rather than 60 min with sufficient sensitivity to satisfy the needs of the nuclear medicine or positron emission tomography laboratories has been developed and validated for use as a substitute for the Bacterial Endotoxin Test described in the United States Pharmacopeia, 22nd revision. Using this method, results may be obtained from the test prior to the human administration of radiopharmaceuticals without extensive loss of activity and with increased safety when compared to tests performed after administration. Additionally, studies on the shelf-lives of the reagents used in the test were conducted. When refrigerated between use, control standard endotoxin dilutions of 5 EU/ml or greater may be used for at least 1 mo after preparation and reconstituted lysate retains its labeled sensitivity for at least 10 days, considerably longer than the manufacturer's stated shelf-lives.
