A stationary hemispherical SPECT imager for three-dimensional brain imaging. A completely stationary, hemispherical-coded aperture SPECT imaging system was designed to produce three-dimensional images of the brain. The system consisted of a hemispherical multiple-pinhole coded aperture and 20 small (100 x 100 mm crystal area) digital gamma cameras. Reconstructions and measured performance specifications from two laboratory versions of the imager are presented. The reconstructed field of view of these systems was an ellipsoidal region with semi-diameters of 100 x 100 x 50 mm. The reconstructed spatial resolution for a point source in air at the center of this field was found to be 4.8 mm FWHM and the corresponding system sensitivity was 36 cps/microCi. An analysis using an ideal-observer model indicated that the multiplexed projection data suffered a 21% degradation relative to similar, but nonmultiplexed SPECT data. Therefore, by this measure, the effective sensitivity of the brain imager was 79% of the measured value.
