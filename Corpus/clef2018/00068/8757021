Fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography in diffuse Lewy body disease. We report six demented individuals with pathologically verified diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD) studied with fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Three subjects had pure DLBD and three subjects had combined DLBD and Alzheimer's disease (DLBD-AD) pathology. FDG-PET revealed evidence of diffuse cerebral hypometabolism in both pure DLBD and DLBD-AD with marked declines in association cortices with relative sparing of subcortical structures and primary somatomotor cortex, a pattern reported previously in AD. Unlike AD, however, these subjects also had hypometabolism in the occipital association cortex and primary visual cortex. These findings indicate the presence of diffuse cortical abnormalities in DLBD and suggest that FDG-PET may be useful in discriminating DLBD from AD antemortem.
