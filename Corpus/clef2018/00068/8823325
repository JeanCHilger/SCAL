Single-photon emission computed tomography gallium imaging versus computed tomography: predictive value in patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. To evaluate the predictive value of computed tomography (CT) scanning and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) gallium (Ga) scanning in the disease-free survival of patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).One hundred forty-three patients undergoing transplant for NHL underwent CT scanning of chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and a SPECT Ga scan before transplantation and at day + 100 after transplant. The failure-free survival (FFS) by scan result was analyzed.In the diffuse aggressive lymphoma patients, the 1-year FFS for patients having a positive SPECT Ga scan at day + 100 was 15% compared with a 3-year FFS of 47% for those with a negative scan (P < .001). Patients with a positive CT scan at day + 100 had a 36% 3-year FFS, and those with a negative CT scan had a 39% 3-year FFS (P = not significant [NS]). An analysis of the combination of CT scan and SPECT Ga scan results at day + 100 posttransplant demonstrated a 3-year FFS of 14% if they were both abnormal if the CT was positive and Ga was negative, the 3-year FFS was 68%The use of SPECT Ga scan at day + 100 posttransplant for evaluation of disease activity in patients with diffuse aggressive NHL was highly predictive of eventual outcome and was more predictive than the CT scan results. However, for patients with follicular NHL, the addition of SPECT Ga scanning to CT scanning did not add substantially to the evaluation of transplant outcome.
