Magnetic resonance in the assessment of myocardial viability after infarction: comparison with dobutamine echocardiography and thallium scintigraphy. Revascularization and prognosis after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) depend on the assessment of myocardial viability. Thus, after AMI, the myocardium may still be viable, though with contractile dysfunction. This study was aimed at comparing three tomographic methods, that is, dobutamine echocardiography (DE), thallium scintigraphy after i.v. nitrate bolus (SPET) and MRI at rest, in the assessment of viable tissue. The viability standard was post-revascularization functional recovery, as assessed with echocardiography at rest. Twenty-four patients with previous AMI (3-6 months earlier) were examined: 384 segments in all 106 segments were a-dyskinetic and they make up our study group. At first follow-up (30-45 days), 38 segments exhibited functional recovery and were considered viable1) this is the first study comparing three different tomographic methods with the same myocardial segmentation for viability assessment 2) MRI exhibited very high sensitivity, which means no false negatives
