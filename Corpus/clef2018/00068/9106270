PET imaging of maze processing. Covered maze traversal models nonverbal planning, involving sequential execution of moves using learned spatial maps. To determine the neural substrate involved in maze processing, eleven adults underwent [H(2)15O]-PET while performing motor control, following the computer visual control, choosing the wall with more dead-ends
