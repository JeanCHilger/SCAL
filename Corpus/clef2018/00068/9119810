Collateral vessels assessed by myocardial contrast echocardiography in patients with coronary artery lesions after Kawasaki disease. Using myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE), coronary arteriography, and thallium-201 myocardial imaging (TMI), we examined the characteristics and the role of collateral vessels in 35 patients with coronary artery lesions after Kawasaki disease. The male/female ratio was 25:10. The patients' ages are examination ranged from 1.0 to 20.3 years (mean, 10.8 years). The age at onset of Kawasaki disease ranged from 0.3 to 11.6 years (mean, 2.6 years). The coronary artery lesions were: dilated lesions without coexistent stenotic lesions in 5 patients (14%), localized stenosis with less than 50% narrowing in 5 patients (14%), localized stenosis with 50% or more narrowing in 4 patients (11%), and obstructive lesions, such as occlusion and/or segmental stenosis, in 21 patients (60%). In the group with no stenotic lesions and the group with less than 50% localized stenosis, the perfusion area of the right coronary artery was 32.6 +/- 8.4% and that of the left coronary artery was 76.3 +/- 7.9%. The total perfusion area of the right and the left coronary arteries was 108.9 +/- 2.6%, which value was inversely correlated with age at examination (r = 0.716, P = 0.020). In the group more than 50% localized stenosis, an increase in overlap areas detected by MCE, where a perfusion defect was seen on TMI, was not found, except in 1 patient with 99% stenosis. In the patients with obstructive lesions development of collateral channels was better in the perfusion area of the occluded right coronary artery than in that of the occluded left coronary artery, and well developed collateral channels were significantly correlated with good wall motion. We conclude that overlapping perfusion occurs in younger rather than in older children without stenotic coronary systems, and this may contribute to the food development of collateral circulation in infants and young children with coronary artery lesions after Kawasaki disease.
