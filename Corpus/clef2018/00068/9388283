Comparison between morphologic changes seen on high-resolution CT and regional pulmonary perfusion seen on SPECT in patients with cystic fibrosis. To evaluate the relationship between morphologic findings seen on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the lung and regional lung perfusion depicted on single photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) pulmonary perfusion imaging in patients with cystic fibrosis.Ten HRCT and 10 technetium-99 m macroaggregated albumin SPECT pulmonary perfusion imaging studies were performed on eight young adult patients who were considered to be clinically well and have mild to moderate cystic fibrosis. HRCT scans of the chest were evaluated using a CT scoring system which included grading of bronchiectasis, peribronchial thickening, hyperlucency, bullae, collapse/consolidation, and mucus plugging. Each lung was divided into six anatomic zones which were independently scored. A lung perfusion score (between 0 and 100), reflecting the percentage of compromised lung, was estimated for each zone. Axial lung perfusion SPECT images were matched anatomically to HRCT images. Lung function was considered compromised when the counts per pixel were less than 25 % of the count level seen in an area of the same patient's lung which was judged to be normal.There was a statistically significant relationship (P = 0.0001) between HRCT total scores and SPECT lung perfusion scores as well as between hyperlucency scores by HRCT and the SPECT lung perfusion scores. However, the HRCT score was a poor predictor of the lung perfusion score in zones with intermediate HRCT scores, which constituted 106 of 120 zones.Morphologic changes depicted by HRCT correlate with decreased lung pefusion on SPECT. However, HRCT changes accurately predict regional lung function only in the most normal and severely diseased lung zones.
