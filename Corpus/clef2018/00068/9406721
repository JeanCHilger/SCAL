Can occult metastases be treated by radioimmunotherapy? Tumor lesions in the millimeter (mm) range may escape detection with nuclear medicine imaging methods (including single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]) using radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). We hypothesized that these lesions still could receive a potentially therapeutic radiation absorbed dose, and therefore should be treated, despite the lack of detection.To simulate this situation, 2-mm beads (0.004 mL) containing approximately 1.15 microCi of iodine-131 (131I) were used. The beads were placed centrally in a 1200-mL liver phantom containing approximately 3 mCi of 131I. The resultant activity concentration on the beads was approximately 288 microCi/mL compared with approximately 2.5 microCi/mL in the phantom, corresponding to a maximum tumor uptake of approximately 0.3% injected dose per gram (%ID/g) if 100 mCi of 131I-labeled immunoglobulin G were administered. The phantom, containing the beads, was imaged by both planar and SPECT techniques at hypothetical Day 1 (time of maximum tumor uptake) and at hypothetical Day 7 to examine the improved target-to-nontarget ratio over time. In addition to imaging the beads, the radiation absorbed dose to the simulated lesions from the beta component emissions of 131I was calculated using absorbed fractions based on Berger's point kernels.Regardless of the conditions used, the beads could not be observed by either planar or SPECT imaging. However, the radiation-absorbed dose to the simulated lesion was calculated to be as high as approximately 6200 centigray (cGy), with an average dose rate of approximately 89.5 cGy/hour.This simulation demonstrates that a relatively high absorbed dose and dose rate can be delivered to mm-sized lesions not observed by conventional nuclear imaging methods, and that these lesions should be considered for radioimmunotherapy with 1311 MoAbs. However, for micrometastases of <1 mm, other radionuclides with shorter path length beta particles than 131I, Auger electrons, or alpha particles should be considered.
