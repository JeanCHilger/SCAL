Hemispherectomy for intractable seizures: presurgical cerebral glucose metabolism and post-surgical non-verbal communication. This study examined the presurgical 2-deoxy-2[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (PET) patterns of regional cerebral glucose metabolism in the non-resected hemisphere of 13 children who underwent hemispherectomy for early-onset intractable seizures. These patterns were compared with the rate of change in the children's non-verbal communication scores, measured before and after surgery. Irrespective of the side of surgery, the pre-operative glucose metabolism in the non-resected prefrontal cortex correlated significantly with the postoperative rate of change in the children's ability to focus the attention of an adult on an object or event (joint attention). These preliminary findings suggest that pre-operative PET patterns might be associated with certain aspects of the developmental outcome of children undergoing hemispherectomy.
