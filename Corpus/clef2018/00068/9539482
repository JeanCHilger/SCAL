Assessment of coronary artery disease in women by dobutamine stress echocardiography: comparison with stress thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography and exercise electrocardiography. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is sensitive and specific in detecting myocardial ischemia of male patients. However, there have been few reports about the use of DSE for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) in women.DSE was evaluated in 51 consecutive women who underwent concomitant quantitative coronary angiography. Forty-four of the 51 patients received stress thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and 30 of the 51 patients had interpretable results (exercise level > or = 85% of age-predicted maximal heart rate) of treadmill exercise. Twenty-nine patients had angiographically documented CAD defined as > or = 50% diameter stenosis.The overall sensitivity of DSE and stress 201Tl SPECT in detecting CAD was 93% and 79% (p = nonsignificant), and the specificity was 82% and 75% (p = nonsignificant), respectively. A combination of both tests increased the sensitivity (96%) at the expense of some decrease in specificity (60%). The agreement of DSE and 201Tl SPECT was 68% (30 of 44 kappa statistic = 0.35The diagnostic accuracy of DSE was similar to that of stress 201Tl SPECT in women. DSE was able to stratify female patients with either abnormal or normal results of treadmill exercise testing and to avoid unnecessary cardiac catheterization.
