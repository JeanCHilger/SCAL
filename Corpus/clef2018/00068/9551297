The current state of epilepsy surgery. Epilepsy surgery is an effective therapy for many patients with refractory partial seizures. The results of epilepsy surgery have improved with advances in the evaluation of patients for surgery and the care of patients during and after surgery. This review looks at recent innovations in imaging modalities to identify the candidates for surgery who will benefit most, to identify subtle pathology, to resect the epileptogenic focus more precisely, and to preserve functionally important cortex in order to achieve the best possible outcome. Patient selection and the identification and removal of the epileptogenic focus, in a safe manner, are crucial for good outcome.
