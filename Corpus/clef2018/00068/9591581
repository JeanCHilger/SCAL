Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose assessment of glucose metabolism in bone tumors. In our study, we investigate the glucose metabolism of various types of bone lesions with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET.Twenty-six patients showing clinical and radiographic symptoms of a malignant bone tumor were included. Histological examination after the PET study revealed 19 malignant and 7 benign tumors. PET images were corrected for attenuation. Arterial blood samples were taken to establish the input function. The metabolic rate of glucose consumption (MRglc) was calculated for the whole tumor, for the 10 pixels with maximum activity and for contralateral normal muscle tissue.All lesions were clearly visualized with 18F-FDG PET except for a small infarction of the humerus. All the other lesions had increased glucose metabolism compared to surrounding and contralateral muscle tissue. Both maximum and average MRglc for benign, as well as malignant, lesions were significantly higher than for contralateral normal tissue. The maximum and average MRglc were not higher for malignant as opposed to benign lesions. There was a large overlap between the MRglc of benign and malignant lesions.Fluorine-18-FDG PET appears suitable to visualize bone tumors. With the quantification of glucose metabolism, it is not possible to differentiate between benign and malignant bone tumors. There does not seem to be a clear correlation between the MRglc and the biologic aggressiveness of the neoplasms.
