Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18FDG) PET scan of the brain in glutaric aciduria type 1: clinical and MRI correlations. The clinical, PET (positron emission tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) findings of brain studies in eight patients, previously diagnosed to have glutaric aciduria type 1, were retrospectively reviewed. The neurological findings typically consisted of variable degrees of dementia and extrapyramidal symptoms (dystonia, choreoathetosis and rigidity). Both MRI and PET showed involvement of the putamina in all the patients. The PET scan demonstrated lesions in the head of the caudate nuclei in all of the patients. Brain atrophy, and in particular the characteristically-enlarged Sylvian fissures, was better demonstrated by MRI. On the other hand, the cerebral cortex and thalamic structures were found to be normal by MRI in all patients, whereas PET scan showed decreased uptake in the cerebral cortex in seven, and in the thalami in three patients. Correlation between imaging and clinical findings was found to be good when both PET scan and MRI findings of the brain were taken into consideration. Therefore, the functional (PET) and structural (MRI) studies of the brain were complementary in the imaging evaluation of glutaric aciduria type 1.
