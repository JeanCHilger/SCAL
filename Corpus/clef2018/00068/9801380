Abstract and effector-specific representations of motor sequences identified with PET. Positron emission tomography was used to identify neural systems involved in the acquisition and expression of sequential movements produced by different effectors. Subjects were tested on the serial reaction time task under implicit learning conditions. In the initial acquisition phase, subjects responded to the stimuli with keypresses using the four fingers of the right hand. During this phase, the stimuli followed a fixed sequence for one group of subjects (group A) and were randomly selected for another group (group B). In the transfer phase, arm movements were used to press keys on a substantially larger keyboard, and for both groups, the stimuli followed the sequence. Behavioral indices provided clear evidence of learning during the acquisition phase for group A and transfer when switched to the large keyboard. Sequence acquisition was associated with learning-related increases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in a network of areas in the contralateral left hemisphere, including sensorimotor cortex, supplementary motor area, and rostral inferior parietal cortex. After transfer, activity in inferior parietal cortex remained high, suggesting that this area had encoded the sequence at an abstract level independent of the particular effectors used to perform the task. In contrast, activity in sensorimotor cortex shifted to a more dorsal locus, consistent with motor cortex somatotopy. Thus, activity here was effector-specific. An increase in rCBF was also observed in the cingulate motor area at transfer, suggesting a role linking the abstract sequential representations with the task-relevant effector system. These results highlight a network of areas involved in sequence encoding and retrieval.
