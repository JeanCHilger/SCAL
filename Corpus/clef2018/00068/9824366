The use of imaging studies in the diagnosis and management of thyroid cancer and hyperparathyroidism. With the variety of radiopharmaceutical agents and refined imaging techniques, thyroid and parathyroid imaging provides much valuable clinical information. The use of imaging is most important in the follow-up of differentiated (DTC) and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Patients with DTC are followed with serum thyroidglobulin and 131I whole body scintigraphy when the serum thyroglobulin level is elevated. When the 131I scintigram is negative, 201Tl scintigraphy may best identify the site of recurrent DTC. Alternative radioisotopes, ultrasound, CT, and FDG PET are also useful in localizing the site of DTC metastases. MTC recurrences and metastases are more difficult to image. Selective venous catheterization is the most sensitive and specific method for detecting areas of recurrent MTC. High-resolution ultrasound, CT, MR imaging, and scintigraphy are all capable of, and useful in, detecting macroscopic foci of metastatic tumor. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and 99mTc DMSA have been the most frequently used nuclear imaging agents in patients with recurrent MTC. Imaging for hyperparathyroidism remains controversial. Sestambi has become the preferred isotope for parathyroid scintigraphy whereas high-resolution ultrasound is also frequently used. Preoperative imaging is being used as a method to allow a unilateral neck exploration, more recently, in conjunction with intraoperative 1-84 PTH assay and with intraoperative use of the gamma probe. Most often, parathyroid imaging is performed before reoperation for persistent hyperparathyroidism.
