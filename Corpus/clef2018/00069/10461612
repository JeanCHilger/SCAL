An introduction to attenuation correction. Attenuation correction techniques have demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy and quality of myocardial perfusion SPECT images in limited studies. The future success of these methods relies largely on understanding the characteristics of the images and their interpretative meaning, as well as their limitations. It will be important to define the impact on patient management decisions, quantitation, laboratory efficiency physician confidence, and communication of important findings. Advances in these areas will help position nuclear cardiology to compete with other imaging modalities. As this technology matures, the technologist has an essential role in ensuring efficient use of these techniques and maximizing the quality of this promising new way to image patients.
