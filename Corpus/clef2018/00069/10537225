Myocardial meta-[125l]iodobenzylguanidine uptake in awake genetically hypertensive rats at different ages: an autoradiographic study. The purpose of this work was to evaluate changes in myocardial meta-[125I]iodobenzylguanidine ([125I]MIBG) uptake and distribution with age in awake spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with respect to Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Rats were randomly divided into two groups, one for measuring myocardial [125I]MIBG uptake and distribution 4 h after its injection and the second for evaluating myocardial catecholamine concentrations. Mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy index (heart/body weight ratio), and heart rate were significantly higher with increasing age in SHR compared with matched WKY rats. Myocardial catecholamine concentrations and turnover did not differ between the two strains and were significantly decreased with increasing age. Myocardial [125I]MIBG uptake determined by gamma counting was similar in WKY rats and SHR and did not vary significantly with age when expressed as uptake density. However, in both strains of rats, [125I]MIBG uptake determined by autoradiography was significantly greater at the base of the heart than at the apex and midventricular levels, and the uptake values of young rats were significantly higher than those of older rats. In 21-week-old WKY rats and SHR, the highest [125I]MIBG uptake values were found in the right ventricle. Thus, quantitative autoradiography allowed detection of significant changes in myocardial [125I]MIBG uptake and showed its heterogeneous distribution in the rat heart.
