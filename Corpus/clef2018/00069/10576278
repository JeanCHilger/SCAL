Preliminary investigation of the vitamin D status of pet rabbits. The plasma concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-(OH)2D3) (vitamin D3) were measured in blood samples taken from one wild rabbit and 13 pet rabbits at different times of the year. Some pet rabbits had low or undetectable plasma concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3 especially if they were kept in hutches. Rabbits with more access to sunlight had higher concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3.
