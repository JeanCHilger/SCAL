Self-initiated versus externally triggered movements. II. The effect of movement predictability on regional cerebral blood flow. Event-related potential studies in man suggest a role for the supplementary motor area (SMA) in movement preparation, particularly when movements are internally generated. In a previous study combining PET with recording of movement-related cortical potentials, we found similar SMA activation and early pre-movement negativity during self-initiated and predictably paced index finger extensions. Early pre-movement negativity was absent when finger movements were paced by unpredictable cues. We postulated that preparation preceding self-initiated and predictably cued movements was responsible for equivalent levels of SMA activation in these two conditions. To test this, we have performed further studies on six normal volunteers with H2(15)O-PET. Twelve measurements of regional cerebral blood flow were made in each subject under three conditions: rest self-initiated right index finger extension at a variable rate of once every 2-7 s
