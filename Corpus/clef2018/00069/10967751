Clinical staging of esophageal carcinoma. CT, EUS, and PET. CT is readily available to all patients. It is relatively inexpensive and fees are usually reimbursed. It provides exquisite anatomic detail of the chest and abdomen in patients with esophageal cancer. The only reliable use of CT in the determination of T is the exclusion of T4 tumors, which is suggested by the preservation of fat planes. Enlarged lymph nodes are suspicious for metastatic disease but require further study or tissue sampling if nodal metastases will determine treatment. Its major use is in the detection of distant metastatic disease however, 30% to 60% of distant metastases may be radiographically occult. There is a significant learning curve for EUS staging of esophageal cancer. It is suggested that this study be performed at institutions where there is a dedicated, experienced endoscopic ultrasonographer with adequate instrumentation that allows specialty imaging and EUS-FNA. EUS is the best means of clinically determining T. The addition of EUS-FNA to routine EUS evaluation of lymph nodes allows an accuracy similar to the EUS determination of T. EUS has no purpose in assessment of non-nodal distant metastatic disease
