Assessment of coronary flow reserve using fast velocity-encoded cine MR imaging: validation study using positron emission tomography. Previous studies using intravascular Doppler sonography and positron emission tomography (PET) have shown that the hemodynamic significance of coronary artery stenosis can be evaluated by measuring coronary flow reserve. The purpose of this study was to assess whether MR imaging measurements of coronary flow reserve in the left anterior descending artery are comparable with those obtained with PET in the corresponding territory.MR imaging and PET flow measurements were obtained in 10 healthy volunteers. Blood flow velocity in the left anterior descending artery was measured with breath-hold velocity-encoded cine MR imaging before and after IV administration of dipyridamole. The coronary flow velocity reserve measured by MR imaging was compared with the myocardial perfusion reserve in the anterior myocardium quantified on using PET and (15)O-labeled water.The average flow velocity reserve in the left anterior descending artery measured on MR imaging was 2.44+/-1.14 in healthy volunteers, which was comparable with the myocardial perfusion reserve measured by PET (2.52+/-0.84). MR imaging and PET measurements of the coronary flow reserve showed a significant correlation (r = 0.79, p<0.01).MR imaging measurement of the flow velocity reserve in the proximal left anterior descending artery correlates well with the myocardial perfusion reserve obtained with PET and (15)O-labeled water.
