Protein kinase G reverses all isoproterenol induced changes of cardiac single L-type calcium channel gating. cGMP reduces the effect of beta-adrenoceptor agonists on cardiac L-type calcium current by protein kinase G activation. Stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors increases protein kinase A dependent phosphorylation of L-type calcium channels via cAMP. At the single channel level, protein kinase A dependent phosphorylation increases both availability and open probability. The present study investigates how cGMP antagonises protein kinase A induced changes of single L-type calcium channel gating.Single L-type calcium channels were recorded in the cell attached configuration of the patch clamp technique in isolated mouse ventricular myocytes.The beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol (10(-6) M) enhanced single channel peak average current by increasing availability and open probability and decreasing the time constant of long close times. 8-Br-cGMP (10(-3) M) completely reversed these effects. The phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (10(-6) M) did not influence the effect of 8-Br-cGMP. The protein kinase G inhibitor Rp-8Br-PET-cGMPS (10(-7) M) abated the effect of 8-Br-cGMP. Activation of protein kinase A by the hydrolysis-resistant cAMP derivative 8-Br-cAMP (10(-3) M) enhanced L-type calcium channel activity like isoproterenol and its effect was also reversed by 8-Br-cGMP.8-Br cGMP diminishes beta-adrenoceptor activation of L-type calcium channels via protein kinase G. It interacts with the beta-adrenoceptor signaling pathway distal of adenylyl cyclase. Our observations suggest that protein kinase G interacts either with protein kinase A or directly with the L-type calcium channel.
