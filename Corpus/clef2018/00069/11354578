Effects of transmyocardial revascularization on myocardial perfusion and systolic function assessed by nuclear and magnetic resonance imaging methods. There is no obvious explanation, except placebo, to the symptomatic effect of transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMR) in patients with refractory angina. Whether TMR improves myocardial perfusion or relieves symptoms without altering cardiac function is not clarified.One hundred patients with refractory angina were randomized 1:1 to TMR (CO2 laser) and medical treatment, or medical treatment alone. Technetium 99m (99mTc)-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion tomography (SPECT), quantitative myocardial perfusion gated SPECT (QGSPECT), technetium 99m (99mTc) multiple gated acquisition radionuclide ventriculografi (MUGA) and cine-magnetic resonance imaging (cine-MRI) were performed at baseline and after 3 and 12 months.Following TMR, a slight reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p < 0.05) was observed (MUGA and QGSPECT) compared to baseline. Inclusion of incomplete studies (QGSPECT) revealed a significant reduction in LVEF and increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) (p < 0.05) compared to a control group. Otherwise, no between-group comparisons showed statistically significant differences.TMR did not improve myocardial perfusion, but led to a reduction in LVEF and increase in LVEDV, however not significantly different from the control group.
