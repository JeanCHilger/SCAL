Photon shielding for a positron emission tomography suite. This paper provides information on the effects of distance and attenuation in lead sheet and gypsum board of the 0.511 MeV photon produced by positron annihilation. Exposure rates are projected external to an adult injected with 185 MBq (5 mCi) of 18F in a fluorodeoxyglucose solution and for the same activity in a small unshielded container. These data have been applied to estimate the shielding requirements for the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) suite operated by the Nuclear Medicine Department of Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center. To assure that exposures are as low as reasonably achievable, lead was added to the walls of the room where the 18F is stored, handled, and injected into the patients. The PET scanner is installed in a room that formerly contained a Computerized Axial Tomography scanner the existing 1.6 mm of lead sheet was left in place even though it is not required for personnel protection. During the initial phase of operation, a shield test program was conducted to estimate annual exposures to personnel inside and outside the suite. Projection of measured rates over a year of operation demonstrate that whole body doses are well below regulatory limits.
