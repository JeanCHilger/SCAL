Changes of regional cerebral blood flow in stroke patients assessed by SPECT. The aim of our work was to evaluate changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with TIA and/or completed stroke and localisation of fotopenic foci in basal conditions and, in some cases, after stimulation pharmacological trial with acetazolamide. One hundred and fifty three patients participated in the study--105 with completed stroke and 48 with TIA. Regional CBF (rCBF) was evaluated using a single-headed rotating gamma camera (Diacam, Siemens) with high resolution collimator, after injection of 740 MBq 99mTc-HMPAO (Ceretec, Amersham). Sixteen patients with TIA underwent SPECT at baseline and after injection of acetazolamide (ACZ). Relative regional perfusion was expressed as the ratio of cerebral/cerebellar activity. In the completed stroke population, the perfusion ratios were significantly lower than those of controls and TIA at baseline (p < 0.001) and TIA after ACZ (p < 0.01).This study shows a significant difference in rCBF in patients with completed stroke and/or TIA and controls. In patients with TIA and rCBF similar to that observed in controls, perfusion deficits may be visible after ACZ injection.
