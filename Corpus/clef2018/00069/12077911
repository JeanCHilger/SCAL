Diagnostic possibilities of positron emission tomography in oncologic pulmonology. The authors present the possibilities of applying positron emission tomography (PET) in oncopulmonology. In addition to reviewing the literature, they share their own experience obtained during the diagnostic work-up and follow-up of twenty-three patients. The basic indications and the relevant properties of the most frequently used radiopharmaceuticals are discussed. Finally, the authors raise the question of cost-effectiveness of PET-investigations vs. conventional techniques, and suggest possible algorithms to include this non-invasive imaging method in the diagnostic work-up of patients with malignant or benign pulmonary diseases.
