PET scan in patients with epipharyngeal tumors. Whole-body FDG PET examinations in 10 cases of epipharyngeal tumour (8 males, 2 females, mean age: 48 years) have been performed since January 1999. The PET examinations were aimed at the accurate staging, follow-up of the patients after the treatment, identification of recurrencies and localization of the unknown primary tumor. Functional imaging resulted in "upstaging" in 3 patients as compared to staging by the conventional diagnostic tools. Four additional patients with hyperplastic epipharyngeal tissue were investigated for occult primary cancer after negative results of multiple excisions, resulting in one case of primary epipharyngeal cancer. Correct staging, early detection of recurrencies, localization of occult primary tumor and the better post-therapeutic assessment of epipharyngeal masses all facilitate a more reasonable therapeutic approach, which may improve survival results.
