Detection of recurrent head and neck cancer with positron emission tomography. Differentiation between recurrence and post-therapeutic lesions in patients with previously treated head and neck cancer can be a real diagnostic problem. The authors discuss the role of positron emission tomography in restaging of this disease by a retrospective analysis based on 20 scans of 17 patients. PET findings were correct in identifying tumors in 85% of patients (11/13) in the group of positive PET results. All negative PET findings (4/4) were also correct during the follow-up. PET results were validated in 88% (15/17) of the patients. In one case silent distant metastases were also detected. PET is a reliable method in restaging previously treated head and neck cancer patients as it can differentiate post-therapeutic changes from tumor relapse.
