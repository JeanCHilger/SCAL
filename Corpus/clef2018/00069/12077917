The role of FDG-PET scan in the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. In 22 patients with focal pancreatic lesions, the values of different diagnostic modalities were analysed for the evaluation of malignancy. The CA 19-9 level was elevated in 4/5 malignant cases (sensitivity: 80%) and in 4/15 of benign cases (specificity: 73%). Hypodensity/hypoechogeneity was considered to be the characteristic sign of malignancy during CT/ultrasound (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 50%/47%). ERCP was found to be specific but not sensitive enough and the rate of unsuccessful investigations was relatively high (4/22). The diagnostic value of FDG-PET was found to be superior to other diagnostic modalities (sensitivity 100%, specificity 88%). In cases with focal pancreatic hypoechogenic/hypodense lesions detected by CT or US in suspicion of malignancy, the FDG-PET should be the next step in the diagnostic strategy.
