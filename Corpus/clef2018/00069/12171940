Characterization of COX19, a widely distributed gene required for expression of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. COX19, a nuclear gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was cloned by transformation of a respiratory-deficient mutant from complementation group G188 of a pet mutant collection. The gene codes for an 11-kDa protein (Cox19p) required for expression of cytochrome oxidase. Because cox19 mutants are able to synthesize the mitochondrial and nuclear gene products of cytochrome oxidase, Cox19p probably functions post-translationally during assembly of the enzyme. Cox19p is present in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it exists as a soluble intermembrane protein. This dual location is similar to what was previously reported for Cox17p, a low molecular weight copper protein thought to be required for maturation of the CuA center of subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase. The similarity in their subcellular distribution, combined with the presence of four cysteines in Cox19p that align with a subset of the cysteines in Cox17p, suggests that like the latter, Cox19p may function in metal transport to mitochondria.
