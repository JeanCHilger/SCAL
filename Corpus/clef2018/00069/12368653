Matching gene expression with hypometabolism after cerebral ischemia in the nonhuman primate. To correlate brain metabolic status with the molecular events during cerebral ischemia, a cDNA array was performed after positron emission tomography scanning in a model of focal cerebral ischemia in baboons. Cluster analysis for the expression of 74 genes allowed the identification of 4 groups of genes. In each of the distinct groups, the authors observed a marked inflection in the pattern of gene expression when the CMRo was reduced by 48% to 66%. These patterns of coordinated modifications in gene expression could define molecular checkpoints for the development of an ischemic infarct and a molecular definition of the penumbra.
