Measurement of cerebral perfusion volume and 99mTc-HMPAO uptake using SPECT in controls and patients with Alzheimer's disease. Methods for quantifying the changes in brain function observed in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using hexamethylenepropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) for patients with Alzheimer's disease have the potential of improving the diagnostic accuracy of the procedure and its ability to monitor response to treatment. The absolute percentage uptake of HMPAO and the cerebral perfusion volume (CPV) of the brain were assessed using SPECT in 26 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 24 control subjects. A subset of 15 control subjects, which was age-matched to the AD patients, was selected to allow fair statistical comparison of parameters between groups. The percentage of brain volume with reduced perfusion (R) and a volume loss index (VLI), given by /CPV, were also calculated. Eight of the control subjects were studied on a second occasion after a mean period of 6 months. There was no significant difference in percentage uptake between controls and AD patients, the mean value being 5.8%. Cerebral perfusion volume in controls was found to depend on sex (mean value in males and females being 1327 ml and 1222 ml, respectively) and on age. The volume loss index corrected for age and sex provided good discrimination between controls and AD subjects giving a sensitivity and specificity of 81% and 96%, respectively. The repeatability coefficient, the 95% confidence limit for the difference between repeat measurements, on controls was 67 ml (5%). The measurement of cerebral perfusion volume and related indices may be of value in identifying patients with early Alzheimer's disease and in following their response to treatment.
