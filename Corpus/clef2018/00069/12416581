Differential diagnosis in patients with ring-like thallium-201 uptake in brain SPECT. This study was performed to investigate lesions with ring-like thallium-201 (201Tl) uptake and to determine whether SPECT provides any information in differential diagnosis.A total of 244 201Tl SPECT images were reviewed. In each study, early (15 min postinjection) and late (3 hr) brain SPECT images were obtained with 111 MBq of 201Tl. The early uptake ratio (ER lesion to normal brain average count ratio) and the late uptake ratio (LR) and the L/E ratio (ratio of LR to ER) were calculated.Ring-like uptake was observed in pre-therapeutic 26 SPECT images, including ten glioblastoma multiformes (ER, 3.45 +/- 0.64 LR, 2.74 +/- 0.54High ER and high LR in a lesion with ring-like uptake is likely an indicator of meningioma. The LR of brain abscess was significantly lower than that of glioblastoma multiforme, but 201T1 SPECT has still difficulty in differentiating abscess from brain tumor.
