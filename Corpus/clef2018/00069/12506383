Chemistry of phosphine-borane adducts at platinum centers: synthesis and reactivity of PtII complexes with phosphinoborane ligands. Reaction of [Pt(PEt(3))(3)] with the primary and secondary phosphine-borane adducts PhRPH x BH(3) (R=H, Ph) resulted in oxidative addition of a P-H bond at the Pt(0) center to afford the complexes trans-[PtH(PPhR x BH(3))(PEt(3))(2)] (1: R=H 2: R=Ph). The products 1 and 2 were characterized by (1)H, (11)B, (13)C, (31)P, and (195)Pt NMR spectroscopy, and the molecular structures were verified by X-ray crystallography. In both cases, a trans arrangement of the hydride ligand with respect to the phosphidoborane ligand was observed. When 2 was treated with PhPH(2) x BH(3), a novel phosphidoborane ligand-exchange reaction occurred which yielded 1 and Ph(2)PH x BH(3). Treatment of 2 with one equivalent of depe (depe=1,2-bis(diethylphosphino)ethane) resulted in the formation of the complex cis-[PtH(PPh(2) x BH(3))(depe)] (3), in which the hydride ligand and the phosphidoborane ligand are in a cis arrangement. Treatment of 3 with PhPH(2) x BH(3) was found to result in an exchange of the phosphidoborane ligands to give the complex cis-[PtH(PPhH x BH(3))(depe)] (4) and Ph(2)PH x BH(3). Complex 4 was found to undergo further reaction in the presence of PhPH(2) x BH(3) to give meso-cis-[Pt(PPhH x BH(3))(2)(depe)] (5) and rac-cis-[Pt(PPhH x BH(3))(2)(depe)] (6).
