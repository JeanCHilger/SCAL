IWhich are the conditions for Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans-strains from avian excrements as a cause for human infections?. Detection of antigen factors of Cryptococcus with factor sera in slide agglutination confirms diagnosis of species and varieties of Cryptococcus neoformans (Cr. n). This method is important in investigations of sources of infections. Serotype D strains of Cr. neoformans were detected in pigeon breedings from Thuringia exclusively. Because of that an essential difference exists in comparison to human isolates in Germany and strains from breeding stocks of companion birds in Thuringia where serotype A strains are predominant in pet birds and in human infections. Using different primers in PCR fingerprinting Cr. neoformans isolates can be assigned to serotypes A, B, C and D and to varieties Cr. neoformans neoformans and Cr. neoformans gattii (primer FM 1). On the other hand, genetic heterogeneity of Cr. neoformans strains is detectable within the serotypes A and D (primer 60-26). This genetic heterogeneity can be demonstrated in investigations by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, too. Isolated Cr. neoformans strains from pigeons (serotype D) could be divided into 3 and from pet birds (serotype A) into 2 different clusters by FTIR spectroscopy. It is important to take into account heterogeneity of strains within serotypes for determination of infection chains of human disease.
