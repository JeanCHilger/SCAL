Abnormal SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging during periods of obstructive sleep apnea in morbid obese patients without known heart disease. Determine the myocardial perfusion characteristics in obstructive sleep apnea and its possible role in cardiovascular damage.Fourteen patients from the Obesity Clinic weighing less than 130 kg underwent myocardial perfusion studies using single photon emission computed tomography with technetium 99m-labeled sestamibi during nighttime polysomnographic recordings. Coronary angiograms were performed on patients with suspect of severe coronary obstruction according nighttime myocardial perfusion studies or pharmacological stress carried out during waking hours.All 14 patients manifested myocardial perfusion defects during sleep, affecting an average of 5.5 segments/patient, although only 8 presented ischemic ST segment changes and none demonstrated rhythm or conduction disturbances. Angiographic examination of the 10 patients with the most severe perfusion defects did not reveal significant coronary obstruction, and fewer perfusion defects were documented during daytime scintigraphy.In obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea, myocardial perfusion defects appear to occur with highest frequency and severity during nighttime sleep, justifying further investigation in a larger number of patients with obstructive sleep apnea and more significant obesity.
