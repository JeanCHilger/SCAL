Improved prognosis of patients with intermediate- and poor-risk nonseminomatous germ cell tumours by optimizing combined treatment. To assess whether the optimal use of combined treatment with chemotherapy and appropriately timed surgical intervention by a specialized team might improve the outcome for patients with poor- and intermediate-prognosis (International Germ Cell Consensus Classification, IGCCC) nonseminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCTs).Between 1984 and 1998, 47 patients with intermediate (16) and poor prognosis (31) NSGCT were treated 43 had a testicular and four a retroperitoneal primary.Of the 47 patients only seven (15%) had a complete radiological response after primary chemotherapy 36 (77%) required surgery after chemotherapy (29 para-aortic lymphadenectomy, 13 resection of pulmonary metastases, two each excision of supraclavicular and retrocrural lymph nodes and one resection of brain metastasesThe optimal delivery and timing of chemotherapy and surgical resection by a specialist team of oncologists, urological and cardiothoracic surgeons is critical in treating poor-risk NSGCT and might be responsible for improving the outcome of these patients. The detection of residual malignant disease after chemotherapy by positron emission tomography should be investigated to identify those who might benefit from further systemic treatment before complete surgical resection.
