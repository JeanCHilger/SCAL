Correlation of single photon emission computed tomography parameters as a noninvasive alternative to liver biopsies in assessing liver involvement in the setting of HIV and hepatitis C virus coinfection: a multicenter trial of the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group. Performing a liver biopsy in patients infected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is considered the standard of practice to assess hepatic involvement but carries risks to patients. This pilot study was designed to identify single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) parameters that correlate with liver disease stage. HIV-coinfected and HCV-coinfected individuals undergoing a liver biopsy had a SPECT scan performed. The results showed that a number of SPECT parameters were associated with histologic changes in architecture, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, of which two SPECT parameters, the minimum pixel count for spleen region of interest and maximum pixel count for right hepatic lobe, correctly classified 39 of 46 SPECT/biopsy pairs. In conclusion, this pilot trial identified SPECT parameters that correlated with liver histology changes. A larger study is needed to demonstrate whether SPECT parameters alone or with other markers can provide information on fibrosis with the clinical significance obtained through liver biopsy.
