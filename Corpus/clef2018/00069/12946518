Validation of a volumic reconstruction in 4-d echocardiography and gated SPECT using a dynamic cardiac phantom. A dynamic cardiac phantom was used as a reference to compare the volumes reconstructed with 4-D echocardiography and gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). 4-D echocardiography used a new prototype of rotating scan head to acquire ultrasound (US) images during a cardiac cycle, associated with a new protocol (left ventricular 4-D or LV 4-D) to reconstruct the volume deformations of the heart as a function of time. Gated SPECT data were acquired with a standard single-head gamma camera, and the reconstructions were carried out using the Mirage software released by Segami. The influences of different LV 4-D parameters were tested and analyzed. End-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and ejection fraction were measured using both LV 4-D and gated SPECT. Results obtained showed a straight correlation between the two examinations. The agreement confirmed the relevance of the comparisons. This study is an initial step before conducting clinical trials to exhaustively compare the two modalities.
