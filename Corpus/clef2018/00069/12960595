Gamma camera coincidence imaging with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose in the pretreatment evaluation of patients with oesophageal cancer. This study investigated the role of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) dual-head gamma camera coincidence imaging (GCI) in the pretreatment evaluation of patients with oesophageal cancer. Twenty-two patients (20 men mean age, 64 years) with untreated, biopsy proven squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus underwent positron emission tomography (PET) and GCI 1 and 3 h after a single injection of FDG, respectively. Computed tomography (CT) was performed within 2 weeks of the FDG imaging. The sensitivity of lesion detection was compared between GCI and PET. Regional (N) and distant (M) metastases detected by GCI were evaluated with reference to PET and CT. The staging obtained by each modality was also compared with pathological staging in nine patients who underwent surgery. FDG PET detected 22 primary tumours, 34 metastatic lymph nodes and four organ metastases. Of them, GCI detected all primary tumours, 24 (71%) metastatic lymph nodes, and none of the organ metastases. Lymph nodes missed by GCI were smaller in size and the majority of them were located in the thoracic region. GCI provided N and M staging identical to CT and PET in eight patients and improved staging over CT in four patients. On the other hand, GCI missed metastases detected by both PET and CT in five patients. The addition of GCI to CT could improve detection of patients with metastasis to 82% (18/22) compared with 64% (14/22) detected by CT alone. In patients with pathological staging (n = 9), GCI could influence management changes in two patients (22%). In conclusion, FDG GCI has a role that is complementary to CT in the initial staging of patients with oesophageal cancer, and due to the additional detection of nodal metastasis, GCI can provide staging information, which may influence changes in management.
