Technetium-99m-tetrofosmin imaging with incremental nitroglycerin infusion to detect severely ischaemic but viable myocardium: a comparative study with thallium-201. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of incremental nitroglycerin infusion (NTG+Inf) on the myocardial uptake of 99mTc-tetrofosmin (TF) in order to determine whether nitrates enhance the detection of viable myocardium with TF in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and left ventricular dysfunction. Fifty patients (39 males, 11 females 54 +/- 11 years) with previous myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction, who had been referred for coronary revascularization procedures, were studied. Myocardial single-photon emission tomography (SPET) images were obtained 1 h after injection of 750 MBq TF at baseline and after NTG+Inf, using a 2 day protocol. NTG+Inf was performed starting at 0.4 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1), with equal increments every 5 min up to 2 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). Within 1 week of the TF study, rest-redistribution (R-RD) 201Tl SPET was performed after the injection of 111 MBq 201Tl. For each study, quantitative analysis was performed in 17 segments. Viability was defined as the presence of tracer uptake of > 50% of the peak activity on baseline studies or reversibility. There was significant correlation between quantitative regional RD 201Tl activity and TF activity after NTG+Inf (r = 0.90, P < 0.001). Of the 131 segments with severely reduced tracer uptake on resting TF images, 34 (26%) were reversible, showing increased tracer uptake after NTG+Inf (from 41%+/-7% to 57%+/-12% of peak activity
