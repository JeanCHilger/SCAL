Results of displacement studies on benzodiazepine receptors (123I-iomazenil and flumazenil). SPECT studies with 123I-iomazenil were performed in 14 patients with hepatic encephalopathy. The activity concentration in the brain decreases spontaneously by 10 to 20% within 80 min, in the nasal tissue by 35%. After an i.v. injection of 0.1 to 0.5 mg flumazenil a decrease of 29 to 38% is observed within 20 min, with a comparable decrease in white matter and nasal tissue. The application of well-known models of receptor kinetics is therefore impossible.
