Clinical experience and comparative analysis of the standard and fast peritoneal equilibration tests (PET). The fast peritoneal equilibration test (PET) has been proposed as a substitute procedure for the standard PET because it is less expensive and less time consuming since fewer samples must be drawn. This study was undertaken to compare the fast and standard PETs to determine if the fast PET is a viable alternative. Fifteen patients participated in the study. Results from the standard PETs indicate 13 patients had average permeability and 2 patients had high transport. Corresponding fast PETs indicate 10 patients with average permeability, 2 patients with high transport, 1 patient had discrepancies between the D/P ratios and drain volume, and 2 patients were noncompliant and did not complete the fast PET. We conclude that the fast PET is a valid screening tool to evaluate peritoneal membrane permeability in patients who have previously undergone a standard PET. It is cost effective and timesaving. The test is easily invalidated if patients fail to comply with instructions for the test. The fast PET is primarily useful as a screening device to determine whether permeability has changed.
