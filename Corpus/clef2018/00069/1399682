Preparation of 123I-labeled 2'-iodospiperone and imaging of D2 dopamine receptors in the human brain using SPECT. [123I]2'-ISP was readily prepared using a radioiodine exchange reaction with a radiochemical yield of approx. 50% after HPLC purification. The radiochemical purity of the product was more than 98% and the specific activity was 5.55-11.1 GBq/mumol. Biodistribution studies performed in mice indicated that injection of [123I]2'-ISP with albumin produced a higher gastric uptake and a lower brain uptake than injection of the radioligand in a weakly acidic solution. In addition, toxicity tests performed in mice demonstrated that acute toxic effects would be very unlikely to be encountered if 2'-ISP was used for diagnostic purposes. A preliminary imaging study with [123I]2'-ISP in a healthy human volunteer showed its specific uptake by the basal ganglia, a region of the brain known to have a high density of D2 dopamine receptors.
