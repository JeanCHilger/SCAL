Rapid Quantitative Analysis of Individual (18)FDG-PET Scans. To evaluate an objective, quantitative, semi-automatic method of single (18)FDG-PET scan analysis. Scans of 60 normal controls was compared to scans from individuals with known pathology using two methods of visual analysis and Statistical Parametric Mapping with two different smoothing filters. We analyzed the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each technique and evaluated the agreement between the four methods using a kappa statistic. When corrected for false positives, which were due to anatomical distortions, all techniques had a sensitivity and accuracy of 0.5 to 0.6. Specificity was highest, 1.0, using SPM with a 16 mm smoothing filter, followed by visual analyses. Good agreement between all techniques was found. A computerized expert which makes use of a normal data base and SPM to analyze single (18)FDG-PET scans can aid in the routine interpretation of scans and provide rapid, quantification of abnormalities for research or clinical purposes.
