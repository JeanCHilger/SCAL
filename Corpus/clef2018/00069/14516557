Rounded Atelectasis. Evaluation With (18)PET Scan. Rounded atelectasis is a well recognized, benign cause of a pulmonary mass. While its radiographic features have been well characterized in the radiologic literature, they are not pathognomonic and patients are commonly biopsied. Positron emission tomography (PET) has become a powerful tool to distinguish between benign and malignant disease in the thorax. We present the CT and PET imaging features of three cases of biopsy proven rounded atelectasis.
