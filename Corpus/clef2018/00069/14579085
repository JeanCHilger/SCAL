Usefulness of 18F-FDG PET in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Surgical resection is the only curative treatment strategy for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CC). Therefore, accurate staging is essential for appropriate management of patients with CC. We assessed the usefulness of 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy- d-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in the staging of CC. We undertook a retrospective review of FDG PET images in 21 patients (10 female, 11 male mean age 57 years) diagnosed with CC. Ten patients had hilar CC and 11, peripheral CC. Patients underwent abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ( n=20) and computed tomography (CT) ( n=12) for the evaluation of primary tumours, and chest radiography and whole-body bone scintigraphy for work-up of distant metastases. For semi-quantitative analysis, the maximum voxel standardised uptake value (SUV(max)) was obtained from the primary tumour. All peripheral CCs showed intensely increased FDG uptake, and some demonstrated ring-shaped uptake corresponding to peripheral rim enhancement on CT and/or MRI. In nine of the ten patients, hilar CCs demonstrated increased FDG uptake of a focal nodular or linear branching appearance. The remaining case was false negative on FDG PET. One patient with a false negative result on MRI demonstrated increased uptake on FDG PET. Among the ten hilar CCs, FDG uptake was intense in only two patients and was slightly higher than that of the hepatic parenchyma in the remaining patients. For the detection of lymph node metastasis, FDG PET and CT/MRI were concordant in 16 patients, and discordant in five (FDG PET was positive in three, and CT and MRI in two). FDG PET identified unsuspected distant metastases in four of the 21 patients
