Osteoporosis and chronic back pain: a study with single-photon emission computed tomography bone scintigraphy. A group of 26 patients aged 47-81 years (average 67) with spinal osteoporosis and back pain for more than 6 months were investigated with planar and SPECT bone scintigraphy and anterior and lateral x-rays of the thoracolumbar spine. Abnormal activity on bone scintigraphy was found in all patients, of whom 22 had multiple lesions. A total of 17 (65%) patients had abnormal activity associated with collapsed vertebral bodies, 5 (19%) had degenerative disk disease, and 21 (81%) had facetal joint disease. Of 112 lesions identified by SPECT, 60 (54%) were localized to the apophyseal joints. Facetal lesions were commoner in those patients with more collapsed vertebrae, and 32 facetal lesions (54%) were associated with collapse of the vertebra immediately above or below. Bone scintigraphy findings suggest that in some individuals with osteoporosis and chronic back pain, collapse of the vertebral body or degenerative disk disease are causes of pain. However, the high frequency of increased apophyseal joint activity suggests that the facet joint may also be an important site of origin of pain in these individuals. Bone scintigraphy may identify a subgroup of osteoporotic patients with chronic back pain who would benefit from treatment to the facet joints.
