Separation and detection of oxidation products of fluorodeoxyglucose and glucose by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. 2-Deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F] FDG), the most popular positron emitting radiopharmaceutical, may oxidise by autoradiolysis in aqueous solution. The aim of this work was to use LC-MS for determination of the oxidation products of fluorodeoxyglucose and glucose (Glc) obtained by oxidation with Fenton's reagent. Asahipak NH2P-50 polyamide silica column and acetonitrile-0.025% aqueous ammonium formate (80:20 (v/v)) eluent were utilised with an Agilent 1100 HPLC-MS instrument. Ten major oxidation products of FDG and Glc were separated and identified by mass spectrometry: 2-fluorogluconic acid, 2-fluoroglucuronic acid, 2-oxoerythronic acid, arabinose, arabonic acid, araburonic acid, erythrose, erythrulose, gluconic acid, and glucuronic acid. The most intensive electrospray ionisation signals were found in the negative ion spectra and were due to HCOO- adducts, the other acids being in their lactone forms.
