Synthesis and biological evaluation of [11C]talopram and [11C]talsupram: candidate PET ligands for the norepinephrine transporter. PET and SPECT ligands for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) will be important tools for studying the physiology, pathophysiology and pharmacology of the CNS noradrenergic system in vivo. A series of candidate NET ligands were synthesized and characterized in terms of their affinity for human monoamine transporters. The two most promising compounds, talopram and talsupram, were radiolabeled with carbon-11 and evaluated through biodistribution studies in rats and PET imaging studies in a rhesus monkey. Although both compounds displayed high affinity and selectivity for the human NET in vitro, these compounds did not enter the CNS in adequate amounts to be used in PET imaging studies.
