A PET imaging agent with fast kinetics: synthesis and in vivo evaluation of the serotonin transporter ligand [11C]2-[2-dimethylaminomethylphenylthio)]-5-fluorophenylamine ([11C]AFA). A new serotonin transporter (SERT) ligand, [11C]2-[2-(dimethylaminomethylphenylthio)]-5-fluorophenylamine (10, [11C]AFA), was synthesized and evaluated as a candidate PET radioligand in pharmacological and pharmacokinetic studies. As a PET radioligand, AFA (8) can be labeled with either C-11 or F-18. In vitro, AFA displayed high affinity for SERT (Ki 1.46 +/- 0.15 nM) and lower affinity for norepinephrine transporter (NET, Ki 141.7 +/- 47.4 nM) or dopamine transporter (DAT, Ki > 10,000 nM). [11C]AFA (10) was prepared from its monomethylamino precursor 9 by reaction with high specific activity [11C]methyl iodide. Radiochemical yield was 43 +/- 20% based on [11C]methyl iodide at end of bombardment (EOB, n = 10) and specific activity was 2,129 +/- 1,369 Ci/mmol at end of synthesis (EOS, n = 10). Biodistribution studies in rats indicated that [11C]AFA accumulated in brain regions known to contain high concentrations of SERT. Binding in SERT-rich brain regions was reduced significantly by pretreatment with either the cold compound 8 or with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram, but not by the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor nisoxetine, thus underlining its in vivo binding selectivity and specificity for SERT. Imaging experiments in baboons demonstrated that the uptake pattern of [11C]AFA in the baboon brain is consistent with the known distribution of SERT, with highest activity levels in the midbrain and thalamus, followed by striatum, hippocampus, and cortical regions. Activity levels in the baboon brain peaked at 15-40 min after radioligand injection, indicating a fast uptake kinetics for [11C]AFA. Pretreatment of the baboon with citalopram (4 mg/kg) significantly reduced the specific binding of [11C]AFA in all SERT-containing brain regions. Kinetic analysis revealed that the regional equilibrium specific to non-specific partition coefficients (V3") of [11C]AFA are similar to those of [11C]McN5652, but lower than those of [11C]AFM or [11C]DASB. In summary, [11C]AFA appears to be an appropriate PET radioligand with a fast brain uptake kinetics:
