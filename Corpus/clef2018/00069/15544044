Therapeutic angiogenesis for severe ischemic heart diseases by autologous bone marrow cells transplantation. Conventional therapies for severe ischemic heart disease are limited in applicability. While several angiogenesis researches have shown novel efficacy, safety and feasibility for clinical use, recently we have started the clinical trial of a sole cell therapy using autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells transplantation targeted into ischemic hibernating myocardium. Here, we review the background of bone marrow cell research and introduce therapeutic angiogenesis for severe ischemic heart disease by autologous bone marrow cells transplantation.
