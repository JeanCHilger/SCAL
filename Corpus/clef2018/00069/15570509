Differences in cerebral glucose metabolism between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. To describe differences in cerebral glucose metabolism between frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).14 patients with FTLD (7 f/7 m, mean age 60.1 years) and 14 patients with AD (7 f/7 m, mean age 59.5 years) were examined. [18F]FDG positron emission tomography (PET) scans were analysed with statistical nonparametric mapping (SnPM) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM99).Significant decreases in glucose metabolism in FTLD compared to AD were detected in the left insula/left inferior frontal gyrus (Brodman area [BA]13, 45 and 47) and in the medial frontal gyrus bilaterally (BA10). A significant decrease in AD compared to FTLD was identified in the right middle temporal gyrus (BA39).Cerebral PET could be a promising tool to discriminate FTLD from AD.
