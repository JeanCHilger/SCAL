Truncation artifact suppression in cone-beam radionuclide transmission CT using maximum likelihood techniques: evaluation with human subjects. Transverse image truncation can be a serious problem for human imaging using cone-beam transmission CT (CB-CT) implemented on a conventional rotating gamma camera. If this problem can be solved, CB-CT will be useful for attenuation compensation of SPECT images. This paper presents a reconstruction method to reduce or eliminate the artifacts resulting from the truncation. The method uses a previously published transmission maximum likelihood EM algorithm, adapted to the cone-beam geometry. The reconstruction method is evaluated qualitatively using three human subjects of various dimensions and various degrees of truncation. For the two smaller subjects, with moderate truncation, the maximum likelihood method is very successful, nearly eliminating the artifacts seen with conventional filtered backprojection of truncated geometries. The use of an expanded reconstructed space, which contains the entire transverse slice of the subject, is necessary for optimal truncation removal. For the largest subject investigated, the truncation was substantial, and the artifacts were only partially removed by the maximum likelihood reconstruction. Nonetheless, the images were qualitatively superior to those obtained with filtered backprojection. An added elliptical support prior moderately increased the rate of convergence, and helped to force a reasonable body contour.
