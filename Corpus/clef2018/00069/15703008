Development and psychometric validation of the veterinary service satisfaction questionnaire (VSSQ). In the absence of a widely available, psychometrically tested questionnaire for measuring satisfaction with UK veterinary services, the Veterinary Service Satisfaction Questionnaire (VSSQ) was developed. Items in the first draft were derived from a literature review, guidelines from professional bodies and interviews with pet owners and veterinarians. The questionnaire includes 72 satisfaction items, each with a five-option response format. A total of 183 domestic pet owners from three small animal practices (60% response rate) completed it by mail. Pilot testing and postal completion rates indicate the acceptability and relevance of the VSSQ. Principal components analyses of respondent ratings suggested that the VSSQ can be scored as five scales: general services, staff communication, vet communication, death of pet and vet technical abilities. Six further items are scored separately. Descriptive statistics are provided for individual items and scales. Subgroup differences are explored according to owners' demographic variables. The VSSQ demonstrates preliminary face and content validity, excellent internal consistency reliability in each of the five scales (Cronbach's alpha 0.93-0.97) and good construct validity: those who had recommended the practice to others had significantly higher scores. Scoring guidelines are provided for the VSSQ, which is now ready for use.
