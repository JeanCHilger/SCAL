Clinical experience with a commercially available negative oral contrast medium in PET/CT. To evaluate a commercially available negative oral contrast material for PET/CT.In a prospective series of 49 patients, Mukofalk, which is a vegetarian-based substance, was used as a negative oral contrast medium in whole body PET/CT studies. Mukofalk was administered during a time period of 1.5 hours before the examination. Quality of small bowl distension and eventual pathological tracer uptake in the intestine were evaluated.Distension of the small bowel was excellent or good in 41 (85 %) and poor in 8 (15 %) patients. Mild tracer uptake in the small bowel was observed in 5 patients (10.2 %) and moderate uptake in another 2 patients (4 %). In none of these patients did the F-18 FDG uptake interfere with image interpretation.Mukofalk can be used as a negative oral contrast medium in PET/CT studies.
