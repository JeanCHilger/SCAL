18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography contributes to the diagnosis and management of infections in patients with multiple myeloma: a study of 165 infectious episodes. Correctly identifying infection in cancer patients can be challenging. Limited data suggest that positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) may be useful for diagnosing infection. To determine the role of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of infection in patients with multiple myeloma (MM).The medical records of 248 patients who had FDG-PET performed for MM staging or infection work-up revealing increased uptake at extramedullary sites and/or bones and joints that would be atypical for MM between October 2001 and May 2004 were reviewed to identify infections and evaluate FDG-PET contribution to patient outcome.One hundred sixty-five infections were identified in 143 adults with MM. Infections involved the respiratory tract [99 pneumonia (93), sinusitis (six)], bone, joint and soft tissues [26In patients with MM, FDG-PET is a useful tool for diagnosing and managing infections even in the setting of severe immunosuppression.
