Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry estimates of 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-(18)F-Fluoro-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-bromouracil: PET imaging studies in dogs. This study reports on the biodistribution and radiation estimates of 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-(18)F-fluoro-1-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-bromouracil ((18)F-FBAU), a potential tracer for imaging DNA synthesis.Three normal dogs were intravenously administered (18)F-FBAU and a dynamic PET scan was performed for 60 min over the upper abdomen followed by a whole-body scan for a total of 150 min. Blood samples were collected at stipulated time intervals to evaluate tracer clearance and metabolism. Tissue samples of various organs were analyzed for tracer uptake and DNA incorporation. Dynamic accumulation of the tracer in different organs was derived from reconstructed PET images. The radiation dosimetry of (18)F-FBAU was evaluated using the MIRD method.At 60 min after injection, blood analysis found >90% of the activity in unmetabolized form. At 2 h after injection, (18)F-FBAU uptake was highest in proliferating tissues (mean SUVs: marrow, 2.6 small intestine, 4.0), whereas nonproliferative tissues showed little uptake (mean SUVs: muscle, 0.75These results demonstrate that (18)F-FBAU was resistant to metabolism, readily incorporated into DNA in proliferating tissues, and showed good contrast between organs of variable DNA synthesis. These findings indicate that (18)F-FBAU may find use in measuring DNA synthesis with PET.
