Preoperative evaluation of thyroid nodules with 18FDG-PET/CT. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)FDG-PET/CT) has become an important tool in the postoperative management of de-differentiated thyroid cancer. The utility of this imaging modality in the preoperative assessment of thyroid nodules is unclear. This study was designed to determine whether (18)FDG-PET/CT improves the preoperative diagnosis of thyroid nodules.A total of 31 patients with 48 lesions underwent fine-needle aspiration and (18)FDG-PET/CT before surgical resection of thyroid nodules. PET/CT images were obtained 1 hour after intravenous administration of (18)FDG. Standard uptake values were calculated for regions of increased (18)FDG uptake. CT scans were evaluated to identify thyroid pathology. Final pathologic diagnoses were compared with PET/CT findings.Fifteen of 48 lesions were malignant and 33 were benign. Nine of 15 malignant lesions were (18)FDG-avid (sensitivity 60%). Thirty of 33 benign lesions were (18)FDG-cold (specificity 91%). Positive and negative predictive values were 75% and 83%, respectively.(18)FDG-PET/CT provides a high negative predictive value for malignancy, making this a potentially useful tool in the evaluation of thyroid nodules with indeterminate fine-needle aspiration. However further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to determine the true efficacy of this test.
