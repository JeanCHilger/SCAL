Effect of intramyocardial injection of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells on perfusion, function, and viability in patients with drug-refractory chronic ischemia. Intramyocardial injection of bone marrow cells has been proposed as a new therapeutic option for patients with chronic ischemic heart disease. We investigated whether autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell injection into the myocardium of patients with drug-refractory ischemia reduces anginal symptoms, improves left ventricular (LV) function, increases myocardial perfusion, and alters the extent of scar tissue.In 25 patients (mean age +/- SD, 64 +/- 10 y 21 male) with drug-refractory angina pectoris (Canadian Cardiovascular Society [CCS] class III-IV), despite optimized medical therapy and without options for conventional revascularization, bone marrow was aspirated from the iliac crest. Mononuclear cell injections were targeted at myocardial regions with stress-induced ischemia on gated (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin SPECT. Anginal symptoms were reassessed at 3- and 6-mo follow-up. At baseline and 3-mo follow-up, gated (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin SPECT and (18)F-FDG SPECT were performed to assess LV function, LV volumes, myocardial perfusion (stress and rest, 17-segment model), and extent of scar tissue.Mean CCS score improved from 3.4 +/- 0.6 at baseline to 2.3 +/- 0.6 at 3 mo (P < 0.01) and remained unchanged at 6 mo (2.3 +/- 0.6 P < 0.01 vs. baseline and P = not significant [NS] vs. 3 mo). Gated (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin SPECT demonstrated an increased LV ejection fraction (from 47.6% +/- 13.5% to 54.1% +/- 16.9%Autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell injection in patients with drug-refractory angina and chronic ischemia improves anginal symptoms, increases LV function, and predominantly enhances myocardial stress perfusion in injected segments, whereas the extent of myocardial scar tissue remains unchanged.
