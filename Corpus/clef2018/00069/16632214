Novel imaging techniques in melanoma. Cutaneous melanoma is one of the most deadly malignancies. Although it accounts for approximately 4% of all cancer cases, it ac-counts for approximately 79% of skin cancer-related deaths. In the past few years, the nuclear medicine platform used in the management of melanoma has extended to biochemical and structural imaging. In clinical practice, integrated positron emission tomography/CT devices allow anatomic and metabolic characterization of meta-static disease in a single study. Similarly, more accurate localization of sentinel nodes in a 3-D space now is feasible with hybrid single photon emission CT/CT system. In translational research, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose probes have been designed to optimize the detection of melanoma tumor sites in vivo.
