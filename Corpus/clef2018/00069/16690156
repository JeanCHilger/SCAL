Impact of integrated positron emission tomography and computed tomography on staging and management of gallbladder cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. (1) To evaluate the diagnostic value of integrated positron emission and computed tomography (PET/CT) in comparison with contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT) to detect biliary tract tumors and associated distant and regional lymph node metastases and (2) to evaluate the impact of PET/CT on therapy management.From January 2001 to March 2005, each patient who was treated for a malignancy of the biliary tract underwent PET/CT examination in addition to the standard work-up imaging. Data were prospectively collected and analyzed in comparison with ceCT.Sixty-one patients with malignancies of the biliary tract were included into the study. Diagnosis was proven in all patients either by histology or cytology. PET/CT detected all gallbladder cancers (n=14). PET/CT and ceCT provided a comparable accuracy for the primary intra- (n=14) and extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas (n=33). All distant metastases (12/12) were detected by PET/CT, but only 3/12 by ceCT (p<0.001). Regional lymph node metastases were detected by PET/CT and ceCT in only 12% vs. 24%. PET/CT findings resulted in a change of management in 17% of patients deemed resectable after standard work-up.PET/CT is particularly valuable in detecting unsuspected distant metastases which are not diagnosed by standard imaging. Thus, PET/CT staging has an important impact on selection of adequate therapy.
