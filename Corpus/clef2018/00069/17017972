PET and SPET molecular imaging: focus on serotonin system. Emission tomography techniques and, in particular, positron emission tomography (PET) enable the in vivo study of several physiological and neurochemical variables in human subjects using methods originally developed for quantitative autoradiography. In particular, PET allows one to evaluate in human subjects: (a) the effect of specific neurochemical challenges on regional brain function at rest or under activation (b) the activity of neurotransmitters and the regional expression of specific molecular targets during pathology including their modulation by drug treatment
