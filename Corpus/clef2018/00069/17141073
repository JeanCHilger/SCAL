Setup and characterization of a human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma xenograft model in nude rats. To develop and characterize a new head and neck cancer animal model.A human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) xenograft model in nude rats was established via subcutaneous inoculation of a human-origin HNSCC cell line, SCC-4. The tumor was evaluated for growth characteristics, pathologic features by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, and immunohistochemistry of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging characteristics were studied too.A new HNSCC animal model was successfully established. Tumor sizes reached about 1 cm3 on day 15 after tumor cell inoculation. HE staining pathology has confirmed that this tumor is a typical SCC. EGFR immunohistochemistry demonstrated this tumor model to be strongly EGFR positive. 18F-FDG PET study has shown that 18F-FDG accumulated in tumors.This study has demonstrated that this tumor model is an appropriate HNSCC tumor model for animal studies on HNSCC.
