Prognostic value of tumor architecture, tumor-associated vascular characteristics, and expression of angiogenic molecules in pancreatic endocrine tumors. It is difficult to predict the biological behavior of pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs). Our aim was to evaluate the prognostic significance of certain variables in PETs.The following variables were examined in 37 patients with PETs and then compared with other clinicopathologic characteristics: histologic tumor structure microvessel density (MVD) measured by three different methods, including a unique method involving calculation of solid area MVDThe presence of focal and intensive solid growth of tumor cells (large solid nests P = 0.003), low solid area MVD (P = 0.002), a high endothelial cell proliferation index (EPIThis study has provided novel findings on the prognostic features of tumor architecture and tumor-associated angiogenesis in PETs. CXCL-12 is the first candidate molecule in association with neoangiogenesis in PETs.
