Chronic high frequency stimulation of the posteromedial hypothalamus in facial pain syndromes and behaviour disorders. Chronic high frequency stimulation (HFS) of the posteromedial hypothalamus (PMH) has been the first direct therapeutic application of functional neuroimaging data in a restorative reversible procedure for the treatment of an otherwise refractory neurological condition in fact, the target coordinates for the stereotactic implantation of the electrodes have been provided by positron emission tomography (PET) studies, which were performed during cluster headache attacks. HFS of PMH produced a significant and marked reduction of pain attacks in patients with chronic cluster headache (CCH) and in one patient with short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT). The episodes of violent behaviour and psychomotor agitation during the attacks of CCH supported the idea that the posteromedial hypothalamus could be also involved in the control of aggressiveness
