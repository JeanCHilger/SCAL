Synthesis of novel neutrophil-specific imaging agents for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. A neutrophil-specific peptide, cinnamoyl-F(D)LF(D)LFK (cFLFLFK), was conjugated consecutively with a polyethylene glycol moiety (3.4K) and 2,2',2'',2'''-(1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetrayl)tetraacetic acid (DOTA) to form cFLFLFK-PEG-DOTA. After (64)Cu labeling, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging was successfully able to detect mouse lung inflammation.
