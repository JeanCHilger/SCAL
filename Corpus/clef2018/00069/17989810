Synthesis and electrochemical study of the first tetrazolate hexanuclear rhenium cluster complex. The linkage isomers [Re(6)Se(8)(PEt(3))(5)(1,5-MeN(4)C)](+) and [Re(6)Se(8)(PEt(3))(5)(2,5-MeN(4)C)](+) were generated upon reaction of tetrabutylammonium azide with the corresponding acetonitrile complex, [Re(6)Se(8)(PEt(3))(5)(NCCH(3))](2+) these are the first (tetrazolato)rhenium complexes reported to date.
