The role of imaging in the detection of prostate cancer local recurrence after radiation therapy and surgery. The aim of this article is to review novel MRI and nuclear medicine methods for detecting and planning salvage treatment for prostate cancer local recurrence after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy.Traditional methods for detecting local recurrence (i.e., digital rectal exam or transrectal ultrasound and digital rectal exam or transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy) have limited accuracy in determining the presence and extent of local recurrence and therefore have limited ability to guide salvage therapy. Recent studies indicate that conventional T1 and T2-weighted prostate MRI could improve the detection of recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and salvage treatment planning. Promising new sequences could further increase the accuracy of MRI. In addition, the use of technically improved PET/computed tomography scanners with new tracers like (11)C and (18)F choline and acetate might offer better assessment of recurrent prostate cancer than (18)F-2-fluoro-D-deoxyglucose-PET and monoclonal antibody imaging with the prostate specific membrane antigen antibody (111)In-capromab pendetide (ProstaScint).With systemic therapies for recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy being noncurative, the application of MRI and nuclear medicine modalities can help to identify patients who have isolated local recurrence amenable to salvage treatment.
