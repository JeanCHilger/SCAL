Considerations for laboratory animal imaging center design and setup. In vivo animal imaging is an outstanding noninvasive tool to study the pathophysiology of disease or response to therapy additionally, serial imaging reduces the required number of experimental animals. Because of the tremendous capital investment, we recommend the imaging center be a shared resource to facilitate innovative and productive cross-disciplinary scientific collaborations. A shared center also enables a broader range of imaging, as equipment is often cost prohibitive for smaller facilities. A multitude of factors will determine the architectural design, facility efficiency, and functionality. Important considerations to determine during the planning stages include the types of animals to be imaged, types of imaging studies to be performed, types of imaging equipment and related services to be offered, and the location of the imaging center. Architects must work closely with manufacturers to accommodate equipment-related building specifications
