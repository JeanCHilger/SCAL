Preliminary results of [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine treatment in metastatic carcinoid tumors. The successful use of [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) in the scintigraphic localisation and treatment of several tumors deriving from neuroectoderm has led us to its application in metastatic carcinoid tumors. We selected five patients (two men and three women age range 53-79 years) who showed progression of the disease with severe related symptoms, poor response to traditional therapy and a good uptake of 131I-MIBG in neoplastic tissue. A cumulative radioactivity of 3.7-22.2 GBq was given. All patients had a clear subjective improvement with a better quality of life for a period of 2-36 months, sometimes accompanied by decreased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid urinary excretion. Results concerning objective remission of the disease were unsatisfactory. No remarkable early or late side-effect was noted. We believe 131I-MIBG is useful for symptomatic treatment of metastatic carcinoid in seriously ill patients too. Different treatment schedule and recruitment of patients with less advanced disease could make pathological remission a possible goal.
