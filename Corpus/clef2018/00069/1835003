Atopic and seborrheic dermatitis: practical management. Atopic dermatitis is common and causes sleep loss, a disfiguring appearance, an unpleasant odour, teasing, short stature and restriction of career choice in severe cases. There are no drugs which control the scratching distraction, keeping the nails short and smooth, and the use of mittens at night are all helpful. The sedative action of the older H1 antihistamines makes them useful if scratching prevents a child from falling asleep. Emollients are useful for the associated skin dryness. The least potent topical steroids should be used sparingly to avoid the main hazards of skin atrophy, systemic absorption and growth stunting. Bacterial skin infection with Staphylococcus aureus and sometimes beta-haemolytic streptococci is common and is best treated with oral antibiotics. Herpes simplex virus skin infection is also common
