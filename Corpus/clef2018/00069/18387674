Gastric Helicobacter species as a cause of feline gastric lymphoma: a viable hypothesis. Gastric Helicobacter spp. are associated with chronic inflammation and neoplastic transformation in humans as well as domestic and laboratory species. The present study examined the association of Helicobacter heilmannii (Hhe) infection in pet cats with feline gastric mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Tissues were collected via gastric biopsy or at necropsy from 47 pet cats with clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease, including vomiting and inappetance, and classified as gastritis (14/47), lymphoma (31/37), or normal (2/47). Tissues positive for argyrophilic organisms with Warthin-Starry stain (29/47) were assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for the presence of Hhe strains 1-4 as well as with a fifth probe that detected Helicobacter salomonis, Helicobacter bizzozeronii, or Helicobacter felis. A significant association of positive Warthin-Starry status with Hhe infection was found in cases of sick cats (22/29 p<0.05 by Chi-square
