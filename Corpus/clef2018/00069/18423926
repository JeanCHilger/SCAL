A novel blood-cell-two-compartment model for transferring a whole blood time activity curve to plasma in rodents. The term input function usually refers to the tracer plasma time activity curve (pTAC), which is necessary for quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) studies. The purpose of this study was to acquire the pTAC by independent component analysis (ICA) estimation from the whole blood time activity curve (wTAC) using a novel method, namely the FDG blood-cell-two-compartment model (BCM). This approach was compared to a number of published models, including linear haematocrit (HCT) correction, non-linear HCT correction and two-exponential correction. The results of this study show that the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and the error of the area under curve (EAUC) for the BCM estimate of the pTAC were the smallest. Compartmental and graphic analyses were used to estimate the metabolic rate of the FDG (MR(FDG)). The percentage error for the MR(FDG) (PE(MRFDG)) was estimated from the BCM corrected pTAC and this was also the smallest. It is concluded that the BCM is a better choice when transferring wTAC into pTAC for quantification.
