Cardiac imaging: specific clinical role of newly developed non invasive techniques. Part II: functional evaluation. The non-invasive evaluation of myocardial ischemia is a priority in cardiology. The preferred initial non-invasive test is exercise ECG, because of its high accessibility and its low cost. Stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging or stress echocardiography are now routinely performed, and new non-invasive techniques such as perfusion-MRI, dobutamine stress-MRI or 82rubidium perfusion PET have recently gained acceptance in clinical practice. In the same time, an increasing attention has been accorded to the concept of myocardial viability in the decisional processes in case of ischemic heart failure. In this indication, MRI with late enhancement after intravenous injection of gadolinium and 18F-FDG PET showed an excellent diagnostic accuracy. This article will present these new imaging modalities and their accepted indications.
