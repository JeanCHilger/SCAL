Positron emission tomography in ischaemic stroke: cerebral perfusion and metabolism after stroke onset. PET studies were performed in 37 patients up to 1 month after ischaemic stroke to observe the relationships between cerebral blood flow (CBF), rate of cerebral oxygen metabolism (CMRO(2)) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) with time. PET findings were classified as misery perfusion (two patients), luxury perfusion (15 patients), matched hypoperfusion-hypometabolism (17 patients) or normal (nine patients). Misery perfusion was seen up to 3 days post-stroke, suggesting an extended time window during which at least some tissue may be salvageable. Luxury perfusion, an indication of non-nutritional flow, was seen as early as 30 h and as late as 23 days, but more commonly between 3 and 7 days. A matched reduction of CBF and CMRO(2) was seen during all time periods, but as early as 27 hours. Since this was associated with severely impaired CBF, presumably from the onset of stroke, it can be assumed that the duration of cerebral tissue survival is less than 27 h under these conditions. We inferred that, for maximal tissue recovery, therapy will need to be introduced within 27 h after stroke, but that at least some potential for recovery exists up to 3 days.
