Gamma probes and their use in tumor detection in colorectal cancer.  The purpose of this article is to summarize the role of gamma probes in intraoperative tumor detection in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as provide basic information about the physical and practical characteristics of the gamma probes, and the radiopharmaceuticals used in gamma probe tumor detection. In a significant portion of these studies, radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (Mabs), particularly 125I labeled B72.3 Mab that binds to the TAG-72 antigen, have been used to target tumor. Studies have reported that intraoperative gamma probe radioimmunodetection helps surgeons to localize primary tumor, clearly delineate its resection margins and provide immediate intraoperative staging. Studies also have emphasized the value of intraoperative gamma probe radioimmunodetection in defining the extent of tumor recurrence and finding sub-clinical occult tumors which would assure the surgeons that they have completely removed the tumor burden. However, intraoperative gamma probe radioimmunodetection has not been widely adapted among surgeons because of some constraints associated with this technique. The main difficulty with this technique is the long period of waiting time between Mab injection and surgery. The technique is also laborious and costly. In recent years, Fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) use in gamma probe tumor detection surgery has renewed interest among surgeons. Preliminary studies during surgery have demonstrated that use of FDG in gamma probe tumor detection during surgery is feasible and useful.
