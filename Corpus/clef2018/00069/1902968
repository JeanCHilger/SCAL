Postures and abnormal paroxysmal movements during sleep: hypnogenic paroxysmal dystonia or partial epilepsy?. In recent years, a differentiation has been made between two syndromes that are characterized by brief abnormal paroxysmal movements occurring principally at night: 1, hypnogenic paroxysmal dystonia (HPD), sometimes considered a particular form of dystonia similar to paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis, and 2, mesiofrontal epilepsy. Whether HPD is a distinct syndrome is not clear. Twenty-three patients, 11 men and 12 women, were hospitalized between 1985 and 1989 for examination of this type of abnormal paroxysmal movements (APM) occurring at night. In order to clarify the physiopathology of these abnormal nocturnal movement as focal epilepsy or a particular form of dystonia, we analyzed the personal and familial antecedents of all 23 patients, the polygraphic records during waking and sleep periods, and the results of neuroradiological examinations. Four patients were examined by positron emission tomography (PET) using i8F deoxyglucose. Symptoms first appeared between 3 and 28 years of age (M, 10.1) and developed over 1 to 20 years (M, 10.1). APM clearly occurred more commonly (greater than 90%) during sleep, usually during phases of slow-wave sleep.
