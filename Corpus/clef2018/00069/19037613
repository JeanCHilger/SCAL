Pretreatment with diphenoxylate hydrochloride/atropine sulfate (Lomotil) does not decrease physiologic bowel FDG activity on PET/CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis. Physiologic uptake of 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG) by bowel can confound positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) assessment for abdominal pathology, particularly within the bowel itself. We wished to determine if oral administration of the antimotility agent, Lomotil (5 mg diphenoxylate hydrochloride/0.05 mg atropine sulfate G.D. Searle and Company, a division of Pfizer), prior to PET/CT scanning would reduce physiologic uptake of FDG by the small bowel and colon (lower gastrointestinal [GI] tract).Patients undergoing PET/CT scans for lymphoma were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study and received either 10 mL water (control group) or 10 mL Lomotil (experimental group) orally 30-60 min prior to scanning. Scans were reviewed independently by two blinded experienced readers and scored for the degree of FDG activity in the lower GI tract relative to liver activity.The administration of Lomotil prior to PET/CT scanning did not reduce physiologic FDG activity in the small bowel and colon. In contrast, increased radiotracer uptake by the lower GI tract was observed in the Lomotil group compared to the control group.Pretreatment with Lomotil prior to PET/CT scanning confers no benefit toward the reduction of physiologic FDG uptake by the small bowel and colon.
