Issues in imaging malignant neoplasms of the female reproductive system. Radiological evaluation of malignant neoplasms of the female reproductive system is invaluable in the initial diagnosis, staging, treatment planning, and follow-up management. Radiologists serving as consultants for the general primary care internist, gynecologists, and specialists in gynecologic oncology should be familiar with the strengths and limitations of various modalities used to evaluate gynecologic cancer patients. This article discusses the most common female reproductive tract neoplasms (ie, cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers) and the role of ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography in their diagnosis and management. Imaging features that impact on clinical diagnostic or treatment algorithms are highlighted and illustrated. Finally, recent technical advances that demonstrate promise are described.
