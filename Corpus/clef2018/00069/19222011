Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is one of the current challenges in the neurology. The development of imaging techniques (volumetric and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography), and functional neuroimaging (single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography) in recent years has opened new research fields, and are useful as diagnostic tools.Anyway the diagnosis is still a clinical process, and it should be reconsidered at each visit.
