Population dynamics of Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latrielle, 1806) in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks are distributed throughout the world, especially in those areas in which dogs are in close contact with humans. R. sanguineus and fleas are regarded as the main ectoparasites infesting dogs in Brazil. Besides causing direct damage during the blood feeding process, this tick species can also transmit pathogens to dogs and humans. Despite its importance in Brazil, data regarding the seasonality of R. sanguineus are limited, especially with regard to natural infestations of dogs. The present study aimed to evaluate the seasonality of R. sanguineus on dogs living in Belo Horizonte, state of Minas Gerais. From August 2006 to July 2007, ticks were collected monthly from 12 adult dogs in nine houses, which were located in two districts in the north region of the city. In parallel, canine clients of a pet care department of the small animal veterinary clinic were examined for the presence of ticks before bathing and/or clipping. The climatic data recorded for Belo Horizonte during the experimental period were: mean temperature 18.6 degrees C relative air humidity 56.5%
