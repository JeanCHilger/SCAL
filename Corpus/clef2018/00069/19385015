Robustness of multivariate image analysis assessed by resampling techniques and applied to FDG-PET scans of patients with Alzheimer's disease. For finite and noisy samples extraction of robust features or patterns which are representative of the population is a formidable task in which over-interpretation is not uncommon. In this work, resampling techniques have been applied to a sample of 42 FDG PET brain images of 19 healthy volunteers (HVs) and 23 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients to assess the robustness of image features extracted through principal component analysis (PCA) and Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA). The objective of this work is to: 1) determine the relative variance described by the PCA to the population variance 2) assess the robustness of the PCA to the population sample using the largest principal angle between PCA subspaces
