99Tcm-HMPAO SPECT in suspected dementia. To evaluate the usefulness of 99Tcm-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in suspected dementia we studied 160 consecutively imaged elderly patients from our hospital's memory disorder clinic. The diagnosis was based on clinical data, laboratory tests, neuropsychological examination, computed tomography (CT) and EEG. The patients were divided into six diagnostic categories: Alzheimer's disease (AD), multi-infarct dementia (MID), frontal lobe-type dementia (FTD), vascular encephalopathy not fulfilling the criteria of dementia, specific organic conditions, and psychiatric disorders. SPECT images were assessed without knowing the clinical diagnosis, and divided into AD pattern, FTD pattern, MID pattern, abnormal but unclassifiable, and normal. Twenty-three of 36 patients with clinical AD, 25/33 patients with clinical MID, and 2/5 patients with clinical TFD had compatible SPECT patterns. SPECT distinguished AD from MID in the majority (80%) of cases. In patients with depression or anxiety SPECT was abnormal in 16/21 cases, suggesting that SPECT may give early clues to the presence of an underlying organic disease in such elderly patients. Thus, SPECT with 99Tcm-HMPAO seems to be useful in the diagnosis of suspected dementia.
