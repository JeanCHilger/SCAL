Effect of ketanserin on cerebral blood flow autoregulation in healthy volunteers. The effect of a clinically relevant dose of ketanserin (10 mg as a bolus followed by an infusion of 6 mg/h) on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CBF autoregulation was examined in 12 healthy volunteers. Changes in CBF were estimated by the cerebral arteriovenous-oxygen saturation difference method, while mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was increased by norepinephrine and decreased by ganglionic blockade (trimethaphan camphosulphonate) combined with lower body negative pressure one hour after the infusion of ketanserin. During ketanserin infusion, MABP fell insignificantly by 2.5 mmHg (6 to -2), while CBF rose insignificantly by 5 ml/100 g/min. Autoregulation was preserved in all volunteers. CO2-correction factors from 0 to 4.6% CBF/0.1 kPa were used. The lower limit of CBF autoregulation was 82 mmHg (80-86) with an SE of 3 mmHg (1-5) similar to a previous control group of healthy volunteers. Aside from a major decrease in MABP in one subject, no adverse side effects were observed. The present study shows that CBF autoregulation is maintained during ketanserin infusion.
