Construction of a prokaryotic expression vector for apoptin and preparation of polyclonal antibody of apoptin. To construct a prokaryotic expression vector for apoptin and prepare polyclonal antibody of apoptin.Apoptin gene amplified from pGEM-T/Apoptin plasmid by PCR was cloned into pET-28a (+). E.coli BL21 (DE3) was transformed by the recombinant plasmid, and apoptin protein expression induced by IPTG was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. BALB/c mice were immunized with the protein and the titer of the antibody was determined using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Apoptin gene was successfully cloned into pET-28a (+), and the expression of a protein with relative molecular mass of about 17 000 was identified by SDA-PAGE. After 5 immunizations of the mice with the protein, the blood antibody titer reached 1:5x10(5).The prokaryotic expression vector for apoptin is successfully constructed and the polyclonal antibody of apoptin is obtained, which allows further functional study of apoptin.
