Chrysosporium guarroi sp. nov. a new emerging pathogen of pet green iguanas (Iguana iguana). Chrysosporium guarroi sp. nov. represented by five strains isolated from cases of dermatomycosis in pet green iguanas (Iguana iguana) in Spain, is described and illustrated. This taxon is characterized by its ability to grow at temperatures from 15 to 37 degrees C and by the presence of arthroconidia and aleurioconidia. The latter are unicellular, smooth, pyriform or clavate, sessile or borne at the ends of narrow stalks. The analysis of the sequences of the D1/D2 and ITS regions confirm the separation of this new species from others of the genus Chrysosporium.
