Genetic variations in the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region influence attraction for a favorite person and the associated interactions between the central nervous and immune systems. Limbic system activation that occurs when a person experiences several emotions is primarily represented by the amygdala output that influences autonomic brainstem nuclei that control autonomic nervous function, thus modulating the endocrine and immune systems. Amygdala activity is modulated by the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5HTTLPR) however, whether variations in 5HTTLPR influence central nervous and immune activities in response to positive stimuli remains unclear. Here, we found that seeing a favorite person induced significantly higher amygdala activity in individuals with the 5HTTLPR SS genotype than in others. This activity was positively correlated with changes in the NK cell proportion among peripheral lymphocytes. Thus, 5HTTLPR influences attraction and the associated interactions between the central nervous and immune systems in affectively positive situations.
