Single photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) for functional investigation of the proximal tubule in conscious mice. Noninvasive analysis of renal function in conscious mice is necessary to optimize the use of mouse models. In this study, we evaluated whether single photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) using specific radionuclear tracers can be used to analyze changes in renal proximal tubule functions. The tracers included (99m)TC- dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA), which is used for cortex imaging (99m)Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine ((99m)Tc-MAG3), used for dynamic renography
