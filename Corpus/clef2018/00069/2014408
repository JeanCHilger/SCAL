Women and depression: a Durkheimian perspective. Sex differences in mental disorder rates have been examined from two opposing perspectives. One of these suggests that women have higher rates due to sex role related stress [1. Am. J. Sociol. 78, 812, 1972 2. Gender and Disordered Behavior, p. 23. Brunner/Mazel, New York, 1979]. The other holds that women do not have generally higher rates than men but rather that they manifest different types of psychiatric disorders [3. A. Rev. Psychiat. 25, 417, 1974
