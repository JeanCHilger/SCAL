Effect of hepatic steatosis on liver FDG uptake measured in mean standard uptake values. To evaluate the association between diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver and average fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the liver.Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study the requirement for informed patient consent was waived. Consecutive nonenhanced whole-body hybrid FDG positron emission tomographic (PET)-computed tomographic (CT) scans obtained in 142 patients (mean age, 63.6 yearsThe average SUV(m)for the control group was 2.18 (standard deviation [SD], 0.36 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.12, 2.24). No significant difference was identified when the average SUV(m)for the control group was compared with those for the fatty liver disease (SUV(m), 2.03No association between liver attenuation and FDG uptake measured in terms of SUV(m)was observed. On the basis of these data, it is acceptable to use the liver as a comparator for extrahepatic foci of equivocal increased FDG activity in patients with fatty liver disease. (c) RSNA, 2010.
