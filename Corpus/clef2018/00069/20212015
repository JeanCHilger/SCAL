Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography using Iodine-123 in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer: additional value over whole body planar imaging and SPECT. The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic performance of co-registered single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) compared to Iodine-123 whole body gamma camera (WBGC) imaging and to SPECT alone in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.WBGC and SPECT/CT (n=85) imaging of the neck and thorax was performed in 79 consecutive patients. Three experienced observers reviewed: i) WBGC images followed by ii) SPECT alone, and iii) co-registered SPECT/CT. Foci of increased radioiodine uptake were classified on a five-point scale. Biopsy, other imaging modalities, and clinical follow-up served as the reference standard.Twenty-two patients had local recurrence or metastatic thyroid cancer (11 were radioiodine negative), 9 had remnant thyroid tissue, and 54 had no evidence of disease. When classifying equivocal, probably, and definitely malignant findings as positive for malignancy, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were as follows: 41, 68, 31, and 77% for WBGC imaging 45, 89, 59, and 82% for WBGC plus SPECT imagingThe addition of SPECT/CT significantly improved the diagnostic information over Iodine-123 WBGC imaging and WBGC plus SPECT imaging alone.
