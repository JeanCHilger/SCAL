The role of whole-body imaging in the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is one of the most common hematological malignancies and accounts for significant morbidity and mortality. In the past, detection of myelomatous deposits by radiography was the main method of radiological assessment in this disease. However, in recent years the introduction of whole-body imaging techniques, specifically low-dose whole-body computed tomography, whole-body magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography, has facilitated a more comprehensive assessment of this heterogeneous and often diffuse disease. Each of these whole-body imaging techniques has specific applications and limitations in the assessment of multiple myeloma that the interpreting radiologist and referring clinician need to be aware of. As these techniques gain further acceptance in the radiology and hematology communities, their use in the assessment of multiple myeloma is likely to increase further.
