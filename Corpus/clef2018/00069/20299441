Effects of age on the glucose metabolic changes in mild cognitive impairment. Decreased glucose metabolism in the temporal and parietal lobes on FDG-PET is recognized as an early imaging marker for the AD pathology. Our objective was to investigate the effects of age on FDG-PET findings in aMCI.Twenty-five patients with aMCI at 55-86 years of age (median = 73 years) and 25 age- and sex-matched CN subjects underwent FDG-PET. SPM5 was used to compare the FDG uptake in patients in aMCI-old (>73 years) and aMCI-young (<or=73 years) groups with CN subjects. The findings in the aMCI-old patients were independently validated in a separate cohort of 10 aMCI and 13 CN subjects older than 73 years of age.The pattern of decreased glucose metabolism and gray matter atrophy in the medial temporal, posterior cingulate, precuneus, lateral parietal, and temporal lobes in aMCI-young subjects was consistent with the typical pattern observed in AD. The pattern of glucose metabolic changes in aMCI-old subjects was different, predominantly involving the frontal lobes and the left parietal lobe. Gray matter atrophy in aMCI-old subjects was less pronounced than that in the aMCI-young subjects, involving the hippocampus and the basal forebrain in both hemispheresPathologic heterogeneity may be underlying the absence of AD-like glucose metabolic changes in older compared with younger patients with aMCI. This may be an important consideration for the clinical use of temporoparietal hypometabolism on FDG-PET as a marker for early diagnosis of AD in aMCI.
