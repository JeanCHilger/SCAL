Small-molecule biomarkers for clinical PET imaging of apoptosis. Apoptosis is a fundamental biologic process. Molecular imaging of apoptosis in vivo may have important implications for clinical practice, assisting in early detection of disease, monitoring of disease course, assessment of treatment efficacy, or development of new therapies. Although a PET probe for clinical imaging of apoptosis would be highly desirable, this is yet an unachieved goal, mainly because of the required challenging integration of various features, including sensitive and selective detection of the apoptotic cells, clinical aspects such as favorable biodistribution and safety profiles, and compatibility with the radiochemistry and imaging routines of clinical PET centers. Several approaches are being developed to address this challenge, all based on novel small-molecule structures targeting various steps of the apoptotic cascade. This novel concept of small-molecule PET probes for apoptosis is the focus of this review.
