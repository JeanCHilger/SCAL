Labeling of histamine H1-receptors in vivo: a compartment model analysis and positron emission tomographic imaging. Binding of [3H]-pyrilamine to guinea-pig brain in vivo was studied and analyzed kinetically on the basis of a four-compartment model to establish the method of analysis for the in vivo binding. The pharmacological properties of the [3H]-pyrilamine binding in vivo were similar to those of the in vitro binding to brain homogenate. The distribution of histamine H1-receptors in dog brain, which was obtained by positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]-pyrilamine or doxepin as a tracer, was in good correlation to that obtained by the in vitro binding method. We finally applied this in vivo binding method to a living healthy human to reveal the distribution of H1-receptor in the brain.
