3D PIB and CSF biomarker associations with hippocampal atrophy in ADNI subjects. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of Ab and tau, Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) imaging and hippocampal atrophy are promising Alzheimer's disease biomarkers yet the associations between them are not known. We applied a validated, automated hippocampal labeling method and 3D radial distance mapping to the 1.5T structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 388 ADNI subjects with baseline CSF Ab(42), total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau(181)) and 98 subjects with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using PIB. We used linear regression to investigate associations between hippocampal atrophy and average cortical, parietal and precuneal PIB standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and CSF Ab(42), t-tau, p-tau(181), t-tau/Ab(42) and p-tau(181)/Ab(42). All CSF measures showed significant associations with hippocampal volume and radial distance in the pooled sample. Strongest correlations were seen for p-tau(181), followed by p-tau(181)/Ab(42) ratio, t-tau/Ab(42) ratio, t-tau and Ab(42). p-tau(181) showed stronger correlation in ApoE4 carriers, while t-tau showed stronger correlation in ApoE4 noncarriers. Of the 3 PIB measures the precuneal SUVR showed strongest associations with hippocampal atrophy.
