Near-IR core-substituted naphthalenediimide fluorescent chemosensors for zinc ions: ligand effects on PET and ICT channels. Near-IR (NIR) emission can offer distinct advantages for both in vitro and in vivo biological applications. Two NIR fluorescent turn-on sensors N,N'-di-n-butyl-2-(N-{2-[bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)amino]ethyl})-6-(N-piperidinyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid bisimide and N,N'-di- n-butyl-2-[N,N,N'-tri(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)amino]ethyl-6-(N-piperidinyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid bisimide (PND and PNT) for Zn(2+) based on naphthalenediimide fluorophore are reported. Our strategy was to choose core-substituted naphthalenediimide (NDI) as a novel NIR fluorophore and N,N-di(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine (DPEA) or N,N,N'-tri(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine (TPEA) as the receptor, respectively, so as to improve the selectivity to Zn(2+). In the case of PND, the negligible shift in absorption and emission spectra is strongly suggestive that the secondary nitrogen atom (directly connected to the NDI moiety, N(1)) is little disturbed with Zn(2+). The fluorescence enhancement of PND with Zn(2+) titration is dominated with a typical photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) process. In contrast, the N(1) atom for PNT can participate in the coordination of Zn(2+) ion, diminishing the electron delocalization of the NDI moiety and resulting in intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) disturbance. For PNT, the distinct blueshift in both absorbance and fluorescence is indicative of a combination of PET and ICT processes, which unexpectedly decreases the sensitivity to Zn(2+). Due to the differential binding mode caused by the ligand effect, PND shows excellent selectivity to Zn(2+) over other metal ions, with a larger fluorescent enhancement centered at 650 nm. Also both PND and PNT were successfully used to image intracellular Zn(2+) ions in the living KB cells.
