A Case Report Demonstrating Unambiguous Clinical Utility of Pet/CT Scanning in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer. There has been discussion and debate in the medical literature regarding the clinical value of PET/CT scans in ovarian cancer, particularly focusing on evidence whether the technology is of predictive versus solely prognostic utility. In the somewhat unusual case reported here, the results of the PET/CT scan were extremely helpful in developing a rational management strategy. The case emphasizes the critical need to specifically address the issue of whether data generated from an expensive diagnostic test will be useful in an individual patient's management before it is obtained.
