Diagnosis and management of giant cell arteritis: a review. This article aims to provide a review of giant cell arteritis (GCA) clinical features, differential diagnosis, treatment options, and recent literature.GCA, first described by Horton et al., is a systemic immune-mediated vasculitis affecting medium-sized and large-sized arteries. Characteristic findings include headache, jaw claudication, visual loss, and constitutional symptoms (malaise, fever, weight loss, loss of appetite). Localized GCA symptoms are the end-result of vascular insufficiency and tissue ischemia. Temporal artery biopsy (TAB) remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Additional diagnostic tests include blood tests (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ESR C-reactive protein, CRPFurther research is warranted concerning the immunogenetics of GCA. Further treatment trials are also needed to develop more specific and sensitive diagnostic tests and new corticosteroid-sparing treatment modalities.
