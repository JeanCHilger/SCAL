Pyridyl-Cyclopentadiene Re(CO)(2) Complexes as a Compact Core Systems for SPECT Ligand Development. An η(1) η(5)-rhenium complex has been prepared, starting from a CpRe(CO)(3) complex substituted with a pendant aromatic amine. This unique complex has potential application as a surrogate for a technetium-99m complex, a common radioisotope for biomedical imaging applications. Chelation occurred via photochemical decarbonylation of the rhenium, which opened a binding-site for the aromatic amine.
