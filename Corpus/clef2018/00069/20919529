The role of PET scanning in pancreatic cancer. The strength of functional imaging lies in its ability to detect malignant disease irrespective of lesion morphology. In this setting, 18FDG-PET can complement management by providing a more accurate diagnosis. When combined as an adjunct to CT, 18FDG-PET can increase the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for detecting a pancreatic malignancy, especially in patients in whom CT alone fails to identify a discrete mass or in whom biopsy results are indeterminate. This capability is accentuated with small lesions of the pancreas. 18FDG-PET is significantly more sensitive in detecting metastatic disease than conventional CT imaging. Moreover, 18FDG-PET is able to differentiate tumor response to therapy in the postoperative setting, and could potentially serve to monitor recurrence patterns in the setting of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Finally, as 18FDG-PET/CT fusion modalities become more widespread and technical advances in image acquisition progress, 18FDG-PET will continue to have an increasing role in the diagnosis, staging, and surveillance of pancreatic cancer, integrating anatomic information with functional imaging.
