Factor analysis of ventricular contraction using SPECT-ERNA images. Equilibrium radionuclide angiography images (ERNA) has been established as a useful modality for clinical evaluation of the ventricular function. Tomographic acquisition of ERNA (SPECT-ERNA) improves the quantification of ventricular function with planar ERNA, avoiding both the overlap of structures and the need of defining the best septal view which can be difficult in dilated ventricles. In this work we analyze the contribution and distribution of the most significant factors of dynamic structures (FADS), and propose an index based on the characterization of the normal contraction pattern, to quantify the ventricular contraction normality in a set of patients with clinical diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) using SPECT-ERNA. The statistical analysis shows significant differences between normal and PAH subjects in the models of left ventricle (LV) contraction pattern. This comparison shows that the LV has an abnormal contraction as a consequence of the pulmonary arterial hypertension.
