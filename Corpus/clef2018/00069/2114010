Positron emission tomographic studies on cerebral hemodynamics in patients with cerebral contusion. Positron emission tomography is currently one of the most useful methods for measurements of cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism, because it facilitates accurate analysis of the local cerebral circulation in three-dimensional quantitative images. In this study, we performed positron emission tomography studies to measure cerebral circulation in a total of 11 patients who sustained head injuries with contusion. Several parameters were measured including regional cerebral blood flow, regional cerebral blood volume, permeability, and regional cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen. Data from brains both with and without contusion were analyzed for chronological changes, in the subacute stage from the 8th to 29th day and in the chronic stage until 360 days after the injury and compared with similar data in a group of normal subjects. It was concluded that in the subacute stage, regional cerebral blood flow decreased (26 +/- 7 and 39 +/- 10 ml/100 g/min) and regional cerebral blood volume increased (5.6 +/- 1.8 and 5.4 +/- 0.9 ml/100 g) both in areas of cerebral contusion and in areas remote from cerebral contusion and that permeability increased in areas of contusion but not in remote brain areas. In the chronic stage, these parameters showed a tendency for recovery.
