Denervated myocardium detected by I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial imaging following successful percutaneous transluminal coronary thrombolysis. I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is taken up by sympathetic nerve endings. Thirteen patients with acute myocardial infarction, in whom reperfusion was achieved with percutaneous transluminal coronary thrombolysis (PTCR), MIBG and Tl-201 (Tl) images 14 days after PTCR which were simultaneously performed were studied. In the late stage, Tl myocardial stress test was also performed to detect ischemia. The extent of myocardial defect was estimated as percent defect. Wall motion was assessed by echocardiography. Ejection fraction (EF) was assessed in the chronic phase using left ventriculography. In nine of the 13 patients, the denerved myocardial regions having the MIBG defects were noted using a Tl uptake. A percent defect noted in MIBG images was 25 +/- 6% and was greater than those (6 +/- 6%,p less than 0.01) in Tl images. During the convalescent phase, the wall motion of the denerved region was restored (2, normal 4, mild hypokinesis
