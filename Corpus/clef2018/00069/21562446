Feasibility of measuring human pancreatic perfusion in vivo using imaging techniques. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of pancreatic perfusion computed tomography (CT) and review pancreatic perfusion measurements by various imaging modalities.Dynamic CT data from 8 patients (4 men mean age, 64.8 [SD, 12.1] yearsAlthough the perfusion value estimated by the maximum-slope method (88.1 [SD, 42.1] mL/min per 100 mL) was significantly smaller than that of the compartment-model method (127.0 [SD, 70.5] P < 0.001), there was a linear correlation between them (r = 0.97, P < 0.001). In the literature review, 15 studies that reported the absolute values of normal pancreatic perfusion, by using perfusion CT, dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, hydrogen gas clearance method, and 15O-H2O-positron emission tomography were found. The reported mean values of normal pancreatic perfusion ranged from 38.4 to 356 mL/min per 100 mL, and there was a great deal of individual variation.Perfusion CT may provide reliable perfusion measurements of the pancreas, and the normal value was estimated at around 100 mL/min per 100 mL with a great deal of individual variation. The maximum-slope method may provide a lower perfusion value compared with the compartment-model method.
