Iodine-131-labeled meta-iodobenzylguanidine therapy of children with neuroblastoma: program planning and initial experience. Patients with high-risk neuroblastoma have a poor prognosis, especially in cases of recurrent or relapsed disease. Iodine-131-labeled meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-MIBG) can be an effective and relatively well-tolerated agent for the treatment of refractory neuroblastoma. Establishing an MIBG therapy program requires a great deal of planning, availability of hospital resources, and the commitment of individuals with training and expertise in multiple disciplines. Providing (131)I-MIBG therapy requires physical facilities and procedures that permit patient care in compliance with the standards for occupational and community exposure to radiation. Establishment of a successful (131)I-MIBG therapy program also requires a detailed operational plan and appropriate education for caregivers, parents, and patients.
