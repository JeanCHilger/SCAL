Current role of metaiodobenzylguanidine in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid cancer. Despite early reports of excellent diagnostic characteristics of [(131)I]/[(123)I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) in the evaluation of pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PHEOs/PGLs) or medullary thyroid cancer as experience with it was accumulated, the sensitivity dropped. Nevertheless, this modality is still useful in the diagnostic work-up of PHEOs/PGLs because it is widely available, and in case of positive scans it might indicate patients who are potential candidates for [(131)I]MIBG therapy.
