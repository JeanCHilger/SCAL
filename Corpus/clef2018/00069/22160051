Optimal therapy of advanced Hodgkin lymphoma. Advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) has become a curable disease in the majority of patients. Research during the last decade has challenged chemotherapy with Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD) as the standard of care and debates continue regarding the role of radiation therapy (RT) in this patient population. The incorporation of interim positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and, recently, further characterization of HL on cellular and molecular levels are emerging as tools for treatment stratification and predictors of disease status. Newer targeted therapies have emerged that are very effective in the relapsed setting and are actively being explored as frontline therapy. Lastly, the expanding population of survivors cured of HL outnumbers patients with the disease and needs to be monitored for therapy-related late effects.
