Radioiodinated anti-DNA-histone 1 complex chimeric tumor necrosis therapy (TNT) monoclonal antibody 1 Because neoplastic solid tumors grow rapidly, the lack of sufficient blood supply (and nutrition) leads to cell death and lysis in the lesion and results in the development and accumulation of necrotic areas in the affected areas. As a consequence of the lysis, the nuclear antigens (e.g., DNA, histone proteins, etc.) of the lysed cells are exposed in the necrotic tissues. Investigators have used the exposed antigens to develop monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that have been radiolabeled for evaluation in preclinical and clinical studies to detect and treat malignant tumors (1). This treatment protocol is known as tumor necrosis therapy (TNT), and the mAb used for this treatment targets only the intracellular antigens present in the necrotic section of a tumor. Although the intact cell membrane of a viable cell does not allow the passage of mAbs (because of their large size), the lysed membrane of a necrotic cell provides mAbs with free access to bind the intracellular antigens, such as DNA-histone complexes, heterochromatic DNA, and single-strand DNA of the lysed cells (2).
