Liver perfusion imaging in patients with primary and metastatic liver malignancy: prospective comparison between 99mTc-MAA spect and dynamic CT perfusion. To prospectively analyze the correlation between parameters of liver perfusion from technetium99m-macroaggregates of albumin (99mTc-MAA) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with those obtained from dynamic CT perfusion in patients with primary or metastatic liver malignancy.Twenty-five consecutive patients (11 women, 14 men mean age 60.9 Â± 10.8Interreader agreements for quantitative perfusion parameters were high for dynamic CT (r = 0.90-0.98, each P < .01) and 99mTc -MAA SPECT (r = 0.91, P < .01). Significant correlation was found between 99mTc-MAA uptake ratio and ALP (r = 0.7, P < .01) in liver tumors. No significant correlation was found between 99mTc-MAA uptake ratio, PVP (r = -0.381, P = .081), and TLP (r = 0.039, P = .862).This study indicates that in patients with primary and metastatic liver malignancy, ALP obtained by dynamic CT liver perfusion significantly correlates with the 99mTc-MAA uptake ratio obtained by SPECT.
