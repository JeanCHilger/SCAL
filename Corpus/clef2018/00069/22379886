Interdisciplinry approach to the treatment of diffuse germinogenic ovarian tumours. The first stage in the treatment of disseminated germinogenic ovarian tumours (HOT) is induction chemotherapy in accordance with the IGCCCG prognosis group. Dynamic observation is indicated in case of incomplete induction in patients with seminoma excepting those with PET-positive residual tumours bigger than 3 cm to whom second-line chemotherapy or retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy is indicated. Ablation of residual tumour of any localization is indicated to patients with disseminated non-seminoma HOT (NHOT), incomplete induction, and negative level of tumour markers. The necessity of adjuvant chemotherapy in case of a viable malignant HOT in the removed tissues remains debatable. Refractory and recurring HOT are usually treated with a combination of fosfamide and vinblastine. Residual tumours need to be removed after salvation chemotherapy. Surgical treatment is the preferred option for the management of late NHOT relapses.
