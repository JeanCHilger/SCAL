Role of SPECT/CT in differentiated thyroid cancer. Radioiodine scintigraphy and therapy has played a major role in the treatment and follow-up of thyroid cancer patients for decades. Single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography in this setting is emerging as a useful tool in accurately localizing sites of pathological uptake and physiological mimics of disease, thus providing more accurate staging prognostic information for risk stratification, which in turn tailors management and follow-up regimes. This review presents the current evidence and potential indications of single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography in thyroid cancer.
