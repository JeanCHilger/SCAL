Comparison of (18)F-FDG PET-CT and abdomen enhancement CT in diagnosing peritoneal metastases. To compare the diagnostic value of (18)F-FDG PET-CT with abdomen contrast CT in the diagnosis of peritoneal metastases.Between January 2008 and May 2011, imaging results of 97 patients with suspicious peritoneal metastases were retrospectively reviewed, and all the patients underwent both abdomen contrast CT and (18)F-FDG PET-CT imaging. Final diagnosis was made by histopathology or follow up.Seventy-seven patients were verified as peritoneal metastases after pathological examination(n=88) or follow up(n=9), while the other 20 patients were absent. The sensitivity of (18)F-FDG PET-CT was 90.9%(70/77), the specificity 85.0%(17/20), and the accuracy 89.7%(87/97). There were 3 false positive and 7 false negative. The sensitivity of contrast CT was 66.2%(51/77), the specificity 80.0%(16/20), and the accuracy 69.1%(67/97). There were 4 false positive and 26 false negative. The difference in diagnostic accuracy was statistically significantly between these two methods(P<0.05).The diagnostic value of (18)F-FDG PET-CT is significantly higher than that of abdominal enhanced CT for peritoneal metastases.
