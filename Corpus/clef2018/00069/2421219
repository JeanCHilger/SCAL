Single photon emission computed tomography study of human cancer: utilization of 57Co-labelled bleomycin. The sensitivity and specificity of single photon emission tomography with 57Co-labelled bleomycin (57Co-BLM) for the detection of cancer was determined from a prospective study involving a large group of patients selected to investigate roentgenographic abnormalities. Eighty-four of the 104 patients studied had malignant disease, of whom 76 had a positive scintigram. Eighteen of the 20 patients with benign disorders had a negative scintigram. The sensitivity and specificity was therefore 90.5 and 90% respectively. For the subset of patients who underwent investigation below the diaphragm, the sensitivity was 85.7%, while for investigation above the diaphragm, it reached 95.2% (this excluded reconstructions on the bladder level, because it produced large artifacts). This study leads to the conclusion that SPECT can be used specifically to investigate unidentified X-ray abnormality and diagnose malignancy using 57Co-BLM. In addition, we propose further investigation to evaluate the usefulness of this method in staging cancer.
