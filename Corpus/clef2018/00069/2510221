Renal blood volume vs. glomerular filtration rate: evaluation with C15O and 88Ga-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) study. 68Ga-EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is simply and economically obtained without a cyclotron. We used renal blood volume (RBV) values obtained by C15O studies for blood activity subtraction on renal time activity curves using a positron emission tomography for the determination of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by intravenous 68Ga-EDTA administration. Positive correlation was revealed between the GFR and RBV values, where the ratio of blood activity in whole renal activity increased relatively as GFR value decreased. The estimation using a correction equation derived from the correlation curve was possible without a C15O study.
