Biochemical tests for pheochromocytoma: strategies in hypertensive patients. To determine the optimal clinical strategy utilizing either 1) serum catecholamines, 2) urinary metanephrines, or 3) urinary vanillylmandelic acid measurements in the evaluation of hypertensive patients with suspected pheochromocytoma.Prospective clinical determination of test-operating characteristics.Tertiary care university medical center.415 patients referred for evaluation of suspected pheochromocytoma.All subjects had measurements of the three above-mentioned biochemical tests with the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma established by tissue confirmation.All three biochemical tests were similar in sensitivity (0.70-0.75), specificity (0.90-0.95), and receiver operating characteristics. With an estimated disease prevalence of 5.9% in symptomatic hypertensive patients, the predictive value of any single negative test would be 98% in ruling out disease.All three biochemical tests have similar performance characteristics and only a single test need be performed to exclude pheochromocytoma in most symptomatic hypertensive patients in a primary care population.
