Endodontics. It is known that pets with broken teeth or teeth with other diseases of the pulp suffer considerable pain and frequent infection. To ignore these problem teeth would not only be inhumane, it would risk chronic infection, abscessation, and tooth loss. Although extraction of these teeth is sometimes necessary, the procedure is often difficult to perform and painful for the animal. The resultant tooth loss is cosmetically displeasing and, frequently, there is compromise in function. The endodontic treatment of these teeth, on the other hand, is relatively easy to perform. It almost always results in immediate cessation of pain and will usually allow the tooth to remain functional for the lifetime of the pet.
