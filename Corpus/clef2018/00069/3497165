Brain blood volume, flow, and oxygen utilization measured with 15O radiotracers and positron emission tomography: revised metabolic computations. We have revised our methods for calculating regional blood volume, flow, oxygen extraction, and oxygen utilization from positron emission tomography data obtained using 15O-labeled radiotracers. These revisions include radioactive decay explicitly within the model equations instead of requiring all measured activity to be corrected for decay prior to incorporation in the equations. The revised equations yield small but significant differences in the computed values.
