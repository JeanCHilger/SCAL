18Fluorodeoxyglucose PET in schizophrenia. Six chronic schizophrenic patients and six age-matched controls were studied with 18fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). All patients were scanned when they had been free of medication for at least 2 weeks. Comparisons were made between the groups on regional ratios of cortical 18FDG, with manual and automated measures. Only one of eight regions, the right temporal cortical region, showed a significant group difference, and this effect was not significant when adjustment was made for multiple comparisons. Secondary analyses suggest that ventricular enlargement and age may be associated with a relatively "hypofrontal" pattern of 18FDG.
