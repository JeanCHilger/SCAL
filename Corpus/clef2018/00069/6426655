New approach to the localisation of phaeochromocytoma: imaging with iodine-131-meta-iodobenzylguanidine. Thirty eight patients with known or suspected phaeochromocytoma were studied by radioisotope imaging after intravenous administration of iodine-131-meta- iodobenzylguanidine (131I- mIBG ), a radiopharmaceutical which has affinity for chromaffin tumours. Seventeen positive results (including one false positive) and 21 negative results (including two false negatives) were obtained. Clinical accuracy was 92%. Urinary noradrenaline concentrations were raised in all patients with confirmed phaeochromocytoma. These findings show that 131I- mIBG is of value in localising and assessing the extent of chromaffin tumours.
