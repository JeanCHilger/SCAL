A simplified in vivo autoradiographic strategy for the determination of regional cerebral blood flow by positron emission tomography: theoretical considerations and validation studies in the rat. A simplified mathematical model is described for the measurement of regional cerebral blood flow by positron emission tomography in man, based on a modification of the autoradiographic strategy originally developed for experimental animal studies. A modified ramp intravenous infusion of radiolabeled tracer is used this results in a monotonically increasing curvilinear arterial activity curve that may be accurately described by a polynomial of low degree (= zeta). Integrated cranial activity CB is measured in regions of interest during the latter portion of the tracer infusion period (times T1 to T2). It is shown that (See formula: text) where each of the terms A chi is a readily evaluated function of the blood flow rate constant kappa, the brain:blood partition coefficient for the tracer, the cranial activity integration limits T1 and T2, the coefficients of the polynomial describing the arterial curve, and an iteration factor n that is chosen to yield the desired degree of precision. This relationship permits generation of a table of CB vs. kappa, thus facilitating on-line computer solution for blood flow. This in vivo autoradiographic paradigm was validated in a series of rats by comparing it to the classical autoradiographic strategy developed by Kety and associates. Excellent agreement was demonstrated between blood flow values obtained by the two methods: CBF in vivo = CBF classical X 0.99 - 0.02 (units in ml g-1 min-1
