Radiation absorbed dose estimates for positron emission tomography (PET): K-38, Rb-81, Rb-82, and Cs-130. Radiation absorbed dose estimates were made for K-38, Rb-81, Rb-82, and Cs-130, potential radionuclides for myocardial and brain studies with positron emission tomography (PET). Biodistribution data for K-42, Rb-86, and Cs-137 in rats were used, together with the most recent radiation absorbed dose computational techniques and data. Renal radiation absorbed doses for K-38, Rb-81, Rb-82, and Cs-130 were estimated to be 56, 120, 19, and 150 mrad, respectively, per mCi administered. Corresponding radiation absorbed doses in the heart were 42, 54, 13, and 68 mrad/mCi. Radiation absorbed doses in the brain of 1.3, 3.5, 0.25, and 3.7 mrad/mCi were estimated for these four radionuclides.
