Enzootic aspergillosis in wild red vented cockatoos in the Philippines. Philippine Red Vented Cockatoos were being trapped in the wild and dispersed directly to private homes, aviaries, pet stores and for export to the United States of America. Except for non-aggressive behaviour and tiring easily the subjects showed clinically nothing peculiar. Numerous cases of Aspergillosis with no clinical signs prior to death were being reported at the United States Air Force Base, Clark Field, Angeles City, Philippines. In all cases stress was a predisposing factor to death such as enclosure in a small bird cage. Those birds in aviaries that were kept free-flying remained clinically normal, with no deaths recorded. Systematic examination to determine the causative source of infection was carried out and revealed natural infection in the wild state as the cause of disease in caged Red Vented Cockatoos in the Philippines. Examination on three other species of Philippine Pstitticine birds revealed only the Red Vented Cockatoo to be infected or a latent carrier in the wild state.
