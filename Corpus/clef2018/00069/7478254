Tetrahydroaminoacridine modulates technetium-99m labelled ethylene dicysteinate retention in Alzheimer's disease measured with single photon emission computed tomography imaging. The present study investigated if acute treatment with tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) (25 or 75 mg, p.o.) affects technetium-99m labelled ethylene dicysteinate (ECD) retention abnormalities in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD mean age 69 years). THA (75 mg) increased temporal, prefrontal and occipital ECD retention (normalized to cerebellum) in mildly demented AD patients, but 25 mg of THA had no effect on ECD retention. After 75 mg THA, prefrontal and temporal ECD retention correlated with improved executive and memory functioning, respectively. THA (25 or 75 mg) had no measurable effect on ECD retention of moderately demented patients.
