Multistep tumor targeting in nude mice using bispecific antibodies and a gallium chelate suitable for immunoscintigraphy with positron emission tomography. To improve tumor:tissue ratios in immunoscintigraphy, a three-step targeting method has been developed. The reagents used were (a) a radioactive, low molecular weight chelate prepared from ionic gallium and a phenolic polyaminocarboxylic acid, which can be labeled either with the single-photon emitter 67Ga or with the short-lived positron emitter 68Ga (t1/2 = 68 min) (b) a bispecific monoclonal antibody (bs-mAb) synthesized from the F(ab)2 fragment of the 1.1ASML antibody specific for the glycoprotein CD44v associated with a rat pancreas carcinoma cell line and the F(ab') fragment of an antibody specific for the gallium chelate
