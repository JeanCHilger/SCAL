Regional cerebral blood flow changes in motor cortical areas after transient anesthesia of the forearm. To study the effect of deafferentation on cortical areas activated by movement of the proximal muscles, we measured regional cerebral blood flow with positron emission tomography and 15O-labeled water. Flexion-extension movements of the right elbow before deafferentation were associated with an increase of regional cerebral blood flow in the primary sensorimotor area bilaterally, posterior supplementary motor area bilaterally, ipsilateral cerebellum, contralateral putamen, premotor area, anterior cingulate area, and posterior parietal region. Transient anesthesia of the right forearm induced by ischemic block caused an increase of regional cerebral blood flow in the primary sensorimotor area bilaterally at rest, but there was no change of regional cerebral blood flow with movement, indicating that the movement-related change in cerebral blood flow was reduced. These findings are consistent with increased excitability of neurons as a result of deafferentation. In the supplementary motor area, anesthesia did not induce any change in regional cerebral blood flow at rest, but there was a decline with movement, again indicating a reduction of the change in cerebral blood flow related to movement. This might be due to a reduction in sensory feedback because of the anesthesia.
