Clinical experience of automated peritoneal dialysis. For uremic patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis who are complicated with peritonitis, hernia or burn out of meticulous procedure, automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) is a new alternative therapy. We started our APD program by continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) method from October, 1991 and this study included 3 CAPD patients. Our studies showed high dose CCPD was better than CAPD in ultrafiltration and urea clearance with similar weekly creatinine clearance and weekly KT/V urea. During the one year treatment course, there was no signs of fluid overload. We performed once to twice day time exchange by low volume dialysate (1500-1600ml) There was no events of abdomen discomfort due to increase intraabdominal pressure or recurrent hernia in susceptible patient. The decrease in day time exchange frequency obviously reduced patients'loading. One patient changed to high dose CCPD due to underdialysis after stand CCPD therapy. Two patients returned to hemodialysis due to severe peritonitis and technique method, but careful assessment of dialysis adequacy with PET test and KT/V evaluation is mandatory.
