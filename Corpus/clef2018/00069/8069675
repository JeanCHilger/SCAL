Modulation of cortical neuronal activity by a serotonergic agent: a PET study in humans. This study investigates the effect of a serotonergic agent, fenfluramine, on neuronal activity, as measured using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake with positron emission tomography (PET) in humans. Eleven subjects each received oral fenfluramine and placebo, on two different occasions, followed by FDG PET scans. Our study shows that fenfluramine modulates ongoing neuronal activity in a regionally specific fashion with a relative increase in metabolism in the prefrontal cortex and a relative decrease in the occipital-temporal regions.
