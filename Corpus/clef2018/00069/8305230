Radioimmunotherapy dosimetry--a review. Results from therapeutic trials in systemic radiation therapy with radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies are difficult to compare, because of lack of accurate dosimetry. This applies macroscopically as well as microscopically for both tumours and normal tissues. For treatment planning in radioimmunotherapy both the macroscopic and the microscopic absorbed dose distribution must be known. The former is based on a proper knowledge of parameters, such as activity quantitation techniques in both planar and SPECT imaging, different correction techniques, and high activity measurements. Absorbed dose calculations and treatment planning techniques are based on analytical or Monte Carlo calculations. The PET technique with higher resolution is also suggested for radioimmunotherapy planning. Accurate in vivo absorbed dose measurement techniques to verify the calculated absorbed doses are needed in treatment planning. Monitoring the absorbed rate is desirable to assess radiobiological effect. Several ways of enhancing the therapeutic ratio are suggested, especially novel technique with extracorporeal immunoadsorption. An important topic is small scale dosimetry, which is based on techniques for detailed imaging of activity distributions to calculate the absorbed dose distribution.
