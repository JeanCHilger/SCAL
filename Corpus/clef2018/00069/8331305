Identification of hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenoses by dipyridamole-magnetic resonance imaging and 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile-SPECT. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used in conjunction with dipyridamole induced wall motion abnormalities for the noninvasive detection of coronary artery disease (CAD). To assess the clinical usefulness of dipyridamole-MRI for the localization of CAD and to evaluate the relation between dipyridamole induced wall motion abnormalities and myocardial perfusion 33 patients with severe CAD (> 70% diameter reduction) underwent MRI at rest and after dipyridamole infusion (0.75 mg dipyridamole/kg over a period of 10 minutes). All patients performed exercise stress testing and 20 patients of the study group additionally had rest and exercise stress 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile-SPECT (MIBI-SPECT). Two patients (6%) could not be evaluated due to severe motion artifacts during dipyridamole MRI. Segmental wall motion and perfusion of corresponding short axis planes were related to the major coronary arteries using a standardized segmental coronary artery perfusion pattern. Detection of wall motion abnormalities or perfusion defects by 2 blinded observers in consensus was the criterion for grading a segment normal or pathologic. For localization of CAD, segmental gradings were related to the presumed coronary artery territories. Stress-ECG was pathologic in 19/31 patients yielding a sensitivity of 61% and dipyridamole induced angina was present in 68% (21/31) of patients. Dipyridamole-MRI detected coronary artery disease with a sensitivity of 84% (26/31 patients) and all patients with new wall motion abnormalities also had dipyridamole induced angina. For the subgroup of 20 patients with MIBI-SPECT images, CAD was detected by both MIBI-SPECT and Dipyridamole-MRI in 90% (18/20) of patients. Dipyridamole-MRI and MIBI-SPECT gradings agreed in 55/60 (92%) coronary artery perfusion territories. There were no significant differences with respect to the sensitivities of Dipyridamole-MRI/MIBI-SPECT for the localization of individual coronary artery stenoses yielding 81%/78% for left anterior descending, 80%/80% for left circumflex and 92%/89% for right coronary artery stenoses. However, specificity of Dipyridamole-MRI (89%) for the detection of RCA stenoses was slightly better than for MIBI-SPECT (80%).
