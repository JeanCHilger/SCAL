99mTc-sestamibi can improve the inferior attenuation of TL-201 myocardial spect imaging. Tl-201 myocardial scintigraphy (Tl study) tends to be attenuated by soft tissues (such as the diaphragm) due to its low energy emission. 99mTc-sestamibi (2-methoxy isobutyl isonitrile) is a relatively new agent with a higher energy emission and this characteristic accounts for the higher quality of 99mTc-sestamibi images. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of 99mTc-sestamibi in alleviating the inferior attenuation of Tl studies. 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT myocardial scintigraphy was performed on 13 patients with inferior wall perfusion defects as determined by Tl study (but with normal coronary artery as evidenced by cardiac catheterization). All patients underwent Tl SPECT study using a standard procedure. Same-day protocol (rest-stress sequence) was used for 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT imaging. All images were analyzed by two independent observers. The results of our study reveal that 99mTc-sestamibi produced better images. The inferior wall perfusion defects in the T1 study were noted in one case only (1/13) in the 99mTc-sestamibi study. Our study suggests that 99mTc-sestamibi can remarkably reduce the inferior attenuation of Tl study.
