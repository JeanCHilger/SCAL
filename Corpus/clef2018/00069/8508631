The performance of specialized collections of bisphenol A epoxy resin system components in the evaluation of workers in an occupational health clinic population. Epoxy resin of the bisphenol A type (ERBA) is a common cause of occupational contact dermatitis. 167 patients with a history of potential exposure were patch tested with epoxy resin (molecular weight 340) (ERBAM) 1% in pet. and with a number of other ingredients in ERBA systems. 18% of the test patients exhibited a positive response to ERBAM. Phenyl glycidyl ether was the most frequent system component other than ERBAM itself to elicit a positive response (6.1%). Approximately 80% of those tested were unresponsive to ERBAM or any other of the system components, while 20% exhibited a positive response to one or more of the test materials. Only a small % were positive to system materials, but negative to ERBAM, in keeping with previous studies. The study suggests that there is a marginal benefit to testing with other than ERBAM 1%, except in instances where there is known exposure to another ERBA system ingredient, in which event, the patient should also be tested with the specific material to which they have been exposed if there is no response to ERBAM.
