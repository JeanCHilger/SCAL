A study on accuracy of rCBF measurements using the conventional microsphere method with N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine and SPECT. To evaluate the accuracy of conventional microsphere method for the measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) based on the microsphere model with N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) and SPECT, we performed simulation analysis and clinical studies. Although the microsphere method requires early SPECT scan at a few minutes after injection of the tracer for the accurate measurement of rCBF, the conventional microsphere method, which is generally used, requires more delayed SPECT scan with long scan-duration. In the conventional microsphere method, the delayed SPECT image is corrected to the image at a few minutes after injection of the tracer by using the monitored entire brain activity. By the simulation analysis based on the 2-compartment model (influx K1 and outflux
