Inhibition of PDGF-induced phospholipase C activation by herbimycin A. Herbimycin A, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases, dose-dependently reduced PDGF-induced inositol phosphates (IPt) accumulation without effect on phosphatidylethanol (PEt) formation in PLC-gamma 1-overexpressing NIH 3T3 (NIH 3T3 gamma 1) cells. The compound also reduced tyrosine phosphorylations of some proteins including PLC-gamma 1 in response to PDGF. On the other hand, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced phospholipase D (PLD) activation was reduced by herbimycin A in the cells, indicating that the pathways for PLD activation by PDGF and PMA are different from each other. Also, these results suggest that PLC-gamma 1 activation is not always an upstream event for PLD activation and that tyrosine phosphorylation of one or more proteins not affected by herbimycin A should be indispensable for PLD activation in PDGF-stimulated NIH 3T3 gamma 1 cells.
