New display methods of combined topographic EEG and cerebral blood flow images in the evaluation of cerebral ischemia. To evaluate complicated changes in the EEG and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in cerebral infarction, EEG was recorded under various blood pressure levels, during CBF measurement with positron emission tomography, in patients with chronic cerebral infarction. Newly developed display methods which combine topographic EEG and its significance probability mapping with CBF, clearly provided objective measures of changes in EEG parameters and CBF, during induced hypo- and hypertension.
