Detection of residual ischemia after acute anterior myocardial infarction using Thallium-201 SPECT. To assess the utility of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with Thallium-201 after anterior myocardial infarction at predischarge time in the detection of a) the prevalence of isotopic redistribution in the infarct area or at a distanceSeventy-three survivors of an uncomplicated anterior myocardial infarction, 67 men and 7 women, with a mean age of 56 +/- 9 years (34-70 range), underwent T1-SPECT after stress test (62 exercise test and 11 pharmacological Dipyridamole test) as well as coronarographic studies before discharge. Peri-infarction ischemia was defined as redistribution presence in the distribution territory of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and was assessed in a semi-quantitative way scoring both stress and rest images that allowed the calculation of a redistribution index R (Stress Score-Rest Score/Stress Score). Ischemia at a distance was defined as redistribution presence in the territories of circumflex and right coronary arteries as assessed both by visual analysis (VA) and bull's eye polar maps (BE) or by washout imaging (WO).Peri-infarction ischemia (R > 0) was found in 48 (65.7%) patients 43 with and 5 without significant residual lesions in the LAD and the absence of peri-infarction ischemia (R = 0) was found in 25 (34.3%) patients, 19 with and 6 without significant residual lesions in the LAD. Sensitivity and specificity for multivessel disease detection by ischemia at a distance was 64% and 85% respectively, for VATI-SPECT imaging is a useful diagnostic method to detect both peri-infarction ischemia and ischemia at a distance at predischarge time following anterior myocardial infarction. Redistribution presence in the non infarct-area shows a fair sensitivity and a high positive predictive value to detect residual multivessel disease.
