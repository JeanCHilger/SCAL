A scintigraphic study on gastric emptying in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia. Solid gastric emptying rates (GER) were determined with scintigraphic techniques in 20 patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) and 9 healthy volunteers. GER were significantly decreased in NUD patients compared with controls, especially 45 min (P < 0.05), 60 and 90 min (P < 0.01) and 120 min (P < 0.05) after ingestion. In 13 out of 20 NUD patients who demonstrated lower GER, only 4 cases gave a lower GER at all stages throughout the determination, the other 9 showed their abnormal GER only after 60 min. In 3 cases who received repeated GER studies after cisapride therapy, 2 patients showed symptomatic relief accompanied by GER improvement. It is concluded that gastric emptying delay may be present with a high percentage in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia. Scintigraphic gastric emptying test is a safe and reliable technique with good reproducibility. It may be helpful in quantitative study about gastric motion disorders.
