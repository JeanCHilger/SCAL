Quantitative 123I IMP and 99mTc HMPAO imaging in the dog following cocaine administration. SPECT and associated imaging procedures were used in beagle dogs to (1) evaluate the uptake, distribution, and clearance properties of i.v.-injected 123I IMP (IMP) and 99mTc HMPAO (HMPAO) in the brain, lungs, liver, and kidneys (2) quantify the acute effects (after 15 sec) of very low doses (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg) cocaine on the kinetics and localization properties of IMP and HMPAO
