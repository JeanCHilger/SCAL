18F]CFT ([18F]WIN 35,428), a radioligand to study the dopamine transporter with PET: biodistribution in rat. We describe the 18F-radiolabelling synthesis (18F T(1/2) = 109.8 min) of 2-beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane (also known as CFT or WIN 35,428) and the biodistribution of this compound in rats. 18F-labelled CFT has high chemical and radiochemical purity and relatively high specific radioactivity [specific radioactivity up to 14.8 GBq/mumol (400 mCi/mumol) at end of synthesis]. Striatum to cerebellum radioactivity uptake ratios were calculated from digitised images of rat brain slices recorded with a phosphoimaging device, the maximum ratio of about 10 was obtained at 2 h postinjection. Pretreatment of the rats with a specific dopamine transport inhibitor, GBR 12909, showed that CFT binding is specific in striatum. The highest accumulation of 18F-radioactivity was found in the liver, urine, striatum, and kidney of the rat. Clearance from blood was rapid. The uptake in bone was low, indicating that [18F]CFT is not defluorinated. The relatively long half-life of 18F makes it possible to study the uptake of [18F]CFT in the brain, as equilibrium between specific and non-specific binding is reached. This will improve the signal to noise ratio as compared to positron emission tomography (PET) studies with [11C]CFT (11C
