Relationship between exercise induced ischemia and left ventricular dysfunction simultaneous assessment of perfusion and function images with 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial scintigraphy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between exercise induced ischemia and left ventricular dysfunction, ergometer exercise 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial scintigraphy was performed using one day protocol (exercise/rest). Subjects consisted of 68 patients without previous myocardial infarction without coronary artery disease (CAD) (n = 36) and with CAD (n = 32). Perfusion and function images were evaluated simultaneously. Perfusion image was taken by single photon emission tomography (SPECT). Quantitative analysis was performed with normal data-base. The area of abnormal perfusion, less than normal lower limits, was named as extent score (ES). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured by first-pass study. According to ES on stress image, 32 patients with CAD were divided into 3 groups
