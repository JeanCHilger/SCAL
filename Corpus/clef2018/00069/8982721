Evaluation in rat of RS-79948-197 as a potential PET ligand for central alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Tritium-labelled RS-79948-197 {(8aR,12aS,13aS)-5, 8,8a,9,10,11,12,12a,13,13a-decahydro-3-methoxy-12-(ethylsulphon yl)-6H-iso- quino[2,1-g][1,6]naphthyridine} was evaluated in rat brain as an in vivo ligand for central alpha 2-adrenoceptors, as a preliminary step in the development of a radioligand for positron-emission tomography (PET) studies. The maximal receptor-specific signal was achieved within 90-120 min after i.v. injection of [ethyl-3H]RS-79948-197 and was selective for the alpha 2- compared with the alpha 1-adrenoceptor, with no detectable binding to the imidazoline-I2 site. Estimates for binding potential (approximating to Bmax/Kd) ranged between 3.4 in entorhinal cortex and 0.5 in medulla oblongata. The results, which indicate a similarly localised but 2-fold increase in specific binding compared with that previously demonstrated using [3H]RX 821002 (2-methoxy-idazoxan), are sufficiently encouraging as to support further investment in the development of 11C-labelled RS-79948-197, or a close structural analogue, as a ligand for clinical PET.
