The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission computing tomography (SPECT) for the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders presenting as parkinsonism. In Parkinson's disease, both MRI and SPECT are usually normal. In striatonigral degeneration and olivo-ponto-cerebellar atrophy presenting as parkinsonism, MRI shows putaminal atrophy and SPECT shows hypoperfusion in the frontal lobe, basal ganglia and cerebellum. In progressive supranuclear palsy, MRI shows tegmental atrophy and SPECT shows hypoperfusion in the frontal lobe with intact cerebellar perfusion. In conclusion, MRI and SPECT seem to be useful for the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders presenting as parkinsonism.
