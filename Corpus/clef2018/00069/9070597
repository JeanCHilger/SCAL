Interictal 99Tc(m) HMPAO SPECT and 1H MRS in children with temporal lobe epilepsy. To understand the pathological basis of focal hypoperfusion seen on interictal 99Tc(m) hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) in intractable temporal lobe epilepsy, and to determine why the technique may be misleading in the localization and lateralization of the seizure focus in some cases.Interictal 99Tc(m) HMPAO SPECT and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) of the mesial temporal regions were performed in 14 children with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy not caused by a foreign tissue lesion.Hypoperfusion of one temporal lobe ipsilateral to the seizure focus was demonstrated in 10 (71%) of the children 1H MRS correctly lateralised in eight of these 10. No asymmetry of perfusion of the anterior temporal regions was seen in the remaining four childrenAbnormalities demonstrated by 1H MRS correlate well with those seen on interictal SPECT and can help to understand the pathologic basis of these SPECT abnormalities. Furthermore, the presence of bilateral damage can result in an absence of perfusion asymmetry on interictal SPECT.
