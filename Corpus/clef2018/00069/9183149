Compton-scatter correction using the triple energy window (TEW) method in conventional single photon emission computed tomography without TEW acquisition hardware. We devised a method which allowed the triple energy window (TEW) method to be applied for Compton-scatter correction in conventional single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) systems without any hardware for TEW acquisition. In this method, the data within two subwindows located at both sides of the main window were acquired together. The effectiveness of this method was investigated by phantom experiments. The integral and differential uniformities measured using a flood phantom filled with 123I were minimized when the energy width of subwindows was 5 keV (5.8% and 4.2%, respectively). When this method was applied to a brain phantom filled with 123I in which the relative activities in white and gray matter were assigned as 1: 4.3, the ratio of SPECT values between them was more accurate (1:4.26) than that obtained without this method (1:208). This method appears to be useful for Compton-scatter correction in SPECT, because it can be applied to conventional SPECT systems without any hardware for TEW acquisition and is available for routine clinical use for its simplicity.
