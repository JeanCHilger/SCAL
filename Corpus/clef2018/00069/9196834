Action on preservatives in fresh pet food. In late 1995 and early 1996, Sydney vet Dr Bob Steel reported first-hand experience with a cat dying from thiamine deficiency. This deficiency was attributable to the presence of sulfur dioxide in fresh pet food which was fed to the cat over a period of time. The diagnosis was confirmed, as was the presence of sulfur dioxide in significant levels. Since that time, Dr Steel and the AVA have pursued the issue of preservatives (specifically those producing sulfur dioxide) in fresh pet food. An update on that work follows.
