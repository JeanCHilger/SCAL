A simplified intravenous glucose loading protocol for fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose cardiac single-photon emission tomography. The myocardial uptake of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has emerged as the most sensitive and specific technique for the assessment of myocardial viability. With the development of FDG single-photon emission tomography (SPET) and dual head coincidence imaging, a hindrance to the widespread clinical use of FDG cardiac imaging is the complexity of the preinjection glucose loading necessary for obtaining interpretable myocardial FDG scans. In a population of 209 patients undergoing dual-isotope single acquisition (DISA) FDG/sestamibi (MIBI) SPET, we describe the improvements in both image quality and time efficiency using a new short, simple glucose/insulin/potassium (GIK) infusion protocol prior to FDG injection as compared to a conventional oral glucose loading protocol. DISA FDG/MIBI SPET scans were performed in 111 nondiabetic patients after oral loading with 50 g of glucose (group 1). Ninety-eight consecutive nondiabetic patients were subsequently scanned following preparation with a fixed-concentration GIK infusion administered at a standardized rate (group 2). A three-point grading scale was used to assess image quality. The time to FDG injection following glucose administration was significantly shorter for the group 2 patients (39.9+/-15.6 min range 20-105 min) than for the group 1 patients (99.5+/-30.3 min
