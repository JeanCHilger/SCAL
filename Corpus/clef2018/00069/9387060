Design of an isolated pig heart preparation for positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Validation of new positron emission tomography (PET) tracers or magnetic (MR) imaging contrast agents is based on isolated rodent heart preparations. The use of larger animals could provide a more direct validation using the devices used for humans.An isolated pig heart preparation has been developed and adapted to the technical constraints of whole body PET and MR imaging. This preparation could be used either in the Langendorff or working mode after selective cannulation of both coronary arteries.The authors showed that quantification of regional kinetics of PET tracers was possible using this preparation by measuring fluorine-18-labeled deoxyglycose (18FDG) kinetics in remote and ischemic territories. Experiments using MR imaging contrast agents, for myocardial perfusion, demonstrated the ability of this preparation to accurately validate these contrast agents over a wide range of flow rates.An isolated pig heart preparation could be developed to fulfill the constraints of PET and MR imaging, and proved useful for the study of the distribution of different tracers or contrast media developed for functional cardiac imaging in humans.
