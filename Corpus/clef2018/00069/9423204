Index for predicting post-operative residual liver function by pre-operative dynamic liver SPET. To predict residual liver function before hepatic resection, we devised a predictive index by combining clearance values with functional liver volume measured by liver dynamic single photon emission tomography (SPET). Forty-seven patients with liver disease underwent liver dynamic SPET with 99Tcm-Sn colloid before hepatic resection. There were no operation-related deaths. Three patients died from hepatic failure more than 1 month following the operation. Their predictive indices were 0.24, 0.33 and 0.34. When the predictive index was above 0.35, no patient had symptoms of hepatic failure or died. Our data suggest that when the predictive index is above 0.35, there is a low probability of hepatic failure after hepatectomy.
