Comparison of [123I]metaiodobenzylguanidine kinetics with heart rate variability and plasma norepinephrine level. [123I]Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging has been used to assess cardiac sympathetic nerve abnormalities. We evaluated the clinical significance of myocardial MIBG imaging as a measure of cardiac sympathetic nervous system function by comparing it to heart rate variability and plasma norepinephrine level.In 211 subjects, we analyzed heart rate variability with 24-hour electrocardiography, performed scintigraphy with MIBG, and measured plasma norepinephrine levels. Time and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability were calculated with the Marquette heart rate variability program (Marquette Electronics, Milwaukee, Wis.). Early and late myocardial MIBG uptakes were measured at 15 and 150 minutes after injection, respectively. MIBG clearance rate from the heart and heart-to-lung and heart-to-mediastinum ratios of MIBG activities were calculated. On the whole, heart rate variability, including low-frequency power, correlated positively, but modestly so, with late MIBG uptake and negatively with MIBG clearance rate. The plasma norepinephrine level correlated negatively with late MIBG uptake and with heart rate variability, including low-frequency power, and positively with MIBG clearance rate. Similar correlations were also observed in patient subgroups with coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal failure, but these correlations were weak (R2 < 0.5).Increased cardiac sympathetic nervous system activity may be associated with increased myocardial MIBG clearance and decreased heart rate variability, including low-frequency power. Because these associations were not strong, however, the combination of heart rate variability with MIBG may allow an interactive assessment of the cardiac autonomic nervous system.
