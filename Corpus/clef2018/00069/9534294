An aggressive exercise test is suitable for myocardial scintigraphy. Exercise myocardial scintigraphy is frequently used as a second step tool in the assessment of coronary artery disease. Little attention has been paid on the exercise protocol used as a stress during scintigraphy. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the test is better if higher heart rate is achieved. The aim of this study was to evaluate if an aggressive exercise protocol was safe and more effective than a standard protocol in achieving higher heart rate. Eighty-four patients (64 men and 20 women, mean age 56 +/- 10 years, range 34-78 years) underwent a standard exercise test (cycloergometry SET: 25 W increments every 2 min starting from 25 W load) and an aggressive exercise test (AET: 50 W increments every 2 min starting from 50 W load)
