Glucose and methionine uptake by rat brain tumor treated with prodrug-activated gene therapy. The effect of acyclovir (ACV) on the metabolism of rat 9L-gliosarcoma cells expressing the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene was studied using 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) and L-[methyl-11C]methionine. Though the average weight of the tumors treated with ACV was significantly lower than that of the saline-injected control group, FDG and methionine uptake per weight of tumor tissue was not different between the two groups. This result exhibits a striking contrast to the metabolic pattern observed after radiation therapy, suggesting the different pathways regarding tumor cell death between the therapies.
