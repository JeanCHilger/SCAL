11C-methionine and 18F-2-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography: a tool for diagnosis of cerebral glioma and monitoring after brachytherapy with 125I seeds. Forty-six patients with suspected brain tumors were investigated by positron emission tomography (PET). Using 11C-methionine PET, the spatial extent of increased uptake in gliomas was larger than that of contrast enhancement on CT/MR images in 67% or the same in 33%. Ten of 46 patients treated with brachytherapy for low-grade gliomas were also investigated with 18F-2-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET. One year after seed implantation, the glucose metabolism had not changed, but the decline of methionine uptake was significant. In conclusion, 11C-methionine PET may improve tumor delineation and, following brachytherapy, provides more information on the therapeutic effects than FDG.
