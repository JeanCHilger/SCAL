PET as a tool in pharmacologic development. Positron emission tomography (PET) allows the in vivo recording of tracer compounds with respect to anatomical distribution, time course and absolute concentration. These features has proven of great value in drug development, especially in the phase of early clinical trials. PET can be used to assess the tissue kinetics of a new drug, or to evaluate a drugs interaction with a target system and thereby aid in decisions regarding dosing regimes.
