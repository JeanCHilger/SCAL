Hereditary spastic paraplegia with a thin corpus callosum and thalamic involvement in Japan. The authors examined two Japanese siblings with a recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) with dementia and a thin corpus callosum. Both showed thalamic glucose hypometabolism on PET. Recessive HSP with a thin corpus callosum is a rare disorder, with less than 20 reported patients, that may be a Japanese subtype of HSP.
