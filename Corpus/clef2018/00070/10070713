Automated synthesis of [11C]choline, a positron-emitting tracer for tumor imaging. (beta-Hydroxyethyl)tri([11C]methyl)ammonium ([11C]choline) is a tracer very effective in imaging various human tumors using positron emission tomography (PET). We have constructed a computer-controlled [11C]choline synthetic apparatus which carries out the whole process of synthesis and product purification automatically. The setup is simple and the process quick. In 20 min, 11 GBq of [11C]choline (chloride) is obtainable from 26 GBq of [11C]CO2. The final product is a sterile and pyrogen-free [11C]choline "injection".
