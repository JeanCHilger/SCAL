Functional assessment with electrocardiographic gated single-photon emission computed tomography improves the ability of technetium-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging to predict myocardial viability in patients undergoing revascularization. This study evaluates the use of electrocardiographic (ECG) gated single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging for the prediction of viability in patients undergoing revascularization, who have coronary disease and left ventricular dysfunction. Fifty patients underwent technectium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi ECG gated SPECT imaging preoperatively at rest and 1 week after revascularization, whereas 36 (72%) also underwent imaging 6 weeks after revascularization. Images were interpreted by the consensus of 3 experienced readers without knowledge of patient identity or time of imaging (pre- or postrevascularization) for perfusion and wall motion using a 17-segment model. Results of perfusion alone were compared with perfusion and wall motion combined. One hundred five coronary artery territories were revascularized, 96 of which were viable and 9 nonviable. Perfusion alone predicted 87 to be viable and 18 nonviable (sensitivity 86%, specificity 55%, positive predictive value 95%, negative predictive value 28%, and overall accuracy 85%). Perfusion and wall motion combined identified 95 territories to be viable (sensitivity 95% p <0.025
