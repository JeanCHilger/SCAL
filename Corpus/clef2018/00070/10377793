Functional imaging for disorders of basal ganglia. The nigrostriatal dopaminergic function and regional glucose metabolism were evaluated in patients suffering from various disorders of basal ganglia by using positron emission tomography with 18F-dopa and 18F-FDG, respectively. The 18F-dopa uptake in the striatum (the caudate head and the putamen) decreased in patients with Parkinson's disease but was relatively unaffected in the caudate. The cerebral glucose metabolism was normal in patients with Parkinson's disease. The 18F-dopa uptake in the striatum also decreased in cases of multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, but there was no difference in the uptake between the caudate and the putamen. The glucose metabolism decreased in the cerebral cortices and the striatum: this finding was also different from those of Parkinson's disease. A normal 18F-dopa uptake with a markedly decreased striatal glucose metabolism was observed in cases of Huntington's disease. The 18F-dopa uptake increased and the glucose metabolism was normal in cases of idiopathic dystonia. Various patterns of 18F-dopa uptake and glucose metabolism were thus observed in the various disorders of basal ganglia. These results suggest that the measurements of the 18F-dopa uptake and glucose metabolism would be useful for evaluating the function of the basal ganglia in various disorders of basal ganglia.
