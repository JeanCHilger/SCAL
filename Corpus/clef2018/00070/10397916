Enhanced expression of P-selectin (CD62P) by endothelial cells seeded onto synthetic arterial prostheses (PET, Dacron) is correlated with leukocyte interactions. This study evaluated the expression by seeded endothelial cells (S-EC) of P-selectin (CD62P/GMP-140/PADGEM), an adhesion molecule implicated in endothelial-leukocyte interactions. Endothelial cells were seeded onto knitted polyethylene terephthalate (PET, Dacron(R)) prostheses and compared with control endothelial cells (C-EC) cultured in flasks to the same stage. Using flow cytometry techniques, we observed that CD62P expression by PET S-EC was significantly increased (p<0.05) compared to C-EC. Moreover, RT PCR techniques showed that the CD62P RNA level was higher on S-ECs compared to C-ECs. Following adhesion assays, increased polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) attachment to the PET-seeded prostheses as compared to control cultures (p<0.001) was observed. PMN adherence was enhanced by TNFalpha activation. PMN adhesion was decreased significantly (p<0.001) after the incubation of resting EC or TNFalpha-activated EC-seeded prostheses with a blocking monoclonal antibody (LYP20) directed against the P-selectin. Such results suggest that: (1) PET prosthetic material may induce the expression of P-selectin by S-EC (2) seeding conditions provoke an increase in PMN adhesion
