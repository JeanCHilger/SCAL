Regional cerebral blood flow in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with or without definite neuropsychiatric symptoms/signs were studied. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) hexamethylpropylenamine (HMPAO) brain images were used to detect basal ganglion and cerebral cortex regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with SLE with brain involvement. One hundred nine female patients with SLE were investigated using Tc-99m HMPAO brain images with fan-beam single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and surface three-dimensional (3D) display. These patients were separated into 2 subgroups: group 1, 74 cases with definite neuropsychiatric symptoms/signs and group 2, 35 cases without any neuropsychiatric symptoms/signs. Fan-beam SPECT demonstrated unilateral or bilateral hypoperfusion of basal ganglia or thalamus in 22% and 9% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Local hypoactivity anomalies were found in the brain cortex of 89% and 20% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively, using surface 3D display of the brain. In either group 1 or group 2 patients, parietal and frontal lobes are the most common areas and cerebellum and thalamus are the least common areas of brain involvement, respectively. This study suggests that in comparison with traditional brain imaging techniques, Tc-99m HMPAO brain imaging with fan-beam SPECT in combination with surface 3D display may provide objective information for detection of anomalies of rCBF in patients with SLE.
