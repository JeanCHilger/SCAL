Comparison of three cold kit reconstitution techniques for the reduction of hand radiation dose. In the performance of conventional nuclear pharmacy work, personnel usually receive the highest hand radiation dose during reconstitution of 99Tcm-labelled radiopharmaceuticals. This study was conducted to compare the hand radiation doses incurred during the preparation of 99Tcm-labelled radiopharmaceuticals using three different reconstitution procedures: (1) the standard reconstitution method (i.e. withdrawing 99Tcm activity and normal saline [NS] into the same syringe before adding to the cold kit) (standard) (2) an alternative reconstitution procedure using two syringes to add normal saline separately before 99Tcm activity to the cold kit (NS/Tc)
