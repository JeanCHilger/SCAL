Pregnancy testing before high-dose radioiodine treatment: a case report. This case emphasizes that negative urine pregnancy testing and a written declaration of the patient are not sufficient to safely exclude an early pregnancy. Serum pregnancy testing inherently has a diagnostic gap of about 1 wk following conception. We recommend sufficient contraception at least 1 mo before radioiodine treatment in women of childbearing age.
