Evaluation of [18F]VUF 5000 as a potential PET ligand for brain imaging of the histamine H3 receptor. [18F]VUF 5000 was evaluated as a potential PET ligand for the histamine H3 receptor. In the rat a high uptake of [18F]VUF 5000 was observed in liver, lung and kidney and a low uptake in the brain. In order to explain these findings we determined the LogD(oct,7.2) of [18F]VUF 5000, studied the biodistribution in the presence of carrier VUF 5000, modified [18F]VUF 5000 chemically and studied the binding of [18F]VUF 5000 to human serum albumin. From the results of these experiments it was concluded that [18F]VUF 5000 is not suitable as a PET ligand for brain imaging of the histamine H3 receptor, since [18F]VUF 5000 hardly penetrates into the brain.
