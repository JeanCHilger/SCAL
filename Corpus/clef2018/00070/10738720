Factors associated with the development of atopy in young adults. To determine the risk factors for the development of atopy in Spanish young adults.Case-control study over prevalent cases. Carried out in general population between the ages of 20 to 44 years old. Spanish participants of the ECRHS, a random representative sample of Spanish young adults (n = 16,884), and a 20% randomised subsample made by those who answered to a short respiratory questionnaire and had atopy assessed, was studied.
