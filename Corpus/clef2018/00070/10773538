18F-labeled radiopharmaceuticals for PET in oncology, excluding FDG. This article reviews possible use of (18)F-labelled radiopharmaceuticals in oncology with positron emission tomography. The characteristics of various (18)F-labelled compounds are proteins and peptides, those that bind to. receptors, agents to assess hypoxia, and agents to evaluate gene therapy are highlighted. Furthermore, different (18)F-labelled tissue specific agents are indicated for the detection and monitoring of various malignancies: melanoma, brain tumours, breast cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose has been excluded from this summary.
