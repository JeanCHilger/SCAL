Ultrasonic tissue characterization evaluates myocardial viability and ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease. To evaluate whether or not ultrasonic tissue characterization (UTC) can detect jeopardized or salvageable myocardium in patients having chronic coronary artery disease, we studied 103 patients with sequential UTC, dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and (201)thallium stress-reinjection single-photon emission computed tomography (T1-SPECT). This revealed that the weighted amplitude of the cyclic modulation of integrated backscatter was larger for the myocardium with less ischemia burden or greater viability (p<0.001). The segments with larger ischemia burden or the nonviable myocardium demonstrated the contrary result. Using the receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses to determine the cutoff value of weighted amplitude for various predictions, UTC can detect ischemia in normokinetic myocardium (kappa = 0.34 compared to DSE or T1-SPECT) and viability in dyssynergic myocardium (kappa = 0.57 compared to DSE and 0.45, to T1-SPECT). These observations show that UTC may prove useful in the identification and pathophysiological understanding of myocardial ischemia and viability.
