Comparison of gated single-photon emission computed tomography with magnetic resonance imaging for evaluation of left ventricular function in ischemic cardiomyopathy. To perform a head-to-head comparison between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the evaluation of left ventricular (LV) function (LV ejection fraction [LVEF], LV volumes, and regional wall motion) in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, we studied 22 patients with chronic coronary artery disease and LV dysfunction. Multislice, multiphase echoplanar MRI was performed with Philips Gyroscan ACS-NT15. Image analysis was performed using the MASS software package to determine LV end-systolic volume, LV end-diastolic volume, and LVEF. The same parameters were calculated using quantitative gated SPECT software (QGS, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center). The different parameters were compared using linear regression, and correlation coefficients were calculated. Regional wall motion was also determined from both techniques, according to a 13-segment model and a 3-point scoring system (from 1 = normokinesia to 3 = akinesia or dyskinesia). A summed wall motion score was also calculated for MRI and gated SPECT. Good correlations were found between MRI and gated SPECT for all parameters: (1) summed wall motion scoreMRI versus summed wall motion scoreSPECT: y = 0.74x + 8.0, r = 0.88, p <0.01 (2) LV end-systolic volumeMRI versus LV end-systolic volumeSPECT: y = 0.94x - 12.3, r = 0.87, p <0.01
