Canadian beef quality audit 1998-99. The second beef quality audit was conducted in Canada in 1998-99 to determine the prevalence of quality defects in slaughtered cattle and to monitor changes since the first audit in 1995. Approximately 0.6% of the number of cattle processed annually in Canada were evaluated. Brands were observed on 49% and tag was observed on 43% of the hides. Both brands and tag had increased from 1995. Seventy percent of the cattle were polled and 5% had full horns thus, the number of horned cattle had decreased from 1995. Bruises were found on 54% of the carcasses, which was a decrease from 78% in 1995. Sixty-eight percent of the bruises were minor, 28% major, and 4% critical in severity. The distribution of bruises on the carcass was 17% on the chuck, 36% on the rib, 30% on the loin, and 16% on the round. Grubs were observed on 0.008% of the carcasses, and surface injection site lesions were observed on 0.2% of the whole carcasses, a decrease from the 1.3% seen in 1995. Seventy-two percent of the livers were passed for human food and 14% for pet food
