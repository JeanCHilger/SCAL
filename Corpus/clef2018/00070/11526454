Direct correlation between positron emission tomographic images of two reporter genes delivered by two distinct adenoviral vectors. Biodistribution, magnitude and duration of a therapeutic transgene's expression may be assessed by linking it to the expression of a positron emission tomography (PET) reporter gene (PRG) and then imaging the PRG's expression by a PET reporter probe (PRP) in living animals. We validate the simple approach of co-administering two distinct but otherwise identical adenoviruses, one expressing a therapeutic transgene and the other expressing the PRG, to track the therapeutic gene's expression. Two PET reporter genes, a mutant herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-sr39tk) and dopamine-2 receptor (D(2)R), each regulated by the same cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, have been inserted into separate adenoviral vectors (Ad). We demonstrate that cells co-infected with equivalent titers of Ad-CMV-HSV1-sr39tk and Ad-CMV-D(2)R express both reporter genes with good correlation (r(2) = 0.93). Similarly, a high correlation (r(2) = 0.97) was observed between the expression of both PRGs in the livers of mice co-infected via tail-vein injection with equivalent titers of these two adenoviruses. Finally, microPET imaging of HSV1-sr39tk and D(2)R expression with 9-(4-[(18)F]fluoro-3-hydroxymethylbutyl) guanine ([(18)F]FHBG) and 3-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)spiperone ([(18)F]FESP), utilizing several adenovirus-mediated delivery routes, illustrates the feasibility of evaluating relative levels of transgene expression in living animals, using this approach.
