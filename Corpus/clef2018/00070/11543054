Relation of GFR and endothelin in the plasma in pilots and ground crew. To observe the specitic property of Glomeoular Filtration Rate (GFR) and its relation to endothelin of plasma in pilots.GFR was assessed with single photon emisson computed tomography (SPECT), tracer for 99mTc-DTPA, enthlion of plasma were measured by radio immunossay in forty-six pilots, thirty ground crew and renal disease patients.Endothelin were not correlation with GFR in pilots. GFR of pilots and ground crew had not a significant difference. Compared with ground crew and pilots, endothelin of renal disease patients had a significant increased, and GFR had a significant decreased. Age were a linear negative correlation with total GFR r = (0.84, P < 0.01), flying time, age had not correlation with endothelin. After thirty-one ground endothelin had a significant difference with ground crew.It suggested that the endothelin has no influence on GFR in pilots when it was increased with in the limits of a level, pilots and ground crew may use the same stand on GFR.
