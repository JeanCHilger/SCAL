Disturbance of serotonin 5HT2 receptors in remitted patients suffering from hereditary depressive disorder. The characteristics of 5HT2 receptor binding were investigated in major depression in vivo using positron emission tomography and the radioligand F-18-altanserin.Twelve patients from families with high loading of depression living in a geographically restricted region were examined and compared with normal control subjects. At the time of the PET measurement all patients were remitted in some of them remission was sustained by antidepressive medication. Binding potential was assessed by Logan's graphical analysis method.The binding of F-18-altanserin was about 38% lower in patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001). A multiple regression analysis revealed that this difference was mainly induced by depression rather than by medication.The data suggest that 5HT2 receptors are altered in depression. We present evidence for a reduction of the receptor density, which might be usable as trait marker of subjects susceptible for depressive illness.
