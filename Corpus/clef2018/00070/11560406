A preliminary study of the ultrasonographic determination of renal size in the guinea pig (Cavia porcellus). No standard kidney measurements studies are available for guinea pigs and other pet rodents. Because the size of the kidney often is altered due to diffuse parenchymal renal disease, standardized normal values may help in the ultrasonographic detection of renal enlargement or diminution in vivo. We obtained in vivo ultrasonographic renal measurements from 31 clinically healthy guinea pigs. A significant (P < 0.01) positive correlation was found between renal length and calculated volume compared to body weight (r = 0.459 to 0.535). Renal volume data were calculated from a single sagittal ultrasonographic image by using the area-length prolate ellipsoid mathematic model. Renal volume can be calculated from the data of the regression equation, and both linear and calculated volume measurements correlated to body weight.
