Positron emission tomography and lymphoma therapy. FDG-PET is both able to provide information of lymphomatous organ involvement not available by conventional imaging techniques (US, CT, MRI) and to give reliable data otherwise obtainable only by using invasive procedures. As a whole body-screening technique, PET reduces diagnostic requirements and potential complications. Nevertheless the conventional imaging techniques are essential for the exact localisation and correct interpretation of PET findings. A number of factors that may produce false-positive results have to be taken into consideration, including post-treatment inflammatory changes and the sensitivity of the method in the setting of minimal residual disease. Despite its potential of a screening method being performed prior to other imaging procedures, PET is not yet established as a routine element for the primary staging of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Its value for re-staging is less doubtful due to the frequency of stage migration and possible changes in therapy related to the use of PET. Detailed cost-effectiveness studies are needed to assess the economic implications of an expanded use of PET in lymphoma therapy.
