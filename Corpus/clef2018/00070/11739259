Pursuit and saccadic eye movement subregions in human frontal eye field: a high-resolution fMRI investigation. Recent positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in humans have localized the frontal eye field (FEF) to the precentral sulcus (PCS). In macaque monkeys, low-threshold microstimulation and single unit recording studies have located a saccadic subregion of FEF in a restricted area along the anterior wall of the arcuate sulcus and a pursuit subregion located deeper in the sulcus close to the fundus. The functional organization and anatomical location of these two FEF subregions are still to be defined in humans. In the present study, we used fMRI with high spatial resolution image acquisition at 3.0 Tesla to map the saccade- and pursuit-related areas of FEF within the two walls of the PCS in 11 subjects. We localized the saccade-related area to the upper portion of the anterior wall of the precentral sulcus and the pursuit-related area to a deeper region along the anterior wall, extending in some subjects to the fundus or deep posterior wall. These findings localize distinct pursuit and saccadic subregions of FEF in humans and demonstrate a high degree of homology in the organization of these FEF subregions in the human and the macaque monkey.
