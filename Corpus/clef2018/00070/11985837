The contribution of visual areas to speech comprehension: a PET study in cochlear implants patients and normal-hearing subjects. Early visual cortex can be recruited by meaningful sounds in the absence of visual information. This occurs in particular in cochlear implant (CI) patients whose dependency on visual cues in speech comprehension is increased. Such cross-modal interaction mirrors the response of early auditory cortex to mouth movements (speech reading) and may reflect the natural expectancy of the visual counterpart of sounds, lip movements. Here we pursue the hypothesis that visual activations occur specifically in response to meaningful sounds. We performed PET in both CI patients and controls, while subjects listened either to their native language or to a completely unknown language. A recruitment of early visual cortex, the left posterior inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and the left superior parietal cortex was observed in both groups. While no further activation occurred in the group of normal-hearing subjects, CI patients additionally recruited the right perirhinal/fusiform and mid-fusiform, the right temporo-occipito-parietal (TOP) junction and the left inferior prefrontal cortex (LIPF, Broca's area). This study confirms a participation of visual cortical areas in semantic processing of speech sounds. Observation of early visual activation in normal-hearing subjects shows that auditory-to-visual cross-modal effects can also be recruited under natural hearing conditions. In cochlear implant patients, speech activates the mid-fusiform gyrus in the vicinity of the so-called face area. This suggests that specific cross-modal interaction involving advanced stages in the visual processing hierarchy develops after cochlear implantation and may be the correlate of increased usage of lip-reading.
