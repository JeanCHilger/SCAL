Usefulness of concomitant nitrate administration for the enhancement of viability detection with myocardial perfusion imaging. Myocardial viability assessment is crucial in the evaluation of patients who had prior myocardial infarction for revascularisation procedures. Conventional methods include nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging, dobutamine stress echocardiography and positron emission tomography. Utility of nitrate in assessment of viability was assessed. Twenty-five patients with prior myocardial infarction underwent 99mTc-sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography protocol of stress, rest and post 5 mg sublingual isorbide dinitrate. The mean age of the patients was 51.28 years. Eight (32%) had reduction in perfusion defect and increased tracer uptake following nitrate administration. It is concluded that addition of nitrate adds to utility of conventional perfusion imaging in the assessment of myocardial viability.
