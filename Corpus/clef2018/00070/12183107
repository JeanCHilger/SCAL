Positron emission tomography: the conceptual idea using a multidisciplinary approach. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a method for quantitatively measuring biochemical and physiological processes in vivo by using radiopharmaceuticals labeled with positron-emitting radionuclides such as 11C, 13N, 15O, and 18F and by measuring the annihilation radiation using a coincidence technique. This technique is also used for measurement of the pharmacokinetics of labeled drugs and measurement of the effects of drugs on metabolism. Deviations from normal metabolism can be measured and insight into biological processes responsible for diseases can be obtained.
