Radiopharmaceutical chemistry for positron emission tomography. Radiopharmaceutical chemistry includes the selection, preparation, and preclinical evaluation of radiolabeled compounds. This paper describes selection criteria for candidates for positron emission tomography (PET) investigations. Practical aspects of nucleophilic and electrophilic (18)F-fluorinations and (11)C-methylations are described. These aspects include production of fluorine-18 and carbon-11, workup of fluorine-18, (18)F radiochemistry, production of [(11)C]methyl iodide and triflate, and (11)C-methylation radiochemistry.
