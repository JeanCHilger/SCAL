Modular fluorescence sensors for saccharides. Modular and modular polymer supported fluorescence photoinduced electron transfer (PET) sensors 2 and 3 with two boronic acid receptor units, a pyren-1-yl fluorophore, and hexamethylene linker show selective saccharide binding in aqueous methanolic solution at pH 8.21.
