Time-dependent contribution of the hippocampal complex when remembering the past: a PET study. Previous studies of brain-damaged patients and functional neuro-imaging have consistently shown the importance of the hippocampal complex, i.e. the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, in episodic memory retrieval. We wished to determine whether patterns of brain activation during memory retrieval as measured by PET are same or different when the oldness of a to-be-retrieved episode is manipulated. Using cue words, subjects remembered related episodes from three periods of their life, childhood, adolescence and recent period. The results showed an increase of parahippocampal activities during recall of episodes from childhood and recent period, but not from adolescence. These data suggest a possibility of time-dependent hippocampal contribution in episodic recall, which cannot be understood in simple terms of recent remote memory dichotomy.
