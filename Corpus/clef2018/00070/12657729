Molecular imaging and cancer. Molecular imaging is a relatively new discipline, which developed over the past decade, initially driven by in situ reporter imaging technology. Noninvasive in vivo molecular imaging developed more recently and is based on magnetic resonance and nuclear (positron emission tomography gamma camera) and in vivo optical imaging systems. Molecular imaging has its roots in both molecular biology and cell biology, as well as imaging technology. Most current in vivo molecular imaging strategies are "indirect" and involve the coupling of a "reporter/marker gene" with a complimentary "reporter/marker probe." Imaging the level of probe accumulation provides indirect information related to the level of reporter gene expression. Reporter gene constructs are driven by upstream promoter/enhancer elements that function as an "on/off switch"
