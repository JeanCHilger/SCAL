Characteristics of pet populations and households in the Purdue Comparative Oncology Program catchment area, 1988. A 1-stage, random-digit dial telephone survey was conducted to obtain information on characteristics of pet populations and pet-owning households in 1988 in Marion and Tippecanoe Counties, Indiana. Interviews for 653 out of 731 eligible households were completed (response rate, 88%). Approximately half of the households in each county owned a pet. Of these, 35% owned at least 1 dog, and 23% owned at least 1 cat. Households with pets were more likely to be larger and have a higher median income score than were households without pets. Households with children between 6 and 17 years old were more likely to own pets than were households with no children however, no difference in pet ownership proportions was determined for households with children < or = 5 years old, compared with households without children. For dogs, younger dogs and male dogs were less likely to have been neutered than older dogs and female dogs. Older cats were more likely to have been neutered than younger cats, with neutering percentages of > 90% for cats in the oldest age group. Approximately 20% of dogs and 40% of cats had not been seen by a veterinarian in the 12 months preceding the interview.
