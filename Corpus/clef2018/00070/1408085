The value of acetazolamide provocation combined with blood flow tests in the diagnosis of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. In 28 (3 normal, 11 TIA, 14 completed stroke) patients 99mTc-HMPAO rCBF SPECT studies were performed at rest and after acetazolamide administration. For the investigations, a one-day protocol (the stress study directly followed the rest investigation) was used. The reconstructed and normalized slices were evaluated visually and semiquantitatively with a side difference analysis method. In the group of TIA patients, the abnormal results of the rCBF investigations increased from 55% to 82% after acetazolamide provocation. The corresponding results in the completed stroke group were 80% and 87%. After acetazolamide stimulation, hypoperfusion appeared or become more pronounced in the majority of the TIA group patients in contrast with the completed stroke patients with an unchanged or decreased perfusion abnormality. The semiquantitative evaluation method was mostly effective in the TIA group, where predominantly a one-sided cerebrovascular disorder was suspected. It was concluded that the 99mTc-HMPAO studies allow demonstration of the acetazolamide-induced cerebral perfusion alterations, and this method can be useful in the diagnosis and management of cerebrovascular disorders.
