Cholinergic modulation of learning and memory in the human brain as detected with functional neuroimaging. The advent of neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) has provided investigators with a tool to study neuronal processes involved in cognitive functions in humans. Recent years have seen an increasing amount of studies which mapped higher cognitive functions to specific brain regions. These studies have had a great impact on our understanding of neuroanatomical correlates of learning and memory in the living human brain. Recently, advances were made to go beyond the use of fMRI as a pure cognitive brain mapping device. One of these advances includes the use of psychopharmacological approaches in conjunction with neuroimaging. The paper will introduce the combination of neuroimaging and psychopharmacology as a tool to study neurochemical modulation of human brain function. A review of imaging studies using cholinergic challenges in the context of explicit and implicit learning and memory paradigms is provided which show that cholinergic neurotransmission modulates task-related activity in sensory and frontal cortical brain areas.
