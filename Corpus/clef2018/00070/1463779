1-(m-[211At]astatobenzyl)guanidine: synthesis via astato demetalation and preliminary in vitro and in vivo evaluation. No-carrier-added 1-(m-[211At]astatobenzyl)guanidine ([211At]MABG) was synthesized by astato demetalation using two different routes. The overall yield for the two-step approach from 3-(tri-n-butylstannyl)benzylamine was 13%. N-Chlorosuccinimide-mediated astato desilylation of 1-[3-(trimethylsilyl)benzyl]guanidine in acetic acid gave poor yields. In trifluoroacetic acid, the reaction worked well. The radiochemical yield was independent of reaction time and the amount of precursor used however, the temperature of the reaction had a marked effect. Yields of 85% were obtained in 5 min at 70 degrees C using 0.5 mumol of the precursor. The percentage specific binding in vitro of [211At]MABG was nearly constant over a 2-log activity range and was comparable to that of no-carrier-added [131]MIBG. The accumulation of [211At]MABG in the heart and adrenals of normal mice was similar to that observed for no-carrier-added [131]MIBG.
