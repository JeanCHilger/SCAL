FDG-PET/CT in re-staging of patients with lymphoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of combined fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in patients with lymphoma, and to compare the FDG-PET/CT staging results with those of FDG-PET and CT alone. Twenty-seven patients were studied. Each patient had clinical follow-up for >12 months and entered complete follow-up evaluation. Patient-based evaluation showed a sensitivity of 78% for CT alone, 86% for FDG-PET alone, 93% for CT and FDG-PET read side by side, and 93% for combined FDG-PET/CT imaging. Region-based evaluation showed a sensitivity for regional lymph node involvement of 61%, 78%, 91% and 96% respectively. FDG-PET/CT imaging is superior to CT alone ( P=0.02) and has additional benefit over FDG-PET alone due to exact anatomical localisation. We conclude that FDG-PET/CT imaging is accurate in re-staging lymphoma and offers advantages over separate FDG-PET and CT imaging.
