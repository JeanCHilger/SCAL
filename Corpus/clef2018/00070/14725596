Dopamine transporter binding in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome: a [123I]FP-CIT/SPECT study. To investigate dopamine transporter binding in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) with SPECT and [123I]FP-CIT.Ten neuroleptic na√Øve/free patients with GTS, and 10 age- and gender-matched normal volunteers were studied. Subjects were clinically evaluated. GTS severity and affective symptoms were measured and the presence of GTS-related behaviours were recorded.The GTS group showed significantly higher binding in both caudate and putamen nuclei than the controls. No associations were found between striatal binding ratios and measures of affect or GTS-related behaviours.Patients with GTS show higher striatal binding of FP-CIT to the striatum in comparison with age- and gender-matched control subjects, indicating that dopamine transporter abnormalities are involved in the pathophysiology of GTS. These abnormalities appear to be distributed across both caudate and putamen.
