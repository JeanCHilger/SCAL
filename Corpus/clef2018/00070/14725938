Relationship between plasma Cystatin C and creatinine in chronic renal diseases and Tx-transplant patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the best overall index of renal function in health and disease. Recently, Cystatin C (Cyst C), a low molecular weight protein freely filtered through the glomerulus, and almost completely reabsorbed and catabolized by tubular cells, has been proposed as a new and very sensitive serum marker of change in GFR. This study investigated the relationship between Cyst C and creatinine (CR) in renal disease patients.Serum Cyst C was determined by particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetry using the Cyst C PET-kit. The results could be obtained within 1 h. Cuvettes were washed before the Cyst C assay as recommended. Serum CR, BUN and albumin were determined by auto-analyzer.A strong correlation was observed between Cyst C and CR (P = 0.001, r = 0.764 and P = 0.0001, r = 0.888, respectively) in prehemodialysis (pre-HD) and kidney transplantation (Tx-kidney), whereas there was a weak correlation in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (P = 0.05, r = 0.535).These findings suggest that serum Cyst C may be considered as a sensitive predictive parameter for reduced GFR. It is of value for the laboratory diagnosis of chronic renal failure and should be preferentially used for CR clearance.
