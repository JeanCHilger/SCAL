Dichloropentafluoropropanes as solvents for size exclusion chromatography. We have found that HCFC225s (HCFC225ca: 3,3-dichloro-1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoropropane, HCFC225cb: 1,3-dichloro-1,1,2,2,3-pentafluoropropane) are superior mobile phases for size exclusion chromatography (SEC). As alternatives of CFC113, they have been shown to possess a number of excellent properties, such as low flammability, low viscosity, low cost, high purity, and environmental and operational friendliness. In addition, they have distinct advantages for the SEC measurement, because they solubilize some kinds of acrylate such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and commercial monodispersed PMMA can be used to prepare calibration curves necessary for the measurement of equivalent molecular weight of some polymers. Furthermore, we propose an HCFC225/1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol mixed solvent for use in the SEC of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and polyamides. Poly(2-(perfluorooctyl)ethyl acrylate), whose PMMA equivalent weight average molecular weight was 118,100 Da, was evaluated by a multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) detector to have an absolute molecular weight of 439,000 Da. The difference can be attributed to the molecular size of the polyfluorinated polymer compared to the non-fluorinated one. The possible application of this novel mobile phase system for molecular size and molecular weight characterization of perfluoropolyethers, PET, nylon 6 and nylon 6,6 are also discussed.
