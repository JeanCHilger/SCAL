Early diagnosis in Parkinson's disease. In early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) clinical symptoms are often very subtle. Therefore additional instrumental and biochemical methods could be useful to confirm the diagnosis. Firstly, clinical signs could be detected in a more sensitive way by using kinesiologic methods e.g. the Motor Performance Test. Secondly, imaging techniques like Positron Emission Tomography are valuable tools. Up to now, specific biochemical markers for early PD are not available. Field studies are needed to validate the sensitivity of different instrumental and biochemical methods for early diagnosis in PD.
