Utilisation of [11C]-labelled boron carbonyl complexes in palladium carbonylation reaction. The use of the [(11)C]BH(3).CO complex as a source of carbon monoxide in the carbonylation of iodobenzene catalysed by palladium(0) is described, which allows the synthesis of an amide and a lactone in a straightforward manner.
