Typical findings and erroneous findings in SPECT-radioimmunoscintigraphy using 99mTc-labeled CEA antibodies in colorectal tumors. Radioimmunoscintigraphy with 99mTc-labelled monoclonal antibodies against Carcino-Embryonic-Antigen (CEA) is increasingly accepted in the follow-up of patients suffering from colorectal carcinomas. However, interpretation of transversal, coronal and sagittal reconstructions of "Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography" radioimmunoscintigraphic studies is difficult due to physiological antibody accumulations and anatomical based variations of antibody distribution. In the following study we demonstrate therefore, the typical findings and "pitfalls" of radioimmunoscintigraphy with 99mTc-labelled CEA antibodies in comparison to findings in computed tomography, to help to avoid misinterpretations.
