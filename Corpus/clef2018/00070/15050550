Neural basis of pantomiming the use of visually presented objects. Neuropsychological studies of patients suffering from apraxia strongly imply a left hemisphere basis for skillful object use, the neural mechanisms of which, however, remain to be elucidated. We therefore carried out a PET study in 14 healthy human volunteers with the aim to isolate the neural mechanisms underlying the sensorimotor transformation of object-triggers into skilled actions. We employed a factorial design with two factors (naming, pantomiming and TRIGGER: actions, objects) and four conditions (IA: imitating the observed pantomime
