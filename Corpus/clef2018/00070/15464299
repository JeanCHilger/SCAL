Changes of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in the rat auditory pathway after bilateral ablation of the cochlea. It has been reported that the area of decreased glucose metabolism in the FDG-PET of prelingually deaf children correlates significantly with speech performance after cochlear implantation. In this study, we undertook to confirm changes of glucose metabolism in the cerebral cortex using an animal model with age-matching groups to completely exclude the influence of age differences between the deaf and normal-hearing groups. The cochlea was ablated bilaterally at a postnatal 10-14 days in the deaf groups 3-4 deaf and normal rats were included at each time point at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks and 7 months after ablation. After injecting 2-deoxyglucose intraperitoneally, digitalized autoradiographic images were obtained, and analyzed by using two different methods
