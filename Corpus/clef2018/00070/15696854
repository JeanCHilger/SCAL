Coeliac disease and (extra)intestinal T-cell lymphomas: definition, diagnosis and treatment. Intestinal lymphomas encompass those lymphomas with a dominant or only localized occurrence in the intestinal tract. Coeliac disease is highly associated with enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphomas (EATLs). Coeliac disease-related lymphomas can appear at nodal or extranodal sites. EATL is often multifocal with ulcerative lesions, which explains the high perforation rate at presentation or during chemotherapy. Staging includes ear-nose-throat examination and CT scan of the chest and abdomen. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning may be valuable. Accurate diagnosis based on endoscopic biopsies is preferable if necessary, full thickness laparoscopic small-bowel biopsies are mandatory. Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) with aberrant T cells carries a high risk of development of EATLs. There is no satisfactory treatment for EATL, the only possibility of preventing EATL development in RCD being autologous bone marrow transplantation. EATLs can present in 20% of patients as extra-small-bowel T-cell lymphomas
