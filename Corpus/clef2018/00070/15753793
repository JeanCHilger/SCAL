The identification of reversible dysfunctional myocardium is influenced by the severity of contractile dysfunction and by the length of follow-up. To evaluate the influence of the severity of regional myocardial dysfunction and of the length of follow-up on the identification of myocardial viability with rest-redistribution Tl single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and low-dose dobutamine echocardiography (LDDE).Twenty-six patients with chronic coronary artery disease and wall motion abnormalities, candidates for revascularization, were included in this study. All patients underwent, in the same week, Tl SPECT and LDDE for pre-revascularization evaluation of myocardial viability. Reversibility of regional dysfunction was assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography, 40+/-20 days (early follow-up) and 12+/-5 months (late follow-up) after revascularization.In a/dyskinetic segments, Tl SPECT showed similar values of sensitivity (78% vs. 71%, P=NS) and slightly higher values of specificity (43% vs. 18%, P<0.01) compared to hypokinetic segments, in predicting functional recovery at early follow-up. No significant changes were observed in the diagnostic accuracy of Tl SPECT at late follow-up. On the contrary, LDDE provided significantly lower values of sensitivity (56% vs. 94%, P<0.05) and higher values of specificity (73% vs. 9%, P<0.01) in a/dyskinetic compared to hypokinetic segments. Specificity of LDDE in a/dyskinetic segments significantly increased from early (73%) to late follow-up (95% P<0.05). Similarly, positive predictive value in a/dyskinetic segments significantly increased from early (69%) to late follow-up (96%The severity of regional dysfunction and the length of follow-up significantly influence the diagnostic accuracy of LDDE but not of rest-redistribution Tl SPECT in the identification of myocardial viability.
