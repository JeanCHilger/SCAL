Repeatability of left ventricular ejection fraction and volume measurement for 99mTc-tetrofosmin gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). This study was carried out to assess the repeatability of left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and volume values obtained using Cedars-Sinai quantitative gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (QGS) software and relatively low doses of 400-600 MBq of 99mTc-tetrofosmin.Repeatability was assessed in a group of 75 patients, with both normal and reduced EF, who underwent repeat 99mTc-tetrofosmin gated SPECT studies and showed no clinical change in cardiac status. Gated SPECT data were acquired 1 h after injection at rest of 400-600 MBq of 99mTc-tetrofosmin. The standard patient dose was 400 MBq however, some patients with a weight of >90 kg were given increased doses up to a maximum of 600 MBq.There was good correlation of EF and volumes between the first and repeat measurements, and no significant difference between the mean EF and volumes for both the initial and repeat measurements. Background-corrected counts in the left ventricle were calculated and patients were divided into two groups: one with low counts and one with high counts. The mean difference in EF between the first and repeat measurements was significantly higher for patients in the low count group compared with those in the high count group, but there was no significant change in volume. Similarly, the mean sequential difference in EF was significantly higher for patients with normal EF, but there was no significant difference in volume.We have demonstrated that EF measured using 99mTc-tetrofosmin gated SPECT is repeatable, particularly for patients with low EF, provided that adequate left ventricular counts are obtained. This will require doses greater than 400 MBq in larger patients. Ventricular volumes calculated using QGS may not be sufficiently repeatable for clinical use.
