PET/CT in the evaluation of childhood sarcomas. Our objective was to review our preliminary experience with PET/CT in evaluating childhood sarcomas including rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 28), the Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors (n = 14), nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft-tissue sarcoma (n = 9), osteosarcoma (n = 8), chondrosarcoma (n = 1), and embryonal sarcoma (n = 1).We found PET/CT useful in depicting an unknown primary rhabdomyosarcoma and detecting unsuspected and unusual metastatic sites of childhood sarcomas. It was useful in monitoring response to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and radiofrequency ablation and aided the postoperative evaluation of tumor resection sites.
