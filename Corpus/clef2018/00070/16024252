A simple and fast method for the preparation of n.c.a. 2-[18F]F-A85380 for human use. 2-[18F]F-A85380 is the first subtype selective PET-radiotracer to visualize the distribution of alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in human brain in vivo. We investigated a fast and safe automated production of 2-[18F]F-A85380 by purification of the BOC-protected intermediate product with a combination of solid phase extraction cartridges. After deprotection, adjustment of the pH and sterile filtration n.c.a. 2-[18F]F-A85380 was applicable for the use in human studies with a high specific activity and an overall radiochemical yield of 55% in 35 minutes.
