PET imaging and optical imaging with D-luciferin [11C]methyl ester and D-luciferin [11C]methyl ether of luciferase gene expression in tumor xenografts of living mice. New carbon-11 labeled D-luciferin analogs D-luciferin [(11)C]methyl ester ([(11)C]LMEster, [(11)C]1) and D-luciferin [(11)C]methyl ether ([(11)C]LMEther, [(11)C]2) were synthesized in 25-55% radiochemical yield. PET studies with [(11)C]LMEster and [(11)C]LMEther demonstrate a lower retention of the C-11 label at 45 min post-injection in luciferase expression tumor. Optical imaging with unlabeled substrate D-luciferin and radiotracers [(11)C]LMEster and [(11)C]LMEther gave tumor luciferase images within a few minutes of photon counting.
