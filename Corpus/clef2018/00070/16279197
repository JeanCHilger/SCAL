Cloning and expression of the apx III A gene of Actinobacillus pleuropneumonie. The apx III A gene of Actinobacillus pleuropneumonie (App) was amplified by PCR. The amplified DNA fragment 3 466bp was cloned into pMD18-T. After R.E. analysis and sequencing, the apx III A gene in pMD18-T was ligated into pBluescrip II SK(+), the recombinant expression plasmid pET-28b/apx III A was constructed and analysed with R. E., the protein of apx III A gene expressed in E. coli BL21 was detected by Western blotting. Based on expressed apx III A protein as antigen, empty expression vector as control, the ELISA to detect antibody against apx III A was developed and was primarily used to detect serum samples.
