Evaluation of cerebral blood flow by single-photon emission computed tomography in young Asian Indians with hypertension. The objective of the study was to investigate abnormalities of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in young (age 33.0+/-6.3 years range 21-45 years) non-diabetic and normolipidemic Asian Indians with hypertension. The rCBF was assessed with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with hypertension (n = 33) and healthy controls (n = 20). The SPECT findings were normal in 41 subjects and showed abnormalities of cerebral perfusion in 10 subjects, all of which were hypertensive patients. These observations are extremely important for a vast number of young hypertensive patients in India. To prevent cerebrovascular accidents in future, patients with hypertension and decreased rCBF should be carefully monitored and their hypertension should be strictly controlled. These subjects may also be researched as potential candidates for preventive antiplatelet therapy.
