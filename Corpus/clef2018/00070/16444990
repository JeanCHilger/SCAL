Distinct different intra-tumor distribution of FDG between early phase and late phase in mouse fibrosarcoma. An early image of intra-tumor distribution of 14C-labeled fluorodeoxy glucose (14C-FDG) was compared with a late image of 18F-labeled FDG (18F-FDG) using mouse fibrosarcoma. Heterogeneous intra-tumor distribution of 14C-FDG was observed 1 minute post injection of the tracer, whereas relatively homogeneous distribution of 18F-FDG was seen 30 minutes later. 14C-FDG was particularly taken up in the peripheral part of the tumor immediately after the tracer injection. A gradual and significant increase in 18F-FDG accumulation with time was seen in the central part of tumor, which indicated an enhancement of anaerobic glycolysis. An initial uptake of 18F-FDG was also compared with distribution of 14C-iodoantipyrine and 14C-thymidine uptake. Intratumoral distribution of initial uptake of 18F-FDG showed almost the same regional distribution of 14C-iodoantipyrine. A similar distribution of 14C-thymidine as the initial uptake of 18F-FDG was also observed. These results indicated that a high initial FDG uptake area seemed to be highly proliferative. A significant difference in the intratumoral distribution of FDG between early phase and late phase seemed to be related to heterogeneous biological characteristics of tumor cells.
