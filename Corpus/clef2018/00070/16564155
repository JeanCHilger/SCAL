An audit of fusion CT-PET in the management of colorectal liver metastases. To assess the use of positron emission tomography combined with computerized tomography (CT-PET) with fluoro-18-2-deoxy-d-glucose ((18)F-FDG) to identify hyper-metabolic tumours, especially colorectal metastases (CRM).Patient particulars, diagnoses and clinical outcome for each patient were studied. Twenty-three patients underwent CT-PET, 10 males and 13 females, median age 59 (range 34-72). Fourteen patients presented with primary liver CRM and nine had undergone previous liver resections. Indications for CT-PET included suspected extrahepatic disease in 13/23 patients, possible hepatic recurrence 5/23 and clinical suspicion in 8/23 patients.Seven patients had a major impact on their management. Unexpected (not seen on CT) findings in the CRM group included, 7/23 (30%) patients with extrahepatic disease, 3/23 with hepatic metastases, 8/23 suspected of having liver or distant metastases on CT had a negative study. A clinical decision, based on the CT-PET report, could be undertaken in 21/23 patients.CT-PET is useful in patients with CRM where conventional imaging presents dilemmas such as: assessment of suspected extrahepatic disease, recurrence in liver, patients with advanced or perforated initial tumours.
