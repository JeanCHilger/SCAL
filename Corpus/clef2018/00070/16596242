18FDG PET in oncology: the best and the worst (Review). The clinical added-value of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18FDG PET) in the management of oncology patients is increasingly documented. In the present review, we discuss both the benefits and the limitations of 18FDG PET in different cancers. Considering the literature data and our own experience, we also indicate the best clinical approach to optimize the use of metabolic imaging in oncology.
