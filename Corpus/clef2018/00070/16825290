Intramyocardial injection of vascular endothelial growth factor-A165 plasmid followed by granulocyte-colony stimulating factor to induce angiogenesis in patients with severe chronic ischaemic heart disease. To assess the safety and effects of combined treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor-A(165) plasmid (VEGF-A(165)) and granulocyte- colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization of bone marrow stem cells in patients with severe chronic ischaemic heart disease (IHD).Sixteen patients with severe chronic IHD were treated with intramyocardial injections of VEGF-A(165) plasmid followed 1 week later by G-CSF (10 microg/kg/day for 6 days). Two control groups included (i) sixteen patients treated with intramyocardial injections of VEGF-A(165) plasmid and (ii) sixteen patients treated with intramyocardial injections of placebo. In the G-CSF group, circulating CD34+ stem cells increased almost 10-fold compared with the control groups (P<0.0001). After 3 months, there was no improvement in myocardial perfusion at single photon emission computerized tomography in the VEGF-A(165) and G-CSF treated group, and clinical symptoms were unchanged. There were no side effects to the gene and G-CSF therapy.Intramyocardial VEGF-A(165) gene transfer followed by bone marrow stem cell mobilization with G-CSF seemed safe. However, a significant increase in circulating stem cells did not lead to improved myocardial perfusion or clinical effects suggesting a neutral effect of the treatment. To improve homing of stem cells, higher doses of VEGF-A(165) and/or use of SDF-1 transfer might be considered.
