Computerized analysis of cerebral blood flow autoregulation in humans: validation of a method for pharmacologic studies. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation in the supine position without tilting using systemic ganglion-blockade (trimetaphane camphosulfonas) combined with lower body vacuum is evaluated. Automatic computerized curve-fitting analysis for assessment of the lower limit (LL) of autoregulation is introduced. Global CBF was evaluated using the arteriovenous-O2-difference method in 12 volunteers and in seven patients with chronic arterial hypertension. Classic autoregulatory curves were found in all cases. The LL of CBF autoregulation was 85 +/- 5 mm Hg in the volunteers and 113 +/- 7 mm Hg in the hypertensive patients. In seven of the volunteers, the autoregulatory study was performed twice in 1 day a small but significant shift of LL toward higher blood pressure (BP) values was observed in the second test (3 mm Hg). In five of the hypertensive patients, regional CBF (rCBF) was measured by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of inhaled xenon-133. The median global CBF decreased from 62 to 45 ml/100 g/min during the mean arterial BP (MABP) decrease from 110 to 68 mm Hg. The regional distribution of CBF was normal at baseline as well as during hypotension. The method is suitable for pharmacologic studies of cerebral autoregulation.
