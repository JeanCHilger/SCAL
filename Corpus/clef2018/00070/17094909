Three-dimensional dose calculation of 153Sm-EDTMP in treating bone metastasis--comparison of Monte Carlo and S value calculation methods. Three-dimensional (3D) dose calculation of radionuclide therapy for specified patients is a research interest in nuclear medicine, of which the main methods include S value calculation method, dose point kernel calculation method, and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method. This study was to compare 3D absorbed dose calculation of 153Sm-EDTMP in treating a specified patient with bone metastasis between MC and S value methods.A 3D dose calculation program was built based on the MC program EGS4, and the S value of nuclide 153Sm was calculated. For the specified patient with bone metastasis, 153Sm activity in excreted urine was measured at 0, 0.5, 2, 3.5, 5 and 6 h after injection of 153Sm-EDTMP. The accumulative activity is calculated by fitting measurement data. Based on the fusion SPECT/CT images of the patient, 3D absorbed dose is calculated by MC and S value methods.The iso-dose distribution curves of MC and S value calculation results were similar, and the dose was mainly collected in the bone. According to the 2 methods, the maximum doses were 3.92 Gy and 3.71 Gy with a difference of 5%. On the dose-volume histogram of the calculation volume, D10 (the highest dose of the 10% volume) were 2.14 Gy and 2.00 Gy with a difference of 7% D20 (the highest dose of the 20% volume) were 0.58 Gy and 0.51 Gy with a difference of 14%. In general, the data of S value calculation were smaller than the data of MC calculation.MC and S value could be used to calculate the 3D dose of radionuclide therapy based on nuclear medical image. S value is a fast and simple method for the dose evaluation although the error of the calculation is relatively bigger.
