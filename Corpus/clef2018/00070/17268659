Detection of chemical warfare simulants by phosphorylation of a coumarin oximate. The detection of chemical warfare simulants is attained by the PET mechanism that gives an "off-on" fluorescent response with a half-life of approximately 50 ms upon phosphorylation of a reactive oximate functionality the X-ray crystal structure of the oximate was also obtained and is discussed.
