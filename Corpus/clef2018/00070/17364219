Myocardial viability by contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance in patients with coronary artery disease: comparison with gated single-photon emission tomography and FDG position emission tomography. The aim of this study was to assess the value of contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in viability for patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (ejection fraction [EF] </=50%), comparing to gated thallium-201 ((201)Tl) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET).One hundred sixteen patients (EF 37.8 +/- 16.2%) underwent stress-reinjection or rest-redistribution gated-SPECT and CMR (46 FDG-PET) within 1 month. All images were analyzed in a 17-segment and 0-4 scales system. Of 1972 segments, delayed enhancement (DE) on CMR correlated well with (201)Tl reduction (r = 0.90, p < 0.0001). The agreement of SPECT (>/=50% maximal (201)Tl activity) and CMR (</=50% DE) was 96.8% (kappa = 0.62). CMR detected more subendocardial scars in 18 subjects (60 segments). Reduced (201)Tl activity but none DE were observed in 19 subjects (76 segments more inferior) who had lower EF and larger end-systolic volume (p < 0.05). Of 411 dysfunctional segments from 46 patients, FDG-PET (>/=50% of maximal FDG uptake) detected more viability (9%).The extent of DE correlated (201)Tl activity well. CMR could detect more small infarcts, while FDG-PET could detect more viability. CMR could distinguish between artifacts or infarction on SPECT, especially in poor LV function.
