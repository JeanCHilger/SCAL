Diagnostic work-up of the prostate carcinoma. The most important investigation in the diagnostic work-up of prostate carcinoma is the determination of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the serum. The rate of increase in PSA (PSA velocity) may provide valuable additional information. The highest detection rate is achieved using the combination of digital rectal examination (DRE) and PSA determination. Transrectal ultrasound is of importance in particular in the context of biopsy-taking. Nomograms permit an estimation of the local tumor spread and lymph node status. The currently accepted most sensitive method for the detection of bone metastases is scintigraphy. The value of PET in the primary diagnostic work-up has yet to be established.
