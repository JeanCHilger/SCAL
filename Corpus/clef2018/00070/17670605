Staging of non-small cell lung cancer: clinical value of positron emission tomography and mediastinoscopy. We report about a MEDLINE research from 2000 to 2005 with the key words 'positron emission tomography AND/OR mediastinoscopy'. The search identified 448 potential studies. Out of the published data sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy for mediastinal lymph node staging by FDG-PET ranged from 58%-94%, 76%-96%, 43%-95%, 56%-98% to 74%-91%, respectively. With corresponding values of 80%-96%, 100%, 100%, 92%-97%, and 94%, respectively, for mediastinoscopy. FDG-PET improved the rate of detection of local and distant metastases in 12% to 62% and changed the management of treatment in 8% to 60% of patients with NSCLC. Our study shows that in the diagnostic strategy of patients with NSCLC, additional FDG-PET can prevent non-therapeutic thoracotomy in a significant number of cases. If FDG-PET imaging and CT scan is negative for mediastinal lymph node involvement routinely mediastinoscopy can be omitted and thoracotomy can immediately be performed. In patients with negative FDG-PET scan, but positive CT scan, histologic verification by invasive methods can individually be considered. Patients with positive FDG-PET scan mediastinoscopy still remain a reliable standard for exact lymph node staging. By incorporating FDG-PET in clinical staging unnecessary exploratory thoracotomies, and mediastinoscopy, can be omitted.
