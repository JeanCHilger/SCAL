Cerebral blood flow associated with creative performance: a comparative study. Creativity is important for social survival and individual wellbeing science, art, philosophy and technology have been enriched and expanded by this trait. To our knowledge this is the first study probing differences in brain cerebral blood flow (CBF) between highly creative individuals (scientists and/or artists socially recognized for their contributions to their fields with creativity indexes corresponding to the 99% percentile) and average control subjects while performing a verbal task from the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. Additionally, we correlated CBF with creativity dimensions such as fluency, originality and flexibility. Subjects with a high creative performance showed greater CBF activity in right precentral gyrus, right culmen, left and right middle frontal gyrus, right frontal rectal gyrus, left frontal orbital gyrus, and left inferior gyrus (BA 6, 10, 11, 47, 20), and cerebellum
