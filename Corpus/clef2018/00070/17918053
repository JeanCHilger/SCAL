The seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii in women from Sanliurfa, a province with a high raw meatball consumption. Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan that can infect all kind of birds and all mammals including humans and is common throughout the world. The prevalence varies according to social and cultural habits, pet cats in homes and geographic factors. Domestic cats are considered to be an important source of Toxoplasma gondii infection. From January to June 2006, the prevalence of toxoplasmosis was retrospectively monitored from blood samples that had been sent to our laboratory in order to determine the levels of IgM and IgG. All the subjects were women and 2,586 blood samples were investigated with the chemiluminescence immunoassay method. The rates of Toxoplasma gondii IgM antibodies were found to be 3.0% (78/2,586) and that of Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies, 69.5% (1.798/2,586). The total rate of positivity of Toxoplasma gondii antibodies was 69.6% (1,801/2,586) and the negativity, 30.4% (785/2,586). The highest positive rates have been reported in the southeastern region of Turkey and the 69.6% detected in our study seems to be the highest rate. Raw meatball consumption is common in our region and raw meat has a high risk of Toxoplasma gondii infection by direct ingestion of tissue cysts. As a result we consider that the high frequency of Toxoplasma gondii seropositivity in this region is due to raw meatball consumption.
