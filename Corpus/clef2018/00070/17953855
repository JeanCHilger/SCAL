Imaging of the pathophysiology in acute stroke. Recent developments in neuroimaging have changed the diagnostic aspect of acute stroke and improved our understanding of stroke pathophysiology. Both diffusion weighted MR imaging and CT are capable of detecting the infarcted volume damaged by cytotoxic edema. However, within six hours of stroke onset, DWI has both higher sensitivity and specificity than CT. Perfusion weighted MR imaging and perfusion CT can identify the tissue at risk surrounding the core of the infarct. CT and MR-angiography contribute important information concerning the intra and extracerebral arteries.
