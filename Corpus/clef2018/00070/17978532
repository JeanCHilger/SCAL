Thalamic hyperperfusion in verbal hallucination of Parkinsonian patients. We compared brain perfusion image using 3D-SSP analysis of (123)I-IMP SPECT between Parkinson's disease patients with auditory verbal hallucination and those without auditory hallucination.Eighty-three cases with Parkinson's disease were studied. In 6 of these patients, auditory hallucination was noted. Among them, four cases had verbal hallucination and two other cases had elementary hallucination. Auditory hallucination was not found in the other 77 cases.Right thalamic perfusion was significantly increased in the verbal hallucination group compared to the group that lacked auditory hallucination.In Parkinson's disease, the right thalamic hyperactive state may be related to verbal hallucination.
