(13)N-ammonia myocardial perfusion imaging with a PET/CT scanner: impact on clinical decision making and cost-effectiveness. The purpose of the study is to determine the impact of 13N-ammonia positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) on clinical decision making and its cost-effectiveness.One hundred consecutive patients (28 women, 72 men mean age 60.9 +/- 12.0 yearsBefore PET management strategies would have been: diagnostic angiography (62 of 100 patients), diagnostic angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI 6 of 100), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABGIn a population with a high prevalence of known CAD, PET is cost-effective and has an important impact on patient management.
