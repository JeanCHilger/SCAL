Pharmacological evaluation of [123I]-CLINDE: a radioiodinated imidazopyridine-3-acetamide for the study of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites (PBBS). The study aims to evaluate the iodinated imidazopyridine, N',N'-diethyl-6-Chloro-(4'-[(123)I]iodophenyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetamide ([(123)I]-CLINDE) as a tracer for the study of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites (PBBS).In vitro studies were performed using membrane homogenates and sections from kidney, adrenals, and brain cortex of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and incubated with [(123)I]-CLINDE. For in vivo studies, the rats were injected with [(123)I]-CLINDE. In competition studies, PBBS-specific drugs PK11195 and Ro 5-4864 and the CBR specific drug Flumazenil were injected before the radiotracer.In vitro binding studies in adrenal, kidney, and cortex mitochondrial membranes indicated that [(123)I]-CLINDE binds with high affinity to PBBS, K(d) = 12.6, 0.20, and 3.84 nM, respectively. The density of binding sites was 163, 5.3, and 0.34 pmol/mg protein, respectively. In vivo biodistribution indicated high uptake in adrenals (5.4), heart (1.5), lungs (1.5), kidney (1.5) %ID/g at 6 h p.i. In the central nervous system (CNS), the olfactory bulbs displayed the highest uptake up to six times the activity in blood. Pre-administration of unlabeled CLINDE, PK11195 and Ro 5-4864 (1 mg/kg) reduced the uptake of [(123)I]-CLINDE by 70-55% in olfactory bulbs. In the kidney and heart, a reduction of 60-80% ID/g was observed, while an increase was observed in the adrenals requiring 10 mg/kg for significant displacement. Flumazenil had no effect on uptake in peripheral organs and brain. Metabolite analysis indicated >90% of the radioactivity in the above tissues was intact [(123)I]-CLINDE.[(123)I]-CLINDE displays high and selective uptake for the PBBS and warrants further development as a probe for imaging PBBS using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
