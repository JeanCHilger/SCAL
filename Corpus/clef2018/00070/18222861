Volume rendering of multimodal images: application to MRI and PET imaging of the human brain. A procedure for combining and visualizing complementary structural and functional information from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) is described. MR and PET images of the human brain were obtained and correlated to form three-dimensional volumes of image data. Volume rendering and solid-texturing concepts were combined to develop a new volume imaging technique for volume texture-mapping' brain glucose metabolism (from PET) onto brain anatomy (from MRI). The technique was used to produce sequences of three-dimensional views: these sequences were dynamically displayed in a
