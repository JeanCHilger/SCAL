Evaluation of hepatic angiography procedures and bremsstrahlung imaging in selective internal radiation therapy: a two-year single-center experience. The imaging of Bremsstrahlung radiation is performed after hepatic radioembolization to assess the distribution of the injected radioactive material. This review assesses the role of Bremsstrahlung imaging and its relation to the angiographic procedure and technique in hepatic selective internal radiation therapy on 21 patients undergoing this procedure at a single center.
