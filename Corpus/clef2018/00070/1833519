A review of cardiac imaging with sestamibi and teboroxime. Overall, it is clear that the two new technetium-labeled compounds can provide diagnostic myocardial perfusion imaging both at stress (exercise and pharmacologic) and rest, but they have very different mechanisms of transport in comparison to each other and to thallium. Therefore, new imaging protocols will need to be developed and refined by practical experience as the use of these agents expands. Further investigative work needs to be done to optimize protocols and computer processing of images. In addition, special clinical situations will become associated with the use of these new compounds. Nuclear cardiology will continue to advance during this time of great changes and challenges if informational exchange on these topics continues to flourish and critical clinical trials are completed.
