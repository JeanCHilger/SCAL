Levels of adhesion molecules bear a relationship to triglyceride levels in type 2 diabetic subjects with proven silent ischemia. The aim of the study was to examine the levels of adhesion molecules, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and lipid spectrum of type 2 diabetic subjects with proven silent myocardial ischemia.We included in the study 19 patients with ischemia (Group 1) and 16 patients without ischemia (Group 2). We documented silent ischemia by an exercise-myocardial single photon emission computed tomography. We examined the levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, E-selectin, HbA1c, microalbuminuria (MAU), hs-CRP and carotid intima-media thickness.The differences among the values of lipids, adhesion molecules, HbA1c, hs-CRP, MAU between the groups were not statistically significant. E-selectin levels positively correlated with triglyceride levels in the group 1 (Spearman correlation, P<0.05). This correlation was not proven in the Group 2.Statistically differences between the study groups were not significant. Levels of E-selectin positively correlated with high triglyceride levels in type 2 diabetic subjects with silent ischemia. This correlation documents a disturbance of the reverse cholesterol transport system.
