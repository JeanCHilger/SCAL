Evaluation of [11C]PipISB and [18F]PipISB in monkey as candidate radioligands for imaging brain cannabinoid type-1 receptors in vivo. N-(4-Fluorobenzyl)-4-[3-(piperidin-1-yl)indole-1-sulfonyl]benzamide] (PipISB, 3) is a selective and high-potency cannabinoid subtype-1 (CB1) receptor inverse agonist. We have previously reported radiosyntheses of [11C]3 and [18F]3. Here, we aimed to evaluate the uptake and CB(1) receptor-specific binding of each radioligand in monkey brain in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET). [11C]3 or [18F]3 was injected intravenously into rhesus or cynomolgus monkey, respectively, and examined with PET at baseline or after pretreatment with a receptor-saturating dose of CB1 receptor-selective ligand (3 for [11C]3 or 8 for [18F]3). In one PET experiment, the dose of 3 was administered at 100 min after [11C]3. Relative plasma concentrations of radioligand and radiometabolites were concurrently measured in baseline experiments with high-performance liquid chromatography. Brain radioactivity uptake was highest in striatum and cerebellum, and it reached 170-270% standardized uptake value (SUV) at 120 min after injection of [11C]3 and 180% SUV at 240 min after injection of [18F]3. Radioactivity was well retained in all CB1 receptor-rich regions. No reference region could be identified for nonspecifically bound radioligand. Under CB1 receptor pretreatment and displacement conditions, initial brain uptakes of radioactivity were similar to those at baseline. Regional brain radioactivity concentrations then became homogeneous and diminished to between 70 and 80% SUV at 120 min after injection of [11C]3 and to 25% SUV at 240 min after injection of [18F]3. [18F]3 was not defluorinated but was metabolized to less lipophilic radiometabolites, as was [11C]3. Hence, [11C]3 and [18F]3 showed high CB1 receptor-specific binding in monkey brain in vivo and merit further investigation as prospective PET radioligands in humans.
