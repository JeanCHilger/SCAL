Randomized study of mononuclear bone marrow cell transplantation in patients with coronary surgery. Mononuclear bone marrow cell (MN-BMC) transplantation has great clinical potential to promote myocardiogenesis and angiogenesis. This randomized study was designed to assess the feasibility and safety of MN-BMC transplantation during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with ischemic heart failure.Thirty-six patients were prospectively enrolled and randomized to a MN-BMC group (n = 18) and a control group (n = 18). A mean number of 6.59 x 10(8) +/- 5.12 x 10(8) MN-BMC were injected into the infarcted and marginal areas during CABG in the MN-BMC group. The patients in the control group underwent CABG alone. All patients were followed up to 6 months.There was one death in the MN-BMC group and no death in the control group. Two patients developed ventricular arrhythmia in the MN-BMC group. Compared with baseline and the control group, therapeutic effects of MN-BMC transplantation were observed over time. Heart function (New York Heart Association) was significantly improved and angina pectoris was alleviated in the MN-BMC group. Left ventricular ejection fraction in the MN-BMC group was greater than the control group. The thickness and motion velocity of the infarcted wall were significantly increased in the MN-BMC group. More pronounced perfusion improvements of ischemic regions and LV were observed in the MN-BMC group. There was one late death in the MN-BMC group. No procedure-related complications occurred.MN-BMC transplantation improves cardiac function and regional perfusion in ischemic heart failure patients during CABG. A large cohort with long-term follow-up is needed to further evaluate the safety of MN-BMC transplantation.
