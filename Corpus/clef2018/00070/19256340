Construction and evaluation of DnaB split intein high expression vector and a six amino acids cyclic peptide library. A library with potential to produce six amino acids cyclic peptides was prepared using pET-28a as the starting plasmid. pVmut was used to amplify the Int(C)-dnaB-N-Int(N) fragment that was inserted into pET28a to give pEV. On pEV, DnaB split intein was expressed under the strong T7 promoter. Analyses of Escherichia coli transformed with pEV showed that DnaB split intein was produced in large quantity and the fusion protein self-spliced efficiently to produce cyclized DnaB-N. A synthesized 115 bp fragment mixture encoding 5 random amino acids was inserted into pEV to generate pEV-IS. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli. A library of 10(3) clones was obtained, 20 randomly picked clones were sequenced. All of them contain different sequences. Nine clones were chosen for further analysis. Split-intein-ISs were expressed in large quantity, and 90% of them self-spliced under 16 degrees C in 20 hours. After induction at 30 degrees C for 3 hours, the expressed DnaB split intein was purified using His-column, and then a molecular weight of target cyclic peptide was detected by MALDI-TOF-MS.
