Long term non-invasive imaging of embryonic stem cells using reporter genes. Development of non-invasive and accurate methods to track cell fate after delivery will greatly expedite transition of embryonic stem (ES) cell therapy to the clinic. In this protocol, we describe the in vivo monitoring of stem cell survival, proliferation and migration using reporter genes. We established stable ES cell lines constitutively expressing double fusion (DF enhanced green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase) or triple fusion (TF
