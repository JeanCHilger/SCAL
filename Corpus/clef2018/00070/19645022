18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) imaging in the staging and prognosis of inflammatory breast cancer. : To prospectively assess fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) staging and prognosis value in patients with suspected inflammatory breast cancer (IBC).: Sixty-two women (mean age 50.7 +/- 11.4 years) presenting with unilateral inflammatory breast tumors (59 invasive carcinomas 3 mastitis) underwent a PET/CT scan before biopsy.: PET/CT scan was positive for the primary malignant tumor in 100% and false positive in 2 of 3 benign mastitis. In 59 IBC patients, FDG nodal foci were detected in axillary (90% n = 53) and extra-axillary areas (56%: FDG-PET/CT imaging provides additional invaluable information regarding nodal status or distant metastases in IBC patients and should be considered in the initial staging. It seems also that some prognostic information can be derived from FDG uptake characteristics. Cancer 2009. (c) 2009 American Cancer Society.
