Synthesis and preliminary biological evaluations of [18F]-1-deoxy-1-fluoro-scyllo-inositol. A novel PET radiotracer, [18F]-1-deoxy-1-fluoro-scyllo-inositol, was synthesized via a one-pot reaction in 16 +/- 3% uncorrected radiochemical yield within 80 minutes although this compound revealed low brain penetration it shows promise in rodent tumour models for breast cancer imaging.
