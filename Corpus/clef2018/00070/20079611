Intra-operative electrocorticography in lesional epilepsy. Intra-operative electrocorticography (ECoG) is useful in epilepsy surgery to delineate margins of epileptogenic zone, guide resection and evaluate completeness of resection in surgically remediable intractable epilepsies. The study evaluated 157 cases (2000-2008). The preoperative evaluation also included ictal SPECT (122) and PET in 32 cases. All were lesional cases, 51% (81) of patients had >1 seizure/day and another 1/3rd (51) had >1/week. Pre and post resection ECoG was performed in all cases. A total of 372 recordings were performed in 157 cases. Second post-operative recordings (42) and third post-operative recordings (16) were also performed. Site of recordings included lateral temporal (61), frontal (39), parietal (37), hippocampal (16) and occipital (4). 129/157 cases (82%) showing improvement on ECoG, 30/42 cases showed improvement in 2nd post resection, 8/16 showed improvement in the 3rd post-operative ECoG. 116/157 (73%) patients had good outcome (Engel I and II) at follow up (12-94 months, mean 18.2 months). Of these, 104 patients (80%) showed improvement on post-operative ECoG. 12 had good outcome despite no improvement on ECoG. The improvement in ECoG correlated significantly with clinical improvement [Sensitivity: 100% (95% CI 96-100%)
