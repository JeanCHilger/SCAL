Recurrence after esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma: defining optimal follow-up intervals and testing. To determine the optimal follow-up strategy after esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction by evaluating the timing of recurrence and the method that first detected the recurrence.Between 1991 and 2007, 590 patients had an esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma. Recurrence occurred in 233 (40%) and, of those, 174 had complete follow-up at our center with a protocol that consisted of an office visit with CT scans and laboratory studies every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually. A subset of patients had PET annually.Recurrence in the 174 patients with complete follow-up was systemic in 104 (60%), locoregional/nodal in 51 (30%), and both in 19 (10%). Recurrence was first suspected by symptoms and/or physical examination in 29 patients (17%), by CT scan in 105 (60%), PET in 32 (18%), and by elevated CEA in 8 (5%). Recurrence was detected at a median of 11 months (range 3 to 72 months) and occurred later after esophagectomy alone compared with patients who received neoadjuvant therapy (12 versus 8 months p = 0.01), but the pattern of recurrence was similar. More than 90% of recurrences were detected within 2 years after neoadjuvant therapy, compared with 3 years after esophagectomy alone. Median survival after recurrence was 7 months and was significantly longer in patients treated for the recurrence (9 versus 3 monthsFrequent early follow-up is appropriate after esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma because >90% of recurrences will occur by 3 years after esophagectomy alone and by 2 years following neoadjuvant therapy. Beyond these time periods, 2% to 3% of recurrences were detected each year, suggesting that annual follow-up is adequate. Survival after recurrence was improved with therapy, confirming the use of careful follow-up in these patients.
