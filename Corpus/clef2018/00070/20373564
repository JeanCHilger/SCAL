SPECT combined with CT angiography yield better diagnostic accuracy of pulmonary embolism--secondary publication. The aim of our study was to perform a prospective study that compared the diagnostic ability of V/Q single photon emission computer tomography (V/Q-SPECT), V/Q-SPECT combined with low-dose computed tomography (CT) and pulmonary multidetector computed tomography(MDCT)-angiography in patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism (PE) using a dedicated combined SPECT/MDCT-scanner. V/Q-SPECT in combination with low-dose CT had a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 100%. MDCT angiography had a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 100%. We conclude that V/Q-SPECT in combination with low-dose CT without contrast has an excellent diagnostic performance and should be considered the first-line imaging technique in the work-up of PE in most cases.
