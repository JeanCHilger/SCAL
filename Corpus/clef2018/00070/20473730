Thyroid and pregnancy. Screening for thyroid dysfunction is recommended among certain groups of women, who plan a pregnancy, for example women with history of hyperthyroid or hypothyroid disease, with type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune disorders or women with previous therapeutic head or neck irradiation, in the case of infertility. Management of thyroid disease during pregnancy requires special consideration because pregnancy induces major changes in thyroid function, and maternal thyroid disease can have adverse affects on the pregnancy and the foetus. Under ideal conditions there is a cooperation among several healthcare professionals, such as endocrinologists, nuclear medicine physicians, gynaecologists, neonatologists and if necessary surgeons. This article surveys the physiological and pathological changes of thyroid, their diagnosis and therapy in the case of women in childbearing age, women with unfulfilled desire to have children, pregnant women, as well as women after delivery.
