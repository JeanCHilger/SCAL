Parametric Design Study of a Long Axial Field-of-View PET Scanner using a Block-Detector Tomograph Simulation of a Cylindrical Phantom. We are conducting a two-phase study, which aims to select design parameters of a long-axis positron emission tomography (PET) scanner that are a compromise between detection performance and cost. In this first phase, we examine the effects of axial length, detector thickness and collimator geometry on the noise equivalent count rate per axial length (Î»NEC) and noise equivalent count rate per slice (dNEC). We use these metrics as approximate, but quickly computed, indicators of a PET-scanner's performance at a detection task. From this first phase, we select a subset of scanner designs for which we can conduct a detailed study of tumor detectability and quantitation accuracy in whole-body PET imaging.
