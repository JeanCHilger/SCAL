Basic structural parameters for the design of composite structures as ligament augmentation devices. Composite structures are designed to mimic the morphology and mechanical properties of natural ligaments. Filament winding technology has been implemented in order to obtain a composite material based on a polyurethane matrix (HydroThaneTM ), reinforced with degradable and non-degradable fibers. The mechanical properties of the matrix and fiber have been analysed to define the optimal type, volume ratio and winding angle of the reinforcement. The typical J-shaped stress-strain curve, displayed by natural tendons and ligaments, is reproduced. The mechanical behaviour of HydroThaneTM reinforced with poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fibers were modified by varying the winding angle of the fibers. Fibers comprising poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) and PET, individually and in combination, were considered as candidate materials for the reinforcement of a composite ligament augmentation device (LAD). Mechanical and degradation studies demonstrated that, by combining different types of fiber, at a fixed volume fraction and winding angle (20 degrees ), it is possible to optimize mechanical properties and degradation kinetics of the device.
