Development of an automated modular system for the synthesis of [11C]acetate. Carboxylation reactions offer a straightforward method for the synthesis of carbon-11 labelled carboxylic acids. Among these, the preparation of carbon-11 (C)-acetate is receiving increasing attention because of diagnostic applications in oncology in addition to its well-established use as a probe for myocardial oxidative metabolism. Although a number of dedicated modules are commercially available, the development of the synthesis on flexible platforms would be beneficial to widen the number of tracers, in particular for preclinical assessment and testing.In this study, the carboxylation reaction was implemented for the synthesis of sodium 1-[C]acetate after the classic route of carboxylation of methylmagnesium chloride by [C]carbon dioxide, followed by the acidic hydrolysis, purification and sterile filtration. This was performed using a commercially available kit of preassembled hardware units and fully compatible components of radiochemistry automation (VarioSystem).The system proved be to highly versatile and inexpensive and allowed a quick translation of the radiochemistry project into a working system even by less experienced personnel, because of predefined interfaces between electronic parts and operating software (preloaded on a laptop and included in the kit). The automatic module proved to be a simple and reliable system for the production of 1-[C]acetate that was prepared in 24 min (total synthesis time) with stable radiochemical yields (20% nondecay corrected) and high radiochemical purity (>97%). The module is used routinely to produce 1-[C]acetate for preclinical studies and is being implemented for the production of the labelled fatty acids.
