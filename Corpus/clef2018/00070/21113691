Present and future of FDG-PET/CT in ovarian cancer. Integrated FDG-PET/CT has been used successfully for the diagnosis, staging, restaging, therapy monitoring and prognostic prediction of ovarian cancer as well as various other malignant tumors. Compared with conventional PET/non-contrast CT images, combined PET/contrast-enhanced CT images with intravenous iodine contrast medium and sufficient radiation dose may contribute to a more accurate diagnosis with higher confidence. In the future, tracers other than FDG and integrated PET/MRI will be realized. We herein review the place and role of FDG-PET/CT in the management of ovarian cancer, discussing its usefulness and limitations in the imaging of these patients.
