Electrocardiogram-gated 18F-FDG PET/CT hybrid imaging in patients with unsatisfactory response to cardiac resynchronization therapy: initial clinical results. The present study aimed to distinguish responders to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) from nonresponders, using electrocardiogram-gated 18F-FDG PET/CT.Seven consecutive CRT nonresponders were included in the study, along with 7 age- and sex-matched CRT responders, serving as reference material. Therapy response was defined as clinical improvement (â‰¥1 New York Heart Association class) and evidence of reverse remodeling. Besides PET/CT, we measured brain natriuretic peptide levels and assessed dyssynchrony using transthoracic echocardiography.Compared with nonresponders, CRT responders showed significant differences in the declines of left-ventricular end-systolic volume and brain natriuretic peptide and in left-ventricular dyssynchrony (global left-ventricular entropy), extent of the myocardial scar burden, and biventricular pacemaker leads positioned within viable myocardial regions. Among the nonresponders, further therapy management was guided by the PET/CT results in 4 of 7 patients.Cardiac hybrid imaging using gated 18F-FDG PET/CT enabled the identification of potential reasons for nonresponse to CRT therapy, which can guide subsequent therapy.
