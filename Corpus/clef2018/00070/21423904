Colorectal cancer - patterns of locoregional recurrence and distant metastases as demonstrated by FDG PET / CT. Colorectal cancer (CRC) can recur locoregionally or at distant sites. Timely diagnosis of recurrence is of paramount importance, as radical treatment of the localized disease can prolong survival. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET / CT) is routinely used in restaging and surveillance of colorectal cancer, as it can demonstrate recurrent disease with good accuracy. This article illustrates the spectrum of standard as well as unusual patterns of local recurrence and distant metastases of colorectal cancer.
