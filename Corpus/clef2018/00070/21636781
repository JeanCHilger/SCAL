Abnormal brain protein synthesis in language areas of children with pervasive developmental disorder: a L-[1-11C]-leucine PET study. This study was performed to evaluate the cerebral protein synthesis rate of language brain regions in children with developmental delay with and without pervasive developmental disorder. The authors performed L-[1-(11)C]-leucine positron emission tomography (PET) on 8 developmental delay children with pervasive developmental disorder (mean age, 76.25 months) and 8 developmental delay children without pervasive developmental disorder (mean age, 77.63 months). They found a higher protein synthesis rate in developmental delay children with pervasive developmental disorder in the left posterior middle temporal region (P = .014). There was a significant correlation of the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale autism index score with the protein synthesis rate of the left posterior middle temporal region (r = .496, P = .05). In addition, significant asymmetric protein synthesis (right > left) was observed in developmental delay children without pervasive developmental disorder in the middle frontal and posterior middle temporal regions (P = .03 and P = .04, respectively). In conclusion, abnormal language area protein synthesis in developmentally delayed children may be related to pervasive symptoms.
