Diagnostic imaging in patients with coronary artery disease: the nuclear medicine physicians' view. Actually myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MIP) is best evaluated imaging modality in patients with coronary artery disease. It detects flow-limiting coronary artery disease with high sensitivity and specificity, enables recognition of the grade of severity and extensiveness of myocardial ischemia, and furthermore enables assessment of future cardiac events independently of clinical and diagnostic parameters. Due to rapid technical evolution in diagnostic tools there is need of comparison between MIP and other concurrent imaging modalities such as stress echocardiography, Cardio-CT and Cardio-MRI in patients with coronary artery disease.
