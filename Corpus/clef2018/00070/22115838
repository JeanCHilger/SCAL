Radiosynthesis of [13N]dantrolene, a positron emission tomography probe for breast cancer resistant protein, using no-carrier-added [13N]ammonia. Dantrolene (1) is a substrate for breast cancer resistant protein, which is widely distributed in the blood-brain-barrier, intestine, gall bladder, and liver. PET study with 1 labeled with a positron emitter can be used to visualize BCRP and to elucidate the effect of BCRP on the pharmacokinetics of drugs. The objective of this study was to label 1 using nitrogen-13 ((13)N, a positron emitter half-life: 9.9min). Using no-carrier-added [(13)N]NH(3) as the labeling agent, we synthesized [(13)N]dantrolene ([(13)N]1) for the first time. The reaction of carbomyl chloride 2b with [(13)N]NH(3) gave an unsymmetrical urea [(13)N]3, followed by cyclization of [(13)N]3 to afford [(13)N]1. Due to its instability, 2b was prepared in situ by treating amine 5 with triphosgene in a ratio of 4 to 1 and used for subsequent [(13)N]ammonolysis without purification.
