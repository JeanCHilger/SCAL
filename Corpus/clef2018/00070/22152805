Cloning and expression of human interleukin-32 and studies on its bioactivity. To clone human interleukin-32(hIL-32) gene and express it in E.coli efficiently.The gene of hIL-32 was amplified by RT-PCR from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) which stimulated with Con A for 60 h. The PCR product was inserted into the pMD18-T vector. The hIL-32 cDNA confirmed by sequencing was inserted into expression vector pET-30a(+) and expressed in E.coli BL21(DE3) strain. The hIL-32 protein expression was induced by IPTG and assayed by SDS-PAGE and coomassie blue stain. The recombination protein was identified by Western blot and its biological activity was analyzed.DNA sequencing confirmed that the cloned cDNA was identical to the published sequence of hIL-32 that the nucleotide sequence of this gene was 567 bp. The recombinant plasmid pET30a-hIL32 was transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3) strain for expression. An expected 28 kDa protein of hIL-32  was found mainly in the induced host strains by SDS-PAGE and coomassie blue stain. The 28 kDa protein was recognized by anti-IL-32 antibody in western blot. The purified recombination protein could induce the producing of IL-6 in the human PBMC.We have successfully cloned the gene and expressed the protein of hIL-32 and the expressed protein has specific bioactivity.
