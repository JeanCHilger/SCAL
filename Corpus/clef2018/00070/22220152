False-Positive Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy on 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography after Rectal Cancer Resection: A Case Report of Thoracoscopic Surgery in the Prone Position. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography and computed tomography (integrated FDG PET/CT) has been used to diagnose recurrence and differentiate postoperative changes from lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer, although its accuracy is questionable. We report a prone thoracoscopic surgery for a rectal cancer patient in which false-positive mediastinal lymph nodes were found on FDG-PET/CT. A 60-year-old man underwent a laparoscopic high anterior resection and D3 lymph node dissection for rectal cancer. The histopathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the rectum, stage IIIB (pT3N1M0), necessitating oral fluoropyrimidine agent S-1. After the primary surgery, a solitary mediastinal lymph node measuring 30 mm in diameter was detected, and abnormal accumulation was confirmed by FDG-PET/CT (SUV(max), 11.7). Thoracoscopic resection was performed in the prone position, but histopathological results showed no metastasis. He was subsequently diagnosed with reactive lymphadenitis. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 4 in good condition and is alive without recurrence 12 months after surgery. PET/CT is useful for the detection of colorectal cancer recurrence however, it does have a high false-positive rate for mediastinal lymph nodes. There is a limit to its diagnostic accuracy, and one must determine the indication for surgical treatment carefully. Surgery in the prone position is a useful and minimally invasive approach to the mediastinum and allows aggressive resection to be performed.
