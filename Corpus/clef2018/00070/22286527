Can PET-CT imaging and radiokinetic analyses provide useful clinical information on atypical femoral shaft fracture in osteoporotic patients? Atypical femoral shaft fractures are associated with the extended usage of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates as therapy for osteoporosis. For such fractures, the positron emission tomography (PET) procedure, coupled with computerized tomography (CT), provides a potential imaging modality for defining aspects of the pathogenesis, site specificity, and possible prodromal abnormalities prior to fracture. PET-CT may assess the radiokinetic variables K1 (a putative marker for skeletal blood flow) and Ki (a putative marker for skeletal bone formation), and when combined with PET imaging modalities and CT skeletal site localization, may define the site of such radiokinetic findings. Further studies into the clinical usage of PET-CT in patients with atypical femoral shaft fractures are warranted.
