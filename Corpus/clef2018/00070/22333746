Interim fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET predicts response and progression-free survival in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and HIV infection. Interim PET scans in HIV-negative patients with Hodgkin lymphoma has emerged as one of the most important prognostic tools. However, equivalent studies in HIV-positive patients are yet to be performed.We evaluated the prognostic value of interim [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET (18F-FDG PET) after two or three cycles of chemotherapy using adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD) with concomitant HAART in HIV-positive patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.Patients with advanced HIV-Hodgkin lymphoma (HIV-HL) from six UK centres were included. Interim PET scans after two or three cycles of ABVD (PET-2 or PET-3) were carried out. Prognostic analysis correlated the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate with the interim PET result.Twenty-three evaluable patients were assessed, 21 achieved a negative interim PET and 22 achieved complete remission by computerized tomography scan criteria after ABVD therapy. After a median follow-up of 27 months (range 12-50), disease progression was seen in one patient. Treatment failure was seen in one of the two interim PET-positive patients and none of the interim PET-negative patients. The 2-year PFS for interim PET-positive patients was 50%, and 100% for interim PET-negative patients (P = 0.0012).A negative interim 18F-FDG PET result is highly predictive of treatment success in HIV-HL patients.
