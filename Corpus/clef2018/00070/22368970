Brain FDG-PET changes in ALS and ALS-FTD. FDG-PET in ALS most typically demonstrates a primary (and sometimes also supplementary) motor cortex hypometabolism, often associated with more diffuse cortical hypometabolism involving mostly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the medial and lateral premotor cortices, and the bilateral insular cortex involvement. In ALS-FTD, extensive temporal hypometabolism is seen in addition to severe diffuse frontal hypometabolism.This study analyses FDG-PET findings in 6 ALS patients and 4 ALS-FTD patients.In addition to earlier described areas of hypometabolism in ALS, we found also reduced FDG-PET metabolism in the medial frontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the anterior temporal lobe in our ALS patients. The anterolateral area was the best preserved part of the frontal lobe in ALS patients. In ALS-FTD, frontal and temporal hypometabolism was severe (and parietal hypometabolism was often also present) with relatively preserved perirolandic metabolism.In ALS, more diffuse frontal and temporal FDG-PET hypometabolism was seen than earlier reported, with the anterolateral area as the best preserved part of the frontal lobe. In ALS-FTD, relatively preserved perirolandic metabolism was seen, associated with severe frontal and temporal hypometabolism.
