Cerebral circulation and oxygen metabolism associated with subclinical periventricular hyperintensity as shown by magnetic resonance imaging. A combined magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography study was performed on 21 patients with cerebrovascular risk factors but without neurological abnormalities. Our purpose was to investigate the hypothesis that periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) reflects ischemia. Periventricular hyperintensity was evaluated with a method we devised, and cerebral circulation and oxygen metabolism were evaluated with the oxygen-15 steady-state technique. We concluded that the brain with severe periventricular hyperintensity had abnormal circulation, although oxygen metabolism was not measurably affected. The role of a compensation mechanism under conditions of decreased oxygen supply was considered.
