Choline PET/CT in the diagnosis of primary and recurrent prostate cancer. Are there evidence-based indications?. Overdiagnosis and resulting overtreatment in prostate cancer are under intensive discussion both in the urologic communities and in the public media. Sensitive and specific diagnostic modalities could be one step forward to overcome this problem. Choline PET/CT provides fusion imaging that combines anatomical/morphological information with metabolic/functional data. Despite promising preclinical data and interesting initial clinical results, this cost-intensive and logistically demanding technology has not yet found its way into routine clinical practice the German and European guideline recommendations are careful and reluctant. This review has the goal to give an overview of the recent data both on initial diagnosis and on staging/diagnosis for biochemical recurrence by choline PET/CT and to summarize the possible role of this innovative technology in the future, if adequate research projects can be realized.
