Rare metastatic prostatic malignancy: A case report and approach to management. We present a patient with metastatic leiomyosarcoma of the prostate who achieved complete response with chemotherapy. A 70 years old male patient presented with urinary tract symptoms and a prostatic mass. After having been treated as carcinoma prostate, he presented with progressive pelvic mass, lung and bone metastases to our hospital. Repeat biopsy was suggestive of prostatic leiomyosarcoma. He was treated with chemotherapy with the ifosfamide-epirubicin regimen and achieved complete remission on positron emission tomography/computerized tomography after three cycles. He was given a total of six cycles of chemotherapy and continues to be disease-free after 8 months. Although adenocarcinomas are the commonest prostatic malignancies in the elderly, a careful evaluation is essential to rule out alternative diagnoses. Our case report illustrates the potential role of combination chemotherapy in the management of advanced leiomyosarcoma of the prostate. The literature on this entity is reviewed.
