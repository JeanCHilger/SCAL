Positron emission tomography study of the effects of tryptophan depletion on brain serotonin(2) receptors in subjects recently remitted from major depression. Decreased brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) levels are considered to mediate depressive relapse induced by the tryptophan depletion paradigm. However, in patients who recently achieved remission from a major depressive episode with antidepressant treatment, only about half become depressed following tryptophan depletion. We hypothesized that downregulation of brain serotonin(2) receptors might be a compensatory mechanism that prevents some patients from becoming depressed with tryptophan depletion.To assess, with use of positron emission tomography, whether brain serotonin(2) receptor downregulation occurs in patients with recently remitted depression who do not have depressive relapse, but not in those who become depressed, following tryptophan depletion.Each patient underwent 2 fluorine 18-labeled- setoperone positron emission tomography scans, one following a tryptophan depletion session and another following a control session. The order of scanning was counterbalanced.Academic university hospital with imaging facilities.Seventeen patients in recent remission from a DSM-IV major depressive episode following treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.Changes in brain serotonin(2) receptor binding.Of the 17 patients, 8 (47%) became depressed during the tryptophan depletion session, and none developed depression during the control session. The depletion session was associated with a significant reduction in brain serotonin(2) receptor binding compared with the control session for all participants. A subgroup analysis revealed that the reduction in serotonin(2) receptor binding was significant only for the nondepressed group.Reduction in brain serotonin(2) receptors might be a potential compensatory mechanism to prevent tryptophan depletion-induced depressive relapse.
