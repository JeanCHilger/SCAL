Patient preferences in screening for recurrent disease after potentially curative esophagectomy. Routine imaging (RI) as part of follow-up after potentially curative esophagectomy is currently not widely accepted. If detected recurrent disease could be adequately treated, it remains unclear whether patients would want to take part in a screening program. The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which patients who underwent esophagectomy prefer follow-up with or without RI.Patients who underwent esophagectomy for carcinoma without evidence of recurrent disease were included. An interview-administered questionnaire was used to assess fear of recurrence and elicit patient preferences for the frequency and duration of follow-up and hypothetical changes of survival chances (1-10%).45/54 eligible patients (83%) participated in this study. The majority of patients preferred follow-up with RI (67%) even if screening would not provide a survival benefit this proportion increased up to 93% if the proposed chances of survival improved. Younger patients and patients with a lower histopathological tumor stage were more likely to desire follow-up with RI.Most patients who underwent esophagectomy preferred RI as part of follow-up over outpatient clinic visits only, even if such screening would not provide a survival benefit. Further research is needed to determine the most accurate screening modality and most efficient follow-up interval.
