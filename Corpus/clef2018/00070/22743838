New frontiers of MRI in Crohn's disease: motility imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion MRI, MR spectroscopy, molecular imaging, and hybrid imaging (PET/MRI). This article reviews the latest diagnostic advances in the evaluation of the CD, including functional studies on intestinal motility and molecular characterization of the inflammatory process at the level of the involved bowel. Molecular changes related to inflammation of the intestinal wall may be evaluated by different MRI techniques, including diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion weighted imaging, in vivo spectroscopy, molecular imaging, and fusion imaging (PET-MRI).
