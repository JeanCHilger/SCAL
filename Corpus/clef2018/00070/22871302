Biodistribution and metabolism of 11C-labeled Kendine 91 in mice and rats. The biodistribution pattern of [(11)C]Kendine 91 (a novel HDAC inhibitor) after IV administration has been evaluated using Positron Emission Tomography (rats) and gamma counting of dissected tissues (rats and mice) at different doses (1 Î¼g/kg and 10.0 mg/kg). Metabolism in mice plasma has been also investigated by radio-HPLC. Obtained results (fast accumulation in lungs, heart, kidneys and liver lower uptake in pancreas and muscle) are in concordance with previously reported results using HPLC/MS-MS. Plasma analysis studies showed a fast metabolism of the radiotracer.
