Augmented myocardial perfusion reserve after coronary angioplasty quantified by positron emission tomography with H2(15)O. Effects of coronary angioplasty on myocardial flow reserve have been difficult to characterize noninvasively because conventional imaging techniques cannot quantitate blood flow in absolute terms. The effects of coronary angioplasty on myocardial perfusion and perfusion reserve were delineated with positron emission tomography and oxygen-15-labeled water (H2(15)O) in 13 patients before and after single vessel angioplasty. In 11 patients, angioplasty was successful (minimal cross-sectional area increased from 0.60 +/- 0.59 to 3.45 +/- 1.09 mm2, p less than 0.001). In these patients, regional H2(15)O radioactivity (the ratio of nutritional perfusion in regions distal to the stenosis compared with regions supplied by angiographically normal arteries) at rest before angioplasty was 55 +/- 22% of peak myocardial radioactivity and did not increase significantly afterward (70 +/- 16%, p = NS). However, after administration of intravenous dipyridamole, hyperemic perfusion in regions distal to a stenosis averaged only 39 +/- 18% of peak myocardial counts before angioplasty, but increased to 66 +/- 22% after angioplasty (p less than 0.02). Perfusion reserve in the two patients in whom angioplasty was angiographically unsuccessful showed no change. Quantitative estimates of perfusion in absolute rather than relative terms were obtained with positron emission tomographic data from seven of the patients with successful angioplasty. At rest, perfusion in regions distal to a stenosis was not different from the values in regions supplied by normal coronary arteries (1.54 +/- 0.54 compared with 1.46 +/- 0.38 ml/g per min, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
