Synthesis and in vivo characterization of D-(+)-(N1-[11C]methyl)-2-Br-LSD: a radioligand for positron emission tomographic studies of serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. D-(+)-N1-Methyl-2-Br-LSD (MBL), which displays high affinity and selectivity for serotonin receptors in vitro, has been labeled with carbon-11 for localization of cerebral serotonin 5-HT2 receptors by positron emission tomography. [11C]MBL was prepared from [11C]iodomethane and D-(+)-2-Br-LSD within 20 min from end of bombardment. The average specific activity of [11C]MBL was 2300 mCi/mumol and the average radiochemical yield was 17%, both at end of synthesis. The in vivo regional distribution of radioactivity in brain after i.v. administration of [11C]MBL to mice paralleled the known density of serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. The maximum specific binding, defined by a frontal cortex to cerebellum radioactivity concentration ratio of 5.4 to 1, was reached 30 min postinjection. Administration of ketanserin, a potent serotonin 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, markedly blocked radioligand binding in all brain regions examined except cerebellum.
