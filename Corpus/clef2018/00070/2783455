Imaging of brain tumors with L-3-[123I]iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine and SPECT. Carbon-11-labeled amino acids have been successfully used to image brain tumors by PET. This study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of L-3-[123I]-iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine (123IMT) for metabolic imaging of brain tumors. Ten patients (glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma, lymphoma, and metastases) had early and delayed brain SPECT with a rotating gamma camera after i.v.-injection of 200-300 MBq 123IMT. In nine patients the tumors showed intense uptake of the radiotracer. Tumor-to-brain tissue ratios were between 1.4 and 2.6. 123IMT shows potentials for monitoring the effects of brain tumor therapy.
