An altered ratio of 18:2 (9,11) to 18:2 (9,12) linoleic acid in plasma phospholipids as a possible predictor of pre-eclampsia. As a part of a larger study, 15 healthy primigravidas were studied from 28 weeks gestation until 3 days after deliver. In 6 of these women pre-eclampsia (PET) developed the remaining 9 subjects, who were age matched had normal pregnancies. Plasma phospholipid-esterified 18:2(9,11):18:2(9,12)fatty acids were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The ratio of 18:2(9,11):18:2(9,12)linoleic acid was significantly higher in the PET group than in the normotensive group at 28 weeks' gestation--that is before the onset of symptoms and signs of PET. The ratio remained significantly higher in the PET group than in the normotensive group until deliver, except at 30 weeks when the difference between the ratios just failed to reach statistical significance. It is suggested that measurement of the ratio of 18:2(9,11) to 18:2(9,12)linoleic acid in plasma phospholipids may be useful as a predictor of the likely development of PET.
