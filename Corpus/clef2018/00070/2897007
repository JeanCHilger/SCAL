Diagnosis of acute herpes simplex encephalitis by brain perfusion single photon emission computed tomography. Brain perfusion was studied in 14 patients with acute encephalitis by use of 123I-iodoamphetamine or 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), the first examination being made 4-11 days after onset of encephalitis symptoms. All 6 patients with herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSVE) had strongly increased accumulation of radiotracer in the affected temporal lobe in the remaining 8 results were normal. At the time of the first SPECT conventional CT images were normal in all patients. The SPECT abnormality in HSVE gradually converted over 4-10 weeks from increased tracer accumulation to greatly subnormal accumulation. Brain perfusion SPECT may be helpful in the early diagnosis of HSVE.
