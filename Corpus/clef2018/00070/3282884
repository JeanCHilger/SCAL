Cardiac nuclear medicine tomographic systems. There are two competitive measuring techniques in emission tomography: SPECT and PET. The superiority of PET is founded not only on using physiological radionuclides and tracers such as carbon 11, oxygen 15, and nitrogen 13, but also on achieving a physical performance far in excess of that of SPECT. Considering the demands of cardiac studies, the performance of both methods is analyzed and compared and the inherent limitations are stated.
