MIBG-treatment in neuroblastoma experiences of the TÃ¼bingen/Frankfurt group. 27 children with neuroblastoma were treated with 131I-Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MBIG). They were either refractory to conventional therapy or experienced relapse after initially successful treatment. 7 children revealed stage IV and 20 stage III at the beginning of MIBG-treatment. MIBG was administered by infusion lasting from 30 min to 30 hrs. In most children the dose was split into two portions each infused over a period of 4 hrs with a 24 hrs interval between. Courses were repeated up to 6 times and maximum activity given to one patient cumulatively was 38,221 MBq. 24 patients were evaluable for analysis of results. In 4 children (16.7%) a CR was observed, in 10 (41.7%) a PR, in 5 (20.8%) a disease stabilization and 5 were nonresponders. The 4 CR-patients were initially stage IV. 3 of them were treated in addition by bone marrow transplantation (bmt), one by further chemotherapy. 3 died of a relapse, 1 of complications from bmt. 5 of the 10 PR-patients died of tumor progression, 3 achieved a CR by additional chemotherapy, 1 a PR by bmt and 1 stays in PR without further measures. 2 of the 5 children with a disease stabilization were the first treated patients to whom a fairly low dose was given. In 3 of the 5 nonresponders no uptake of MIBG was observed they died from tumor progression. 1 of the 2 nonresponders with uptake died of graft-versus-host disease after bmt, 1 other also of tumor progression. Duration of remission was between 1 and 12 months and depended upon uptake and dose of MIBG, interval between administrations and individual tumor behaviour. Side effects were seen as marked bone marrow depression
