Surgery for epilepsy: a review. This year marks the centennial of the first surgical resection for epilepsy performed by Horsley. While epilepsy is generally considered a disease best treated with anticonvulsant medications, surgical therapy is of significant benefit to some patients in whom medical therapy has proved ineffective. Anterior temporal lobectomy has been the single most successful operation commonly performed today. In this paper we review current techniques of preoperative evaluation, the role of scalp and intracranial electrophysiologic monitoring, as well as the contribution of PET and MRI scanning to improving the selection of patients for surgical therapy. The role of focal cortical excisions, hemispherectomy, and corpus callosotomy in the surgical armamentarium is also outlined. A plea is made for establishment of additional regionalized centers for epilepsy surgery in which close collaboration among neurologists, neuropsychologists, neurosurgeons and neurophysiologists can enhance patient care and advance our knowledge of the partial epilepsies and human cerebral function.
