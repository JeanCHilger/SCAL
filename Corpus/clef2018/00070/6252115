Feline leukemia in Israel: prevalence of antibody to feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen in stray cats. Feline lymphoma was recorded for the first time in pet cats in Israel. Furthermore, a serological survey in urban stray cats was carried out to determine the prevalence of antibody to feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA). A total of 91 cats was tested and only 5 has antibody to FOCMA. Of these 5 positive cats, 4 originated from an area where a feline leukemia virus-positive cat had been detected prior to the survey. The prevalence of stray cats with antibody to FOCMA is lower in Israel than found in similar studies in the USA and Scotland.
