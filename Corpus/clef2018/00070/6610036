Improved performance from modifications to the multidetector SPECT brain scanner. A multidetector single photon emission computerized tomographic brain scanner was modified to improve the angular sampling. The detector plate was rotated such that 12, 24, or 36 angular projections could be acquired. Phantom experiments demonstrated that the angular aliasing artifacts seen in images obtained with 12 detectors were eliminated with 36 effective detectors. In addition, the reconstructed image noise in a uniform source was decreased by a factor of 1.7 by the use of 36 instead of 12 angular projections, as predicted by computer simulation.
