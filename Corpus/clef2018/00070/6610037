Two algorithms for use with an orthogonal-view coded-aperture system. ohe goal of single photon emission computerized tomography is to map out a three-dimensional distribution of a radionuclide that is concentrated in a structure of interest. There are a number of imaging modalities that achieve this goal with varying degrees of success. In this study, computer simulation is used to explore a novel imaging modality, orthogonal-view coded-aperture imaging. Furthermore, a comparison is made between two reconstruction algorithms, one being an iterative back-projection algorithm and the other a Monte Carlo algorithm. Finally, evidence is presented suggesting that a deficiency in the projection data due to multiplexing is less disturbing than that due to limited angular range.
