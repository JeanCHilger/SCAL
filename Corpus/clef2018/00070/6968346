Method for optimizing side shielding in positron-emission tomographs and for comparing detector materials. This report presents analytical formulas for the image-forming and background event rates seen by circular positron-emission tomographs with parallel side shielding. These formulas include deadtime losses, detector efficiency, coincidence resolving time, amount of activity, patient port diameter, shielding gap, and shielding depth. A figure of merit, defined in terms of these quantitites, describes the signal-to-noise ratio in the reconstructed image of a 20-cm cylinder of water with uniformly dispersed activity. For 1-cm-wide nal (TI) detectors, a 50-cm patient port, an activity of 200 microCi per axial centimeter, and a shielding gap of 2 cm, the optimum shielding depth is 20 cm, which requires a detector circle diameter of 90 cm. For a 25-cm patient port and other conditions as above, the optimum shielding depth is 14 cm. Results are presented for the scintillators Nal(TI), bismuth germanate (BGO), CsF, and plastic and for Ge(Li) and wire chambers with converters. In these examples, BGO provided the best signal-to-noise activity levels below 1000 microCi per cm, and CsF had the advantage for higher activity levels.
