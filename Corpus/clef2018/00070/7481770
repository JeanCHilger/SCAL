Superior parietal cortex activation during spatial attention shifts and visual feature conjunction. Positron emission tomography was used to measure changes in the regional cerebral blood flow of normal people while they searched visual displays for targets defined by color, by motion, or by a conjunction of color and motion. A region in the superior parietal cortex was activated only during the conjunction task, at a location that had previously been shown to be engaged by successive shifts of spatial attention. Correspondingly, the time needed to detect a conjunction target increased with the number of items in the display, which is consistent with the use of a mechanism that successively analyzes each item in the visual field.
