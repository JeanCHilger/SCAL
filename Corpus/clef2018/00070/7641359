Myocardial blood flow response to pacing tachycardia and to dipyridamole infusion in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy without overt heart failure. A quantitative assessment by positron emission tomography. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) impairment has been documented in advanced dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in which hemodynamic factors, secondary to severe ventricular dysfunction, may limit myocardial perfusion. To assess whether MBF impairment in DCM may also be present independent of hemodynamic factors, the present study was designed to quantify myocardial perfusion in patients with mild disease without overt heart failure.Absolute regional MBF (milliliters per minute per gram) was measured by positron emission tomography and 13N-ammonia in resting conditions, during pacing-induced tachycardia, and after dipyridamole infusion (0.56 mg/kg over 4 minutes) in 22 DCM patients and in 13 healthy subjects. Patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I-II and showed depressed left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction by radionuclide angiography (35 +/- 8% range, 21% to 48%), normal coronary angiography, and normal or moderately increased LV end-diastolic pressure (9.2 +/- 5.5 mm HgIn patients with DCM without overt heart failure, myocardial perfusion is impaired both at rest and in response to vasodilating stimuli. The abnormalities in vasodilating capability can be present despite normal hemodynamics progression of the disease is associated with more depressed myocardial perfusion.
