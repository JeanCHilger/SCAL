Children with intractable focal epilepsy: ictal and interictal 99TcM HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography. Fourteen children with intractable complex partial seizures underwent ictal and interictal 99TcM HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans. Abnormalities concordant with clinical and/or EEG localisation were present in 13 of 14 ictal and/or interictal scans. Focal hyperperfusion was seen at the seizure focus on ictal scans and focal hypoperfusion was seen on interictal scans. The timing of the injection in relation to the start of the seizure was crucial for reliable localisation. While recognisable patterns of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were seen on either interictal or ictal scans, marked changes in the patterns of rCBF between the ictal study and interictal study provided the most reliable information about seizure localisation. Using both ictal and interictal studies, 99TcM HMPAO SPECT may provide data about both the seizure origin and its relationship to structurally abnormal regions of the brain.
