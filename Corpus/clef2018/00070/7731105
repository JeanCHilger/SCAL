Relative hypoparathyroidism associated with CAPD treatment using normo-calcemic (3.5mEq/1) dialysate: an approach from transperitoneal calcium balance. We investigated factors affecting net transperitoneal calcium balance (Ca-BL) and the level of parathyroid hormone in relation to stepwise changes in serum calcium, by short PET (peritoneal equibrium test during 240 min: using 2000 ml of 2.5% dextrose dialysate containing 1.75 mmol/L Ca) in uremic patients undergoing stable CAPD. We calculated Ca-BL (mg/effluent/PET) of 244 effluents obtained from 90 patients receiving calcium carbonate as a phosphate binder without vitamin D supplementation. Their serum calcium level corrected with albumin (cSCa), alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and intact-PTH level was 9.7 +/- 0.9 mg/dl, 236 +/- 83 mIU/ml and 153.0 +/- 172.4 pg/ml, respectively. We proposed two statistic significant regression lines between Ca-BL and total drainage effluent volume (Ca-BL = 133X - 0.056: r = 0.981, P < 0.001), cSCa (Ca-BL = -12.9X + 123.6: r = 0.941, P < 0.01). Total drainage volume (TDV) and cSCa were two major factors affecting Ca-BL. A TDV level of 2430 ml/240 min-PET or more was required for positive Ca-BL in cases with 9.5-10.0 mg/dl of cSCa, using this linear regression analysis. A cSCa level of 9.6 mg/dl or more was also required for positive Ca-BL in cases with 2400-2600 ml/240min-PET. We also proposed a significant linear regression line between the intact-PTH level and cSCa (i-PTH = -90.5X + 1015.8, r = 0.973, P < 0.01). This line suggest that 200 pg/ml of intact PTH was obtained by 9.0 mg/dl or less of cSCa level in 90 CAPD uremic patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
