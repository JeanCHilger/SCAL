Scintigraphy of the vascular supply of the liver in the differential diagnosis of hemangioma, in malignant processes and cystic formations in the liver. The aim of the research is to establish and confirm the diagnoses of patients with suspected haemangioma of the liver with completed ultrasonography. A group of 92 patients were checked by scintigraphy after the equilibration of marked eritrocytes in the circulation. After the marking dose of 99mTc-Sn-PYP in a dose of 555 MBq scintigraphy and static scintigram of the liver (early and late, after 3 hours) were done. During the clinical studies the classic scintigraphy of the liver by 99mTc-S-coloid was done in all the patients. After the study it was concluded that there was a partial gathering of the radioisotopes in early scintigrams which was more evident in the late ones especially in the areas which represented focal-cold zones in the classic scintigrams.
