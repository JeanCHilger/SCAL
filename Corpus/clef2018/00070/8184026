Current status of the clinical applications of cardiac positron emission tomography. At the present time, positron emission tomography (PET) has evolved into an accurate clinical diagnostic imaging procedure for coronary artery disease that provides unique information, presently unavailable from other imaging modalities, for the management of patients with previous myocardial infarction. The superior accuracy of PET for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease has had a positive influence on the management decision process to perform revascularization. In addition to the superior accuracy of PET compared with single photon emission computed tomography, PET has the advantage of being able to identify viable hibernating myocardium.
