A rotating PET scanner using BGO block detectors: design, performance and applications. Recent advances in fully three-dimensional reconstruction for multi-ring PET scanners have led us to explore the potential of a prototype scanner based on the rotation of two opposing arrays of BGO block detectors. The prototype contains only one-third of the number of detectors in the equivalent full ring scanner, resulting in reduced cost. With a lower energy threshold at 250 keV, the absolute efficiency of the scanner is 0.5% and the scatter fraction is 35% for a 20-cm cylinder. Transaxial and axial spatial resolution is about 6 mm. The maximum noise equivalent count rate estimated for a 15-cm diameter cylinder is 36,000 cps at a concentration of 26 kBq/ml. The minimum scan time for a 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) brain study is 55 sec. The camera has been validated for clinical applications using both FDG and 82Rb.
