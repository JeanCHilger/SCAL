Multidetector single-photon emission tomography: are two (or three or four) heads really better than one? Today, almost every camera sold, with the exception of mobile systems, is "single-photon emission tomography-capable". The atest technical development is the so-called multidetector systems. This article reviews the development and current and potential clinical role of these multidetector systems, with particular emphasis on multicamera systems. The utility of multidetector systems is considered in the context of an image's signal-to-noise ratio, including its effect on diagnostic or quantitative accuracy. The potential for multidetector systems to increase the signal-to-noise ratio is discussed, as are other potential benefits. Finally, advice on an approach to equipment selection is provided.
