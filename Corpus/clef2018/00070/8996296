Assessment of myocardial viability in chronic coronary artery disease using technetium-99m sestamibi SPECT. Correlation with histologic and positron emission tomographic studies and functional follow-up. The value of 99mTc-sestamibi (2-methoxy-isobutyl isonitrile [MIBI]) as a viability tracer was investigated in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.Initial studies claim that rest MIBI single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) studies can be used to assess myocardial viability.Thirty patients with a severely stenosed left anterior descending coronary artery and wall motion abnormalities were prospectively included. The patients underwent a MIBI rest study, a positron emission tomographic (PET) flow (13NH3) and metabolism (18F-deoxyglucose) study and nuclear angiography before undergoing bypass surgery. A preoperative transmural biopsy specimen was taken from the left ventricular anterior wall. Morphometry was performed to assess percent fibrosis. After 3 months, radionuclide angiography was repeated.Statistically significant higher MIBI values were found in the group with myocardial viability as assessed by PET than in the group with PET-assessed nonviability (p < 0.01). Significantly higher MIBI values were found in the group with enhanced contractility at 3 months (76 +/- 13% vs. 53 +/- 22%, p < 0.01). A linear relation was found between MIBI uptake and percent fibrosis in the biopsy specimen (r = 0.78, p < 0.00001). When maximizing the threshold for assessment of viability with MIBI by using functional improvement as the reference standard, a cutoff value of 50% was found, with positive and negative predictive values of 82% and 78%, respectively.99mTc MIBI uptake was significantly higher in PET-assessed viable areas and in regions with enhanced contractility at 3 months. A linear relation was found between percent fibrosis and MIBI uptake. An optimal threshold of 50% was found for prediction of functional recovery.
