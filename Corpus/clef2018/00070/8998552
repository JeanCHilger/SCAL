Analysis of L-[methyl-11C]methionine and metabolites in human plasma by an automated solid-phase extraction and a high-performance liquid chromatographic procedure. A fully automated method for separation of L-[methyl-11C]Methionine from metabolites in patient plasma was developed. L-[methyl-11C]Methionine was isolated from plasma by solid-phase extraction (SPE). The radioactivity retained on the SPE column was eluted and injected onto the HPLC system for separation of in vivo formed L-[methyl-11C]methionine radiolabeled metabolites. The yield through the isolation procedure and HPLC analysis was greater than 95% with a precision better than 5% (R.S.D.). The calculated rate of L-[methyl-11C]methionine transport into tumor tissue was markedly different with and without compensation for radiolabeled metabolites in patient plasma.
