A technique utilizing positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance/computed tomography image fusion to aid in surgical navigation and tumor volume determination. Brain tumors are histologically heterogeneous. A technique for three-dimensional fusing of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance images (MRI) with positron emission tomography (PET) images is described. This allows the anatomic detail provided by CT or MRI scans to be combined with the information about metabolic activity provided by PET scans. The fused images allowed selection of the most metabolically active portions of tumors. Fusion of CT and MRI images with PET scans has allowed first-pass diagnostic yield by providing the surgeon with a map of anatomical as well as functional (metabolic) detail. We describe a technique to allow routine fusion of MRI, CT, and PET information to help guide the neurosurgeon.
