AVERAGE: a Windows program for automated analysis of event related cerebral blood flow. Functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD) is used to measure changes in brain perfusion during different states of brain activity by evaluating flow velocities within the major brain arteries. We developed a computer program called AVERAGE which can be used with various TCD devices and allows for subtle quantitative off-line analysis of Doppler flow signals. AVERAGE supports data transformation, heart beat analysis, noise reduction, trigger signal and marker modification, artifact analysis and artifact rejection, as well as data reduction. Perfusion differences and their time course within two different arteries can be analyzed by parametric and non parametric statistical methods. This is important, for instance, in studies on hemispherical dominance during mental task processing. Each data processing step is supported by graphical output. If investigated bilaterally with interhemispheric analysis even minimal activations can reliably be detected and quantified with a sensitivity known from positron emission tomography approaches.
