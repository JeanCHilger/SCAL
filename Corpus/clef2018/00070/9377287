Chronic schizophrenia: validity of the study of regional cerebral blood flow through cerebral SPECT. To check the validity of the diagnostic test in schizophrenia.The cerebral blood flow (CBF) characteristics were assessed by means of single photon emission tomography (SPECT) in 24 patients with schizophrenia and 20 normal control subjects. Analysis of sensitivity, specificity and the Youden rate was made of certain RCBF patterns chosen in terms of the cerebral regions between which the greatest differences were observed according to the diagnosis, schizophrenia vs control.Schizophrenia vs control: sensitivity = 58.33% specificity = 95%Cerebral SPECT is valid in the discrimination between patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and control subjects, taking the diagnostic judgement of the psychiatrist as the gold standard, and the RCBF pattern that displays the best coefficient is hypoperfusion, in one or several of the regions: right frontal/left frontal/right parietal/thalamus: sensitivity = 58.33% specificity = 95%
