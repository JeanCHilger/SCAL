Execution times of five reconstruction algorithms in 3D positron emission tomography. Various analytical, iterative and rebinning algorithms have been proposed for 3D reconstruction in positron emission tomography. This paper examines execution times of five analytical and rebinning algorithms. Meaningful comparisons are obtained by using similar software modules in all implementations. Reconstruction times are shown to differ by vast amounts: the Favor algorithm of Defrise et al is more than twice as fast as the widely used reprojection algorithm of Kinahan and Rogers the Fourier rebinning algorithm (Fore) recently developed by Defrise is more than 15 times faster than the reprojection algorithm.
