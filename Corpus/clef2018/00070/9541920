11C-tyrosine position emission tomography and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the response of brain gliomas to radiotherapy. We monitored 10 patients with unresected (9) or partially resected (1) supratentorial gliomas with 11C-tyrosine position emission tomography (TYR-PET) before and after radiotherapy. TYR-PET tumour volumes were measured using a threshold technique. In seven patients the tumour volume decreased after radiotherapy, although all gliomas persisted on TYR-PET images. In eight patients the tumour protein synthesis rate (PSR) was calculated using a dynamic study protocol in combination with a PATLAK analysis. There were no changes in PSR after radiotherapy, but the PSR was calculated on the remaining tumour volume using the same threshold technique as before therapy, i.e. the decrease in tumour volume was not taken into account. In eight patients the PET data were compared with magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) performed simultaneously. Although there was no statistically significant correlation between TYR-PET volume changes and 1H-MRSI choline level we observed a simultaneous decrease in volume and choline in four patients.
