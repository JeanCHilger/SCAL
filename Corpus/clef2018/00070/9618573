Prediction of post-revascularization functional recovery of asynergic myocardium using quantitative thallium-201 rest-redistribution tomography: has the reverse redistribution pattern an independent significance? The significance of reverse redistribution on rest-redistribution thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy is unclear. Previous studies suggested that reverse redistribution segments with normal resting activity include viable myocardium, whilst resting defects with further worsening correspond to scar. We evaluated whether reverse redistribution has an independent significance for the prediction of post-revascularization recovery, particularly as compared with the quantification of redistribution activity. We studied 26 coronary artery disease patients with left ventricular dysfunction, who underwent 201Tl rest-redistribution single-photon emission tomography (SPET) and echocardiography before revascularization. Viability was defined by the detection of wall motion improvement on follow-up echocardiography. 201Tl activity was considered normal if >/=80%, moderately reduced if <80% but >/=50%, and severely decreased if <50%. Reverse redistribution was defined as a defect in redistribution images with >/=10% decrease in relative 201Tl activity compared with the resting value. Reverse redistribution was detected in 33 segments (10%). Baseline dysfunction was equally observed in the reverse redistribution and in the non-reverse redistribution segments (64% vs 56%, P=0.40) and the rate of asynergic segments with post-revascularization recovery was not different between the two groups (33% vs 54%, P=0.11). The rate of functional recovery in redistribution defects without reverse redistribution was 53% in moderate and 30% in severe defects the corresponding values for the reverse redistribution segments were 50% and 27% (all non-significant versus non-reverse redistribution segments). For the prediction of post-revascularization recovery in asynergic segments, the detection of reverse redistribution on rest-redistribution 201Tl SPET does not add any information to the quantitative analysis of redistribution activity.
