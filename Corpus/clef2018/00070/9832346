D2-dopamine receptor occupancy measured by IBZM-SPECT in relation to extrapyramidal side effects. The purpose of this study was to compare striatal D2 dopamine receptor occupancy of various typical neuroleptics and clozapine in relation to the occurrence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Forty-four inpatients with schizophrenia, including 12 patients with schizodominant schizoaffective disorder, were evaluated using 123I-iodobenzamide (IBZM) and single photon emission computed tomography. Striatal D2 dopamine receptor occupancy was estimated by use of a striatal/frontal cortex ratio (ST/FC) of IBZM binding. Fourteen patients were neuroleptic-free and served as controls. Six patients were treated with clozapine and 24 patients were treated with various typical neuroleptics. ST/FC ratios in patients taking typical neuroleptics were significantly lower than those who were neuroleptic free or treated with clozapine. Patients with EPS had lower ST/FC ratios than those without EPS. A significant linear relationship between ST/FC ratios and severity of EPS estimated by the Simpson-Angus-Scale was established (r=-0.51, p=0.041).
