Evaluation of compartmental and spectral analysis models of [18F]FDG kinetics for heart and brain studies with PET. Various models have been proposed to quantitate from [18F]-Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) data glucose regional metabolic rate. We evaluate here four models, a three-rate constants (3K) model, a four-rate constants (4K) model, an heterogeneous model (TH) and a spectral analysis (SA) model. The data base consists of [18F]FDG dynamic data obtained in the myocardium and brain gray and white matter. All models were identified by nonlinear weighted least squares with weights chosen optimally. We show that: 1) 3K and 4K models are indistinguishable in terms of parsimony criteria and choice should be made on parameter precision and physiological plausibility in the gray matter a more complex model than the 3K one is resolvable
