Assessment of global and regional LV function obtained by quantitative gated SPECT using 99mTc-tetrofosmin: comparison with left ventricular cineangiography and echocardiography. The quantitative gated SPECT (QGS) software that has automatic edge detection algorithm of the left ventricle, is able to calculate LV volumes and visualize LV wall motion with perfusion throughout the cardiac cycle. We evaluated the reliability of global and regional LV function derived from QGS using 99mTc-tetrofosmin by comparing with left ventricular cineangiography (LVG) and echocardiography (ECHO). In 22 cardiac patients, end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV) and ejection fraction (LVEF) were calculated. Using cinematic display, regional LV wall motion were scored on a 3-point scale (1 = normal, 2 = hypokinesis, 3 = akinesis WMS). EDV, ESV and LVEF correlated well with those by LVG (p < 0.001 for each). Correlation between WMS derived from QGS and ECHO was high (r = 0.85, p < 0.001). There was an inverse correlation between WMS and LVEF (r = 0.77, p < 0.001). In conclusion, QGS is useful to evaluate global LV function. Regional wall motion evaluated by QGS is good enough for clinical application.
