Evaluation of the safety and clinical feasibility of exercise 99mTc-MIBI SPECT using one day protocol--multicenter phase III clinical trial report. We evaluated the safety and clinical usefulness of the same day protocol of exercise 99mTc-MIBI SPECT in 107 patients with heart diseases. No adverse event was observed except for one case of transient hypotension caused by the exercise. More than 95% of stress images and all of the rest images were judged as "Excellent" or "Good" in image quality. Overall sensitivity was 84.3% in detecting coronary artery disease, and no statistical difference was observed between the results obtained with Re-Ex and Ex-Re protocols. The examination was "Quite Effective" or "Effective" in diagnostic efficacy in 96.2% of the cases. We concluded that the same day protocol is a safe and useful method for diagnosing myocardial ischemia, which provides high image quality and valuable information.
