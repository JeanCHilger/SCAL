Long-term effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on chronic heart failure. Examination by 123I-MIBG imaging. To examine the long-term effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on chronic heart failure, 10 patients (7 men and 3 women, mean age: 62 +/- 11 years) with chronic stable heart failure, classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class 2-3 for more than 3 months, and a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45% were treated with 2.5-5.0 mg of enalapril once a day for 3-15 months (mean 7 months). The causes of heart failure were old myocardial infarction (n = 7), hypertension (n = 2), and atrial fibrillation (n = 1). Radioiodinated metaiodobenzyl guanidine (123I-MIBG) imaging, radionuclide angiography, and treadmill exercise test were performed before and after the treatment. With enalapril treatment, (1) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) increased significantly from 38.3 +/- 6.9% to 47.5 +/- 14.7% (2) sub-maximal exercise time increased significantly from 205 +/- 112 to 272 +/- 120 seconds
