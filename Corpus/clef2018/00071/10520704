Preoperative assessment of residual hepatic functional reserve using 99mTc-DTPA-galactosyl-human serum albumin dynamic SPECT. Preoperative assessment of residual hepatic functional reserve offers important strategic information for hepatic resection. To predict the postoperative residual liver function, we assessed the value of hepatic 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-galactosyl-human serum albumin (99mTc-GSA) clearance estimated by dynamic SPECT analysis.We investigated 114 consecutive patients with liver disease, including 55 hepatectomy cases. One minute after injection of 185 MBq 99mTc-GSA, 15 serial dynamic SPECT images were obtained every minute. The initial five sets of SPECT images were analyzed by Patlak plot to estimate the sequential initial hepatic 99mTc-GSA clearance (mL/min) as an index of hepatic function. The sum of hepatic 99mTc-GSA clearance of the segments immune from resection was categorized as predicted residual 99mTC-GSA clearance. In the hepatectomy cases, scintigraphy was performed before and 37 +/- 10 d after the operation.Good correlation was observed between the total hepatic 99mTc-GSA clearance and conventional hepatic function tests: plasma retention rate of iodocyanine green (ICG) at 15 min (ICG R15), r = -0.600, P < 0.0001, n = 94 plasma disappearance rate of ICG (K ICG), r = 0.670, P < 0.0001, n = 83The total hepatic 99mTC-GSA clearance reflected hepatic function. In addition, preoperative predicted residual hepatic 99mTc-GSA clearance was a good indicator of postoperative hepatic function and early prognosis. 99mTc-GSA dynamic SPECT is assumed to be a useful method for determining the surgical strategy in patients with hepatic tumor and especially in patients with hepatic dysfunction.
