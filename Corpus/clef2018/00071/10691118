Contralateral EEG slowing and amobarbital distribution in Wada test: an intracarotid SPECT study. To relate the occurrence of contralateral electroencephalogram slowing (CES) to amobarbital distribution, we performed electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and intracarotid single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) during an intracarotid amobarbital procedure (IAP).IAP was performed on 22 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. CES was defined as the occurrence of significant EEG slowing on the contralateral hemisphere (>50% of the ipsilateral hemisphere slowing) after amobarbital injection. To map the distribution of the amobarbital, we injected a mixture of amobarbital and (99m)technetium-ethylcysteinate dimer (99mTc-ECD) into the internal carotid artery and performed a brain SPECT 2 h later. In the SPECT images, regions of interest were determined by ipsilateral and contralateral anterior cerebral artery territories (iACA, cACA), ipsilateral and contralateral middle cerebral artery territories (iMCA, cMCA), and ipsilateral and contralateral posterior cerebral artery territories (iPCA, cPCA), as well as ipsilateral and contralateral anterior and posterior mesial temporal regions (iAMT, cAMT, iPMT, cPMT). The perfusion of amobarbital was interpreted visually in each region.Amobarbital was distributed in the iMCA in all the patients in the iACA in 20 (90.9%) patientsAmobarbital rarely perfused the iPCA territory and the iPMT region and was rarely delivered to the contralateral hemisphere. The occurrence of CES was not related to the cross-perfusion of amobarbital. CES appears to be produced by a transient functional disconnection from the ipsilateral hemisphere.
