The suitability of [11C]-alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan as a tracer for serotonin synthesis: studies with dual administration of [11C] and [14C] labeled tracer. The tracer [11C]-alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan (alphaMTP) has been used to measure brain serotonin synthesis rates with positron emission tomography (PET). To address questions about the accuracy of the kinetic model, [14C]alphaMTP was used to directly measure conversion to [14C]-alpha-methyl-serotonin (alphaM5HT) in monkeys that had been previously studied with PET and [11C]alphaMTP. Four male, fasted, isoflurane-anesthetized rhesus monkeys were studied with [11C]alphaMTP and PET. Immediately after the initial 3-hour scan, a second dose of [11C]alphaMTP was coinjected with 1 mCi of [14C]alphaMTP, and additional PET data were collected. Approximately 90 minutes after the second alphaMTP administration, the animals were killed with an overdose of phenobarbital, and brain samples from 21 regions were taken and analyzed by HPLC. Minimal conversion of alphaMTP to alphaM5HT occurred HPLC analysis of 14C radioactivity showed that greater than 96% of the total counts were in fractions corresponding to the alphaMTP peak. Brain concentrations of serotonin, tryptophan, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, and alphaMTP also were determined fluorometrically using external quantification. Patlak plots generated from PET images acquired over 3 hours showed no time period of linear increase, and final slopes were not significantly different from zero, consistent with the finding of minimal conversion to [14C]alphaM5HT. These data indicate that in the 3-hour period after injection, [11C]alphaMTP is acting predominantly as a tracer of tryptophan uptake, not serotonin synthesis.
