A versatile, low-cost method for presenting visual stimuli during MRI. A visual presentation system is described that is inexpensive, easily implemented, and adaptable to most laboratory and clinical settings. Performance evaluations demonstrated a field of view of 26 x 56 degrees, no radiofrequency interference, and high image quality. Although the system was designed for brain activation studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it can also be used for positron emission tomography activation studies and for presenting relaxation videos during clinical MRI.
