Acute effects of thalamotomy and pallidotomy on regional cerebral metabolism, evaluated by PET. The subacute effect of thalamotomy and pallidotomy on regional cerebral metabolism was studied by means of Positron Emission Tomography (PET). In this way we aimed to identify the pattern of functional deafferentiation following a specific lesion in the basal ganglia. The cerebral distribution of 2-[18F]fluoro 2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake at 1-2 weeks after operation was compared with the uptake before operation. Analysis of the changes was done by statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Thalamotomy resulted in a reduction of FDG uptake in predominantly the lateral prefrontal- and the parietal cortex, whereas pallidotomy affected only uptake in the (pre)frontal cortex. The absence of change in the primary sensory-motor cortex after either surgical procedure may suggest that, in man, the motor portions of the thalamus exert a predominantly indirect influence on the human motor cortex.
