Nigrostriatal dopamine system and motor lateralization. The mechanism by which most people favor use of the right hand remains unknown. It has been proposed that asymmetries in the nigrostriatal dopamine system may be related to motor lateralization in humans. We explored this hypothesis in vivo by using [18F]fluorodopa positron emission tomography. Whereas the degree of right hand preference was found to correlate with left putamen dominance as assessed by asymmetry in fluorodopa uptake (K(i)), right caudate dominance was positively correlated with the level of performance during simultaneous bimanual movements in right-handed normal subjects. In addition, right-handed patients with Parkinson's disease with higher right than left caudate K(i) performed much better in bimanual movement tests than those in whom the K(i) value of the left caudate was higher than that of the right. These findings support the notion that the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system may play a role in motor lateralization, and suggest a functional model for bimanual movements. We propose that the skill for performing simultaneous bilateral hand movements in right-handed subjects might depend upon both the activation (through the dominant left putamen circuitry) of the left supplementary motor area (SMA), and the inhibition (through the right caudate circuitry) of motor programs stored in the right SMA.
