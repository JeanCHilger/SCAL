The impact of FDG positron emission tomography imaging on the management of lymphomas. The role of 2-(F-18)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging in the management of patients with lymphoma has been evaluated. 29 patients (12 Hodgkin's disease, 17 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)) who underwent FDG-PET imaging during their lymphoma treatment programme were reviewed retrospectively. Correlation between FDG-PET and CT was evaluated, together with the impact upon clinical management of the findings on FDG-PET imaging. FDG-PET added extra information to the findings on clinical examination and CT in 12 patients (41%). This was seen both in patients with negative and positive CT scan. Two false positive FDG-PET scans were seen, reflecting FDG uptake in extranodal sites. Information from FDG-PET imaging resulted in a change in clinical management in 10 patients (34%) in two, initial management was altered, and in eight consolidation therapy after completion of initial chemotherapy was influenced. These changes in clinical management occurred in six patients with high grade NHL, two with low grade NHL and two with Hodgkin's disease. No specific subgroup was identified in whom FDG-PET was particularly discriminant.
