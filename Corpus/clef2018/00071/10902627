Modulation of fluorouracil tissue pharmacokinetics by eniluracil: in-vivo imaging of drug action. Fluorouracil is widely used for chemotherapy of gastrointestinal cancer, but response rates are poor. Eniluracil is being developed as an inactivator of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, the enzyme that brings about first-pass degradation of fluorouracil. We studied the mechanism of action of eniluracil by measuring with positron emission tomography (PET) the effect of eniluracil on tumour and normal-tissue pharmacokinetics of fluorine-18-labelled fluorouracil.Six patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers were studied. PET scanning was done after injection of oxygen-15-labelled water to assess tissue blood flow, followed by 1 mg/m2 18F-fluorouracil. We compared the pharmacokinetics of 18F-fluorouracil when the patients had not received eniluracil, during a 4-day course of oral eniluracil, and during a 28-day course of oral fluorouracil plus eniluracil.In eniluracil-naÃ¯ve patients, 18F-fluorouracil localised more strongly (mean 0.0234% [SE 0.0019] of injected activity per mL tissue at 11 min) in liver than in tumours (0.0032% [0.0004]). There was substantial inhibition, after eniluracil administration, of radiotracer uptake and retention in normal liver (mean area under the time versus radioactivity curve 0.927 [SE 0.086] vs 1.857 [0.169] m2 mL(-1) s) and kidneys (1.096 [0.048] vs 5.043 [0.915] m2 mL(-1) s). There was also an increase in plasma uracil and unmetabolised 18F-fluorouracil and an increase in the radiotracer half-life in tumours (2.3 h to >4.0 h).Two events strongly suggested increased exposure of 18F-fluorouracil and its anabolites in the tumours, consistent with the inactivation of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase: a selective decrease in radiotracer exposure in normal liver and kidneys compared with tumours and an increase in radiotracer half-life in tumours.
