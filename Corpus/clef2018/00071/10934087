Influence of chemoreceptor stimuli on genioglossal response to negative pressure in humans. Genioglossal muscle (GG) activity is modulated by both chemoreceptive and mechanoreceptive reflexes that help stabilize airway patency. We assessed the effects of blood gas changes, within the range encountered during mild obstructive apnea-arousal cycles, on GG activity and the GG reflex to upper airway negative pressure. Eighteen healthy adults were studied while awake under 5 conditions: (1) baseline (PET(CO(2)) = 40 mm Hg, Sa(O(2)) = 99%) (2) hypercapnia (PET(CO(2)) = 45 mm Hg)
