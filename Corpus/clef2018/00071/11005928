Construction and structural modeling of a single-chain Fv-asparaginase fusion protein resistant to proteolysis. In this study, we construct a fusion protein composed of L-asparaginase (ASNase from Escherichia coli AS 1.357) and a protective single-chain Fv (scFv), which was selected from a phage-display scFv library from our previous studies. The antibody moiety of the fusion protein was fused to the N-terminus of the enzyme moiety via a linker peptide, (Gly(4)Ser)(6). Recombinant plasmid pET-SLA was constructed to express scFv-ASNase fusion to high levels in E. coli and the expressed product was found to form inclusion bodies. We obtained a soluble fusion protein by refolding and purification. The soluble fusion protein exhibited about 82% of the enzymatic activity of the native ASNase at the same molar concentration, and had a K(m) value similar to that of the native enzyme for the substrate L-asparagine. Importantly, the fusion protein was more stable than native ASNase. In addition: (1) following treatment with trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, and rennet, at 37 degrees C for 30 min, scFv-ASNase fusion retained 94.0%, 88.8%, and 84.5% of its original activity, respectively, whereas native ASNase became inactive
