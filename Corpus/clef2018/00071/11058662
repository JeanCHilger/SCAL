Left ventricular function: correlation of quantitative gated SPECT and MR imaging over a wide range of values. In 21 patients, the authors compared results with quantitative gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to results with magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), end-systolic volume (LVESV), and ejection fraction (LVEF). Between the two methods, correlations were good for LVEF (r = 0.85), LVEDV (r = 0.94), and LVESV (r = 0.95). Quantitative gated SPECT can help determine LVEF, LVEDV, and LVESV.
