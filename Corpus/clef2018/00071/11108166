Relationship between regional severity of emphysema and coronary heart disease. We analyzed the relationship between regional severity of emphysema, which was evaluated by three-dimensional fractal analysis (3D-FA) of Technegas SPECT images, and coronary heart disease (CHD). For 22 patients with emphysema who underwent Technegas SPECT, we followed up CHD events. The follow-up period was 5.4+/-0.5 (mean +/- SD) years. We defined the upper-lung fractal dimension (U-FD) and lower-lung fractal dimension (L-FD) obtained with 3D-FA of Technegas SPECT images as the regional severity of emphysema. FD became greater with the progression of emphysematous change. During the follow-up period, CHD events occurred in 6 (27%) of the 22 patients. The ratio of U-FD to L-FD for patients with CHD events (0.87+/-0.22) was significantly smaller than for patients without CHD events (1.52+/-0.38) (p = 0.0015). These findings suggest that severer emphysema in the lower lung indicates a higher risk of CHD than that in the upper lung.
