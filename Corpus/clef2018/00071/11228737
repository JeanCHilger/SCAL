Physical examination and preventive care of rabbits. As rabbits gain increasing popularity as house pets, more rabbit owners are seeking basic preventive veterinary care. Although a knowledge of the unique anatomic and physiologic characteristics of pet rabbits is essential, annual examination and review of diet and husbandry are as important as with any other species. Many disease states can be detected or prevented with routine veterinary care. Despite all the advances in diagnostic testing in veterinary medicine, there will never be a substitute for a complete physical examination.
