Myocardial imaging with 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine in essential hypertension and renovascular hypertension. Iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial imaging is considered to reflect cardiac sympathetic function. We performed myocardial MIBG scintigraphy and echocardiography in 27 patients with essential hypertension (EHT), 7 patients with renovascular hypertension (RVHT), and 8 normotensive subjects (NT) to investigate alterations in MIBG myocardial imaging in the presence of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). EHT were divided into two groups based on LV wall thickness EHT with LVH group (> or = 13 mm, n = 15) and EHT without LVH group (< 13 mm, n = 12). The delayed uptake of MIBG was decreased, and the washout rate of MIBG was greater in the EHT with LVH group than EHT without LVH group or NT group. The washout rate was correlated with LV mass and LV diastolic function (as assessed by mitral flow). In RVHT group, the MIBG washout rate increased even without LVH, compared with NT and EHT without LVH groups. In summary, the washout rate of MIBG increased in parallel with the development of LVH in EHT and increased independently of the LV mass in RVHT. Cardiac sympathetic function could be altered in hypertensive LVH and in renovascular hypertension.
