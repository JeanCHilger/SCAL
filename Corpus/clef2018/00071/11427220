Fibrinogen and C-reactive protein on admission as markers of final infarct size after primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction. In acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treated conservatively or with thrombolysis, marked increases of C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen have been observed. No data are however available concerning a possible relation between CRP and fibrinogen levels on admission and markers of infarct size after obtaining thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow III by primary angioplasty.We studied 34 patients with a first AMI (29 men, mean age 54+/-11 years) who were treated with primary angioplasty (TIMI flow III in all patients, no concomitant treatment with glycoprotein IIb-IIIa antagonists) within 6 h of onset of pain. CRP and fibrinogen levels on admission were determined and related to the following markers of infarct size: peak creatine kinase MB (CKMB) levels, radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at discharge and thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) infarct size at 1 month.Median CRP levels were 0.4 mg/dl (range 0.09-3 mg/dl), median fibrinogen levels 412 mg/dl (range 198-679 mg/dl), mean CKMB was 178+/-151 U/l, mean LVEF 52+/-8% and mean thallium-201 infarct size 7+/-6%. Although CRP levels were related to fibrinogen levels on admission (r=0.56, P=0.002), only fibrinogen levels were related to markers of infarct size (r=0.58, P=0.001 for CKMB, r=-0.44, P=0.01 for LVEF and r=0.64, P=0.001 for thallium-201 infarct size). No relation was found between CRP or fibrinogen levels on admission and the extent of coronary artery disease or the myocardial area at risk. In multiple regression analysis, the relation between fibrinogen and markers of infarct size was independent of CRP levels and the duration of pain on admission.These findings indicate a relation between fibrinogen levels on admission and myocardial infarct size in patients treated with primary angioplasty for AMI. This relation seems to be independent of CRP levels and the duration of pain on admission. If confirmed in larger patient populations, fibrinogen levels on admission could have an important value for risk stratification and more aggressive reduction of infarct size in patients who are treated with primary angioplasty.
