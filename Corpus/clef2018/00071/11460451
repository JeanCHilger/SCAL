Computer-assisted surgical planning. 3-D software for the PC. A potent software was developed for virtual planning in orthopedic surgery with complex spatial relationships, that runs on a standard PC with Windows 98/NT/2000. This voxel-based 3D-software creates data from tomographic images (CT, MRI, 3D-Sono, PET) in Dicom-III-format, that are visualized in near real-time as 2D-reconstructions or 3D-images. For three-dimensional analysis interactive tools, geometric rulers and an anatomic coordinate-system are available. Multiplanar osteotomies are carried out with a virtual saw. Selected segments are moved freely to mimic fracture reduction and deformity correction. Three-dimensional movement coordination is supported by problem-oriented movement features and a 3D-mouse. User defined objects in CAD-format like implants or anatomical templates can be inserted and moved. Matching of two volume data sets is possible as well as simultaneous processing of different data sets. All 3D-reconstructions can be calculated as virtual radiographs and viewed stereoscopically with LCD-shutter glasses. Export features in various data formats allow further processing of all volume data in CAD applications and rapid prototyping. An intra-operative navigation system can be integrated via an interface. This universally applicable software allows thorough three-dimensional analysis and processing of volume data sets from tomographic images and can be used in various applications through its flexible modular setup.
