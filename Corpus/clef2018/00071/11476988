Recent advances in carcinoid pathogenesis, diagnosis and management. Carcinoid tumors usually present as diagnostic dilemmas due to obscure or nonspecific symptomatology. Advances in molecular biology are allowing the investigation of molecular markers of aggressiveness, better serum tumor markers, as well as the molecular pathogenesis of carcinoid heart disease. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) and whole body positron emission tomography (PET) are providing much improved sensitivity in localization of both primary and metastatic tumors. Long acting depot somatostatin analogues are combining effectiveness and ease of use for medical management of carcinoid syndrome. An additional benefit may be tumor growth suppression.
