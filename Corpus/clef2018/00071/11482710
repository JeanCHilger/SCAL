Good correlation between gated single photon emission computed myocardial tomography and contrast ventriculography in the assessment of global and regional left ventricular function. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of the measured left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and wall motion analysis by the recently introduced quantitative electrocardiographically (ECG)-gated myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed myocardial tomography technique (gated SPECT) (QGS).We compared technetium-99 m tetrofosmin gated SPECT imaging and contrast ventriculography in the assessment of global and regional left ventricular function in 74 patients with undiagnosed chest pain of whom 27 sustained a previous myocardial infarction.Linear regression analysis demonstrated that gated SPECT determined LVEF correlated well with LVEF determined from contrast ventriculography (y = 0.95x + 1.9, r2 = 0.84, p < 0.0001). Bland-Altman plot analysis showed no systematic difference between the two sets of values derived from the two imaging approaches over a wide range of LVEF values. Exact agreement of segmental wall motion scores was 460 of 518 (89%) segments with a kappa value of 0.76 (p < 0.0001).We conclude that gated SPECT imaging is an accurate and reliable clinical tool to accurately measure global and regional left ventricular function.
