New frontiers in diagnostic imaging in concussive head injury. Concussed athletes may have documented incapacitating postconcussive symptoms, neuropsychological deficits, and consequent important changes in their lives and sport, yet the majority of neuroimaging attempts reveal few findings to account for these signs and symptoms. In this paper, we explore new techniques in the neuroimaging of concussion including diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and functional brain imaging technology.
