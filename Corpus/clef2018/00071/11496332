The role of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in cancer screening - a preliminary report. Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluoro-2 deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is a non-invasive method for surveying the whole body and detecting various malignancy. A total of 299 subjects underwent whole-body FDG PET studies in our PET center over an 18-month period. FDG PET accurately detected malignant tumors in 7 (2.34%) subjects. False positive FDG PET studies in 3 (1%) subjects and false negative FDG PET studies in 2 (0.6%) subjects were found. Because of the high cost of FDG PET examination, it might not be suitable as a cancer screening test for the general population. However, it is a valuable supplemented tool for routine check-up, particularly for those at high-risk of developing cancer.
