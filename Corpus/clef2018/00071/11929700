Positron emission tomography and ex vivo and in vitro autoradiography studies on dopamine D2-like receptor degeneration in the quinolinic acid-lesioned rat striatum: comparison of [11C]raclopride, [11C]nemonapride and [11C]N-methylspiperone. With [11C]raclopride,[11C]nemonapride and [11C]N-methylspiperone, degeneration of dopamine D2-like receptors in the unilaterally quinolinic acid-lesioned rats was evaluated by positron emission tomography (PET) and ex vivo and in vitro autoradiography. PET showed a decreased uptake of [11C]raclopride in the lesioned striatum, but an increased uptake of [11C]nemonapride and [11C]N-methylspiperone despite a decreased binding in vitro. Ex vivo autoradiography showed an increased accumulation of the three ligands in the cortical region overlying the injured striatum, probably enlarging PET signals. PET has the limited potential for evaluating the receptor degeneration in the present animal model.
