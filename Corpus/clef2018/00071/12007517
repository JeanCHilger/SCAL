Central pathways controlling micturition and urinary continence. The central control of micturition and urinary continence in cats and humans is organized in a similar manner. In cats, 4 areas in the brainstem and diencephalon are implicated in the control of micturition: (1) the pontine micturition center or Barrington area directly excites bladder motoneurons in the sacral cord during micturition at the same time, it inhibits indirectly, via inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acidergic and glycinergic interneurons in the medial sacral cord, the external urethral sphincter motoneurons
