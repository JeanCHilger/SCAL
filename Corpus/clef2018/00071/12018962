Pre-surgical evaluation and surgical outcome of 41 patients with non-lesional neocortical epilepsy. Pre-surgical evaluation and the surgical treatment of non-lesional neocortical epilepsy is one of the most challenging areas in epilepsy surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the surgical outcome and the diagnostic role of ictal scalp electroencephalography (EEG), interictal (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and ictal technetium-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single photon emission tomography ( (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT). In 41 non-lesional neocortical epilepsy patients (16 frontal lobe epilepsy, 11 neocortical temporal lobe epilepsy, seven occipital lobe epilepsy, four parietal lobe epilepsy, and three with multifocal onset) who underwent surgical treatment between December 1994 and July 1998, we evaluated the surgical outcome with a follow-up of at least 1 year. The localizing and lateralizing values of ictal scalp EEG, interictal FDG-PET, and ictal SPECT were evaluated in those patients with good surgical outcome. Ictal scalp EEG had the highest diagnostic sensitivity in the localization of epileptogenic foci (69.7% vs. 42.9% for FDG-PET and 33.3% for ictal SPECT P= 0.027). However, no significant difference was found in the lateralization of the epileptogenic hemisphere among the three modalities (78.8% for ictal scalp EEG, 57.2% for FDG-PET, and 55.5% for ictal SPECT
