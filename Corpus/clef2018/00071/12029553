PET imaging with [11C]methyl- L-methionine for therapy monitoring in patients with rectal cancer. In this study we evaluated whether positron emission tomography (PET) using the amino acid [11C]methyl- L-methionine (MET) may be used for therapy monitoring in patients with rectal cancer who are undergoing preoperative chemoradiotherapy. A total of 41 MET-PET scans were performed in 26 patients with locally advanced rectal cancers. All patients were examined prior to chemoradiotherapy. In 15 patients, MET-PET was repeated after preoperative chemoradiotherapy (45 Gy radiation dose, 250 mg 5-fluorouracil as continuous infusion). MET uptake prior to and after the completion of chemoradiotherapy was correlated with changes in T stage and histopathological regression. All tumours were visualised with high contrast and had a significantly higher SUV (5.7+/-2.2) than normal rectum (2.7+/-0.9) and all other organs in the field of view except the small intestine (3.9+/-1.7). In all tumours studied prior to and after chemoradiotherapy, MET uptake decreased during therapy (SUV before therapy, 6.2+/-2.3 SUV after therapy, 2.6+/-1.2
