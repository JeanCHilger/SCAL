SPECT imaging of the stomach: comparison with barostat, and effects of sex, age, body mass index, and fundoplication. Single photon emission computed tomography. Impaired gastric accommodation may lead to dyspeptic symptoms. A non-invasive method using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has been developed to measure gastric volumes.Our aims were: to assess the accuracy of SPECT with three dimensional image analysis to measure balloon volumes in vitro to compare gastric barostat balloon volumes measured post-meal and post-distension with total gastric volumes measured simultaneously with SPECTIn vitro balloon volumes measured by SPECT were highly accurate (R(2)=0.99). When measured simultaneously by gastric barostat and SPECT, postprandial/fasting volume ratios (2.2 (0.12) (mean (SEM)) v 2.3 (0.15), respectively p=0.6) and post-distension volume ratios (1.4 (0.1) v1.3 (0.1)SPECT provides a non-invasive estimate of the effect of a meal on total gastric volume that is comparable to changes in balloon volume observed with the gastric barostat. The SPECT technique is promising for investigation of gastric volumes in health and disease and the effects of pharmacological agents.
