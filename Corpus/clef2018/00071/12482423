18F]FMDAA1106 and [18F]FEDAA1106: two positron-emitter labeled ligands for peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR. We synthesized and evaluated N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[(18)F]fluoromethyl-5-methoxybenzyl)acetamide ([(18)F]-FMDAA1106) and N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl-5-methoxybenzyl)acetamide ([(18)F]FEDAA1106) as two potent radioligands for peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR). [(18)F]FMDAA1106 and [(18)F]FEDAA1106 were respectively synthesized by fluoroalkylation of the desmethyl precursor DAA1123 with [(18)F]FCH(2)I and [(18)F]FCH(2)CH(2)Br. Ex vivo autoradiograms of [(18)F]FMDAA1106 and [(18)F]FEDAA1106 binding sites in the rat brains revealed that a high radioactivity was present in the olfactory bulb, the highest PBR density region in the brain.
