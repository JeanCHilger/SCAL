Low-dose dobutamine stress 99mTc tetrofosmin quantitative gated SPECT performed during the acute phase of myocardial infarction predicts subsequent myocardial viability and detects stunned myocardium. This study evaluated the ability of low-dose dobutamine stress 99mTc tetrofosmin (DSTF) quantitative gated single photon emission computed tomography (QGS) performed during the acute phase of myocardial infarction to predict subsequent myocardial viability and detect stunned myocardium. Twenty-four patients suffering their first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) underwent coronary angioplasty after coronary angiography (CAG) immediately following admission. Follow-up CAG and left ventriculography (LVG) were performed 10 days and 6 months later. All patients underwent DSTF QGS to measure left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at rest and during dobutamine infusion (10 microg.kg(-1).min(-1)) 14 days after angioplasty. No patient suffered coronary restenosis. After 6 months, the LVEF measured by LVG improved >5% in 12 patients (group A), and did not improve in the remaining 12 patients (group B). The culprit coronary artery, the peak serum creatine phosphokinase concentration, the recanalization time, and the LVEF during the acute phase were similar in the two groups. However, the increase in the LVEF was greater in group A than in group B during dobutamine infusion (deltaLVEF) as measured by DSTF QGS (11.2+/-3.8% vs 2.9+/-4.7%, P <0.001). If a cut-off value of 6.5% for the deltaLVEF was used to predict the improvement in LVEF during the chronic phase, then the sensitivity of this test was 83.3% and its specificity was 83.3%. It is concluded that DSTF QGS during AMI can be used to predict myocardial viability and detect stunned myocardium.
