Cardiopulmonary exercise capacity in adult patients with atrial septal defect. The aim of the study was to evaluate cardiopulmonary exercise capacity (WTS) in adult patients with atrial septal defect (ASD). After excluding 10 patients with additional cardiac, pulmonary or muscle diseases, 53 patients with ASD (Gr-ASD mean age 37.8 +/- 14.9 yearsAlthough there was no significant difference in FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, VO2, VE, Vt, RR between ASD patients and controls, the ASD patients aged 40 or older showed significantly lower FEV1/FVC and significantly higher RR. Expiratory gas exchange analysis showed significant differences between the ASD patients and controls (higher VE/VCO2, VE/VO2, PET CO2, and lower PET O2 respectively). Moreover, VO2 peak, VO2%N, AT, PET CO2 and O2 pulse were significantly lower while VE/VCO2 was significantly higher in ASD patients than in normal subjects. On average, VO2%N in ASD patients was only 61% of the predicted value for age and sex. Total time of exercise and time to AT were significantly shorter in ASD patients as well.WTS allows appropriate evaluation of cardiopulmonary capacity in ASD patients, though the mechanisms underlying ventilatory and hemodynamic abnormalities are still not fully understood. Adult patients with ASD reveal ventilatory abnormalities with an age-related trend towards deterioration. Cardiopulmonary exercise capacity in adults with ASD is markedly reduced in comparison with healthy population and deteriorates with age. WTS complements echocardiographic and hemodynamic evaluation of patients with ASD, and is helpful in indicating patients for ASD closure and their follow up.
