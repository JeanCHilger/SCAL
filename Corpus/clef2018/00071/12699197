Survey of parallel slat collimator designs for hybrid PET imaging. Hybrid PET gamma cameras with coincidence detection electronics are commonly equipped with parallel slat collimators in order to reduce detection of singles and scattered photons, and create a pseudo-2D imaging geometry. The objective of this work was to survey a broad range of parallel slat collimator designs using a series of Monte Carlo simulated PET acquisitions. Collimator properties including septal height, septal thickness and pitch were independently examined over a wide range of values. Simulations were performed for hybrid PET imaging of a long cylindrical phantom uniformly filled with water and radioactivity. The performance for each collimator design was evaluated in terms of the trues-to-singles ratio, scatter fraction, and noise equivalent count rate for a wide range of camera trigger rates. Results indicate that increasing septal height offers the biggest performance gain. Septal thickness should be at least 0.5 mm, and should be optimized in conjunction with pitch to obtain the best performance. This survey provides the groundwork necessary for optimizing slat collimators, and provides a starting point for investigating new slat collimator designs.
