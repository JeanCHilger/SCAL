Diagnostic accuracy of 2-[fluorine-18]fluro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography imaging in nonsquamous tumors of the head and neck. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 2-[fluorine-18]fluro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for detecting nonsquamous tumors of the extracranial head and neck (NSTHN).The records of all patients with suspected or proven NSTHN undergoing PET imaging in our institution over a 12-year period were reviewed. Forty-four patients (24 males and 20 females age range, 6-81 yearsThe overall diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET for all NSTHN was 86%, However, the diagnostic accuracy varied for the histologic subtype (thyroid, salivary, miscellaneous) and the area being evaluated (primary site, nodal metastases, distant metastases).There is variable diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET in detecting different histologic subtypes of NSTHN. This information should be taken into consideration when considering PET for evaluation of NSTHN.
