Contribution of single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT-HMPAO) to the study of schizophrenia. The authors studied a group of thirteen schizophrenic patients with functional brain imaging, using single-photon-emission-computed tomography (S.P.E.C.T.). The radiotracer was the H.M.P.A.O. labelled with 99 m Technetium. All were being given neuroleptic drug. Forty-one lesions demonstrated decreased perfusion. These functional abnormalities are mainly located in the left hemisphere and this asymmetry is more pronounced in positive-symptom schizophrenics. However, at rest, these correlations are limited and finally we demonstrated a wide spectrum of metabolic dysfunctions in the same subtype of schizophrenia.
