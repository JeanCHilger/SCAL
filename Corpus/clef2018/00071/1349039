Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy with indium-111-DTPA-D-Phe-1-octreotide in man: metabolism, dosimetry and comparison with iodine-123-Tyr-3-octreotide. Scintigraphy with 123I-Tyr-3-octreotide has several major drawbacks as regards its metabolic behavior, its cumbersome preparation and the short physical half-life of the radionuclide. The use of another radiolabeled analog of somatostatin, 111In-DTPA-D-Phe-1-octreotide, has consequently been proposed. DTPA-D-Phe-1-octreotide can be radiolabeled with 111In in an easy single-step procedure. DTPA-D-Phe-1-octreotide is cleared predominantly via the kidneys. Fecal excretion of radioactivity amounts to only a few percent of the administered radioactivity. For the radiation dose to normal tissues, the most important organs are the kidneys, the spleen, the urinary bladder, the liver and the remainder of the body. The calculated effective dose equivalent is 0.08 mSv/MBq. Optimal 111In-DTPA-D-Phe-1-octreotide scintigraphic imaging of various somatostatin receptor-positive tumors was obtained 24 hr after injection. In the six patients studied, tumor localization with 123I-Tyr-3-octreotide and with 111In-DTPA-D-Phe-1-octreotide were found to be similar. However, the normal pituitary is more frequently visualized with the latter radiopharmaceutical. In conclusion, 111In-DTPA-D-Phe-1-octreotide appears to be a sensitive somatostatin receptor-positive tissue-seeking radiopharmaceutical with some remarkable advantages: easy preparation, general availability, appropriate half-life and absence of major interference in the upper abdominal region, because of its renal clearance. Therefore, 111In-DTPA-D-Phe-1-octreotide may be suitable for use in SPECT of the abdomen, which is important in the localization of small endocrine gastroenteropancreatic tumors.
