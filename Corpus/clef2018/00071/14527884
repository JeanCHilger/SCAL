Effect of titanium surface texture on the cell-biomaterial interface. To improve the in vivo performance of engineered implants, this study examines the independent effects of surface chemistry and topography on fibroblast morphology and density in vitro. Titanium (Ti) was sputter-coated onto smooth and microtextured polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Test specimens were evaluated in 24-h, fibroblast cultures and assessed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for cellular morphology and density. Fibroblast density increased, as the Ti film thickness increased. The fibroblasts exhibited contact guidance on the textured test specimens. The greatest cellular density was found on the Ti-coated, textured test specimens. In conclusion, Ti and surface texture appeared to strongly influence fibroblast density and morphology as compared to PET and smooth surfaces.
