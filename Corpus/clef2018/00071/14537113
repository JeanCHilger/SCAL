Comparison of an 18F labeled derivative of vasoactive intestinal peptide and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose in nude mice bearing breast cancer xenografts. A 18fluorine-labeled derivative of vasoactive intestinal peptide [18F- Arg,Arg VIP(18F-dVIP)] was evaluated as a potential imaging agent for breast cancer by comparison with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) using standard ex vivo determinations and small animal position emission tomography (PET) imaging.Human breast carcinomas, T-47D and MDA-MB231, tumor-bearing nude mice were injected intravenously with 18F-dVIP or FDG for imaging and/or biodistribution (ex vivo) determined by gamma counting.FDG had two- to three-fold greater tumor accumulation and target-to-non target contrast relative to 18F-dVIP. VIP receptors were detected in both tumor types but in low concentrations (<15,000 receptors/cell) consistent with lower uptakes. FDG was cleared rapidly from non-target tissues while 18F-dVIP cleared into the kidneys.18F-dVIP uptake in mice T-47D tumors and kidneys determined by imaging correlated with values determined by ex vivo counting suggesting that tumor and other tissue uptakes can be quantified by in vivo positron projection imaging.
