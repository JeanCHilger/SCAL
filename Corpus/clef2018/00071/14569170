An assessment of wall motion, perfusion and glucose metabolism in recent myocardial infarction: a comparison in patients with and without revascularization. The aim of this study was to compare the extent and severity of wall motion abnormalities, perfusion and glucose metabolism, in recent myocardial infarction in patients with and without revascularization. Forty-nine patients were studied (82% men mean age 58 years) by using echocardiography, 201Tl single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) rest and redistribution, and 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) SPECT at a mean of 9.2 days (range, 1-24 days) after myocardial infarction. Twenty-seven of the 49 patients underwent revascularization while the other 22 received medical therapy before echocardiography and studies using radionuclides. A contrast angiogram was obtained for each patient. A follow-up echocardiogram at 3 months was obtained for 44 patients. Images were read blindly, using a 17 segment model, with semi-quantitative analysis. In the whole group, the extent of hypokinesia was 15%+/-14 (mean+/-SD)
