Usefulness of 99mTc ethyl cysteinate dimer brain SPECT to detect abnormal regional cerebral blood flow in patients with acute carbon monoxide poisoning. 99mTc ethyl cysteinate dimer (99mTc-ECD) brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was used to detect abnormal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Ten patients with acute CO poisoning and no past histories of psychoneurological disorders were enrolled in this study. After oxygen treatment, all of the 10 patients were investigated using 99mTc-ECD brain SPECT and brain computed tomography (CT) scan. Brain CT scan findings were normal in all of the 10 patients. 99mTc-ECD brain SPECT showed the hypoperfusion lesions of the basal ganglia and brain cortex in five and seven patients, respectively. Only three of the 10 patients had normal 99mTc-ECD brain SPECT findings. This study suggests that, in comparison with brain CT scan, 99mTc-ECD brain SPECT is a better tool for the early detection of hypoperfusion brain lesions in acute CO poisoning in patients with normal brain CT findings.
