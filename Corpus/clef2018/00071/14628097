Kinetics of [(11)C]choline uptake in prostate cancer: a PET study. Carbon-11 choline has recently been introduced as a potential tracer for tumour imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). We evaluated the kinetics of the uptake of [(11)C]choline in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. We also evaluated the association between the uptake of [(11)C]choline and the histological grade of malignancy, Gleason score, volume of the prostate and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Fourteen patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer and five patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia were studied with [(11)C]choline PET. A mean dose of 430+/-31 MBq of [(11)C]choline was injected intravenously and a dynamic emission acquisition of prostate was performed for 30 min. The uptake of [(11)C]choline was measured as a standardised uptake value (SUV) and as a kinetic influx constant ( K(i)) obtained from graphical analysis. Both cancerous and hyperplastic prostate were well visualised with [(11)C]choline against low or moderate tracer accumulation in the bladder and rectal wall. The measured radioactivity in urine was invariably low. In the graphical analysis, linear plots were achieved. The mean K(i) of the untreated tumour was 0.205+/-0.089 min(-1) (range 0.128-0.351 n=7) and the mean SUV was 5.6+/-3.2 (range 1.9-15.5
