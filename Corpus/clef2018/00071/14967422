Can post-RT neck dissection be omitted for patients with head-and-neck cancer who have a negative PET scan after definitive radiation therapy? A prospective, single institution study was conducted to evaluate the role of positron emission tomography with fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) before and after definitive radiation therapy for patients with head-and-neck cancer. Correlation with CT or MRI imaging and pathologic findings at the time of planned neck dissection was made.Twelve patients with AJCC Stages III-IV cancer of the head and neck received CT or MRI and PET imaging before treatment with definitive radiation therapy. One month after completion of treatment, repeat CT or MRI and PET imaging was obtained. All images were reviewed independently by radiologists who were blind to the results of the other modality. Patients then underwent planned neck dissection. Pathologic correlation with posttreatment scans allowed calculation of the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and the positive predictive value for both CT/MRI and PET.Comparison of CT/MRI to PET obtained before definitive RT revealed both primary tumor and nodal disease were detected by both modalities in all cases where primary tumor was known. After RT, comparison of CT/MRI imaging to findings of neck dissection revealed a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 50%. Comparison of PET imaging with pathologic findings demonstrated sensitivity of 45%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 14%.In this small series of patients, the presence of a positive PET 1 month after RT accurately indicated the presence of residual disease in all cases however, a negative PET indicated absence of disease in only 14%. Further investigation is warranted before FDG-PET should be used to determine whether post-RT neck dissection should be omitted.
