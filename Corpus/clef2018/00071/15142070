The role of atopy in Maltese patients with chronic rhinitis. The global prevalence of allergic rhinitis has been on the increase and recent clinical experience in Malta has shown a similar trend. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of atopy in 415 patients presenting with rhinitis of at least 3 months duration, and to identify the common allergens responsible. Presenting clinical features, past and family history of seasonal allergic symptoms, exposure to cigarette smoking, pet ownership and occupation were analysed. All patients were skin tested for common allergens. Fifty-five per cent of patients were atopic, the main allergens responsible being house dust mite, cat dander and grass pollen. Rhinorrhoea and sneezing were significantly more common in atopic patients, who were more likely to have a past history and family history of seasonal asthma, eczema or rhinoconjunctivitis. Skin test-negative patients with idiopathic rhinitis were mostly females and tended to present a decade later. Differentiation between atopic and idiopathic chronic rhinitis may be helpful in the clinical setting in order to help predict response to treatment.
