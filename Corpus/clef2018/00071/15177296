High-level expression and single-step purification of leucyl-tRNA synthetase from Aquifex aeolicus. Aquifex aeolicus leucyl-tRNA synthetase is the only known heterodimeric LeuRS, consisting of two subunits with molecular masses of 74.0 and 33.5 kDa, and named alphabeta-LeuRS. The gene encoding alpha subunit was cloned into pSBET-b vector. Synthetic oligonucleotide encoding six histidine residues was also inserted in front of alpha subunit. PSBET-b vector contains argU gene, which encodes a rare Escherichia coli tRNA(Arg)(AGA/AGG). The argU gene helps A. aeolicus LeuRS, which contains AGA/AGG codons in exceptionally high frequency, express well in E. coli. The gene encoding beta subunit was inserted into pET-15b vector. E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) cells were transformed with the two recombinant plasmids to produce alphabeta-LeuRS with a His6 tag at the N-terminus of alpha subunit. The enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA Superflow. About 7 mg purified alphabeta-LeuRS was obtained from 250 ml culture. The His6-tag at the N-terminus did not affect the aminoacylation activity of the enzyme.
