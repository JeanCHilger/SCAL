Biomedical application of commercial polymers and novel polyisobutylene-based thermoplastic elastomers for soft tissue replacement. Novel polyisobutylene-based thermoplastic elastomers are introduced as prospective implant materials for soft tissue replacement and reconstruction. In comparison, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE), polypropylene (PP), polyurethanes (PU), and silicones are outlined from well-established implant history as being relatively inert and biocompatible biomaterials for soft tissue replacement, especially in vascular grafts and breast implants. Some general considerations for the design and development of polymers for soft tissue replacement are reviewed from the viewpoint of material science and engineering, with special attention to synthetic materials used in vascular grafts and breast implants.
