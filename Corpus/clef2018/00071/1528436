A method for quantitative measurement of cerebral vascular permeability using X-ray CT and iodinated contrast medium. Cerebral vascular permeability is an important consideration in treatment for intracranial tumours. We have developed a new method to measure the cerebral vascular permeability quantitatively using a conventional X-ray CT scanner and iodinated contrast medium. We have already applied our method in 50 cases of intracranial tumour and 5 cases, which establish the methodology, are demonstrated. Dynamic CT scanning of a section including the tumour and the superior sagittal sinus was performed over 40 min after bolus injection of contrast medium, and 25 images were acquired. Our theoretical model of contrast enhancement was applied to analyse time-density curves, and the following parameters were obtained: Ki (inward flux constant), Kb (backward flux constant), Vp (vascular plasma volume), and lambda (extracellular fluid space volume). Furthermore, functional maps were generated from parameters for each pixel. Changes in intra-arterial iodine concentration, required in our model, were measured from CT numbers in the superior sagittal sinus. We have investigated several aspects of our method. Histological findings in surgical specimens of intracranial tumours agreed well with the parameters obtained by our method. Vp was verified quantitatively by single photon emission computed tomography. Our method was shown to be reproducible. These results show that the parameters are useful for assessing tumours and in planning chemotherapy. Our method, which employs no special equipment, is readily available at any institution.
