Single-photon emission computed tomography in diagnosis of left ventricular post-infarction aneurysm. To assess value of single-photon emission computed tomography with (99m)Tc-sestamibi ((99m)Tc MIBI SPECT) for detection of post-infarction left ventricular aneurysm in patients with coronary artery disease.Fifty nine patients were operated upon because of coronary heart disease. In 27 patients with post-infarction left ventricular aneurysm modified Dor operation (aneurysmectomy with endoventricular circular patch plasty reconstruction) was performed. In 24 patients with extended cardiosclerosis direct myocardial revascularization was conducted.Comparison of (99m)Tc MIBI SPECT data obtained at rest and during dobutamine stress test revealed some diagnostic features characteristic of patients with left ventricular post-infarction aneurysm. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of viability of myocardium in basal and "borderline" zones influenced not only the volume of revascularization, it was important for preliminary determination of post-infarction left ventricular aneurysm resection level, selection of type of plasty, prognostication of complications in immediate and remote postoperative periods.
