Quantitation and visualization of tumor-specific T cells in the secondary lymphoid organs during and after tumor elimination by PET. Increased understanding in the area of trafficking behavior of adoptively transferred tumor-specific T cells could help develop better therapeutic protocols. We utilized the DUC18/CMS5 tumor model system in conjunction with a microPET scanner to study the DUC18 T cell distribution pattern in spleens and lymph nodes in live mice. Anti-Thy1.2 antibodies conjugated to 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and radiolabeled with (64)Cu were administered to three groups of BALB-Thy1.1 mice on days 4, 7, or 14 post-DUC18 T cell transfer. We were able to detect the transferred cells in all the major lymph nodes, spleens, and in tumors. Our findings suggest that tumor-specific T cells do not all preferentially localize to the tumors but they also home to all the major lymphoid organs additionally the number of DUC18 T cells remains relatively constant during and after tumor elimination within each lymphoid organ.
