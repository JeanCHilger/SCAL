Application of the new zinc-62/copper-62 generator: an effective labeling method for 62Cu-PTSM. A potential PET flow tracer, 62Cu-labeled pyruvaldehyde bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (62Cu-PTSM), was prepared using a new 62Zn/62Cu generator. With this 62Cu-labeling method based on a ligand exchange reaction, 62Cu-PTSM was quantitatively obtained by simple mixing of the generator eluate, 62Cu-glycine and PTSM solution for a few seconds. The glycine contained in the 62Cu-PTSM injectate had no significant effect in mouse biodistribution studies. The PET studies of 62Cu-PTSM showed brain images that were not visualized by 62Cu-labeled albumin (a plasma pool tracer), in the dog cranium.
