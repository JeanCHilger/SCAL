Computer phantom study of brain PET glucose metabolism imaging using a rotating SPECT/PET camera. Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F] fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) provides information about glucose metabolism and is used to measure tissue glucose kinetics in the brain. The recent interest in hybrid SPECT/PET systems emerged as a practical approach to reduce the high cost of purchasing a dedicated ring-detector PET system. We have implemented interpolation methods for processing the projection data that could potentially reduce artifacts when reconstructing a dynamic imaging sequence in a PET study from a dual-head rotating SPECT/PET system. The computer simulations predict that parameter estimates from the dedicated PET system will be superior to results using the rotating camera system. However, the rotating camera system using projection interpolation may approach the accuracy of the dedicated PET system if the data noise is below 20%.
