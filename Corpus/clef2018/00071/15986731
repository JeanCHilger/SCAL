Is there impairment of a specific frontal lobe circuit in head injury? There has been considerable interest in the role of anterior cingulate and lateral frontal cortex in normal cognition, and particularly its role in cognitive control. It has also been suggested that dysfunction of this frontal brain circuit is responsible for many of the cognitive deficits observed after head injury. Several recent PET and SPECT studies of head injury have lent support to this idea, and suggest that the hypothesis is worth further examination. The paper presents a selective overview of evidence that this specific frontal lobe circuit is impaired after head injury.
