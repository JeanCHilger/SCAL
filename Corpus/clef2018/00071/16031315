Streptococcus pneumoniae septicaemia in an Angora goat kid. Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterium frequently associated with pneumonia in man, was isolated from the spleen, liver, lung and kidney of an Angora goat kid which had died suddenly. Signs of septicaemia were pronounced with widespread petechial haemorrhages on internal organs. Histologically, the spleen and liver were severely congested and necrotic changes were most marked in these organs. The goat kid had been reared as a household pet and the possibility that the goat kid had acquired the Str. pneumoniae from a human infection is discussed.
