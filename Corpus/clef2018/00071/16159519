99mTc-HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in both asphyxiated and epileptic children with or without status epilepticus. In this study, technetium 99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed on 18 asphyxiated and epileptic children who also had a status epilepticus episode, and the results were compared with those for 21 children without a status epilepticus episode. All patients underwent a detailed neurologic history, interictal electroencephalography, computed tomography, and/or magnetic resonance imaging. Visual evaluation of the SPECT study showed that 16 patients of group 1 had 56 hypoperfused regions in cerebral blood flow. However, in group 2, visual evaluation showed only six detectable hypoperfusion areas in five patients. When an asymmetric index value of 3 was considered as a cutoff point, 82 regions in group 1 and 57 regions in group 2 were above this value after the quantitative SPECT evaluation. The mean number of pathologic brain regions was found to be higher in group 1 (5.1 +/- 4.3) than in group 2 (2.7 +/- 2.4) (P = .014). The localization of hypoperfused regions that were observed in temporal and frontal regions was generally similar in both groups. In conclusion, the functional activities of the brain vary in both asphyctic and epileptic children, with and without status epilepticus. These children might be candidates for refractory convulsive disease, and interictal SPECT can be a reliable method for the detection of brain lesions in these patients.
