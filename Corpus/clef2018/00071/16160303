Object-oriented implementation for the dual surface minimisation algorithm. The automatic surface extraction from volumetric images is important for the medical image analysis. The delineation task is challenging especially with functional imaging where images are noisy and the content of image depends on the study. We have earlier developed a new dual surface minimisation (DSM) algorithm for the optimisation of deformable surfaces and applied it successfully to fully automatic surface extraction from positron emission tomography images. We present a fast object-oriented implementation for the DSM algorithm with a conventional command line interface. The DSM software is a freely available tool for the Internet community at http://www.cs.uta.fi/research/software/. The implementation of the DSM algorithm provides new opportunities to extend experiments, to develop and to study new applications with noisy volumetric images emerging from medical or other applications.
