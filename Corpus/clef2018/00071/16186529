Natural history of primary progressive aphasia. To characterize the natural history of primary progressive aphasia (PPA).Forty-nine patients (28 women) with newly diagnosed with PPA presenting to a memory disorders clinic between 1992 and 2001 were prospectively evaluated.Median age at onset was 62 years (range 49 to 73 years) and at first visit was 66 years (52 to 80 years). The median duration of follow-up was 4 years (1 to 11 years). Impairments in activities of daily living developed a median of 6 to 7 (2 to 12) years post onset. Seventy-five percent of patients eventually met clinical diagnostic criteria for frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 14% met diagnostic criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies, and 8% developed signs of corticobasal degeneration 60% of the patients died after a median course of 7 years (3 to 17 years) at a median age of 71 years (56 to 81 years). Patients showing high Mini-Mental State Examination scores, moderate aphasia, and fluent language at first visit subsequently retained greater autonomy in daily life.Although activities of daily living are well maintained during the first years of the disease, patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) may lose autonomy 6 to 7 years after onset. The majority of patients with PPA in the current study developed frontotemporal dementia.
