Peritoneal transport status influence on atherosclerosis/inflammation in CAPD patients. Peritoneal transport status is one of the main determinants of dialysis adequacy and dialysis-related complications in end-stage renal disease patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). In this study we aimed to investigate the relationship between peritoneal transport characteristics and known promoters of atherosclerosis in a group of patients receiving CAPD for a minimum of 36 months.We performed a cross-sectional study of a cohort of 84 patients with end-stage renal disease (37 men, 47 women age, 44.0 +/- 15.7 yearsA comparison of follow-up data revealed that the H/HA transport characteristic was associated with lower albumin (P < .01), higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (P < .0001) levels, and higher recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) needs (P < .001) when compared with the L/LA type. During follow-up, 28 patients showed an atherosclerosis-related event. Twenty-two of these were in the H/HA group (43.1%), whereas only six were in the L/LA group (18.1%, P < .01). Reanalysis of 18 patients with atherosclerosis-related events and high CRP levels (> 10 mg/L) showed that 15 were in the H/HA and 3 were in the L/LA group. Sixty-eight percent of the H/HA patients with atherosclerosis and 50% of the L/LA patients with an atherosclerotic event also had chronic inflammation (P < .001). A Pearson correlation analysis showed that there was a positive correlation between D/P creatinine levels and 36-month mean CRP levels (r = 0.608, P < .0001), and a negative correlation between D/P creatinine levels and 36-month mean albumin levels (r = -0.299, P < .005).This study shows that the high transporter peritoneal membrane characteristic is a risk factor for inflammatory state in patients with end-stage renal disease. High-transporter patients are at an increased risk of atherosclerosis when compared with their low-transporter counterparts through chronic inflammation.
