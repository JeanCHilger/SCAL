CT appearance of bone metastases detected with FDG PET as part of the same PET/CT examination. To retrospectively evaluate lesion findings at computed tomography (CT) performed as part of a combined positron emission tomography (PET)/CT examination in patients suspected of having metastatic bone lesions-lesions that were detected with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET as part of the same examination-and to correlate the CT and FDG PET findings.This HIPAA-compliant study had institutional review board approval, and the need for patient informed consent was waived. Three hundred fifty-nine consecutive patients (191 male patients, 168 female patients mean age, 56.9 yearsOne hundred seventy-nine lesions in 55 patients were considered to be probable or definite bone metastases at PET. One hundred thirty-three of these lesions in 33 patients were clinically confirmed to be bone metastases at follow-up and/or histopathologic examination. CT revealed osteolytic changes in 41 (31%) and osteoblastic changes in 21 (16%) of the 133 lesions, but no or nonspecific changes were seen at CT in 49 (37%) and 22 lesions (17%), respectively. Of the 179 lesions suspected at PET, 46 ultimately proved to be nonosseous or false-positive for bone metastasis. Of these 46 lesions, 38 were not located in the bone but in adjacent tissues such as the pleura.CT images obtained as part of PET/CT scanning were useful in yielding the precise location of bone lesions and thus helping avoid misdiagnosis of bone metastasis however, CT revealed morphologic changes in only half of the lesions assigned a grade of 3 or 4 at PET.
