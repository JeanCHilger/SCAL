FDG-PET in 10 children with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: initial experience in staging and follow-up. The use of FDG-PET was evaluated for initial staging and therapy efficacy in paediatric patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and compared to the established conventional imaging modalities (CIM). The results of this retrospective analysis are presented in conjunction with a critical review of the current literature.Ten paediatric patients with NHL were examined using whole-body FDG-PET initially (n = 6), during therapy (n = 5) and after completion of therapy (n = 5), respectively. FDG-PET findings were compared to CIM performed according to the protocol of the German NHL-BFM 95 study. The results were evaluated for their impact on disease classification and therapy decision (St. Jude, REAL) in correspondence to a clinical follow-up of at least 24 months.Concerning initial staging, all lymphoma manifestations detected by conventional imaging were also detected by FDG-PET (15 nodal, 2 extranodal). Furthermore, an additional nodal lesion was detected by FDG-PET in three patients. This resulted in an upstaging followed by an intensified poly-chemotherapy in one patient. In five patients showing unclear residual masses on conventional imaging during therapy, FDG-PET indicated viable residual tumours in one case. This patient showed a relapse during follow-up while the four FDG-PET negative patients did not. After completion of initial therapy, FDG-PET revealed in one out of five patients persistent tumour metabolism in the primary lesions and also detected new manifestations. The patient died shortly after restaging due to disease progression.These first results on the use of FDG-PET in paediatric non-Hodgkin lymphoma indicate a high potential to improve the therapeutic management.
