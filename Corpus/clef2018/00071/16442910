Prognostic utility of single-photon emission computed tomography in adult patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Data derived from stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) carry prognostic significance in young patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but there are limited data on the utility of stress MPI in patients with HCM who are older. This study examined the prognostic significance of stress MPI in an adult population of patients with HCM.We examined 158 patients with HCM (aged 60 +/- 16 years, 61% men) who underwent exercise or pharmacologic stress MPI. Summed stress score (SSS, normal = 56) and summed reversibility scores were calculated for each patient. Follow-up was complete in 157 (99%) patients at a median duration of 5.2 years.Normal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were present in 38% of the population. Summed stress score (P = .01) and summed reversibility score (P = .03) were both significantly associated with cardiovascular death. Survival at 10 years was significantly better in those with normal versus abnormal SPECT (89% vs 67%, P = .04). Ten-year survival also was better in those without versus those with ischemia (90% vs 64%, P = .02). Five-year survival could be stratified by SSS risk categories: low risk (SSS > or = 53), 97% intermediate risk (SSS = 48-52), 94%In an older population of patients with HCM referred for SPECT imaging, abnormal stress MPI identifies those at increased risk of cardiovascular death.
