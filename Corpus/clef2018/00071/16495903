Single photon emission computed tomography in focal liver lesions. Sixteen parameters of liver diseases including echography, liver scintigraphy with radioactive colloids, slices of the SPECT and the 3 dimensions surface display of the SPECT, were examined in 17 patients with liver disease.The findings of imaging examinations were classified with a code of letters and numbers and patients with the same code were given the same number. The measured values were submitted to a multivariate analysis to evaluate which variable were significant to predict focal liver lesions.The slices of SPECT, TGP and bilirubin were the most significant indexes of liver lesions.The validity of SPECT in the study of focal liver lesions is confirmed.
