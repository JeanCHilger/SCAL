Pathogenicity of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, A/chicken/Yamaguchi/7/04 (H5N1) in different species of birds and mammals. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) have been occurring in domestic poultry in Asia since 1996. In the beginning of 2004, HPAI outbreaks were caused by H5N1 virus in two farms and a group of pet chickens in different areas of Japan. In the present study, the pathogenicity of A/chicken/Yamaguchi/7/04 (H5N1), which had been isolated from a dead chicken during the first outbreak in Japan, was assessed in chickens, quails, budgerigars, ducklings, mice, and miniature pigs by experimental infection. The virus was highly pathogenic to all the birds tested. Mice were susceptible to infection with a low mortality rate and miniature pigs were resistant to infection with the virus.
