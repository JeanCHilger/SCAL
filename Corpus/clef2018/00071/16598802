Sensitive and selective photoinduced-electron-transfer-based sensing of alkylating agents. Photoinduced-electron-transfer (PET)-based chemosensing is a very elegant way of reporting the presence of a guest species in solution. This method was successfully applied for the detection of different ionic species, such as cations, anions, and protons. Herein, we report on the application of the PET chemosensing concept for the efficient and selective detection of different alkylating agents. 2-(2-Dimethylaminoethyl)benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3-dione (1) was found to be a highly selective and effective PET chemosensor that turns luminescent upon reacting with different alkylating agents. This PET-based system detected even rather weak alkylating agents, such as dichloromethane. A PET-based sensor that consists of 1 as the active component could detect rather low concentrations of alkylating agents in solution and in the gas phase.
