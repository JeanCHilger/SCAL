Role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in staging and follow-up of lymphoma in pediatric and young adult patients. To assess the role of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT in pediatric patients with Hodgkin disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).31 patients, mean age 12.9 +/- 5.1, HD (n = 24), and NHL (n = 7) underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT at diagnosis (n = 31 studies) and later in the course of the disease (n = 75 studies). The findings of PET/CT were correlated with diagnostic CT and clinical follow-up.PET/CT findings resulted in a change of disease staging in 10 patients (32.3%), upstaging in 7 (22.6%) and downstaging in 3 (9.6%). On a lesion analysis, 164 disease sites were detected by PET/CT of which 38 were overlooked by DCT. At mid-treatment, PET was negative in 28 out of 31 patients (90%) with negative predictive value of 96% as all latter patients except for 1, were disease free (mean 15.4 +/- 8.8 months). The positive predictive value of persistent increased 18F-FDG uptake was 100% as 3 patients with latter findings had active disease. On the CT part, 76 residual masses were identified in 22 patients. Increased 18F-FDG uptake was detected in 11 masses in 4 patients who had active disease. Remaining 65 PET negative masses were false positive findings. The positive predictive value of residual CT mass was 14%.PET/CT is associated with change in staging in approximately 1 out of 3 pediatric patients with HD and NHL. When used for monitoring response to treatment, a negative study is associated with disease-free period, even when residual mass is detected. A positive PET study indicates residual malignant disease.
