Atomoxetine occupies the norepinephrine transporter in a dose-dependent fashion: a PET study in nonhuman primate brain using (S,S)-[18F]FMeNER-D2. Atomoxetine is a potent and selective norepinephrine transporter (NET) reuptake inhibitor acting as a nonstimulant for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies had failed to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring a dose-dependent and saturable NET occupancy in human brain using [11C]MeNER.To determine if atomoxetine occupies NET in a dose-dependent fashion using (S,S)-[18F]FMeNER-D2 in nonhuman primate brain.A total of eight PET measurements were performed in two cynomolgus monkeys. Each monkey was examined four times with PET: under baseline conditions and after steady-state infusion with 0.03, 0.06, or 0.12 mg/kg/h of atomoxetine. A prolonged intravenous (i.v.) infusion design was developed rather than an i.v. bolus to better mimic an oral absorption profile and to reach plasma steady state.During baseline conditions, (S,S)-[18F]FMeNER-D2 uptake was highest in the locus coeruleus, thalamus, mesencephalon, and the cingulate gyrus, whereas the radioactivity in the caudate was low. Peak equilibrium measurements were achieved using (S,S)-[18F]FMeNER-D2 in contrast to the previously reported data for [11C]MeNER. After administration of atomoxetine, a dose-dependent occupancy from 38 to 82% was observed for various brain regions known to contain high densities of NET.This is the first in vivo PET study to successfully demonstrate the ability to measure a dose-dependent change in NET occupancy in brain using (S,S)-[18F]FMeNER-D2. Furthermore, an asymptotic relationship between N-desmethylatomoxetine plasma concentration and NET occupancy was established. In total, these data encourage further PET studies using (S,S)-[18F]FMeNER-D2 in humans.
