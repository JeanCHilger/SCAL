FDG-PET in localization of cancers of unknown primary origin. FDG-PET can be successful in localizing the primary cancer when a metastasis is discovered but no primary tumor can be identified (cancer of unknown primary, or CUP) by physical examination, laboratory testing (for tumor markers, for example) or conventional imaging. The greatest number of PET studies in CUP concern secondary lesions in cervical lymph nodes, and PET is an established clinical use (highest ranking, 1A) according to the 3rd German Consensus Conference and an "option" in the French Standards, Options, and Recommendations. Success rates range from 30% to 50% in most studies using PET a higher rate was reported recently with PET/CT. FDG-PET should be performed sufficiently early in cases of neurological paraneoplastic syndrome, because established lesions become irreversible. Identification of the antibody present helps to specify the organ and FDG-PET can then localize the lesion
