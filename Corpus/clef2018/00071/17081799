Fluorescent sensing of anions with acridinedione based neutral PET chemosensor. Newly synthesised fluorescent chemosensor ADDTU contains the thiourea receptor connected to the acridinedione (ADD) fluorophore via a covalent bond, giving rise to a fluorophore-receptor motif. In this fluorescent chemosensor, the anion recognition takes place at the receptor site which result in the concomitant changes in the photophysical properties of a ADD fluorophore by modulation of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process. The binding ability of these sensor with the anions F(-), Cl(-), Br(-), I(-), HSO(4)(-), ClO(4)(-), AcO(-), H(2)PO(4)(-) and BF(4)(-) (as their tetrabutylammounium salts) in acetonitrile were investigated using UV-vis, steady state and time-resolved emission techniques. ADDTU system allows for the selective fluorescent sensing of AcO(-), H(2)PO(4)(-) and F(-) over other anions in acetonitrile.
