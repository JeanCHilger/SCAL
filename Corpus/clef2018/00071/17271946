Applying 2D ML iterative reconstruction methods with resolution recovery to 3D PET data: evaluation of rebinning effects. The applicability of OSEM reconstruction algorithms with space dependent resolution recovery to clinical FDG-PET studies is verified. The performance of the 2D algorithm is improved by means of a low resolution initialization and by a infra-iteration Metz filtering. Effects of different rebinning algorithms on 3D data are assessed, concluding that they do not alter the transaxial plane blurring parameters, thus permitting a straightforward application of 2D OSEM reconstruction after rebinning, with the same system matrix. Finally axial degradation was also quantified, finding that FORE is the best rebinning method to be combined with the 2D OSEM reconstruction.
