A comparative evaluation of Tl-201 and Tc-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion spect imaging in diabetic patients. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) is an effective tool for early diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in type II diabetes mellitus (DM). The purpose of this study was to review the comparative findings of Tc-99m MIBI and Tl-201 MPS in defining normal and abnormal myocardial segments, type and extent of the perfusion defects with reference to coronary angiography findings in diabetic patients.Thirty patients with type II DM who had abnormal Tc-99m MIBI MPS findings and underwent coronary angiography were included this study (20 male, 10 female mean age was 64 +/- 11 years). Those patients were also investigated with Tl-201 MPS thereafter. All scintigraphic images were evaluated semiquantitatively using a 20-segments myocardial model. The perfusion of myocardial segments, reversibility and severity of defects based on defect score were compared using the MIBI and Tl-201 images in relation to coronary angiography. Diffuse slow-washout of Tl-201 was also noted.A total of 600 myocardial segments were comparatively analyzed. Diagnostic concordance between both tracers in defining normal and abnormal perfusion on a segmental basis was 88% (kappa = 0.71). The percentage of normal, reversible and non-reversible segments in the Tc-99m MIBI and Tl-201 study were 67-61%, 11-20% and 22-19% respectively. While the number of irreversible defects were similar for both tracers, more number of reversible defects were identified by Tl-201 MPS than Tc-99m MIBI (65 vs. 123, p = 0.001). No significant difference between the defect scores of both tracers was found.MPS using both tracers offered agreement in defining or excluding perfusion abnormalities in a major part of the data. However, Tl-201 MPS yielded better detection rate of myocardial ischemia than Tc-99m MIBI MPS in diabetic patients.
