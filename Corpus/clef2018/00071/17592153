Fusion of metabolic function and morphology: sequential [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography studies yield new insights into the natural history of bone metastases in breast cancer. By monitoring bone metastases with sequential [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography ([(18)F]FDG-PET/CT) imaging, this study investigates the clinical relevance of [(18)F]FDG uptake features of bone metastases with various radiographic appearances.Bone metastases were found in 67 of 408 consecutive patients with known/suspected recurrent breast cancer on [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT, characterized by CT morphology changes and/or bony [(18)F]FDG uptake. Twenty-five of the patients had sequential [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT examinations (86 studies) over an average follow-up period of 23 months. The temporal changes in [(18)F]FDG uptake and corresponding CT morphology features of 146 bone lesions identified in these 25 patients were followed up and correlated with therapeutic outcome retrospectively.The 146 lesions were classified as osteolytic (77), osteoblastic (41), mixed-pattern (11), or no change/negative (17) on CT. The majority of the osteolytic (72 93.5%) and mixed-pattern lesions (nine[(18)F]FDG uptake reflects the immediate tumor activity of bone metastases, whereas the radiographic morphology changes vary greatly with time among patients.
