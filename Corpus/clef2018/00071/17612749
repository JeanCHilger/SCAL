CT imaging of myocardial viability: experimental and clinical evidence. Over the last decade, imaging of myocardial viability has become a well-established indication in patients suffering from myocardial infarction. Myocardial viability imaging is routinely performed using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Only recently have several multi-slice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) techniques been evaluated for visualisation of myocardial infarction. This review describes the different concepts of MSCT viability imaging. MSCT assessment of myocardial morphology, myocardial perfusion imaging and delayed myocardial contrast enhancement are introduced, with the latter evolving as the key concept of MSCT viability imaging. Clinical relevance of the different MSCT techniques is described.
