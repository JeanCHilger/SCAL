The impact of endoscopic ultrasonography on the management of suspected pancreatic cancer--a comprehensive longitudinal continuous evaluation. Between 1997 and 2001, a single-center chart review demonstrated significant impact of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in evaluating suspected pancreatic cancer (PCA). Repeating and comparing this review with that from 2001 to 2004 was performed to determine whether increased use of EUS results in more patients being accurately chosen for curative versus palliative procedures, and for surgical versus nonsurgical oncotherapy.The complete systematic review was made up of electronic files from the gastroenterology, oncology, and pathology departments of patients presenting with suspected PCA. Results were compared with those obtained in 1997-2001.From 2001 to 2004, 72 patients had PCA. Seven tumor types were identified. Forty-seven percent (34/72) of patients with suspected PCA were preoperatively staged by EUS 24% (17/72) of all patients underwent surgery. Comparatively, from 1997 to 2001, only 32% (20/62) of patients were evaluated by EUS (P = 0.056) and 45% (28/62) of all patients underwent surgery (P < 0.01). The EUS detected a tumor in 32 of 34 cases. The EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology identified PCA in 14 of 18 cases. F-18-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were not used. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed in 29% (21/72) of patients, with 15 stents inserted.Increased EUS use for diagnosing and staging PCA resulted in fewer patients undergoing futile surgery. The EUS plays a pivotal role in the management of patients with PCA.
