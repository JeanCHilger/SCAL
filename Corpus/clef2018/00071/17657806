Brain metabolic changes following 4-week citalopram infusion: increased 18FDG uptake and gamma-amino butyric acid levels. We used 2-week and 4-week citalopram infusion (10 mg/kg/day) to determine how this selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) would alter 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG) uptake and neurotransmitter tissue levels in male Sprague-Dawley rodents. A weekly time course of 18FDG uptake altered by chronic citalopram treatment was determined in vivo with small animal positron emission tomography (microPET). Additionally, end of study monoamine levels were measured ex vivo using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and amino acid levels were determined ex vivo with proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMRS). We found increased striatal 18FDG uptake, reduced tissue levels of noradrenaline and serotonin in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, and increased striatal gamma-amino-butyric acid following 4-week citalopram infusion.
