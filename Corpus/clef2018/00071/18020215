Scrotal ultrasound: pearls, patterns and pitfalls. We present a review of the scrotal ultrasound findings showing normal anatomic variants that may simulate scrotal pathology (rete testis dilatation, normal testicle and epididymis appendages). US patterns of the scrotal pathology may be classified as: calcified (scrotal and albuginea calcifications, microcalcifications, epididymis calcifications, testicular tumors with calcium), cystic appereance (intratesticular and echogenic varicocele, epididymis cysts, albuginea cysts, haematoma, abscess), solid nodular testicular lesions (infarct, neoplasm) and diffuse lesions (orchitis, lymphoid hyperplasia lymphoma, leukemia). Testicular ultrasound may be helpful in detecting extraescrotal pathologies. There is a known relationship between right varicocele and extratesticular neoplasms. We also show some cases of Burn-out testicular tumor and their MR, CT and PET findings. The knowledge of normal US scrotal anatomy, US patterns of the scrotal lesions and scrotal findings that suggest extratesticular pathologies are crucial in the management of testicular pathology and if unnecessary orchiectomies want to be avoided.
