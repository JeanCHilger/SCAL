Fast point spread function computation from aperture functions in high-resolution positron emission tomography. The problem of extracting point spread functions from detector aperture functions in high-resolution PET is addressed. In the limit of very small size detectors relative to the ring dimensions, assumptions are made that lead to a fast and simple computation model yielding point spread functions with negligible errors due to the reconstruction algorithm. The methods allows one to assess accurately the intrinsic performance of a PET tomograph, and it appears to be adequate to relate the imaging capabilities in every point of the camera reconstruction field to the geometric and physical characteristics of the detection system. The method was developed as an investigation tool to help design the next generation of very-high-resolution PET tomographs.
