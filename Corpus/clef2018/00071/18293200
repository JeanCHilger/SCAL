Host inflammatory response profiling in preeclampsia using an in vitro whole blood stimulation model. The pathophysiology of preeclampsia (PET) implicates an inflammatory dysfunction. This study profiled this host response by challenging whole blood with lipopolysaccharide. Multiplex immunoassays determined interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-17, granulocyte/granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF/GM-SCF), interferon(IFN)-gamma, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels. Secretory capacity was expressed in pg/million white cells or monocytes (+/-SEM). PET featured significantly higher IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-10, IL-13, G-CSF, IFN-gamma, MCP-1 and TNF-alpha monocyte secretory capacities (p < 0.05). The PET group exhibited an inflammatory hyper-responsiveness (p < 0.01) which was poorly described by the traditional Th1:Th2 dichotomy.
