PET/CT for assessing mandibular invasion by intraoral squamous cell carcinomas. Evaluation of mandible invasion in cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx is a major challenge. Today, CT scans are the most frequent imaging technique used, with sensitivity of 53 to 92% and specificity of 83 to 96%. Positron emission tomography is known as one of the most sensitive imaging techniques for head and neck cancer, but has poor anatomical resolution. Our study associates positron emission tomography with CT scans, fusioning both images to maximise data information. Positron emission tomography/CT fusion shows sensitivity of 100% with specificity of 85%. This result encourages the use of positron emission tomography/CT when assessing mandibular invasion.
