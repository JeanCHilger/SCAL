Progress in diagnostics of anorectal disorders. Part II: radiology. Diagnostics and therapy of anorectal disorders remain a surgical question. In close cooperation between different departments (radiology and gastroenterology, urology and gynecology, dermatology and psychology), the role of radiologic imaging is of growing importance. Exact knowledge of functional anatomy and precise clinical examination constitute the basis of the according therapeutic strategies. In this context radiology has contributed decisively. Developments in imaging techniques, e.g. dynamic MRI, highly contributed to better understanding of complex functional pelvic floor disorders. The combination of nanotechnology and high-resolution imaging allows precise staging, especially in rectal cancer. Furthermore, advances in virtual colonoscopy could lead to widely acceptable and patient-friendly screening for colorectal malignancies.
