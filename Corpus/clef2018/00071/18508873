Whole-body PET/CT-mammography for staging breast cancer: initial results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and utility of a dedicated positron emission tomography (PET)/CT protocol in breast cancer patients. 40 patients with suspected recurrent breast cancer underwent whole-body PET/CT in the supine position (SP) followed by PET/CT of the breasts and axillae in the prone position (PP) using a special positioning aid. PP and SP images were compared in terms of the tumour-to-thoracic-wall distance, tumour-to-skin distance and tumour volume, diameter, density, maximal standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) and localization. The size of axillary areas, the number of intra-axillary lymph nodes, their transverse diameters, their SUV(max) and the number of distant metastases were compared between PP and SP images. Differences were tested for significance using the Student's t-test. All patients tolerated PP imaging well. Five locally recurrent breast cancers were detected, both in the SP and in the PP. Mean tumour-to-thoracic-wall distances (PP, 19 mm SP, 8 mm
