The diagnostic utility of the Heston index in gated SPECT to detect multi-vessel coronary artery disease. Although the Heston index, derived left ventricular (LV) volumetric analysis, is reported to best represent transient LV dilation on non-gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), its diagnostic performance has not been proven to identify extensive coronary artery disease (CAD) as assessed by coronary angiogram. Accordingly, we sought to evaluate the diagnostic utility of Heston index to detect multi-vessel CAD.Post-stress and resting electrocardiogram-gated 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT was performed in 223 patients with suspected or known CAD. All of the patients underwent coronary angiography within 3 months of gated SPECT. The summed stress, summed rest, and summed difference scores were calculated using a 20-segment model. The left ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and ejection fraction (EF) were calculated automatically with the QGS program. In addition, stress-to-rest ratios of EDV, ESV, and (ESVx5+EDV) were calculated the latter was defined as Heston index.In the 104 patients with multi-vessel CAD, the summed stress score (17.5+/-10.0 vs. 11.7+/-9.2, p<0.001), the summed difference score (9.1+/-6.3 vs. 4.3+/-4.2, p<0.0001), the Heston index (1.17+/-0.15 vs. 1.02+/-0.13, p<0.0001), the stress-to-rest ratio of EDV (1.05+/-0.10 vs. 0.99+/-0.09 p<0.0001), and that of ESV (1.23+/-0.21 vs. 1.04+/-0.17The Heston index is simple and achieves higher diagnostic value in the detection of multi-vessel CAD, compared with conventional analysis alone.
