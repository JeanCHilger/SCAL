Housing characteristics, home environmental factors and respiratory health in 3945 pre-school children in China. The objective of the study was to assess the effects of housing characteristics and home environmental factors on respiratory symptoms of Chinese children. A cross-sectional study of 3945 children aged 1-6-years-old was conducted at 24 randomly selected kindergartens in Liaoning province, northeast China during April 2007. Information on respiratory symptoms (persistent cough, persistent phlegm, doctor-diagnosed asthma, current asthma, current wheeze and allergic rhinitis) and exposures to home environmental factors was obtained by a standard questionnaire from the American Thoracic Society. We used Chi-square tests, multivariate logistic regression models and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for estimates of the risk of respiratory symptoms. Results suggested that the prevalence of asthma-related symptoms was higher for those who lived along the main stem of traffic, and houses near a pollution source. Lower prevalence rates of respiratory morbidity were associated with households with a larger area of residence and more rooms. Pet keeping was associated with doctor-diagnosed asthma (OR = 1.45 95% CI, 1.03-2.06). Among boys, home decorations significantly increased the risk of doctor-diagnosed asthma (OR = 1.71
