Incidental adrenal lesions: principles, techniques, and algorithms for imaging characterization. Incidental adrenal lesions are commonly detected at computed tomography, and lesion characterization is critical, particularly in the oncologic patient. Imaging tests have been developed that can accurately differentiate these lesions by using a variety of principles and techniques, and each is discussed in turn. An imaging algorithm is provided to guide radiologists toward the appropriate test to make the correct diagnosis.
