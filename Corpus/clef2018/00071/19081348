Use of metoprolol in dogs with acquired cardiac disease. To evaluate the response to metoprolol in dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy or endocardiosis receiving standard therapies for management of heart disease.Beta-blocker therapy has been documented to improve survival in human patients with heart disease and heart failure. There are few studies documenting the effects of beta-blockers in dogs with naturally occurring heart disease.A retrospective study of medical records of dogs treated with metoprolol between 1991 and May 2000.Eighty-seven dogs were treated with metoprolol between 1991 and May 2000. The majority of dogs tolerated the addition of metoprolol in a step-wise fashion. Side effects included syncope, congestive heart failure, lethargy, anorexia, weakness and diarrhea. Side effects were not more likely in dogs with pre-existing congestive heart failure.Metoprolol was well tolerated in the majority of dogs with naturally occurring dilated cardiomyopathy or endocardiosis. Further studies are required to determine if the administration of metoprolol is beneficial for this patient population.
