Combined 18F-FDG PET/CT Imaging for the Initial Evaluation of Glottic Cancer. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether 18F-FDG-PET/CT (PET/CT) scans provide additional diagnostic information in addition to the direct laryngoscopic examination (L/E) and contrast-enhanced CT (CT) in patients with glottic cancer during the initial evaluation.Fifty-five consecutive patients with glottic cancer of the larynx that had L/E, CT and PET/CT were enrolled. The diagnostic value of each modality was compared for their accuracy in predicting the extent of the primary tumors on sub-site based analysis and the final tumor staging. The reference standards were either the surgical pathology findings or clinical/radiological follow-up outcome. Changes in patient care based on PET/CT results were compared with the treatment decisions based on L/E with CT.For primary tumor sub-site based analysis, the sensitivity was significantly higher for L/E (92.8%) than for PET/CT (79.4%, P=0.028). The comparisons between L/E vs. CT and CT vs. PET/CT did not reach statistical significance. As an initial tumor-staging method the L/E had a diagnostic accuracy of 76.4%, compared to 61.8% for CT and 41.8% for PET/CT. The L/E and CT were better than the PET/CT (P=0.0009 and 0.049) for the initial TNM staging. PET/CT scanning changed the clinical decision-making based on the L/E with CT results in 12.7% of cases, of whom 5.5% had no additional PET/CT related benefit.The results of this study showed that PET/CT imaging added no clinical information benefit compared to the L/E and CT for the initial evaluation of patients with glottic cancer.
