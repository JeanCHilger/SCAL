A retrospective six-year national survey of P. multocida infections in Israel. Pasteurella multocida is the commonest organism infecting pet bites. Anecdotal reports tend to overemphasize dramatic outcomes. We aimed to study a large database of P. multocida infections. This retrospective survey of P. multocida infections in Israeli hospitals refers to the y 2000-2005. Clinical microbiologists were contacted by email and asked to perform a back-search of their hospital's records for isolates of P. multocida. The charts of patients growing P. multocida were abstracted into a structured questionnaire. 77 cases were identified in 12 hospitals, yielding an annual incidence of 0.19/100,000. The mean age was 49.2+/-26.5 y and the mortality rate was 2.6%. Those who died were >65 y of age, had diabetes mellitus or cirrhosis and were bacteraemic. One-third of the cases occurred in people aged > or =65 y. Cats caused most of these infections (54%). Surgery for debridement was common (53.7%), but no-one required amputation a second- and third-look operation was necessary for these patients. Bacteraemia was found in 32.5% of patients and was significantly more common among those aged >60 y (p =0.044). Hospitalized patients with P. multocida have a favourable prognosis, apart from elderly and bacteraemic patients with comorbidities. Surgery and reoperations may be required in about half of the patients.
