Radiation-induced complications after breast cancer radiation therapy: a pictorial review of multimodality imaging findings. The purpose of this pictorial essay is to illustrate the multimodality imaging findings of a wide spectrum of radiation-induced complications of breast cancer in the sequence of occurrence. We have classified radiation-induced complications into three groups based on the time sequence of occurrence. Knowledge of these findings will allow for the early detection of complications as well as the ability to differentiate tumor recurrence.
