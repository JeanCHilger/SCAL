131I-6beta-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol SPECT/CT for primary aldosteronism patients with inconclusive adrenal venous sampling and CT results. The 2 main causes of primary aldosteronism (PA) are aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia (IAH). Dexamethasone-suppression (131)I-6beta-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NP-59) adrenal scintigraphy can assess the functioning of the adrenal cortex. This study evaluated the diagnostic usefulness of NP-59 SPECT/CT in differentiating APA from IAH and in predicting postadrenalectomy clinical outcome for PA patients who had inconclusive adrenal venous sampling (AVS) and CT results.We retrospectively reviewed the 31 adrenal lesions of 27 patients (age range, 33-71 y mean age +/- SD, 50.4 +/- 10.9 y) who had been clinically confirmed (by saline infusion and captopril tests) to have PA, had inconclusive CT and AVS test results, and had undergone NP-59 imaging before adrenalectomy. The accuracy of NP-59 imaging was determined by comparison with histopathologic findings.NP-59 SPECT/CT gave us 18 true-positive, 3 false-positive, 6 true-negative, and 4 false-negative results. Compared with planar imaging, SPECT/CT significantly improved diagnostic accuracy and prognostic predicting ability (P = 0.0390 and P = 0.0141, respectively). The NP-59 results were negative for 7 of the 23 patients with unilateral adrenal lesions, and none of these 7 patients had shown postsurgical clinical improvement.NP-59 SPECT/CT is an effective imaging tool for differentiating APA from IAH in PA patients whose CT and AVS results are inconclusive. Our results suggest that patients with presurgically negative NP-59 results should be treated medically and that noninvasive NP-59 SPECT/CT may be suited for use as the first lateralization modality after CT in patients with clinically confirmed PA.
