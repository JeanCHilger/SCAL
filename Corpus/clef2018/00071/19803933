Update on the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death for all gynecologic malignancies in developed countries, largely owing to the late stage of diagnosis. Despite response to initial surgery and chemotherapy, more than 65% of patients will have recurrent or persistent diseases. Approximately 50% of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer are asymptomatic. Recurrences are often diagnosed using a combination of tests, including cancer antigen 125, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography scan. The most significant prognostic factor among women with recurrent ovarian cancer is the length of time from initial diagnosis to recurrence. Treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer involves chemotherapy, with or without surgery. In selected patients, secondary cytoreductive surgery might significantly improve survival. Radiotherapy may have a role in the treatment of a small group of patients with localized symptomatic masses. New treatment modalities for women with recurrent ovarian cancer are needed, as none of the available treatments are curative.
