Survey of medical students and junior house doctors on the effects of medical radiation: is medical education deficient? We investigated the knowledge of ionising radiation among medical students and junior doctors in Ireland and assessed whether this knowledge improved with clinical experience.A total of 269 subjects completed a questionnaire on the fundamentals of diagnostic imaging and patient doses.Overall knowledge was poor, 99% of subjects underestimated the dose of radiation involved in a barium enema, plain film of abdomen, lumbar spine X-ray and a PET scan. Almost 90% underestimated the dose of a CT abdomen/pelvis. 42% of subjects knew that PET involved ionising radiation while 27% thought that MRI did. There was a significant improvement in understanding after transition to a clinical environment, however, no further development. 1% had attended formal radiation protection courses.The knowledge of basic radiological procedures and patient doses was extremely limited. Current undergraduate teaching needs to be expanded and continued post-qualification to improve core understanding and facilitate safe practice.
