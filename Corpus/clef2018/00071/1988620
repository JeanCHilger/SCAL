Validation of the circular harmonic transform (CHT) algorithm for quantitative SPECT. The purpose of this study was to validate the use of the circular harmonic transform (CHT) algorithm for quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with isotopes technetium-99m (99mTc) and indium-111 (111In) under clinically relevant conditions. Phantom studies were the principal tools used. Volumes of fillable organs within a tissue-equivalent anthropomorphic phantom were determined over a wide range (145-1960 ml) to within 6% by using a thresholding technique. Additionally, phantom studies with nonuniform activity distributions were made. These included a background of activity and hot as well as cold lesions. The hot lesion was computed to within 12% (111In) and 7.7% (99mTc), and contrast in the cold lesion was approximately 70% for both isotopes. The CHT algorithm incorporates the energy-distance relation (EDR) which minimizes the degrading effects of attenuation, scatter, collimator blur and poor statistics.
