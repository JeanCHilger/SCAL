A segmented attenuation correction for PET. A segmented attenuation correction technique has been developed for positron emission tomography which computes attenuation correction factors automatically from transmission images for use in the final image reconstruction. The technique segments the transmission image into anatomic regions by thresholding the histogram of the attenuation values corresponding to different regions such as soft tissue and lungs. Average values of attenuation are derived from these regions and new attenuation correction factors are computed by forward projection of these regions into sinograms for correction of emission images. The technique has been tested with phantom studies and with clinical cardiac studies in patients for 30- and 10-min attenuation scan times. This method for attenuation correction was linearly correlated (slope = 0.937 and r2 = 0.935) with the standard directly measured method, reducing noise in the final image, and reducing the attenuation scan time.
