Quantification of regional myocardial oxygenation by magnetic resonance imaging: validation with positron emission tomography. A comprehensive evaluation of myocardial ischemia requires measures of both oxygen supply and demand. Positron emission tomography (PET) is currently the gold standard for such evaluations, but its use is limited because of its ionizing radiation, limited availability, and high cost. A cardiac MRI method was developed for assessing myocardial oxygenation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and validate this technique compared with PET during pharmacological stress in a canine model of coronary artery stenosis.Twenty-one beagles and small mongrel dogs without coronary artery stenosis (controls) or with moderate to severe acute coronary artery stenosis underwent MRI and PET imaging at rest and during dipyridamole vasodilation or dobutamine stress to induce a wide range of changes in cardiac perfusion and oxygenation. MRI first-pass perfusion imaging was performed to quantify myocardial blood flow and volume. The MRI blood oxygen level-dependent technique was used to determine the myocardial oxygen extraction fraction during pharmacological hyperemia. Myocardial oxygen consumption was determined by the Fick law. In the same dogs, (15)O-water and (11)C-acetate were used to measure myocardial blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption, respectively, by PET. Regional assessments were performed for both MR and PET. MRI data correlated nicely with PET values for myocardial blood flow (R(2)=0.79, P<0.001), myocardial oxygen consumption (R(2)=0.74, P<0.001), and oxygen extraction fraction (R(2)=0.66, P<0.01).Cardiac MRI methods may provide an alternative to radionuclide imaging in settings of myocardial ischemia. Our newly developed quantitative MRI oxygenation imaging technique may be a valuable noninvasive tool to directly evaluate myocardial energetics and efficiency.
