The prognostic value of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography in patients with suspected residual or recurrent medullary thyroid carcinoma. To explore the prognostic value of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with suspected residual or recurrent medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).This retrospective study included all patients with MTC examined with FDG-PET at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, from October 1999 to March 2008. The PET results were compared with other imaging studies and clinical findings, including carcinoembryonic antigen and calcitonin levels.Twenty-nine patients with MTC were included. PET was positive in 14 patients, with follow-up information for 11 six died from metastatic disease, four had disease progression, and one remained in stable condition. PET was negative in 15 patients, with follow-up for 12FDG-PET has high prognostic value in patients with suspected residual or recurrent MTC.
