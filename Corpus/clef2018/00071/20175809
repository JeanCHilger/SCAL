Is a picture worth a thousand (forgotten) words?: neuroimaging evidence for the cognitive deficits in 'chemo-fog'/'chemo-brain'. The diminution in cognitive function reported to occur in patients treated with adjuvant cancer chemotherapy (a phenomenon known as 'chemo-fog, 'chemo-brain' or similar designation) is supported with varying degrees of evidence by prospective and retrospective clinical studies. However, the cognitive deficits are often subtle and the methodologies used to measure them not consistent. Additionally, patients might be able to compensate for the deficits, thereby leading to underestimates of the problem by this type of assessment. For these reasons, direct neuroimaging techniques might provide additional insight. The relatively few such studies, and fewer electrophysiological studies, offer an alternative way to evaluate changes that might be related to cognitive deficits in patients treated with cancer chemotherapeutic regimens.
