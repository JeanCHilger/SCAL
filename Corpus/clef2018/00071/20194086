PET and PET/CT in the clinical management of colorectal cancer. PET/CT is a new imaging technology that has already found a number of clinical applications in oncologic imaging. Widespread introduction into clinical practice started approximately 5 years ago. It can already be stated that the synthesis of structural and metabolic information improves the accuracy of primary staging and the detection of recurrent disease and has the realistic potential to change patient management in up to 30% of cases. PET/CT imaging of Colorectal Malignancies has shown that this new modality has higher specificity and sensitivity than PET alone and in certain settings even when compared to PET and CT viewed side by side. Ongoing and future studies will refine its exact place in the diagnostic work-up of colorectal cancer patients and address how often PET/CT can eliminate the need for other imaging studies that are currently performed for the staging or detection of recurrence in these patients. PET/CT fusion images can directly guide biopsies or surgical interventions. This manuscript highlights on potential clinical applications for PET/CT in colorectal tumors.
