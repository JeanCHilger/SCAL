Imaging characteristics of primary laryngeal lymphoma. The larynx is a rare site for primary NHL. Fewer than 100 cases have been reported in the literature, with the largest imaging review involving only 4 patients. We describe the findings of laryngeal lymphoma on CT, PET, and MR imaging and identify features that may distinguish laryngeal lymphoma from the far more common laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.Multi-institutional retrospective chart review revealed 20 patients with histopathologically proved laryngeal lymphoma. Pretreatment CT, PET, and MR images were reviewed by a head and neck radiologist, focusing on extent of tumor, cervical lymph node involvement, and enhancement patterns.Patients ranged from 30 to 90 years of age with a mean of 63 years at the time of initial diagnosis and a 2:1 female predominance. The average tumor size was 37 +/- 19 mm. In all patients, laryngeal lymphoma involved the supraglottis but also extended into the glottis (65%) and hypopharynx (60%). The subglottis was less frequently involved (35%). Laryngeal cartilage invasion and cervical lymphadenopathy were each seen in 20% of patients. Lymphoma was consistently FDG-avid (100%) and usually enhanced uniformly with iodinated contrast (73%). Necrosis and calcification were not seen in any cases.Although laryngeal lymphoma is rare, particular imaging features suggest this diagnosis. A large uniformly enhancing supraglottic tumor without central necrosis and without cervical lymphadenopathy is a characteristic finding of lymphoma. Similar to squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma may extend into the subglottis, pharynx, and laryngeal cartilages.
