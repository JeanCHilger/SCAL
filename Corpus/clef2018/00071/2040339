The APE nebuliser--a new delivery system for the alveolar targeting of particulate technetium 99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid. We report the validation of a new delivery system--aerosol production equipment (known by the acronym APE), which generates a particulate aerosol of technetium 99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) with a mass-median aerodynamic diameter of 0.35 microns and a geometric standard deviation of 1.8 Twenty subjects were studied in group 1 were 12 healthy men with normal spirometry
