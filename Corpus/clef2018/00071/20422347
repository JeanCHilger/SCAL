Measurement of scatter radiation from the GE Infinia Hawkeye 4 SPECT/CT system. In this study the cumulative scatter dose from a typical monthly SPECT/CT workload on a new GE Infinia Hawkeye 4 system was measured by means of a dosimeter badge survey. Doses were found to be well within regulatory limits. Scatter dose rates attributable solely to the CT component were also measured experimentally for comparison with the manufacturer's isocontour plot. The measured CT dose rate isocontours were found to be of similar magnitude and location to those quoted by the manufacturer. Data generated from this study will form a valuable baseline for the monitoring of equipment performance and for future scatter radiation measurements.
