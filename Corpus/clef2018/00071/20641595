 Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a cell-surface glycoprotein with a molecular weight of ~100 kDa. It is a unique, type II, transmembrane-bound glycoprotein that is overexpressed on prostate tumor cells and in the neovasculature of most solid prostate tumors, but not in the vasculature of normal tissues (1, 2). It has also been detected in other tissues such as the kidney, the proximal small intestine, and the salivary glands, with minimal expression in the brain (2). PSMA was found to have
