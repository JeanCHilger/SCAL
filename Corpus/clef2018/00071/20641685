. The serotonin neurotransmitter is considered to play an important role in a variety of brain functions such as appetite, sleep, and mood. Neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases (1-3), involve a dysfunction of the brain’s serotonin system. The serotonergic neurons – present in wide areas of the brain, including the hypothalamus, thalamus, and cerebral cortex – bear a protein called ”serotonin transporter” (SERT) (4). The SERT, located on the cell bodies and terminals of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons, is a specific marker for the number and integrity of presynaptic terminals of serotonin-producing neurons. The SERT regulates neurotransmission by removing released serotonin from the extracellular space back into the presynaptic neuron. Commonly prescribed antidepressants are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and their effect is obtained through interaction with (and inhibition of) the SERT (5). For that reason,
