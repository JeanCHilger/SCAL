Alexa Fluor 680-Bevacizumab Optical fluorescence imaging is increasingly used to obtain biological functions of specific targets (1, 2). However, the intrinsic fluorescence of biomolecules poses a problem when visible light (350–700 nm) absorbing fluorophores are used. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700–1,000 nm) detection avoids the background fluorescence interference of natural biomolecules, providing a high contrast between target and background tissues. NIR fluorophores have wider dynamic range and minimal background as a result of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. They also have high sensitivity, resulting from low infrared background, and high extinction coefficients, which provide high quantum yields. The NIR region is also compatible with solid-state optical components, such as diode lasers and silicon detectors. NIR fluorescence imaging is becoming a non-invasive alternative to radionuclide imaging. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) consists of at least six isoforms of various numbers of amino acids (121, 145, 165, 183, 189, and 206 amino acids) produced through alternative splicing (3).
