Examination for quantitative evaluation of abnormality of regional pulmonary blood flow in patients with diffuse pulmonary diseases--an application of bull's eye analysis. Bull's eye analysis was applied to the 99mTc-MAA lung perfusion scintigraphy (planar or SPECT). Three kind of phantoms were used to examine spatial and density resolution. Filling defect of 3 cm in diameter was detected and 30% difference between one RI concentration and the other was also detected by this method. 99mTc-MAA lung perfusion scintigraphy was performed in 39, including 28 with diffuse pulmonary diseases and 11 normal subjects. Bull's eye image with its circumferential profile curve was compared visually with conventional planar or SPECT image. This method was superior or equal to conventional image in 78% (planar) and in 75% (SPECT). Especially in patients with interstitial pneumonia, 94% was superior or equal. The patient's Bull's eye map was compared with the lower limit of normal (mean-2SD), and the extent score (ES) and the severity score (SS) were calculated. The changes of ES and SS was useful to follow up the clinical course of the patients. This method would be effective to evaluate the regional pulmonary blood flow quantitatively.
