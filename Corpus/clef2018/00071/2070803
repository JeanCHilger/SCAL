Comparative study of three different approaches on the estimation of the lung-heart ratio in thallium 201 scintigrams in relation to the extent of coronary artery disease and left ventricular function. Uptake of thallium 201 (201Tl) in the lungs has been proposed as a measure of left ventricular dysfunction with exercise. To study this hypothesis, we compared the lung/-heart (LH) ratio assessed from anterior planar images (ANT-P), from anterior images obtained during single photon emission tomography (SPET) acquisition (ANT-T) and from short-axis tomographic cross-sections (CS) in early post-exercise thallium 201 scintigrams. The study population consisted of 54 prepercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) studies (82% with single-vessel disease), 50 post-PTCA studies, 33 pre-coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) studies (71% with three-vessel disease), 30 post-CABG studies and 30 patients with a left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) due to an acute myocardial infarction 18 individuals with a low likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) served as a control group. The results demonstrated that, on average, the LH ratios obtained from ANT-P and ANT-T were not significantly different for all study groups
