Thymic neuroendocrine tumour (carcinoid): clinicopathological features of four patients with different presentation. Thymic carcinoids are aggressive and present at an advanced stage. This article describes the utility of (68)Gallium-1,4,7,10-traazacyclododecane-NI, NII, NIII, NIIII-tetra acetic acid-(D)-Phel1-Tyr3-octreotide positron emission tomography ((68)Ga DOTATOC PET-CT-scan) and clinicopathological features of four thymic carcinoid tumours. Two typical, one atypical, and one large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) were analysed. There were three males and one female with a mean age of 33 years. Three patients had a stage III and one had a stage II tumour. Preoperative (68)Ga DOTATOC PET-CT-scan of three patients did not show uptake of radiotracer in the tumour. Three patients were disease free at 19-27 months follow-up. The patient with LCNEC developed recurrence in the lumbar vertebrae. There is no locoregional recurrence of tumour in any of our patients. Complete surgical resection of the tumour with invaded adjacent structures, postoperative radiotherapy to the tumour bed helps in obtaining disease free survival.
