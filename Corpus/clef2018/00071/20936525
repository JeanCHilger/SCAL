A new 18F-labeled BBN-RGD peptide heterodimer with a symmetric linker for prostate cancer imaging. A peptide heterodimer comprises two different receptor-targeting peptide ligands. Molecular imaging probes based on dual-receptor targeting peptide heterodimers exhibit improved tumor targeting efficacy for multi-receptor expressing tumors compared with their parent single-receptor targeting peptide monomers. Previously we have developed bombesin (BBN)-RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptide heterodimers, in which BBN and RGD are covalently connected with an asymmetric glutamate linker (J Med Chem 52:425-432, 2009). Although (18)F-labeled heterodimers showed significantly better microPET imaging quality than (18)F-labeled RGD and BBN monomers in a PC-3 xenograft model which co-expresses gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) and integrin αvβ3, tedious heterodimer synthesis due to the asymmetric nature of glutamate linker restricts their clinical applications. In this study, we report the use of a symmetric linker AEADP [AEADP = 3,3'-(2-aminoethylazanediyl)dipropanoic acid] for the synthesis of BBN-RGD peptide heterodimer. The (18)F-labeled heterodimer ((18)F-FB-AEADP-BBN-RGD) showed comparable microPET imaging results with glutamate linked BBN-RGD heterodimers, indicating that the replacement of glutamate linker with AEADP linker did not affect the biological activities of BBN-RGD heterodimer. The heterodimer synthesis is rather easy and straightforward. Because tumors often co-express multiple receptors, the use of a symmetric linker provides a general method of fast assembly of various peptide heterodimers for imaging multi-receptor expressing tumors.
