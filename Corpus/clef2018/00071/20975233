Evaluating microvascular obstruction after acute myocardial infarction using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and 201-thallium and 99m-technetium pyrophosphate scintigraphy. Few studies have compared the ability of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with that of scintigraphy using 201-thallium (201-Tl) and 99m-technetium pyrophosphate (99m-Tc PYP) to evaluate microvascular obstructions (MOs). In the present study the relationship between the scintigraphic and CMR characteristics of MOs after acute myocardial infarction (MI) was examined.The 14 patients (age 69±8 years, 11 males) underwent 201-Tl/99m-Tc PYP SPECT 7±3 days, initial CMR 16±12 days, and follow-up CMR 193±20 days after a reperfused first acute MI. Each image was analyzed using a 17-segment model. Segmental extent of delayed enhancement (DE), wall motion (WM) and degree of 201-Tl uptake were scored in 238 segments. Of 91 MI segments, MO was recognized in 22 (25%) segments on CMR. WM was significantly better in proportion to 201-Tl uptake (P=0.01) in MO segments. All 8 MO segments with WM improvement at follow-up had 99m-Tc PYP uptake, although only 3 (21%) of 14 MO segments that did not show WM improvement at follow-up had 99m-Tc PYP uptake (P=0.001).99m-Tc PYP and 201-Tl scintigraphy have the potential to predict WM status and improvement of the MO region after reperfused acute MI.
