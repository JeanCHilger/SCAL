Cumulation of Ornithonyssus bacoti (tropical rat mite) infestations of pet rodents and their owners in the Canton of Zürich and Graubünden. In spring 2009 several cases of infestation with Ornithonyssus bacoti («tropical rat mite») in pet rodents have been diagnosed at the Institute of Parasitology, University of Zurich. Although adequate animal hosts were present, owners also became victims of mite infestation. The owners presented cutaneous lesions such as pruritic red papules partly with a central vesicle, predominantly disposed in groups. Particularly children with close body contact to their pet rodents were strongly affected. Because the definite diagnosis was usually yielded at a late time-point, the medical treatment remained unsatisfactory in some cases. The mite-infestation of the pets was mostly detected after the owners also became affected. The owners noticed merely non-specific signs such as increased restlessness, itching and shaggy coat on their animals. Efficient healing was achieved only if the parasites were completely eliminated, i.e. also the pets were treated, the cages cleaned and the apartments professionally disinfested. A definite diagnosis of «Infestation with Ornithonyssus bacoti» is only possible by means of morphological identification on an isolated mite, which is most likely to be found in the environment of the animals. Pet owners should be informed about the zoonotic potential of O. bacoti.
