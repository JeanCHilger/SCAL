Prognostic value of cardiac hybrid imaging integrating single-photon emission computed tomography with coronary computed tomography angiography. Aims Although cardiac hybrid imaging, fusing single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging with coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), provides important complementary diagnostic information for coronary artery disease (CAD) assessment, no prognostic data exist on the predictive value of cardiac hybrid imaging. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of hybrid SPECT/CCTA images. Methods and results Of 335 consecutive patients undergoing a 1-day stress/rest (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin SPECT and a CCTA, acquired on stand-alone scanners and fused to obtain cardiac hybrid images, follow-up was obtained in 324 patients (97%). Survival free of all-cause death or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and free of major adverse cardiac events (MACE: death, MI, unstable angina requiring hospitalization, coronary revascularizations) was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method for the following groups: (i) stenosis by CCTA and matching reversible SPECT defect (ii) unmatched CCTA and SPECT finding
