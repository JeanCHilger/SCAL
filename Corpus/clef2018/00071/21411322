Potential CRF1R PET imaging agents: N-fluoroalkyl-8-(6-methoxy-2-methylpyridin-3-yl)-2,7-dimethyl-N-alkylpyrazolo[1,5-a][1,3,5]triazin-4-amines. A series of N-fluoroalkyl-8-(6-methoxy-2-methylpyridin-3-yl)-2,7-dimethyl-N-alkylpyrazolo[1,5-a][1,3,5]triazin-4-amines were prepared and evaluated as potential CRF(1)R PET imaging agents. Optimization of their CRF(1)R binding potencies and octanol-phosphate buffer phase distribution coefficients resulted in discovery of analog 7e (IC(50)=6.5 nM, logD=3.5).
