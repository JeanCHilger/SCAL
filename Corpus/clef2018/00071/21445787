In vivo assessment of oxygen consumption via Deuterium Magnetic Resonance. We present a novel approach to simultaneously measure, in vivo, noninvasively, glucose and oxygen consumption via Deuterium Magnetic Resonance (DMR). Mice are administered deuteriated glucose by intravenous injection. The rate of formation of nascent (deuteriated) mitochondrial water is then measured via DMR. The rate of glucose metabolism and oxygen utilization is assessed by tracking their separate peaks in DMR spectra during dynamic scanning. Further studies will aim to validate these results by comparison with in vivo (17)O-MRI (mitochondrial function), (13)C-MRI and (19)FDG-PET (glucose metabolism) and ex vivo 1H- and 2H-MR, as well as mass spectrometry.
