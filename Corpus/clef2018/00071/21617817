A near-infrared fluorescent probe for detecting copper(II) with high selectivity and sensitivity and its biological imaging applications. The first near-infrared fluorescent probe was developed toward Cu(2+). Based on the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) mechanism, the probe exhibited weak fluorescence. Upon the addition of Cu(2+), it fluoresced strongly. The probe offered this unique capability, and was successfully applied to living cells, tissues and in vivo to visualize Cu(2+).
