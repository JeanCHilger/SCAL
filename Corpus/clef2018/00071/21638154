Comparison of high efficiency CZT SPECT MPI to coronary angiography. The recently introduced cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) SPECT cameras have the potential to reduce radiation exposure to patients and shorten imaging time. So far, there has been only one small study comparing the results of high efficiency CZT SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) to invasive coronary angiography.All patients who had either a Tc-99m sestamibi or Tl-201 SPECT MPI study using a CZT camera (GE Discovery NM 530c) over a 1-year period followed by a coronary angiogram within 2 months were included. Only patients with a history of CABG surgery were excluded. Standard stress protocols were employed. Rest images were acquired for 5 min and stress supine and prone images for 3 min each. Both MPI studies and coronary angiograms were interpreted by blinded readers. A standard 17-segment model was employed for MPI interpretation, and coronary angiograms were interpreted for the presence of obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD) defined as ≥70% luminal narrowing. Correlation was based on the ability to diagnose obstructive epicardial CAD.Of the 3,111 patients who underwent SPECT imaging using the CZT camera during this time period, 230 patients qualified for the correlation study (mean age 64.2 ± 11.0 years old, 69% male, and 49% had a history of intracoronary stenting). Tc-99m was used in 76% vs Tl-201 in 24% of the studies. Exercise stress was performed in 60% of patients and vasodilator pharmacologic stress in 40%. Sensitivity was 95%, normalcy rate was 97%, and accuracy was 69% for detecting obstructive CAD.In this so far largest correlation study between coronary angiography and high efficiency CZT SPECT imaging, a high sensitivity and accuracy for detecting obstructive epicardial CAD was found for this new SPECT camera technology.
