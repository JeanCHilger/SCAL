Tc 99m bone scan and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in evaluation of disseminated langerhans cell histiocytosis. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare histiocytic disorder in which pathological langerhans cells accumulate in a variety of organs. Manifestations may include lung infiltrates, lymph node involvements, bone lesions, hepatic, hematopoietic and endocrine dysfunctions. In this case report we present fluorine-18 positron emission tomography (F-18 PET/CT) and bone scintigraphy findings of a 18-year-old male patient with disseminated LCH, mimicking multiple hypermetabolic metastatic lesions. Clinicians should be aware that LCH infiltrations can be seen as intense uptake and to differentiate infiltrations from other metastatic intense uptake with fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT and bone scintigraphy, clinical and laboratory findings should be kept in mind.
