Detecting the recurrence of gastric cancer after curative resection: comparison of FDG PET/CT and contrast-enhanced abdominal CT. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) for detecting the recurrence of gastric cancer. We performed a retrospective review of 139 consecutive patients who underwent PET/CT and contrast-enhanced abdominal CT (CECT) for surveillance of gastric cancer after curative resection. Recurrence of gastric cancer was validated by histopathologic examination for local recurrence or serial imaging study follow-up with at least 1 yr interval for recurrence of distant metastasis form. Twenty-eight patients (20.1%) were confirmed as recurrence. On the patient based analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of PET/CT (53.6%, 84.7%, and 78.4%, respectively) and those of CECT (64.3%, 86.5%, and 82.0%, respectively) for detecting tumor recurrence except in detection of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Among 36 recurrent lesions, 8 lesions (22.2%) were detected only on PET/CT, and 10 lesions (27.8%) only on CECT. PET/CT had detected secondary malignancy in 8 patients. PET/CT is as accurate as CECT in detection of gastric cancer recurrence after curative resection, excepting detection of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Moreover, additional PET/CT on CECT could improve detection rate of tumor recurrence and provide other critical information such as unexpected secondary malignancy.
