Serological survey for antibodies to Encephalitozoon cuniculi in rabbits in Taiwan. Encephalitozoon cuniculi (E. cuniculi) is a microsporidian parasite commonly found in rabbits that can infect humans, causing encephalitozoonosis. Our laboratory recently confirmed the first case of encephalitozoonosis in a rabbit in Taiwan the prevalence of encephalitozoonosis is not well documented, even when many clinics suspect pet rabbits as being infected. This study surveys the seropositivity of E. cuniculi using carbon immunoassay (CIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serological examination of 171 rabbits using CIA and ELISA showed that 63.2% (108/171) and 67.8% (116/171) were seropositive against E. cuniculi, respectively. Thirteen of the 14 rabbits (92.9%) with neurological symptoms were seropositive. Except for gender, health status and location had a significant effect on E. cuniculi seropositivity (p<0.05). Adult rabbits aged older than 4 months exhibited significantly higher seropositivity for E. cuniculi than young rabbits (p<0.05). In conclusion, this study shows that E. cuniculi is present and widespread among healthy rabbits in Taiwan. Therefore, the fields of veterinary and human medicine in Taiwan should be aware of this zoonotic issue and the resulting public health concern of encephalitozoonosis.
