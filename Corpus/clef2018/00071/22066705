Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) based Zn2+ fluorescent probe: transformation of turn-on sensors into ratiometric ones with dual emission in acetonitrile. Ratiometric sensors for the detection of metal ions have gained increasing attention due to its self-calibration tendency for the environmental effects. In this context, we have synthesized and characterized a dual emitting ratiometric Zn(2+) probe (1) having acridinedione as a fluorophore and N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (BPA) as a receptor unit. Existence of two different conformation of the molecule with photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from amine moiety to the acridinedione fluorophore leads to dual emission, namely locally excited (425 nm) and anomalous charge transfer emission (560 nm) in aprotic solvents. In the presence of one equivalent of Zn(2+), a 15-fold fluorescence enhancement in the locally excited state together with the quenching of charge transfer emission is observed. The intensity changes at the two emission peaks allow a ratiometric detection of Zn(2+) under PET signaling mechanism. The utilization of PET process for the ratiometric fluorescence change will further signify the importance of PET mechanism in sensing action. Addition of Zn(2+) to 1 in acetonitrile/water mixtures shows a single emission peak with fluorescence enhancement.
