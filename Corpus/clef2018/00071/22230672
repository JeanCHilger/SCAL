Current role of imaging in diagnosing aortic graft infections. Vascular prosthetic graft infection is a rare but serious complication after aortic graft replacement, with high morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, adequate diagnostics are needed to detect and treat these infections as early as possible. Several imaging modalities provide different diagnostic values for detecting prosthetic graft infection. Previous studies reported on the diagnostic value of ultrasound, computed tomography imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, and single-photon emission computed tomography. In addition, adjunctive studies on new and promising techniques to detect prosthetic graft infection (eg, bio-optical imaging and target imaging with nuclear techniques) have also been investigated. This review provides a summary of noninvasive imaging modalities and their diagnostic values in order to evaluate and treat possible vascular graft infections as early as possible.
