Effects of steroids on the synthesis and metabolism of phosphatidylethanol in phorbol ester-activated lymphocytes. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate activates the phospholipase D pathway in bovine lymphocytes, leading to a synthesis of phosphatidylethanol (PEt) from exogenous alcohol. Concomitant treatment of the cells with 10(-8) M etiocholanolone, dehydroepiandrosterone or 16 alpha-bromo-epiandrosterone results in the production of phosphatidylethanols that carry metabolically altered forms of arachidonic acid at position 2. The observed steroid response appears to be mediated by a receptor mechanism in that it depends on the synthesis of new RNA and protein. The spectrum of steroids producing the response suggests that the postulated receptor system may be distinct from the well-studied glucocorticoid, progesterone, estrogen and androgen specific receptors. The possible relevance of these new metabolites of ethanol to the problem of alcoholism in humans and to the field of carcinogenesis in general is discussed.
