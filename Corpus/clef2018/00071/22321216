Towards the preparation of radiolabeled 1-aryl-3-benzyl ureas: Radiosynthesis of [(11)C-carbonyl] AR-A014418 by [(11)C]CO(2) fixation. The highly selective glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitor N-(4-methoxybenzyl)-N'-(5-nitro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)urea (AR-A014418) was radiolabeled with carbon-11 ((11)C half-life=20.4min) at the urea moiety via [(11)C]CO(2) fixation. Reaction of [(11)C]CO(2) with 4-methoxybenzylamine in the presence of a CO(2) fixating base was followed by dehydration with POCl(3) and addition of 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole to prepare [(11)C-carbonyl] AR-A014418. This reaction resulted in an 8% uncorrected radiochemical yield, based on [(11)C]CO(2), with high specific activity (4Ci/μmol) within 30min. An in vitro GSK-3β enzyme activity assay revealed that AR-A014418 (K(i)=770nM) is not as potent as previously claimed. The [(11)C]CO(2) fixation methodology described herein should prove generally applicable to preparing 1-aryl-3-benzyl-[(11)C-carbonyl] ureas as radiotracers for positron emission tomography.
