Unusual inflow sources and device introduction sites in aortic arch debranching. Aim of the study was to evaluate a single center experience on hybrid treatment for thoracic aortic diseases, including aortic arch and ascending aorta endografting needing a total debranching from descending thoracic aorta and an antegrade endograft deployment from left ventricle.Between January 2004 and December 2010 48 patients underwent thoracic aorta endografting, with coverage of at least one supra-aortic artery, because of atherosclerotic, dissecting and post-traumatic aneurysms or complications of previous aortic surgery. Supra-aortic trunks revascularization was obtained from ascending aorta, common carotid arteries and, in three cases, from descending thoracic aorta since the unavailability of common inflow sites. In three cases the antegrade endograft introduction through left ventricle (transapical approach, 2 cases) or ascending aorta (one case) was the only possibility for a safe deployment.Three groups have been identified on the basis of the proximal landing zone. Group A (27 patients): zone 2 Group B (9 patients): zone 1Hybrid procedures on aortic arch represent a possible treatment for cases unfit for open surgery despite the complication rates and mortality are not negligible. In selected cases, the endografting can be extended up to beyond the landing zone 0 where an antegrade transventricular endograft deployment and a supra-aortic perfusion from descending thoracic aorta represent a feasible option.
