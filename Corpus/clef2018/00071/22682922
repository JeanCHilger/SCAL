Synthesis and evaluation of [¹¹C]Cimbi-806 as a potential PET ligand for 5-HT₇ receptor imaging. 2-(2',6'-Dimethoxy-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-yl)-N,N-dimethylethanamine has been identified as a potent ligand for the serotonin 7 (5-HT(7)) receptor. In this study, we describe the synthesis, radiolabeling and in vivo evaluation of [(11)C]2-(2',6'-dimethoxy-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-yl)-N,N-dimethylethanamine ([(11)C]Cimbi-806) as a radioligand for imaging brain 5-HT(7) receptors with positron emission tomography (PET). Precursor and reference compound was synthesized and subsequent (11)C-labelling with [(11)C]methyltriflate produced [(11)C]Cimbi-806 in specific activities ranging from 50 to 300 GBq/μmol. Following intravenous injection, brain uptake and distribution of [(11)C]Cimbi-806 was assessed with PET in Danish Landrace pigs. The time-activity curves revealed high brain uptake in thalamic and striatal regions (SUV ∼2.5) and kinetic modeling resulted in distribution volumes (V(T)) ranging from 6 mL/cm(3) in the cerebellum to 12 mL/cm(3) in the thalamus. Pretreatment with the 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist SB-269970 did not result in any significant changes in [(11)C]Cimbi-806 binding in any of the analyzed regions. Despite the high brain uptake and relevant distribution pattern, the absence of appropriate in vivo blocking with a 5-HT(7) receptor selective compounds renders the conclusion that [(11)C]Cimbi-806 is not an appropriate PET radioligand for imaging the 5-HT(7) receptor in vivo.
