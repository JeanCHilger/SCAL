Aquaporin-4 positron emission tomography imaging of the human brain: first report. Aquaporin 4 (AQP-4) is the most abundant aquaporin isoform in the brain. Alterations in its expression and distribution have been correlated with the progression of several clinical disorders however, the specific roles of AQP-4 in those disorders are not well understood. Visualizing AQP-4 in vivo is expected to provide fresh insights into its roles in disease pathology, as well as aiding the clinical assessment of those disorders.We developed a 11C-labeled analogue of the AQP-4 ligand TGN-020 (2-nicotinamido-1,3,4-thiadiazole) suitable for in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.In the present study, we report the first PET images of AQP-4 in the human brain. The results unequivocally demonstrated a specific distribution pattern for AQP-4 within the brain, namely, the subpial and perivascular endfeet of astrocytes. The choroid plexus, where both AQP-4 and AQP-1 are expressed, also showed substantial uptake of the ligand.Based on these initial results, we believe [11C]TGN-020 PET will be valuable in determining the role of AQP-4 in disease progression, and for the clinical assessment of water homeostasis under various settings.
