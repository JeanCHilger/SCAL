High uptake of (68)Ga-DOTATOC in spleen as compared to splenosis: measurement by PET/CT. The aim of this study is to ascertain the high somatostatin receptor (SSTR) uptake in spleen and to compare the uptake in spleen and splenosis using SSTR PET/CT using( 68)Ga-DOTATOC.SUV(max) of spleen on (68)Ga-DOTATOC SSTR PET/CT (acquired for initial staging) in 10 patients with known neuroendocrine neoplasm of pancreatic tail was analyzed. All patients underwent left pancreatectomy and splenectomy. Diagnosis of splenosis was confirmed on CT, and SUV(max) was noted on follow-up SSTR PET/CT.SUV(max)was 28.8 ± 12.5 in normal spleen and 10.5 ± 4.3 in splenosis.The high uptake of( 68)Ga-DOTATOC (which has a high affinity to SSTR 2) in the spleen as compared to splenosis, which has a different histology, suggests white pulp as the probable site of high SSTR 2 expression.
