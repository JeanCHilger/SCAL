Spectrum of gastric malignancy on 18F-FDG PET/CT: a pictorial essay. A wide variety of malignant gastric diseases can be detected, staged, and followed on (18)F-FDG PET/CT. Although the PET/CT findings are often nonspecific and some can be seen in certain benign gastric diseases, the aim of this atlas was to demonstrate that the wide histological spectrum of gastric tumors that can be evaluated, staged, and followed with PET/CT is much broader than current medical literature would suggest. PET/CT readers and oncologists should be aware of the utility of PET/CT in these tumors and the imaging characteristics and patterns of (18)F-FDG uptake that can be demonstrated in these cases.
