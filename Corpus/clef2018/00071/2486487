Pulmonary changes in breast cancer patients treated by three different radiotherapy techniques. Twenty eight patients with breast cancer were studied by CT, perfusion scans and pulmonary function tests to assess the extent of post-irradiation changes. The patients had been treated by three treatment techniques using either two, three or four fields with different amounts of lung included in the target volume. The most extensive changes were seen in those patients who received treatment to the mediastinum.
