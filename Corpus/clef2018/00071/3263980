Quantitative measurements of cerebral blood flow using SPECT and [99mTc]-d,l-HM-PAO compared to xenon-133. The uptake and retention in a 2 cm thick brain section was recorded serially by SPECT after i.v. injection of [99mTc]-d,l-HM-PAO (HM-PAO). In 16 patients, the fraction of the administered dose retained by the brain was 5.2 +/- 1%, showing a peak after 40-50s, then decreasing by 10% within the first 10 min and then by only 0.4% per hour. The image contrast was measured in each patient as the regional hemispheric asymmetry difference in percent of the highest value of the two regions. It decreased from 31% at 30-40 s to 25% at 10 min. At 24 h, a value of 19% was reached. Using the images obtained at 10 min after injection, a region to region comparison of the original and corrected HM-PAO images to the xenon-133 regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) images was performed. Forty-four patients with stroke, epilepsy, dementia, basal ganglia disease, and tumors and control subjects were included in this comparison. The algorithm proposed by Lassen et al. was used to correct the original images for back diffusion of tracer (brain to blood) a good correlation very close to the line of identity between the corrected HM-PAO and xenon-133 data was obtained when using a conversion/clearance ratio of 1.5 and when the noninvolved hemisphere was used as a reference region (r = 0.86, p less than 0.0001). Serial arterial and cerebral venous blood sampling was performed over 10 min following i.v. injection of HM-PAO in six patients. An overall brain retention fraction of 0.37 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SEM) was calculated from the data. An average CBF of 0.62 +/- 0.12 ml/g/min was determined on the basis of the Fick principle
