Functional mapping of ventricular contraction and phase using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). A method for functional mapping of ventricular contraction and phase was developed using gated blood-pool SPECT. Parameters of contraction and phase were calculated using length-based and count-based Fourier analyses. In length-based Fourier analysis (LFA), percentage-shortening and length-based phase were calculated based on the changes of lengths from a ventricular centre to edges. In count-based Fourier analysis (CFA), phase and amplitude were also calculated using serial tomographic phase images. Two-dimensional polar display format was employed to summarize the SPECT data of whole cardiac surface. This program was applied to evaluate coronary artery disease and conduction anomalies. The polar functional map using gated blood-pool SPECT can be an effective method to integrate three-dimensional cardiac information in conjunction with myocardial SPECT studies.
