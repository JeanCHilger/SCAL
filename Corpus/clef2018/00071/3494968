Brain SPECT imaging with 99Tcm-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime in the early detection of cerebral infarction: comparison with transmission computed tomography. A new cerebral blood flow agent, 99Tcm-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HM-PAO), was evaluated for early detection of acute cerebral infarction in conjunction with the transmission computed tomographic (CT) studies. The data from 22 cases were analysed. Results reveal that 99Tcm-HM-PAO enables the early detection of acute cerebral infarction prior to CT with rather proper depiction of the extent of physiological abnormality in the majority of patients. This promising result together with the lack of logistical problems will make 99Tcm-HM-PAO a useful and practical agent worldwide for diagnosing and managing acute cerebral infarction.
