Routine synthesis of carbon-11-carboxyl-labeled L-dopa. Carbon-11-carboxyl-labeled L-dopa has been synthesized by the modified Bucherer-Strecker method. The reaction mixture was first purified by chiral HPLC followed by deprotection using hydriodic acid. The entire procedure was performed in a remotely operated system which gave the product in 28% radiochemical yield (decay corrected) in an overall synthesis time of 55-60 min.
