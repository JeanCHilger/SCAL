Liver volume and uptake assessment using 123I-BSP tomography. Liver volume and parenchymal cell uptake of 123I-bromosulphthalein (BSP) has been assessed using the technique of single photon emission tomography (SPET). These results have been compared with a clinical scoring of disease severity and also with results for liver volume and tomographically assessed uptake of 99Tcm-sulphur colloid (SC). Comparisons of volume estimation, geometric mean (GM) uptake curves and a distribution index derived by a mapping technique with both radiopharmaceuticals, show that 123I-BSP tomography is feasible. A short acquisition time is required in order to obtain tomographic information before there is significant biliary excretion. There was a significant difference between the mean percentage uptake of 123I-BSP in the three groups of liver disease severity (P less than 0.002). This technique merits further evaluation in the study of the assessment of functional liver impairment.
