Imaging dopamine receptors in the human brain by positron tomography. Neurotransmitter receptors may be involved in a number of neuropsychiatric disease states. The ligand 3-N-[11C]methylspiperone, which preferentially binds to dopamine receptors in vivo, was used to image the receptors by positron emission tomography scanning in baboons and in humans. This technique holds promise for noninvasive clinical studies of dopamine receptors in humans.
