Brain uptake and organ distribution of 11C from 11C-labeled glucose. The time course of the distribution of carbon-11 (11C, t1/2 = 20.4 min) in brain after the i.v. administration of 11C-labeled glucose [( 11C]glucose) was studied in an effort to understand and explore its behavior in relation to the known factors concerning the catabolic fate of glucose carbon in the brain. The biodistribution of 11C from [11C]glucose was studied in rats using organ dissection. Human radiation doses were estimated from rat biodistribution data. All the rat organs except the brain cleared with a half time of 30-60 min. The brain showed delayed uptake that plateaued from 20 to 60 min. The 11C distribution in normal, non-ischemic, brain 30 min after intravenously administered [11C]glucose is due to labeled carbon incorporation into amino acids associated with tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. External imaging with the Massachusetts General Hospital positron camera, PC I, was performed in dogs and humans and the time course of 11C incorporation was similar to the rat brain results. Regional uptake paralleled known metabolic differences between grey and white matter in normal human volunteers. A patient with progressive dementia had less uptake in an area of decreased perfusion as demonstrated angiographically, suggesting that the image obtained 20 min after tracer administration could be used to detect abnormalities in cerebral metabolism due to pathology.
