Cerebral emission computer tomography (SPECT) with 123I-labeled amphetamines. Amphetamine is stored by brain tissue and permits its scintigraphic imaging, particularly with the single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). A total of 60 scintigraphic investigations in 54 patients were done. Investigations were done using an emission computed tomograph (rotating gamma-camera) after application of 123I-N-isopropyl-amphetamine. In 6 out of 24 patients with epilepsy a focus in agreement with EEG findings could be established despite negative cranial computed tomography (CT). In 4 out of 25 patients with cerebrovascular disease diminished perfusion was demonstrated although cranial CT was normal. In 10 out of 20 cases the extent of functional lesions demonstrated by SPECT was larger than could be assumed by cranial CT findings. Three patients with migraine and negative CT findings showed disorders of perfusion in the amphetamine-SPECT which were in agreement with the EEG. Brain SPECT using 123I-labelled amphetamines thus offers the possibility to demonstrate functional perfusion and metabolic disorders which show no morphologic correlate in the cranial CT. In addition, foci demonstrated in cranial CT can be more precisely defined in their functional extent using the SPECT.
