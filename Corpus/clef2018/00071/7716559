The role of Ga-67 scintigraphy in evaluating the results of therapy of lymphoma patients. Gallium-67 scintigraphy using high-dose, modern equipment, and SPECT plays an important role in the evaluation of patients with lymphoma after treatment. Being a viability agent, taken up by lymphomatous, but not by necrotic or fibrotic tissue, it is used to assess the nature of a residual mass after treatment. Gallium also predicts disease-free survival and overall survival after treatment. It is used with high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of recurrence after a continuous clinical remission, which is achieved after successful treatment. A potential use for Gallium is in early evaluation, during treatment, of the rapidity of response. This evaluation determines early the effectiveness of therapy in the individual patient. After treatment Ga-67 scintigraphy appears to be superior to computed tomography and probably magnetic resonance imaging. It is used routinely in the management of patients with lymphoma.
