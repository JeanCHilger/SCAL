Detection of esophageal carcinoma using Tc-99m MIBI SPECT imaging. Thirty male patients, ranging in age from 41-78 years, with esophageal carcinomas underwent Tc-99m MIBI SPECT of the chest to evaluate the value of Tc-99m MIBI in the detection of esophageal carcinoma. In addition, Tc-99m MIBI SPECT of the chest was performed, for comparative purposes, in 10 normal patients who were referred because of suspected ischemic heart disease. Of the 30 patients with esophageal carcinoma, 22 epidermoid carcinomas (73%) were detected using Tc-99m MIBI chest SPECT, while eight carcinomas (27%) were not detected. In comparison, 10 of the control patients (100%) were not detected on the Tc-99m MIBI chest SPECT. In addition, the diagnostic sensitivity was not related to cell differentiation, the location, or the size of the carcinomas. These results suggest that the Tc-99m MIBI chest SPECT could be a helpful test to detect esophageal carcinoma.
