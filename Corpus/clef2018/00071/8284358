Radiologic diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of adult central nervous system primary malignant glioma. Glioma represents the most common primary intra-axial brain tumor. Currently, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the study of choice for the radiographic evaluation of patients with primary central nervous system glioma prior to and following therapeutic intervention. Computed tomography and MR imaging are frequently used for stereotactic biopsy and mapping. MR spectroscopy and/or thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography may prove helpful in differentiating recurrent malignancy from radiation-induced necrosis.
