Iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy for localization of lesions in children with neuroblastoma: comparison with computed tomography and ultrasonography. Iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy, computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US) were used to localize tumour lesions in 28 children with histologically proven neuroblastoma. Overall, a total of 73 lesions were detected on imaging studies. MIBG scintigraphy, CT and US localized 63 (86%), 49 (67%) and 36 (49%) of these lesions, respectively. The findings of the three imaging techniques were concordant in respect of only 31 (42%) of the lesions. The best agreement among MIBG scintigraphy, CT and US was observed for abdominal lesions (the techniques were concordant for 22 of 23 lesions, i.e. 96%). MIBG scintigraphy detected nine out of ten (90%) liver metastases, but agreement with CT and US was observed in only six instances (60%). The imaging findings were concordant in respect of only two (33%) out of six lymph node metastases the MIBG scan was normal in the other four cases. Imaging agreement was observed for a lesion located in the pelvis. MIBG and CT findings were concordant in four lesions located in the chest, but US was not performed. MIBG scintigraphy depicted the majority (96%) of the skeletal lesions (23/24)
