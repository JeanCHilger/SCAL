Clinical usefulness of 99mTc-ECD--a multicenter phase 3 study. A phase 3 clinical study of a newly developed brain perfusion agent, 99mTc-L,L-ethyl cysteinate dimer (99mTc-ECD), was performed in 521 cases of cerebrovascular diseases and impairment of brain function to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and usefulness of the agent as a multi-center study involving 35 institutions in Japan. Out of 510 cases evaluated for the clinical usefulness, valuable information for clinical diagnosis was obtained in 486 cases (95.3%), and 444 cases (87.1%) were judged as "extremely useful" or "useful". Although the positive ratio of abnormalities detected by the agent was as same as that of 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HM-PAO), the abnormal regions detected by the agent had tendency to be larger in size and to have higher contrast than those detected by 99mTc-HM-PAO. It is concluded that 99mTc-ECD is a safe and useful radiopharmaceutical as a brain perfusion agent for the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases and impairment of brain function.
