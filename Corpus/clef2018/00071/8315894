Assessment of myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function with 99mTc-PPN 1011. First-pass radionuclide angiography (FPRNA) was performed with the new myocardial perfusion agent 99mTc-1,2,bis[bis(2-ethoxyethyl)phosphino] ethane (99mTc-PPN 1011) on stress and at rest. One hour after that, myocardial perfusion was counted by 99mTc-PPN 1011 SPECT. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) obtained by FPRNA correlated with that by multigated image with 99mTc-HSAD (r = 0.94, n = 11). The reduction of left ventricular function under the exercise (delta LVEF) and the increase of severity score (delta Severity score) have a good relation (r = 0.88) in 7 patients with prior myocardial infarction. Thus 99mTc-PPN 1011 appears to be an ideal radiopharmaceutical for evaluation of ventricular function and myocardial perfusion.
