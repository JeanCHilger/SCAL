Familiarity and the rarity of deception: two theories and their relevance to play between dogs (Canis familiaris) and humans (Homo sapiens). One theory of the relation between familiarity and the frequency of deception predicts that familiarity leads to the rarity of deception and another, that familiarity increases deception. We examined which theory applied to play by comparing familiar and unfamiliar partners during play between dogs (Canis familiaris) and humans (Homo sapiens). Deceptions by humans were based on directionality of movement and petting the dog and on the projects show object and throw object, which are specialized for play. Likewise, deceptions by dogs were based on directionality of movement and the project retrieve object (an analogue to show object). Deceptions based on directionality and petting were rare among familiars (and unfamiliars), whereas those based on show object, throw object, and retrieve object were more frequent. The findings suggest that, in play at least, deception may occur frequently.
