The value of peritoneoscintigraphy in the investigation of ultrafiltration loss during peritoneal dialysis. Peritoneoscintigraphy (PSG) was performed in 18 patients with ultrafiltration (UF) loss during peritoneal dialysis (PD). In 9 patients PSG was abnormal after peritonitis (PT), and transfer to hemodialysis (HD) was necessary. In three cases peritoneal catheter malfunction was suspected, and PSG provided information about the catheter's position and function. In two cases loss of UF was connected with extraperitoneal leakage of the dialysis solution (which was confirmed by PSG). In cases of UF loss and normal control, the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was used, and its result was abnormal for glucose D/D0 (too high). PSG was useful for diagnosing the reasons for UF loss during PD.
