Cerebral and cerebellar diaschisis following carbamazepine therapy. 1. The regional cerebral blood flow was studied by SPECT in patients with partial epilepsy before and after 30 days of monotherapy with carbamazepine (CBZ). 2. Both a qualitative visual interpretation and a semiquantitative analysis of SPECT was performed. All patients underwent EEG, CT scan, and MRI studies. The CBZ serum concentrations were assayed. 3. After therapy, in three patients with focal epilepsy, both a crossed cerebral and cerebellar diaschisis were observed, with respect to the side of the epileptic focus in the opposite hemisphere. No morphologic changes were detected at MRI in the cerebral or cerebellar remote hypometabolic areas found at SPECT. 4. CBZ may have a depressant action on the corticopontocerebellar pathways and on the corticocallosal connections.
