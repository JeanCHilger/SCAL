Adenosine technetium-99m sestamibi (SPECT) for the early assessment of jeopardized myocardium after acute myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of adenosine Tc-99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in the detection of jeopardized myocardium early after acute myocardial infarction. Coronary arteriography and myocardial scintigraphy were performed in 50 consecutive patients with an uncomplicated myocardial infarction. Myocardium was considered jeopardized if a significant infarct-related vessel stenosis (> 50% diameter stenosis) supplied an infarct area with residual viable tissue. Perfusion reversibility in the infarct region occurred in 25 patients (50%) and was almost solely observed in the presence of jeopardized myocardium. Non-reversible perfusion defects in the infarct region were found in patients without jeopardized myocardium. This subgroup consisted of either patients without significant vessel stenosis or patients without significant residual viability in the infarct region. Adenosine Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT had an accuracy of 88% for the detection of jeopardized myocardium. Side effects during adenosine infusion were frequently observed but well tolerated. These results suggest that adenosine Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT is an accurate non-invasive method for detecting jeopardized myocardium after acute myocardial infarction and may be a valuable non-invasive test for the early selection of patients at risk for future ischaemic events.
