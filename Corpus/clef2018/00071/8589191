Adhesive protein expression on endothelial cells after contact in vitro with polyethylene terephthalate coated with pyrolytic carbon. This research aims at evaluating the expression of some adhesive proteins on endothelial cell surface with polyethylene terephthalate coated with pyrolytic carbon (PET + PC). Twenty-two different cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were put in contact with PET + PC. Both HUVECs grown without the biomaterial and HUVECs incubated with endotoxin were used as control. After 24 h, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) were evaluated on the cells by monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. In agreement with the literature, after 24 h the culture incubated with endotoxin determined a significant increase in the percentage of positive cells for ELAM-1, a significant increase in fluorescence intensity of ICAM-1, and a significant increase in the percentage of positive cells and fluorescence intensity for VCAM-1. After 24 h of culture with PET + PC, no significant variations in the antigens examined were observed. This demonstrates that such material does not activate in vitro the proteins involved in the adhesion between leucocytes and endothelium or in the adhesion between endothelial cells themselves.
