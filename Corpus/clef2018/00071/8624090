Visual versus auditory memory stimulation in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease. A PET study with 18 FDG. Patients with probable Alzheimer's disease were either stimulated with a continuous visual recognition task (n = 18) or with a continuous auditory recognition task during PET measurement with 18 FDG. The PET scanner was a Siemens CTI, ECAT EXACT with 5 mm transaxial and 6 mm axial resolution. The global stimulation effects were nearly identical in both groups and increased of 4.17 +/- 8.14% in the auditory stimulated group and of 4.03 +/- 11.78% in the visual stimulated group. Beyond regional stimulation effects in both groups a common cerebellar stimulation effect was measured. It is concluded that the cerebellar stimulation effect reflects a modality independent cognitive process and that the only small enhancement of global glucose metabolism indicates disturbed stimuli processes and finally explained the patient's failure in memory tasks.
