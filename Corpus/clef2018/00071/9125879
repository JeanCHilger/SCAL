Usefulness of 3-D dynamic pulmonary xenon-133 SPECT for thoracoscopic lung volume reduction surgery in patients with pulmonary emphysema. Six patients with pulmonary emphysema scheduled to undergo thoracoscopic lung volume reduction surgery (TLVRS) were evaluated by three-dimensional (3-D) dynamic pulmonary xenon-133 SPECT. Serial 30-second dynamic SPECT data for equilibrium and washout (for 5 min) were acquired using a continuous repetitive rotating acquisition mode with a triple-detector SPECT system. SPECT data were reconstructed to 3-D images with a color, surface-rendering technique, and a 3-D fusion image of the 3-min washout image over the equilibrium image was obtained. Regional ventilation was visually assessed on the fusion 3-D images and quantified by xenon-133 half-washout time (T1/2) and mean transit time (MTT). The 3-D fusion image localized and lateralized the worst diseased sites with xenon-133 retention. Xenon-133 retention, T1/2 and MTT were reduced on these images in five patients with improved pulmonary function tests following TLVRS. However, xenon-133 retention was greater in one with asynchronous diaphragm movement after TLVRS. This modality will assist TLVRS in determining the lung resection target and in evaluating the treatment effect.
