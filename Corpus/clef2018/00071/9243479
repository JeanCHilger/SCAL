Implementation of a Monte Carlo dosimetry method for patient-specific internal emitter therapy. In internal emitter therapy, an accurate description of the absorbed dose distribution is necessary to establish an administered dose-response relationship, as well as to avoid critical organ toxicity. This work describes the implementation of a dosimetry method that accounts for the radionuclide decay spectrum, and patient-specific activity and density distributions. The dosimetry algorithm is based on a Monte Carlo procedure that simulates photon and electron transport and scores energy depositions within the patient. The necessary input information may be obtained from a registered set of CT and SPECT or PET images. The algorithm provides the absorbed dose rate for the radioactivity distribution provided by the SPECT or PET image. The algorithm was benchmarked by reproducing dosimetric quantities using the Medical Internal Radionuclide Dose (MIRD) Committee's Standard Man phantom and was used to calculate absorbed dose distributions for representative case studies.
