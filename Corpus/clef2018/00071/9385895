Preoperative positron emission tomographic viability assessment and perioperative and postoperative risk in patients with advanced ischemic heart disease. This study sought to investigate whether determination of tissue viability by means of positron emission tomography (PET) before coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) affects clinical outcome with respect to both in-hospital mortality and 1-year survival rate.Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction are at higher risk for perioperative complications associated with CABG. Therefore, the selection of patients who will benefit from CABG is an important clinical issue.This study retrospectively evaluated 76 patients with advanced CAD and LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction < or = 0.35) who were considered candidates for CABG. Thirty-five patients were selected for CABG on the basis of clinical presentation and angiographic data (group A), and 34 of 41 patients were selected according to extent of viable tissue determined by PET (group B) in addition to clinical presentation and angiographic data.There were four in-hospital deaths (11.4%) in group A and none in group B (p = 0.04). After 12 months, the survival rate was 79% in group A and 97% in group B (p = 0.01). Postoperatively, group B patients had a less complicated recovery (p = 0.05). They required lower doses of catecholamines (p = 0.002) and demonstrated a significantly decreased incidence of low output syndrome (p = 0.05).This retrospective data analysis suggests that selection of patients with impaired LV function on the basis of extent of viability supplementary to clinical and angiographic data may lead to postoperative recovery with a low early mortality and promising short-term survival. Therefore, viability studies permit selection of patients who are at low risk for serious perioperative complications.
