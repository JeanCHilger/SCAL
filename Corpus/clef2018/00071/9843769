Modulation of cholinergic neuromuscular transmission by nitric oxide in canine colonic circular smooth muscle. This study examines the effect of nitric oxide (NO) on cholinergic transmission in strips of canine colonic circular muscle in which neural plexus-pacemaker regions had been removed. Electrical field stimulation gave rise to atropine- and TTX-sensitive excitatory junction potentials (EJPs), the amplitude of which were frequency dependent. In 47% of control muscles, the EJP was followed by an inhibitory junction potential (IJP), whereas in the presence of atropine all preparations exhibited only IJPs. The NO synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]-oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]-quinoxaline-1-one (ODQ), and the protein kinase G (PKG) antagonist Rp-8-bromo-PET-cGMPS all significantly increased EJP amplitude and reduced or abolished IJPs. The potentiation of EJPs by L-NNA was reversed by the NO donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine in a manner blocked by ODQ. [14C]ACh overflow was also measured to evaluate the possible prejunctional effects of NO. Both norepinephrine and TTX significantly decreased [14C]ACh overflow however, L-NNA, ODQ, and SNP were without effect. These data suggest that both cholinergic and nitrergic motoneurons functionally innervate the interior of the circular muscle layer. The inhibitory actions of NO on cholinergic transmission appear to be post- rather than prejunctional and to involve guanylyl cyclase as well as possibly PKG.
