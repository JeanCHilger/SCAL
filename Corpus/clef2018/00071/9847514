The compensation method for the effects of system resolution to the left ventricular volume measurements using QGS program. We evaluated the accuracy of left ventricular volume calculations performed using the left ventricular function automatic analysis software (QGS program), which automatically extracts the left ventricular profile from ECG-gated myocardial SPECT data and then measures the left ventricular volume. We used a myocardial phantom for this evaluation. The results of our experiments showed that the left ventricular volume was underestimated by up to 13% as the SPECT spatial resolution deteriorated. To overcome this problem, we have developed a method for correcting the left ventricular volume measured by the QGS program according to the SPECT spatial resolution of the detectors. This new correction method permits the left ventricular volume of the phantom to be calculated with an error of less than 1.4%.
