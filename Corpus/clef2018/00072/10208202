FDG SPECT in patients with lung masses. To determine whether 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) single-photon emission CT (SPECT) is useful in characterizing pulmonary masses.Scans were prospectively acquired and interpreted. Interpretations were performed with CT or chest radiograph but interpreters were blinded to eventual diagnosis.University hospital practice and affiliated Veterans Administration medical center.Forty patients participated as part of an institutional review board-approved research protocol, and informed consent was obtained in all. Eight additional patient scans were acquired as part of their clinical evaluation for pulmonary mass.There were 26 malignant lesions (12 were 1 to 2 cm in size, the rest were larger) and 17 benign lesions (3 were < 1 cm in size, 9 were 1 to 2 cm in size, and 5 were larger). Averaged sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were, respectively, 50% (12 of 24), 94% (17 of 18), 92% (12 of 13), and 59% (17 of 29) for lesions 1 to 2 cm in size, 100% (28 of 28), 90% (9 of 10), 97% (28 of 29), and 100% (9 of 9) for lesions > 2 cm in size. There was good correlation between readers (p < 0.0001).FDG SPECT is useful in characterizing pulmonary masses > 2 cm in size and appears to be equivalent to positron emission tomography for these lesions. Although currently clinically suboptimal for characterizing lesions < or = 2 cm in size, FDG SPECT appears to be better than current anatomic imaging methods. In addition, the positive predictive value of FDG SPECT for small lesions is also high (92%), and this technique appears potentially useful in the subset of patients in whom a positive result would alter clinical diagnostic pathways or care.
