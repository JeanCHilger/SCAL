Improved renal cortical SPECT of neonates and young infants using narrow imaging pallets. The widths of most commercially-made imaging pallets limit the resolution of 99mTc DMSA SPECT imaging in neonates and young infants. We constructed a pediatric imaging pallet for 99mTc DMSA SPECT of neonates and young infants designed to allow close apposition of the camera to these patients during the entire orbit.We designed the imaging pallet to replace the standard removable pallet on the imaging stand of a commercial gamma camera. The device consisted of two parts: a steel bracket attached to the imaging stand and a polyvinyl chloride imaging pallet. The imaging pallet consisted of interchangeable 15.24-cm (6-in) or 20.32-cm (8-in) diameter, 6.35-mm (1/4-in) thick polyvinyl chloride plumbing pipes cut in half lengthwise.The pallets were mechanically stable with loads 3 times that expected in clinical practice. Attenuation was acceptable and comparable to commercial pallets. The hemicylindrical shape provided side support and reduced patient motion, as well as allowing closer apposition of the camera head to the patient. The quality of these 99mTc DMSA SPECT images compared favorably with those obtainable in older children and adults. Specifically, the renal cortices were well delineated from the collecting systems and anatomic detail of normal cortex could be readily distinguished from abnormal cortex.Custom pediatric imaging pallets optimized for use in neonates and small children can be constructed inexpensively. These pallets are easy to use and are stable. Use of these pallets can optimize 99mTc DMSA SPECT images of neonates and young infants.
