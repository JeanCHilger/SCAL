The contribution of brain imaging in acute psychotic disorders. In recent years research on the neuronal substrate for mental disorders has considerably developed thanks to new brain imaging methods. Functional brain imaging has attracted several workers in their investigations of psychiatric diseases. Some authors have addressed the position of imaging in the diagnosis and, above all, prognosis of acute psychotic disorders. In the following paper, the authors review the published results. Both structural and functional imaging confirm the hypothesis of a neurophysiological contribution to acute psychotic disorders, as shown by ventricular dilatation and functional abnormalities. Nonetheless, imaging does not seem to have a precise and absolute diagnostic and prognostic value, although of undeniable heuristic interest.
