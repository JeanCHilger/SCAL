Nickel-Assisted Carbon-Fluorine Bond Activation of 2,4,6-Trifluoropyrimidine: Synthesis of New Pyrimidine and Pyrimidinone Derivatives. Rapid and regioselective activation of the C-F bond of 2,4,6-trifluoropyrimidine occurs on reaction with [Ni(cod)(2)] (cod=1,5-cyclooctadiene) in the presence of PEt(3) to give 1, which can be converted into complex 2, containing a further N(3)-metalated pyrimidin-4-one unit. The novel pyrimidin-4-one 3 is released on protonation of 2.
