Physics and instrumentation for imaging in-vivo drug distribution. Several imaging methods are currently available to measure drugs noninvasively. Of these, two techniques are today central to such measurements: nuclear imaging and magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy (MRI and MRS). While other methods, such as optical techniques, are rapidly gaining in interest, they have not yet attained the degree of development that makes them effective in measuring drugs in living systems, except in a small number of examples. The following introduction provides some basic elements of the potential and the limitations of both nuclear imaging and MRI/MRS techniques, methods that will be used in the studies described in the articles in this issue. However, and for those desiring to gain a better understanding of both methods, the reader is advised to consult much more extensive reviews and books describing such methods. A suggested list of books and articles on Nuclear Imaging and MRI/MRS is given.
