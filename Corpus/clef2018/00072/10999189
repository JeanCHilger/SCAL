Radiotracers and analytical approaches in positron and single-photon emission tomography. Important advances in PET and SPECT imaging of neurochemistry have permitted direct investigation of neurologic diseases and syndromes, including many associated with seizures and epilepsy. Insights into issues of development and evolution of epileptogenic changes, mechanisms of seizure propagation, and mechanisms underlying therapeutic interventions will be increasingly gained from direct clinical study, rather than from experimental animal models, with the increasing application of this imaging technology.
