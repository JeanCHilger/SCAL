Sensorimotor organization in patients who have undergone hemispherectomy: a study with (15)O-water PET and somatosensory evoked potentials. To identify cortical structures that subserve residual motor and sensory function in patients with congenital hemiparesis due to a porencephalic cyst, we examined, using [(15)O]H2O, PET and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in three patients with left-sided hemiparesis who had undergone hemispherectomy. Motor stimulation of the affected hand produced ipsilateral activation in the premotor area in all patients, the SMA in two patients, and SII in two patients. Vibrotactile stimulation resulted in activation of the ipsilateral SII in all subjects. Median nerve stimulation of the affected hand produced ipsilateral long-latency SEPs in fronto-centro-parietal areas, whereas stimulation of the non-affected hand produced normal early cortical potentials in the contralateral hemisphere. Our results suggest that residual function in the paretic hand is warranted through non-primary motor and sensory areas, and higher order associative areas in the intact hemisphere.
