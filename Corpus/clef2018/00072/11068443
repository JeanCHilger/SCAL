Clinical criteria for the diagnosis for PSP. In attempts to improve the accuracy of its clinical identification, investigators have proposed numerous diagnostic criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy(PSP). We compared with six different sets of previously published criteria for the clinical diagnosis of PSP. Among of them, the NINDS-SPSP criteria are a most prominent diagnostic standard. But in the clinical area, the NINDS-SPSP criteria have some weak point. We plan to make up this point for using the neuroimaging techniques.
