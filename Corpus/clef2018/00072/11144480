Dobutamine technetium-99m tetrofosmin SPECT imaging for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease in patients with limited exercise capacity. Technetium-99m tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging is increasingly used in conjunction with exercise and vasodilator stress test as a means of evaluating coronary artery disease (CAD). Dobutamine stress test is an alternative in patients with limited exercise capacity. This study assessed the accuracy of dobutamine-atropine stress tetrofosmin SPECT as a means of diagnosing and localizing CAD.We studied 124 patients (mean age, 57+/-12 years 88 men) with limited exercise capacity and suspected CAD with dobutamine (as much as 40 microg/kg/min)-atropine (as much as 1 mg) Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT. Resting images were acquired 24 hours after the stress test. Significant CAD was defined as 50% or greater luminal diameter stenosis in 1 or more major coronary arteries. Myocardial perfusion abnormalities (fixed and/or reversible defects) were detected in 70 of 88 patients with CAD and in 10 of the 36 patients without CAD (sensitivity = 80%, CI, 72 to 87Dobutamine stress Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT is a useful method for the diagnosis and localization of CAD in patients with limited exercise capacity. Optimal accuracy of the technique is achieved by using both fixed and reversible perfusion abnormalities for the diagnosis of CAD in patients without an earlier myocardial infarction.
