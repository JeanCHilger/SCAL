Tracer kinetic modeling in nuclear cardiology. The introduction of tracer kinetic modeling techniques in conjunction with nuclear imaging has allowed the assessment of physiologic processes in the myocardium in a noninvasive and quantitative manner. Alongside the development of novel radiopharmaceuticals for both positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography is the clarification of their pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and modeling strategies for assessment of physiologic rates from imaging data. Image analysis and tracer kinetic modeling techniques used in nuclear cardiology must address unique considerations related to the heart. The most commonly used tracers and modeling techniques are presently discussed, with particular attention given to methods that allow absolute quantitation of physiologic processes. The applications of these techniques are obvious in research protocols and may find more use in future clinical studies.
