Radiolabeled cholinesterase substrates: in vitro methods for determining structure-activity relationships and identification of a positron emission tomography radiopharmaceutical for in vivo measurement of butyrylcholinesterase activity. There is currently great interest in developing radiolabeled substrates for acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase that would be useful in the in vivo imaging of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Using a simple in vitro spectrophotometric assay for determination of enzymatic cleavage rates, the structure-activity relationship for a short series of 1-methyl-4-piperidinyl esters was investigated. Relative enzymatic hydrolysis rates for the well-characterized 1-methyl-4-piperidinyl acetate, propionate, and i-butyrate esters were in agreement with literature values. The 4 and 5 carbon esters of 1-methyl-4-piperidinol were specific for butyrylcholinesterase and cleaved in the rank order n-valerate > n-butyrate > 2-methylbutyrate, iso-valerate. These spectrophotometric results were also in agreement with in vitro hydrolysis rates in mouse blood and with in vivo regional retention of radioactivity in mouse brain of 11C-labeled analogs. Brain uptake and apparent enzymatic rate constants for 1-[11C]methyl-4-piperidinyl n-butyrate and n-valerate were calculated from in vivo measurements in M. nemistrina using positron emission tomography. Based on higher brain uptake of radioactivity and superior pharmacokinetics, 1-[11C]methyl-4-piperidinyl n-butyrate was identified as a new radiopharmaceutical for the in vivo measurement of butyrylcholinesterase activity.
