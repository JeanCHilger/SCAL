Clinical impact of arrhythmias on gated SPECT cardiac myocardial perfusion and function assessment. We reported previously that mean quantified cardiac functional parameters computed by one gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) technique were not significantly altered by common gating errors. However, it is not known to what extent other gated SPECT approaches that are based on different ventricular modeling assumptions are influenced by arrhythmias, nor are the effects of gating errors on visual analyses and their subsequent clinical implications known.Projection data for 50 patients (aged 64 +/- 12 years 68% menAlthough mean functional parameters were scarcely altered, paired t tests showed ejection fraction fluctuations to be significantly different from control values, causing patients to change between abnormal and normal ejection fraction categories (2% of patients by QGS and 14% by Emory Cardiac Toolbox). Visual examination of QGS polar perfusion and function maps showed changes for 72% of cases, although in only 4% were these considered to have potential clinical consequences. The kappa statistic for visual analysis of concordance between control and arrhythmia readings showed that agreement was "excellent" for perfusion, "good" for motion, and "marginal" for thickening.As with quantitative measurements, thickening is the parameter most prone to error in the presence of arrhythmias. It is important to test data for gating errors to avoid potentially erroneous measurements and visual readings.
