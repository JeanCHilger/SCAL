Language and brain: what is up? What is coming up? The classical aphasiological model of brain/language relationships is nowadays complemented by independent results from functional neuroimaging studies using techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or Event-Related Electro-Encephalography and Magneto-Encephalography mapping. Although brain mapping of language is still hampered by many methodological pitfalls, these methods now appear reliable and provide a renewed description of the temporal spatial dynamics of neural ensembles subserving language functions. Moreover, neuroimaging techniques should also shed a new light on remaining difficult issues such as neural and functional plasticity in developmental or post-lesional contexts.
