Restless Legs Syndrome. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a well-defined symptom complex and is frequently associated with sleep disturbance and a recognized family history. It occurs either as idiopathic RLS or in association with many medical, neurological or vascular disorders. The neurological examination and routine investigations in idiopathic RLS are normal. Polysomnography supports the diagnosis of RLS by documenting the associated sleep disturbances and periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). Although MRI studies disclose no intracerebral lesions, recent Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies point to some involvement of the basal and red nuclei and the cerebellum. No definitive etiology is known for this condition, but several pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed. There is supportive evidence that RLS is a Central Nervous System (CNS) dysfunction, suggesting widespread involvement of the descending dopaminergic (DA) pathways, possibly originating in the diencephalon or upper brainstem. This is corroborated by the successful treatment of RLS with DA agents, sedatives, and neurotransmitters. However, RLS can also occur with spinal disorders and spinal cord lesions implying the existence of a spinal generator. The incidence of RLS in pregnancy is well known and its association with vascular disorders supports another mechanism in some patients. The primary treatment of RLS is largely symptomatic and quite effective with DA agents, DA agonists, opioids and other neurotransmitters. The treatment of RLS associated with various diseases is aimed at the correction of the underlying pathological or deficiency states. Antidepressant medications frequently precipitate or worsen the condition of RLS.
