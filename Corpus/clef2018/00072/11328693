Relation between 1H MR spectroscopic imaging and regional cerebral glucose metabolism in Alzheimer's disease. 1 H Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and positron emission tomography (PET) of (18) F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) were performed in 18 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 3 normal controls. We measured the distribution and relative signal intensities of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA a presumed neuronal marker), choline residues (Cho) representing cellular membrane compounds and of creatine-containing metabolites (Cr), and correlated these to regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMRGI) after coregistration of both imaging-techniques. The pattern of choline was significantly different between AD and normals (p < 0.01). RCMRGI was significantly related to Cho/Cr (r=-0.21, p<.05) and NAA/Cho quotients (r=0.35, p<.001). Our results suggest that in AD reduced neuronal energy performance and membrane abnormalities contribute to metabolic deterioration.
