Cerebral blood-flow changes induced by paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to assess changes in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) induced by paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of primary motor cortex (M1). The study was performed in eight normal volunteers using two Magstim-200 stimulators linked with a Bistim module. A circular TMS coil was held in the scanner by a mechanical arm and located over the left M1. Surface electrodes were used to record motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI). Cortical excitability was evaluated in the relaxed FDI using a paired conditioning-test stimulus paradigm with two interstimulus intervals (ISIs): 3 and 12 ms. The subjects were scanned three times during each of the following four conditions: 1) baseline with no TMS (BASE) 2) single-pulse TMS (TMSsing)
