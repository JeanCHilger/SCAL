Functional imaging before pulmonary resection. The evaluation of patients before lung resections requires functional imaging. We review the current role of functional imaging in the preoperative evaluation of candidates for lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) and lung cancer resection. Perfusion and ventilation lung scintigraphy methods as well as computed tomography techniques used to predict postoperative lung function are presented. The areas of current investigation are also described.
