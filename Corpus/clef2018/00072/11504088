Comparison of 99mTc-sestamibi lung/heart ratio, transient ischaemic dilation and perfusion defect size for the identification of severe and extensive coronary artery disease. The ability to identify patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) by analysis of perfusion defects is limited. The lung/heart ratio (LHR) and transient ischaemic dilatation (TID) have been used for this purpose in thallium-201 scintigraphy. The value of these parameters in technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission tomography (SPET) imaging is controversial. In this study, therefore, we determined TID and LHR in a single-day rest/stress 99mTc-sestamibi SPET perfusion protocol and compared these measurements with perfusion defect size (PDS) and angiographic severity of CAD. Severe CAD was defined as >75% left main coronary stenosis and/or >90% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis and/or >90% proximal stenosis in the left circumflex and right coronary arteries. LHR was determined from a stress anterior planar image recorded < or =6 min after exercise. TID ratio was derived from automatically calculated left ventricular rest/stress volumes, and PDS was measured based on semi-automated computer software (CEqual). Diagnostic accuracy and predictive values were compared between 22 patients with severe and 98 patients without severe CAD. LHRs showed a higher sensitivity (73%) for the assessment of severe CAD as compared to PDS and TID ratio (41% and 23% respectively, P<0.01), whereas specificity was highest for TID ratio [95%, P<0.01 when compared to PDS (84%) and LHR (82%)]. It is concluded that increased LHR in 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging seems to yield good diagnostic accuracy in the detection of patients with severe CAD and may be derived from a single-day rest/stress study.
