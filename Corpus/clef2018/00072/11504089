Effects of ageing on serotonin transporters in healthy females. The effect of ageing on brain serotonin transporters was evaluated in 19 healthy female volunteers (age range 22-74 years) using single-photon emission tomography and [123I]nor-beta-CIT. The study subjects were scanned 0.3, 3, 6 and 23 h after injection of 185 MBq of [123I]nor-beta-CIT. The ratio of the distribution volume for tracer in the midbrain to that in the cerebellum minus 1 was used as an index for serotonin transporter binding. An age-related decline of 2% per decade (r=-0.47 P<0.05) was found in the midbrain. The decline in [123I]nor-beta-CIT binding in the serotonin transporter-rich area is much less than that in dopamine transporters in the striatum (6% per decade).
