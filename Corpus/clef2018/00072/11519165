Brain imaging in depression. Structural brain imaging studies in major depression have revealed decreased hippocampal volume, decreased frontal lobe volume, decreased basal ganglia volume and increased subcortical hyperintensity lesions(SCH). Decreased hippocampal volume is thought to be related to hypercortisolemia. SCH is related to poor treatment response and clinical symptoms, thus has some value in clinical decision making. Functional brain imaging studies suggested decreased blood flow and metabolism in the frontal lobes and basal ganglia by positron emission tomography and single photon emission tomography, decreased adenosine triphosphate measured by 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy(MRS) in the frontal lobes and basal ganglia, and increased choline containing compounds observed by proton MRS.
