Syntheses, Structures, FAB Mass Spectra, and Magnetic Properties of Chromium Chalcogenide Cluster Complexes [Cr(6)Se(8)(PEt(3))(6)], [Cr(6)Se(8)(H)(PEt(3))(6)], and [Cr(6)S(8)(H)(PEt(3))(6)]. Chromium selenide cluster complexes [Cr(6)Se(8)(PEt(3))(6)] (1) and [Cr(6)Se(8)(H)(PEt(3))(6)] (2) were prepared by the reaction of anhydrous chromium dichloride, Na(2)Se(x)(), and triethylphosphine in methanol. A similar procedure except for the use of NaS(x)()H in place of Na(2)Se(x)() gave a sulfide cluster complex [Cr(6)S(8)(H)(PEt(3))(6)] (3). The partly deuterated derivative [Cr(6)S(8)(D)(0.8)(H)(0.2)(PEt(3))(6)] (4) was prepared for comparison. An extra hydrogen atom in 2-4 has been confirmed by FAB mass spectra. The reactivity and structural studies have indicated that it is at the center of the Cr(6) octahedral cluster. The molecular structures of 1 and 2 have been determined by X-ray structure analyses.
