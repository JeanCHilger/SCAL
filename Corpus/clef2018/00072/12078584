Predictive features of positron emission tomography after two cycles of induction therapy in malignant lymphoma. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a modern functional imaging method, recently introduced to clinical oncology. The aim of our study was the evaluation of prognostic value of PET performed in malignant lymphoma patients after two cycles of chemotherapy.From 9/99 to 11/00 PET was performed in 37 patients with malignant lymphoma (9x m. Hodgkin, 21x HG + IG-NHL, 7x LG-NHL 26x new diagnosis, 11x relaps of disease). Freedom from progression interval (FFP) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Attenuation corrected PET imaging was done by dedicated ECAT EXACT PET scanner from base of the skull to the upper thighs 1 hour after intravenous administration of 18-FDG (7.6 +/- 1.3 MBq/kg). Statistical analysis was done using Kaplan-Meier method. Significance of differences between groups was determined by log-rank test on the level of 5%. After the induction therapy, 30 patients were in complete remission, 3 patients in partial remission and in 4 cases progression of disease were observed. Progression of disease was seen in 4 patients. Median follow up of living patients was 7 months (1-13 months) from the end of therapy. Progression, resp. relapse of disease occurred in 13 patients during this period, two patients died. PET performed after the second course of therapy was positive in 18 patients and negative in 19 patients. Two progressions, resp. relapses of disease were documented in PET-negative group and 11 in PET-positive group. FFP was significantly different in PET positive and PET negative groups (p < 0.05). The negative and positive predictive values of PET for malignant lymphoma relapse or progression were estimated 89%, 63% respectively.Regardless the short follow-up period, our preliminary results reflect very good prognostic value of PET performed after the second course of chemotherapy in malignant lymphoma patients.
