Functional scintigraphy of the adrenal gland. Over the last 30 years nuclear medicine imaging of the adrenal gland and its lesions has been achieved by the exploitation of a number of physiological characteristics of this organ. By seeking and utilising features which are quantitatively or qualitatively different from those of the adjacent tissues, functional depiction of the adrenal gland and its diseases, which in most cases retain the basic physiology of their tissue of origin, including both the cortex and the medulla, are now a useful clinical reality. Agents widely used in clinical practice include: (a) uptake and storage of radiolabelled cholesterol analogues via the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and cholesterol ester storage pool in the adrenal cortex ((131)I-6-beta-iodomethyl-norcholesterol, (75)Se-selenomethyl-norcholesterol) (b) catecholamine type I, presynaptic, uptake mechanism and intracellular granule uptake and storage mechanism in the adrenal medulla and extra-adrenal paraganglia ((131)I-, (123)I- and (124)I-meta-iodo-benzyl-guanidine (MIBG), (18)F-metafluoro-benzyl-guanidine)
