Dual time point 18F-FDG PET for the evaluation of pulmonary nodules. 18F-FDG PET has reached widespread application in the assessment of pulmonary nodules. This study compares the diagnostic accuracy of standard 18F-FDG PET scanning with those of dual time point 18F-FDG PET scanning.Thirty-six patients (21 women, 15 men mean age, 67 ySurgical pathology and follow-up revealed 19 patients with 20 malignant tumors, whereas 16 patients had benign lesions. The tumor SUVs (mean +/- SD) were 3.66 +/- 1.95 (scan 1) and 4.43 +/- 2.43 (scan 2) (20.5% +/- 8.1% increase P < 0.01). Four of 20 malignant tumors had SUVs of <2.5 on scan 1 (range, 1.12-1.69). Benign lesions had SUVs of 1.14 +/- 0.64 (scan 1) and 1.11 +/- 0.70 (scan 2) (P = not significant). Standard PET scanning (single time point) with a threshold SUV of 2.5 (at time point 1) reached a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 94%Dual time point 18F-FDG PET results in a very high sensitivity and specificity for detection of malignant lung tumors.
