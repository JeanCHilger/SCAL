Detection of neuroendocrine tumors: 99mTc-P829 scintigraphy compared with 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of a new somatostatin analog, 99mTc-P829, compared with that of 111In-pentetreotide.Forty-three patients (32 men, 11 women age range, 24-78 y111In-Pentetreotide detected 203 tumoral sites in 39 (91%) of 43 patients, whereas 99mTc-P829 detected 77 sites in 28 (65%) of 43 patients (P < 0.005). In the liver, 129 sites (in 24 patients) were detected by 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy and 34 sites (in 10 patients) were detected by 99mTc-P829 scintigraphy.In patients with endocrine tumors, the detection rate of 99mTc-P829 scintigraphy was lower than that of 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy, which appeared to be more sensitive, especially for liver metastases.
