123I]beta-CIT SPECT distinguishes vascular parkinsonism from Parkinson's diseas. We investigated whether [(123)I]-beta-CIT and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging distinguishes patients with clinically suspected vascular parkinsonism (VP) from patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). [(123)I]beta-CIT SPECT is a sensitive marker of dopaminergic degeneration, and the degree of striatal binding reduction in PD correlates with disease severity. Thirteen patients who fulfilled rigid clinical criteria for VP (mean +/- S.D.: age, 76.5 +/- 5.3 years disease duration, 3.6 +/- 2.8 years), 20 PD patients (age, 66.2 +/- 9.5 years
