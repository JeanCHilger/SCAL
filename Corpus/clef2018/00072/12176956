Clinical determinants of ventricular sympathetic reinnervation after orthotopic heart transplantation. It has been demonstrated that ventricular sympathetic reinnervation after cardiac transplantation improves exercise performance. The extent of reinnervation increases with time but is variable. Little is known about other influencing factors.Seventy-seven nonrejecting transplant recipients were cross-sectionally studied by PET with the catecholamine analogue C-11 hydroxyephedrine at 4.8+/-3.5 years after transplantation. Results were compared with history-derived parameters related to recipient's clinical course before, during, and after surgery donor characteristicsThe present data suggest that sympathetic reinnervation after cardiac transplantation is not simply a function of time. Reinnervation is more likely with young age, fast and uncomplicated surgery, and low rejection frequency. Despite few effects on prognosis in otherwise healthy recipients, improved understanding of clinical determinants may contribute to enhance allograft reinnervation and thereby augment exercise capacity in the future.
