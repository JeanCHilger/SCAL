67Gallium whole body scintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT) in sarcoidosis. 67Gallium scintigraphy has been used for years in sarcoidosis as a makers of activity, a determiner of the extent and distribution of the disease and an aid in therapeutic management. However, it is currently used mainly to assist in diagnosis in difficult cases, particularly in those with isolated extrathoracic sarcoidosis. The finding of the typical lambda or panda sign supports the diagnosis and reinforces the indication to perform an appropriate biopsy. In addition, the detection of clinical silent extrathoracic uptake may provide sites for biopsy. The importance of gallium scintigraphy lies in the possibility of whole-body screening for inflammation localizations, particularly when physical, laboratory, lung function and radiographic examinations fail to provide convincing evidence of active sarcoidosis. Furthermore, it can be helpful in the follow-up of the effect of supportive treatment. 18F-FDG PET is based on the increase of glucose metabolism in inflamed tissues. It may have great potential to assess sarcoidosis activity, but it is still largely experimental and is not routinely employed.
