Neuropharmacology and receptor studies in the elderly. Functional brain imaging has provided unique and exciting opportunities to strengthen our knowledge of the biological substrate of the aging brain and neuropsychiatric disorders. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a particularly powerful tool for quantifying the neurobiological correlates of cognition, mood and behavior. Initial PET studies of aging, psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative disease focused primarily on generalized physiological parameters such as cerebral blood flow and metabolism, and early neuroreceptor imaging studies relied on relatively non selective markers. New, selective receptor radioligands now offer a previously inaccessible means to investigate the dynamic relationships among neurochemistry, aging and psychopathology in vivo. This approach has substantial advantages over peripheral (platelet and cerebrospinal fluid) markers, neuroendocrine challenge studies, animal models, and postmortem receptor binding assays. Advances in tracer kinetic modeling, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to PET registration, radiochemistry techniques, instrumentation and image processing have helped pave the way for increased emphasis on functional imaging studies of neuropsychiatric disorders of the elderly. The capability to correct PET image data for the confounding effect of cerebral atrophy permits relationships among age related brain changes and neurobiological disease mechanisms to be more accurately examined in the course of normal aging and in elderly patient populations.
