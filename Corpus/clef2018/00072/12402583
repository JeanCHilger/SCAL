Differences in peritoneal equilibration test results in patients aged above or below 60 years. Peritoneal permeability, evaluated using the peritoneal equilibration test (PET), indicates that, in an adult population not selected for age, an increase in the transport rate of small solutes usually occurs in the course of peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment. We evaluated the dialysate-to-plasma ratio of urea (D/P urea), the D/P creatinine, the ratio of dialysate glucose at a designated dwell time to dialysate glucose at 0 dwell time (D/D0 glucose), and the mass transfer-area coefficients (KBDs) of those solutes in PETs performed in patients aged above or below 60 years who were matched for sex, PD duration, and outcome. The single-center, retrospective study was carried out in a peritoneal dialysis unit in a university hospital. Two groups of PD patients were chosen. Mean age of patients in group I (n = 21 9 women, 12 men) was 67.7 +/- 4.5 years
