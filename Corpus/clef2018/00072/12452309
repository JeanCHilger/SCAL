Exercise and rest technetium-99m-tetrofosmin lung uptake: correlation with left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with coronary artery disease. Increased lung uptake of thallium-201 (Tl-201) and technetium-99m (Tc-99m) MIBI in myocardial perfusion imaging is a reliable marker of left ventricular dysfunction. The goal of our study was to establish whether the lung-to-heart (L/H) uptake ratio with a newer cardiac imaging agent, Tc-99m tetrofosmin, can also provide valuable information about left ventricular function. We studied 60 patients with recent coronary artery diseases (CAD) undergoing first-pass radionuclide ventriculography to calculate left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and myocardial perfusion imaging to calculate the L/H ratio. Group A consisting of 30 CAD patients with higher LVEF (> or =40%) had a significantly lower L/H ratio than group B consisting of 30 CAD patients with abnormal LVEF (<40%) during exercise and rest. In groups A and B, the exercise and rest L/H ratios did not differ significantly. However, a statistically significant inverse correlation was found between the L/H ratio and LVEF during exercise and rest among the 60 patients. L/H ratios, measured by 99mTc-tetrofosmin imaging, provide clinically useful information with which to predict left ventricular dysfunction in CAD patients.
