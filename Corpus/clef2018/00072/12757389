Synthesis and biological evaluation of halogenated naphthyridone carboxamides as potential ligands for in vivo imaging studies of substance P receptors. With the aim of developing new radioligands for in vivo studies of substance P receptors using positron emission tomography or single photon emission computed tomography, 2- and 3-halo naphthyridone-6-carboxamide derivatives were synthesized. Their affinities toward the target receptors were evaluated on CHO cells and compared to the unsubstituted analogue EP 00652218 (IC(50) = 100 nM +/- 20). The IC(50) value was not altered in the case of 2-chloro compound 1 (IC(50) = 100 nM +/- 15) and only slightly reduced for the 2-fluoro and -iodo analogues 6 and 8 (IC(50) = 500 nM +/- 80). A drastic reduction in binding (IC(50) > 1000 nM) was observed for the halogenated compounds 2-5, 7, and 9.
