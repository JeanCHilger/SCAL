Effect of bisphosphonate treatment in patients with Paget's disease of the skull. Hearing loss has long been known to be a complication of Paget's disease of bone. The aim of this study was to investigate Paget's disease of the temporal bone with special attention to hearing loss.Twenty-five patients with skull involvement were treated with either pamidronate or tiludronate. Imaging included radiography, quantitative bone scintigraphy (QBS), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and high-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) scanning. Audiometric assessment was also performed.Twenty-three of the 25 patients with skull involvement suffered from hearing loss. Bisphosphonate treatment resulted in a decreased serum total alkaline phosphatase (serum tAP) level and QBS ratio, and also seemed to improve the complaints of the patients. HRCT demonstrated involvement of the middle ear ossicles (n = 7), involvement of the petrous pyramids (n = 14), demineralization of the otic capsule (n = 10), porosis pericochlearis (n = 8), narrowing of the external auditory meatus (n = 12), mastoid process thickening (n = 5) and stapedial footplate thickening (n = 4). The audiometric examination did not show any significant changes 1 yr after bisphosphonate treatment.HRCT imaging is a well suited tool for demonstrating the complication of Paget's disease. QBS and measurement of serum tAP level may also be regarded as useful techniques for monitoring treatment. However, hearing may remain impaired in spite of the improved scintigraphy and laboratory parameters, therefore, audiometric assessment is also important in pagetic patients with skull involvement.
