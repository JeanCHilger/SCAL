Mild traumatic brain injury and its psychiatric assessment. Mild traumatic brain injuries without circumscripted necrotic areas in brain tissue were called concussion in classic terminology. It was generally assumed, that such lesions were to heal without any residues. This notion can not be upheld completely any longer, since according to today's state of knowledge on the pathogenesis of brain trauma, chronic troubles and impairments may occur even after mild traumatic brain injuries. Besides, a number of psychosocial stress factors making it more difficult to cope with the posttraumatic disturbances and the new challenging life situation, play a marked role as to the outcome. In mild brain injuries, these environmental factors as well as a general lack of internal resources may be even more crucial than the trauma's severity by itself.
