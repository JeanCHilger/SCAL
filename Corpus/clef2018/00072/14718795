FDG-PET for evaluation of recurrent lymph node metastases in patients with surgically resected breast cancer: adding spot images to whole body images. To evaluate the role of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), spot images were added to whole-body FDG-PET images in a patient with suspected lymph node recurrence of breast cancer.FDG-PET spot images were obtained of 44 patients who had undergone surgical resection of breast cancer as were whole-body FDG-PET images. A total of 33 lesions in 19 patients (mean age, 59 years range, 39-70 years) were diagnosed as lymph node recurrence clinically, and standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated for whole body images and spot images. Lesions were also scored from 1 (not clear) to 3 (very clear) for both the whole body and spot images.For mediastinal lymph node metastases, the SUVs of the spot images (SUVsp) (mean, 4.0 range, 2.1-6.6) were significantly higher than the SUVs of the whole body images (SUVwb) (mean, 3.3By adding spot images, the evaluation of lymph node metastases became easier. Adding spot images to whole-body FDG-PET may be useful.
