Influence of increased 201Tl lung uptake on the myocardial viability of the patients with dilated cardiomyopathy under congestive heart failure. Influence of increased 201Tl lung uptake on the myocardial viability was studied in 15 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy under congestive heart failure. Rest and 4 hours delayed 201Tl SPECT were obtained. At the same time anterior planar images were collected. In 10 patients of 15 patients 201Tl lung heart ratio in SPECT (LHR) was larger than that in planar images. Maximal 201Tl lung uptake was noted at the lower left lung adjacent to the heart. In the delayed images 201Tl lung uptake diminished. In 10 patients the value of LHR in the delayed images was less than 0.5. By comparing initial images with delayed images it was proved to be difficult to determine the myocardial margin adjacent to the increased 201Tl lung uptake. In 2 patients lateral defects were concealed by the increased 201Tl lung uptake. In the remaining patients lateral wall was similar to the hypertrophic myocardium. The effect of scatter due to the increased 201Tl lung uptake was noted in the neighboring myocardium. In most cases %201Tl uptake in the septum was relatively depressed by increased %201Tl uptake in the lateral wall. In the delayed images pseudo-redistribution was noted in the septum. Mean value of differences in %201Tl uptake between initial and delayed images was 8 (2-15)%. It was concluded that in case of increased 201Tl lung uptake SPECT could not accurately estimate myocardial viability by initial images and delayed images were necessary for precise estimation.
