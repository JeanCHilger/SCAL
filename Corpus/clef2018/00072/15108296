Comparison of simultaneously recorded [H2(15)O]-PET and LORETA during cognitive and pharmacological activation. The complementary strengths and weaknesses of established functional brain imaging methods (high spatial, low temporal resolution) and EEG-based techniques (low spatial, high temporal resolution) make their combined use a promising avenue for studying brain processes at a more fine-grained level. However, this strategy requires a better understanding of the relationship between hemodynamic/metabolic and neuroelectric measures of brain activity. We investigated possible correspondences between cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured by [H2O]-PET and intracerebral electric activity computed by Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) from scalp-recorded multichannel EEG in healthy human subjects during cognitive and pharmacological stimulation. The two imaging modalities were compared by descriptive, correlational, and variance analyses, the latter carried out using statistical parametric mapping (SPM99). Descriptive visual comparison showed a partial overlap between the sets of active brain regions detected by the two modalities. A number of exclusively positive correlations of neuroelectric activity with regional CBF were found across the whole EEG frequency range, including slow wave activity, the latter finding being in contrast to most previous studies conducted in patients. Analysis of variance revealed an extensive lack of statistically significant correspondences between brain activity changes as measured by PET vs. EEG-LORETA. In general, correspondences, to the extent they were found, were dependent on experimental condition, brain region, and EEG frequency.
