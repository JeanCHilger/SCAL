Airborne cat allergen reduction in classrooms that use special school clothing or ban pet ownership. Allergens from furred animals are brought to school mainly via clothing of pet owners. Asthmatic children allergic to cat have more symptoms when attending a class with many cat owners, and some schools allocate specific resources to allergen avoidance measures.The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of school clothing or pet owner-free classes compared with control classes on airborne cat allergen levels and to investigate attitudes and allergic symptoms among the children.Allergen measurements were performed prospectively in 2 classes with school clothing, 1 class of children who were not pet owners, and 3 control classes during a 6-week period in 2 consecutive years. Portable pumps and petri dishes were used for collection of airborne cat allergen, and a roller was used for sampling on children's clothes. Cat allergen (Fel d 1) was analyzed with enzyme-linked immunoassay and immunostaining. Both years, questionnaires were administered to the children.We found 4-fold to 6-fold lower airborne cat allergen levels in intervention classes compared with control classes. Levels of cat allergen were 3-fold higher on clothing of cat owners than of children without cats in control classes. Pet ownership ban seemed less accepted than school clothing as an intervention measure.For the first time, it has been shown that levels of airborne cat allergen can be reduced by allergen avoidance measures at school by using school clothing or pet ownership ban, and that both measures are equally efficient. The clinical effect of these interventions remains to be evaluated.
