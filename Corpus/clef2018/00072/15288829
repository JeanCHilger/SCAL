Radioimmunodetection and radioimmunotherapy of head and neck cancer. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) can add a dimension to diagnostic imaging and staging of metastatic head and neck cancer, as well as in eradication of this disease. The vast majority of malignancies arising in the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx are squamous cell carcinomas. This common cellular origin makes it attractive to search for appropriate tumor-associated antigens, which are preferentially expressed in these neoplasms. Radiolabeled MAbs directed against these antigens can be used for tumor detection and selective therapy, known as radioimmunoscintigraphy and radioimmunotherapy, respectively. The combination of MAbs with positron emission tomography (PET) is an attractive novel option to improve tumor detection and to facilitate MAb quantification in a therapeutic setting. Basic aspects of tumor targeting with MAbs, as well as a review of the clinical trials reported in the literature, including own results, are presented.
