The origin of chemoselectivity in the hydrocarbonylation of alkenes catalysed by trialkylphosphine complexes of rhodium. The formation of monophosphine acyl intermediates explains why PPr(i)(3) and PBu(i)(3) generate aldehydes in alkene hydrocarbonylation reactions carried out in protic solvents, whilst PEt(3), for which the acyl complex contains two phosphines, produces alcohols.
