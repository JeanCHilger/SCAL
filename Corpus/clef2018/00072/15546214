18F-fluorothiols: a new approach to label peptides chemoselectively as potential tracers for positron emission tomography. [(18)F]Fluorothiols are a new generation of peptide labeling reagents. This article describes the preparation of suitable methanesulfonyl precursors and their use in no-carrier-added radiosyntheses of (18)F-fluorothiols. The preparations of (3-[(18)F]fluoropropylsulfanyl)triphenylmethane, (2-[2-[2-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy]ethylsulfanyl)triphenylmethane, and 4-[(18)F]fluoromethyl-N-[2-triphenylmethanesulfanyl)ethyl]benzamide starting from the corresponding methanesulfonyl precursors were investigated. Following the removal of the triphenylmethane protecting group, the (18)F-fluorothiols were reacted with the N-terminal chloroacetylated model peptide ClCH(2)C(O)-LysGlyPheGlyLys. The corresponding radiochemical yields of (18)F-labeled isolated model peptide, decay-corrected to (18)F fluoride, were 10%, 32%, and 1%, respectively. These results indicate a considerable potential of (18)F-fluorothiols for the chemoselective labeling of peptides as tracers for positron emission tomography (PET).
