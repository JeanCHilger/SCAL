MIRD Pamphlet No. 14: a dynamic urinary bladder model for radiation dose calculations. The constant-volume urinary bladder model in the standard MIRD phantom has recognized limitations. Various investigators have developed detailed models incorporating more physiologically realistic features such as expanding bladder contents and residual volume, and variable urinary input rate, initial volume and first void time. We have reviewed these published models and have developed a new model incorporating these factors. The model consists of a spherical source with variable volume to simulate the bladder contents and a wall represented by a spherical shell of constant volume. The wall thickness varies as the source expands or contracts. The model provides for variable urine entry rate (three different hydration states), initial bladder contents volume, residual volume and first void time. The voiding schedule includes an extended nighttime gap during which the urine entry rate is reduced to one-half the daytime rate. Radiation dose estimates have been calculated for the bladder wall surface (including photon and electron components) and at several depths in the wall (electron component) for [18F]FDG, 99mTc-DTPA, 99mTc-HEDP, [99mTc]pertechnetate 99mTc-RBCs, 99mTc-glucoheptonate, 99mTc-MAG3, [123I]/[124I]/[131I]OIH and sodium [131I]iodide(Nal). The initial bladder volume and first void time that provide the lowest radiation dose to the bladder wall are determined separately for each compound to give guidance for establishing dose reduction protocols.
