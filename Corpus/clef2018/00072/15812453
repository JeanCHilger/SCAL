Gastric sensory and motor dysfunction in adolescents with functional dyspepsia. Validated, noninvasive studies were used to compare sensation and motor function of the upper gastrointestinal tract in adolescents with functional dyspepsia (FD) and in control subjects.Fifteen adolescents with FD and 15 healthy participants underwent standardized symptom assessment, a satiation nutrient drink test, and 13 C-Spirulina platensis breath test for gastric emptying of solids. Adolescents with FD also underwent measurements of fasting and postprandial gastric volume by means of single-photon emission computed tomography, and their results were compared with those from 15 healthy volunteers (age, 18 to 25 years).Compared with control subjects, adolescents with FD had significantly higher postprandial symptoms 30 minutes after reaching maximum satiation with the nutrient drink test and significant delay in the T 1/2 for gastric emptying of solids. Compared with healthy 18- to 25-year-old adults, adolescents had a diminished postprandial gastric volume response. By means of single-photon emission computed tomography, frequent baseline dyspeptic symptoms were associated with prolonged T 1/2 for gastric emptying and higher postprandial aggregate symptom score. A baseline increased severity of dyspepsia symptoms was associated with prolonged T 1/2 for gastric emptying.Adolescents with FD demonstrate increased postprandial symptoms after challenge, delayed gastric emptying, and a reduced gastric volume response to feeding.
