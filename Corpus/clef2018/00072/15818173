Germ cell tumors. This review provides an overview of some of the recent pre-clinical and clinical developments in germ cell tumors.Recent epidemiological studies highlight the variations in the geographic and ethnic distribution of germ cell tumors and the changing incidence of seminoma versus nonseminoma in the population. Additional studies are continuing to identify risk factors for germ cell tumors. Expression profiling, both at the gene and protein levels, is beginning to identify, at the molecular level, some of the factors associated not only with germ cell pluripotency but also with the different histologic subtypes of germ cell tumors. Work in the area of identifying potentially new serum tumor markers in germ cell tumor, as well as the role of the traditional tumor markers in predicting outcome to therapy is ongoing. Data is emerging on the role of positron emission tomography in evaluating residual lesions in seminoma. Evolving data on chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery further complements and clarifies information on these treatment modalities, and their potential toxicities, in the management of germ cell tumors.Ongoing preclinical and epidemiological studies highlight the complexities underlying germ cell tumor pathogenesis. With enhanced understanding of some of these processes, treatments, particularly for advanced stages, will continue to evolve.
