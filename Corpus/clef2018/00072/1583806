Noninvasive estimation of site of lesion of left anterior descending artery with stress 201Tl myocardial SPECT images. Noninvasive estimation of site of lesion of left anterior descending artery (LAD) is important because of high morbidity of LAD lesion. Utility of stress 201Tl myocardial SPECT images for predicting site of LAD lesion characteristics of ischemic region induced by LAD lesion in the basal coronal image were studied in 53 patients with localized significant LAD lesion. Right margin of ischemic region at basal plane of SPECT images was determined by circumferential maximum count profile analysis of stress 201Tl myocardial images. Right margin of ischemic region induced by the just proximal lesion was 21 +/- 11 degrees, that by proximal lesion was -6 +/- 10 degrees and that by mid portion was -36 +/- 17 degrees. Sensitivity of right margin of ischemic region 0 for just proximal lesion was 100% (20/20) and that of right margin of ischemic region 0 for mid portion lesion was 100% (18/18). These results showed the possibility of detecting site of LAD lesion by stress 201Tl myocardial SPECT images.
