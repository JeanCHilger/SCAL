Three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection study of orthostatic hypotension and brain perfusion image in Parkinson's disease. To compare brain perfusion image using three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection (3D-SSP) analysis of N-isopropyl-p-123I iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) between patients with Parkinson's disease with orthostatic hypotension and those without orthostatic hypotension.Fifteen patients with Parkinson's disease and orthostatic hypotension and 13 patients with Parkinson's disease without orthostatic hypotension were studied. We compared brain perfusion image between the two groups by 3D-SSP.Bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus perfusion of the patients with orthostatic hypotension was significantly decreased compared to that of the patients without orthostatic hypotension.The disorder of anterior cingulate gyrus may participate in the autonomic failure in Parkinson's disease.
