A comparison of three commercially available PET imaging systems. Three commercial positron emission tomography (PET) imagers were assessed using the same test protocol (Positron Corporation 'Posicam', Siemens Ecat 951/31 and the Scanditronix PC 4096-15WB). A cylindrical phantom and a 'Jaszczak' phantom both filled with 18F were employed to measure sensitivity, slice uniformity, transaxial and axial resolution and cold rod contrast. The spread of results were as follows: sensitivity varied from 2.08 to 3.73 kcps kBq-1 ml-1 (77-138 kcps microCi-1 ml-1) radial resolution on axis (at 17.5 cm) varied from 5.0 to 5.9 mm (6.7-8.1 mm)
