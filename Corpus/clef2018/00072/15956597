Characterization of a novel vpu-harboring simian immunodeficiency virus from a Dent's Mona monkey (Cercopithecus mona denti). We report the identification of a new simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), designated SIVden, in a naturally infected Dent's Mona monkey (Cercopithecus mona denti), which was kept as pet in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. SIVden is genetically distinct from the previously characterized primate lentiviruses. Analysis of the full-length genomic sequence revealed the presence of a vpu open reading frame. This gene is also found in the virus lineage of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and chimpanzee immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) and was recently described in viruses isolated from Cercopithecus nictitans, Cercopithecus mona, and Cercopithecus cephus. The SIVden vpu coding region is shorter than the HIV-1/SIVcpz and the SIVgsn, SIVmon, and SIVmus counterparts. Unlike Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii viruses (SIVcpzPts) and Cercopithecus monkey viruses (SIVgsn, SIVmon, and SIVmus), the SIVden Vpu contains the characteristic DSGXES motif which was shown to be involved in Vpu-mediated CD4 and IkappaBalpha proteolysis in HIV-1 infected cells. Although it harbors a vpu gene, SIVden is phylogenetically closer to SIVdeb isolated from De Brazza's monkeys (Cercopithecus neglectus), which lacks a vpu gene, than to Cercopithecus monkey viruses, which harbor a vpu sequence.
