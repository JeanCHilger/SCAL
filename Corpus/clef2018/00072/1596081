Functional reorganization of the brain in recovery from striatocapsular infarction in man. We used positron emission tomography (PET) to study organizational changes in the functional anatomy of the brain in 10 patients following recovery from striatocapsular motor strokes. Comparisons of regional cerebral blood flow maps at rest between the patients and 10 normal subjects revealed significantly lower regional cerebral blood flow in the basal ganglia, thalamus, sensorimotor, insular, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, in the brainstem, and in the ipsilateral cerebellum in patients, contralateral to the side of the recovered hand. These deficits reflect the distribution of dysfunction caused by the ischemic lesion. Regional cerebral blood flow was significantly increased in the contralateral posterior cingulate and premotor cortices, and in the caudate nucleus ipsilateral to the recovered hand. During the performance of a motor task by the recovered hand, patients activated the contralateral cortical motor areas and ipsilateral cerebellum to the same extent as did normal subjects. However, activation was greater than in normal subjects in both insulae in the inferior parietal (area 40), prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices
