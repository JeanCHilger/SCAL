Hemispheric asymmetry of sulcus-function correspondence: quantization and developmental implications. Spatial covariances between the geometric centers of human occipital sulci and visual functional areas were calculated to reduce the spatial variance of functional-area locations between subjects. Seven visual areas in each occipital hemisphere were retinotopically mapped, using horizontal- and vertical-meridian stimuli and (15)O PET in 11 subjects. Sulcal locations were determined using anatomic brain models derived from high-resolution MRI images. Location variability for sulci and functional areas was similar in magnitude, with average standard deviations of (2.7x, 5.3y, 5.7z) mm and (4.3x, 5.4y, 5.3z) mm, respectively. Sulcal locations were predictive of functional-area locations (i.e., significant spatial covariance) in the minority of structure-function pairings tested (25 of 168). Location variability was reduced by an average of 27% for functional areas showing significant covariation with sulcal features. Early-developing sulci were stronger predictors of functional-area location than late-developing sulci. Sulcus-function covariance was stronger in the left occipital lobe than in the right occipital lobe. Notably, the left calcarine fissure demonstrated powerful covariances with functional areas in both hemispheres, suggesting that it serves as a developmental "anchor" for functional areas in the occipital cortex. These findings support the hypothesis that hemispheric lateralization of function is reflected in the strength of correspondence between cortical surface anatomy and function.
