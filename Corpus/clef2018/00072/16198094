Congenital hyperinsulinism in newborn and infant. Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is the most important cause of hypoglycaemia in early infancy.

Several classifications of HI can be attempted, based on: 1) the onset of hypoglycemia in the neonatal period or later in infancy 2) the histological lesion: focal or diffuse
