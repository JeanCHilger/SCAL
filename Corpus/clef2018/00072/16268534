Effective PET and ICT switching of boradiazaindacene emission: a unimolecular, emission-mode, molecular half-subtractor with reconfigurable logic gates. [reaction, structure: see text] We report a unimolecular system functioning as a combinatorial logic circuit for half-subtractor. The emission characteristics can be modulated by chemical inputs, and when followed at two different wavelengths, two functionally integrated logic gates XOR and INHIBIT are obtained. Both logic gates function in the emission mode, and with very large differences in the signal intensity allowing unequivocal assignment of logic-0 and logic-1.
