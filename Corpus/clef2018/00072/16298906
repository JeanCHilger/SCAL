Cardiovascular imaging to quantify the evolution of cardiac diseases in clinical development. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of mortality in western countries, leading to the development of a large set of preventive and curative treatments. Medical imaging is the gold standard to evaluate both cardiac perfusion and cardiac function and can be used even before the advent of hard events to accurately assess treatment effects. This study reviews the different image modalities that can be used to evaluate the evolution of cardiac diseases, especially coronary artery diseases. It also reviews different techniques heavily relying upon image co-registration techniques and population model designs that enable accurate quantitative evaluation of cardiac perfusion and cardiac function through time. It will draw the pros and cons of the different imaging modalities in actual clinical trials: Gated or tagged MRI, MRI for perfusion, PET, SPECT, Gated SPECT, MUGA, Ultrasound. This study also details the latest advances in quantification of cardiac SPECT, which has wide use in clinical trials today.
