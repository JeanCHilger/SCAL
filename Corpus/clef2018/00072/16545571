Comments on the feasibility of 61Cu production by proton irradiation of (nat)Zn on a medical cyclotron. Feasibility of 61Cu production in high radionuclidic purity form via (nat)Zn(p,x) 61Cu nuclear process is discussed. Based on the experimentally available cross-sections of the (nat)Zn(p,x) 61Cu, (nat)Zn(p,x) 60Cu and (nat)Zn(p,x) 64Cu nuclear processes the usefulness of the (nat)Zn(p,x) 61Cu process for high-scale production is questionable in the 22 --> 12 MeV energy range.
