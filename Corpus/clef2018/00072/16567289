QT peak dispersion, not QT dispersion, is a more useful diagnostic marker for detecting exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. The electrocardiographic indices of QT dispersion (QTd), QT peak dispersion (QTpd), and the principal component analysis ratio (PCAr) are related to the occurrence of fatal arrhythmia and are influenced by physical exercise.The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not the QT parameters can be used as markers for exercise-induced myocardial ischemia.We measured these QT parameters at rest and at 3 minutes after exercise using exercise-stress thallium-201 scintigraphy (SPECT), compared with conventional ST segment changes in 161 patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease. The patients were classified into four groups (normal, redistribution, fixed defect, and redistribution with fixed defect) according to SPECT.At rest, QTd and PCAr were greater in the fixed defect and redistribution with fixed defect groups. PCAr, however, increased after exercise in the redistribution and redistribution with fixed defect groups. Although QTpd at rest was not significantly different among the four groups, it increased in the redistribution and redistribution with fixed defect groups after exercise (QTpd after exercise: normal, 36 +/- 16 ms vs. redistribution, 51 +/- 23 ms, redistribution with fixed defect, 53 +/- 19 ms P<.05). For myocardial infarction reflected by fixed defect, QTd at rest was the most useful indicator, while QTpd after exercise was the most useful indicator for exercise-induced myocardial ischemia according to multiple logistic regression analysis with receiver operating characteristic curves. In addition, the change in PCAr by exercise was an independent predictor for exercise-induced ischemia.QTpd and PCAr could be useful indices for exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. Determining the QTpd of a patient after exercising can improve the diagnostic accuracy of ischemia in a routine clinical setting.
