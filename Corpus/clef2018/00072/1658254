Improved detection of small cavernous hemangiomas of the liver with high-resolution three-headed SPECT. The purpose of this study was to review our experience with 99mTc-red blood cell scintigraphy for diagnosis of cavernous hemangiomas of the liver using a new three-headed, high-resolution dedicated SPECT system. Of 19 patients referred with a total of 38 lesions seen on CT, US, or MRI, 14 patients had 24 lesions that were hemangioma-positive with SPECT (all true-positives). Six of these 14 patients also had 9 hemangioma-negative lesions all were less than or equal to 1.3 cm in size and false-negative. The remaining five patients had hemangioma-negative lesions only (1 false-negative, 4 true-negatives). Two hemangiomas were seen by SPECT that were not detected by CT, US, or MR. The sensitivity for hemangiomas greater than or equal to 1.4 cm. was 100% (20/20). The sensitivity was 33% for lesions 0.9-1.3 cm, and 20% for lesions less than or equal to 0.8 cm. The smallest hemangioma detected was 0.5 cm. These results show a definite improvement in sensitivity with high-resolution triple-headed SPECT over previously reported results using single-headed SPECT. High-resolution SPECT has improved our ability to detect small cavernous hemangiomas of the liver.
