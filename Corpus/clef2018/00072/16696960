Photoinduced electron-transfer alpha-deoxygenation of aldonolactones. Efficient synthesis of 2-deoxy-D-arabino-hexono-1,4-lactone. A photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) reaction was used for the deoxygenation at C-2 of aldonolactones derivatized as 2-O-[3-(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl] or benzoyl esters. By irradiation of different D-galactono- and D-glucono-1,4-derivatives, with a 450W lamp, using 9-methylcarbazole as photosensitizer, the corresponding 2-deoxy-D-lyxo- and 2-deoxy-D-arabino-hexono-1,4-lactones were efficiently obtained.
