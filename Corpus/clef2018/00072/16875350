Evaluation of myocardial perfusion and right ventricular function alterations by SPECT and echocardiography after great arteries corrected transposition. Great arteries corrected transposition is a rare congenital heart disease associated with right ventricle dysfunction. The objective of this study was to assess by equilibrium ventriculography (EV) and gated SPECT with Tc-99m sestamibi rest-stress protocol, right ventricle function and perfusion in adult patients with CTGA without previous surgery, and to compare the results with the standard transthoracic cross-sectional (TTE) and color coded Doppler echocardiography (CE) techniques.We studied 13 patients, who underwent ventriculography to assess right ventricle function and gated SPECT to evaluate myocardial perfusion and right ventricle function. The data obtained were compared with TTE and CE.Right ventricle ejection fraction was measured using nuclear medicine and showed a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.67 (p = 0.059) with the shortening area fraction and 0.84 (p = 0.01) with the tricuspid ring descendent method.Gated SPECT and Echo contrast are extremely valuable methods in the assessment of myocardial perfusion of the right ventricle in this group of patients. The diagnostic agreement index of both studies was 0.76 (p = 0.005) to identify non-reversible defects and 0.68 (p = 0.009) for reversible defects.
