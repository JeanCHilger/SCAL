Benign variations and incidental abnormalities of myocardial FDG uptake in the fasting state as encountered during routine oncology positron emission tomography studies. Increased 18fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the myocardium is frequently observed while performing clinical positron emission tomography (PET) body scans for oncology under fasting conditions. This article reviews the normal variations and abnormal appearances of myocardial FDG accumulation which are likely to be encountered in the routine PET studies. Knowledge about the myocardial glucose metabolism and specific abnormalities are indispensable in the interpretation of myocardial FDG uptake.
