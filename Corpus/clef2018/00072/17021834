Imaging strategies in intramuscular haemangiomas: an analysis of 20 cases. The purpose of this study was to review the correlation between the imaging studies and the histological findings in the diagnosis of this disease. We retrospectively reviewed 21 lesions in 20 patients (median age, 23.7 years old) who had been diagnosed with cavernous haemangiomas (n=11), capillary (n=6), and mixed (n=3) types. The imaging studies were obtained with plain film radiography (n=20), Tc-99 m bone scans (n=5), angiography (n=7) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI n=20). All the patients underwent marginal to wide excision. Based on the imaging studies, the rate of accurate prediction of intramuscular haemangioma using MRI in our study was 90%. Using the preoperative imaging studies and surgical excisions, only one (5%) local recurrence happened 2 years after marginal excision. The remaining patients were free of disease. For the avoidance of recurrence, wide excision is necessary with the help of the imaging studies, which can provide more specific information, making possible the preoperative identification of characteristic features of the tumuor.
