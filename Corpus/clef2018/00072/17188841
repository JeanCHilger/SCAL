3D soft tissue imaging with a mobile C-arm. We introduce a clinical prototype for 3D soft tissue imaging to support surgical or interventional procedures based on a mobile C-arm. An overview of required methods and materials is followed by first clinical images of animals and human patients including dosimetry. The mobility and flexibility of 3D C-arms gives free access to the patient and therefore avoids relocation of the patient between imaging and surgical intervention. Image fusion with diagnostic data (MRI, CT, PET) is demonstrated and promising applications for brachytherapy, RFTT and others are discussed.
