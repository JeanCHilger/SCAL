Regional brain glucose metabolism: correlations to biochemical measures and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. Regional brain glucose metabolism in 20 patients with schizophrenia (DSM-III) was investigated by positron emission tomography (PET) with uniformly labeled 11C-glucose as the tracer. Monoamine metabolites were analyzed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum, and prolactin was analyzed in serum. Intensity of anxiety was rated directly after the PET study. Ten healthy volunteers served as controls. In the patients, weak positive and negative relationships were found between homovanillic acid in CSF and prolactin in serum, respectively, and regional metabolic rates. In all subjects, positive correlations were found between the level of anxiety and the regional glucose metabolism. In the controls, positive correlations were found between anxiety and the frontal/parietal ratios of the left hemisphere, whereas anxiety scores of the patients correlated negatively to relative metabolic rates of the right medial frontal cortex and the left thalamus. These observations may indicate alterations in the neuronal systems participating in the initiation of anxiety and arousal in schizophrenia.
