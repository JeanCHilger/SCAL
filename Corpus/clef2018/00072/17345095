Myocardial scintigraphy after pacemaker implantation for congenital complete atrioventricular block. Patients with isolated congenital complete atrioventricular block (CCAVB) occasionally develop dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), despite early pacemaker implantation. However, the etiology of the DCM and its relationship to permanent ventricular pacing are not fully understood. Twenty-five patients with CCAVB underwent (99m) technetium (Tc) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. Five patients were studied before and after pacing, providing a total of 30 image sets, which were divided into three groups group 1: CCAVB before pacemaker implantation (PMI) (n = 11)
