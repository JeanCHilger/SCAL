Synthesis and bioimaging of positron-emitting 15O-labeled 2-deoxy-D-glucose of two-minute half-life. In positron emission tomography (PET), which exploits the affinity of a radiopharmaceutical for the target organ, a systematic repertoire of oxygen-15-labeled PET tracers is expected to be useful for bioimaging owing to the ubiquity of oxygen atoms in organic compounds. However, because of the 2-min half-life of 15O, the synthesis of complex biologically active 15O-labeled organic molecules has not yet been achieved. A state-of-the-art synthesis now makes available an 15O-labeled complex organic molecule, 6-[15O]-2-deoxy-D-glucose. Ultrarapid radical hydroxylation of 2,6-dideoxy-6-iodo-D-glucose with molecular oxygen labeled with 15O of two-minute half-life provided the target 15O-labeled molecule. The labeling reaction with 15O was complete in 1.3 min, and the entire operation time starting from the generation of 15O-containing dioxygen by a cyclotron to the purification of the labeled sugar was 7 min. The labeled sugar accumulated in the metabolically active organs as well as in the bladder of mice and rats. 15O-labeling offers the possibility of repetitive scanning and the use of multiple PET tracers in the same body within a short time, and hence should significantly expand the scope of PET studies of small animals.
