CT-PET: a new light in the diagnostic tunnel. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has got an important role in oncology. Since its introduction in 1995, more than 40 PETs have been installed in Spain. New hybrid CT-PET equipment that have appeared in the last three years have the anatomical and functional information of both techniques. The addition of CT makes it possible to reduce the duration of the PET study, to ameliorate the image quality, to ameliorate its diagnostic performance and to increase its indications. The new equipment being installed are all CT-PET and they will soon be more numerous than the previous PETs.
