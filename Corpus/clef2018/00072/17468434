Respiration-averaged CT for attenuation correction in canine cardiac PET/CT. Heart disease is a leading cause of death in North America. With the increased availability of PET/CT scanners, CT is now commonly used as a transmission source for attenuation correction. Because of the differences in scan duration between PET and CT, respiration-induced motion can create inconsistencies between the PET and CT data and lead to incorrect attenuation correction and, thus, artifacts in the final reconstructed PET images. This study compared respiration-averaged CT and 4-dimensional (4D) CT for attenuation correction of cardiac PET in an in vivo canine model as a means of removing these inconsistencies.Five dogs underwent respiration-gated cardiac (18)F-FDG PET and 4D CT. The PET data were reconstructed with 3 methods of attenuation correction that differed only in the CT data used: The first method was single-phase CT at either end-expiration, end-inspiration, or the middle of a breathing cycle the second was respiration-averaged CT, which is CT temporally averaged over the entire respiratory cycleFor single-phase CT correction at end-expiration, end-inspiration, and mid cycle, the maximum percentage differences were 11% +/- 4%, 7% +/- 3%, and 5% +/- 2%, respectively. Conversely, the maximum difference for attenuation correction with respiration-averaged CT data was only 1.6% +/- 0.7%.Respiration-averaged CT correction produced a maximum percentage difference 7 times smaller than that obtained with end-expiration single-phase correction. This finding indicates that using respiration-averaged CT may accurately correct for attenuation on respiration-ungated cardiac PET.
