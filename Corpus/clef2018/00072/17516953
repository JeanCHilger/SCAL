Basic data on food intake, nutrient digestibility and energy requirements of lorikeets. Although knowledge of the nutrient requirements of pet birds has increased a lot over the last few years, basic data on food and water intake and the energy requirements of nectarivorous species, such as lorikeets, are scarce. Thus, the aim of this study was to try to generate some of these data for lorikeets kept at maintenance. Determination of the daily maintenance energy requirement enables calculation of the daily ration and thus, the appropriate nutrient concentrations in order to maintain body weight. Investigations were carried out with six Goldie's lorikeets (GL Trichoglossus goldiei: 40-50 g BW
