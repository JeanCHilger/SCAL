Chemotherapy-induced normalization of FDG uptake by colorectal liver metastases does not usually indicate complete pathologic response. Dramatic responses are being observed in colorectal cancer liver metastases treated with newer chemotherapeutic regimens. These have been associated with normalization of [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake (complete metabolic response) on follow-up Positron Emission Tomography with [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) scans in some patients. It is unclear how often complete metabolic response is indicative of complete tumor destruction. We analyzed a subset of patients who had neoadjuvant chemotherapy for hepatic metastases from colorectal adenocarcinoma. Inclusion criteria were: (1) FDG-avid hepatic lesions before initiation of chemotherapy (2) complete metabolic response of the same lesions after chemotherapy
