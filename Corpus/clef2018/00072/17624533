Positron emission tomography (PET) in the urooncological evaluation of the small pelvis. Positron emission tomography (PET) with the use of ((18)F)2-fluoro-D: -2-desoxyglucose (FDG) has been investigated to be a highly sensitive and specific imaging modality in the diagnostic of primary and recurrent tumors and in the control of therapies in numerous non-urologic cancers. The aim of this review is to validate the significance of PET as a diagnostic tool in malignant urological tumors of the small pelvis. A systematic review of the current literature concerning the role of PET for malignant prostate, testicular and bladder tumors was carried out. The data indicate no additional role for PET in comparison with conventional imaging in tumor detection and local staging for prostate, bladder or testicular cancer. Tumor recurrence in prostate cancer seems to be more effectively identified with acetate and choline than with FDG, but this effect is more pronounced with higher PSA values. The value of PET in the identification of metastatic disease in either tumor entity can not be finally outlined as the clinical data are partly missing, controversial or in the process of evaluation. FDG-PET can be regarded as accepted imaging modality in the restaging of seminomatous germ cell tumors after chemotherapy.
