Identification of coronary artery disease in the pediatric cardiac transplant patient. Little data exist to identify pediatric patients who have developed transplant coronary artery vasculopathy (CAV). Transplant patients do not exhibit the usual signs of coronary disease, making diagnosis more difficult. The aim of this study is to assess the use of myocardial perfusion imaging to identify CAV in transplant patients and to derive an incidence of occurrence. We studied pediatric cardiac transplant recipients who have undergone myocardial perfusion imaging on a routine basis. All patients from September 1999 through November 2004 with nuclear perfusion scans were included. Twenty patients age 7-24 years (mean: 12.7), 11 male and 9 female, were studied by SPECT technetium 99M tetrofosmin imaging. Sixteen of the 20 patients were studied based on a newly instituted protocol for surveillance. Transplant was 1-14 years (mean: 7.9) earlier. Patients were also studied by stress echocardiography. Six of 20 patients (30%) had a positive perfusion scan. Ages ranged from 8 to 18 years (mean: 12). Time from transplant to positive scans ranged from 1 to 9 years (mean: 5.6). One patient showed the same perfusion defect as 2 years earlier. Five patients with positive nuclear perfusion scans showed the abnormality on the initial study one had a previous negative study 6 months earlier. Four patients who demonstrated ischemia with exercise showed resolution at rest
