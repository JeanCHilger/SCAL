Interventricular mechanical dyssynchrony: a novel marker of cardiac events in Brugada syndrome. Risk stratification in Brugada syndrome is controversial, especially in asymptomatic individuals.The purpose of this study was to evaluate tissue Doppler echocardiography in risk stratification of Brugada syndrome.Patients with Brugada ECG pattern were enrolled in the study. Left ventricular (LV) preejection period was defined as the time interval between onset of the QRS complex and onset of LV lateral wall systolic wave. Right ventricular (RV) preejection period was defined as the time interval between onset of the QRS complex and onset of RV lateral wall systolic wave. Delay in onset of contraction between RV and LV was defined as RV preejection time - LV preejection time [PET((RV-LV))].Type 1, 2, and 3 Brugada ECG pattern was found in 30, 56, and 31 patients, respectively. PET((RV-LV)) was significantly greater in type 1 Brugada patients (39.2 +/- 3.2 ms) compared with type 2 (5 +/- 0.3 ms) and 3 (5 +/- 0.4 ms) Brugada patients as well as controls (4.6 +/- 0.3 ms, P <.01 for all comparisons). Among type 1 Brugada patients, PET((RV-LV)) was significantly greater in patients who had previous cardiac events compared with asymptomatic subjects (48.2 +/- 4.3 ms vs 29.5 +/- 3.6 ms, P <.05). In the presence of type 1 Brugada ECG pattern, PET((RV-LV)) > or =40 ms identifies patients likely to have cardiac events, with 85.7% sensitivity and 93.7% specificity.PET((RV-LV)) is an important risk indicator for Brugada syndrome.
