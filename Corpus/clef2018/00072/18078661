Chronic ischemic heart failure. Revascularization improves survival among patients with hibernating myocardium. Patients with ischemic heart failure and reversible dysfunctional myocardium (Hibernating myocardium, HIB) can benefit from revascularization. These patients can be selected with nuclear methods. The purpose of this study was to describe the results of the imaging procedures in patients tested for HIB and relate the results to the choice of treatment and cause of death.During a 2-year period 51 patients were referred to determine the amount of HIB. This can be determined with blood flow and metabolic imaging of the heart. Resting-myocardial perfusion imaging was performed with 99mTc-sestamibi and glucose metabolism was visualized with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) gamma camera PET. Medical records and death certificate were reviewed retrospectively.50 patients were included. We found an increased survival among patients with HIB who underwent revascularization (1 year mortality 6% vs. 33%, p = 0,004). Patients with HIB who did not undergo revascularization had an increased risk of sudden death. (5/15 patients vs. 0/35 patients, p = 0,003).Despite a simplified method we find the same increased mortality among medically-treated patients with HIB as in earlier studies. This and earlier studies are all retrospective with the risk of selection bias. Prospective studies are underway. Nuclear imaging is useful in evaluating patients with heart failure before revascularization.
