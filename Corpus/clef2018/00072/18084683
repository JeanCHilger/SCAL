Radiosynthesis and evaluation of [11C]BTA-1 and [11C]3'-Me-BTA-1 as potential radiotracers for in vivo imaging of beta-amyloid plaques. To evaluate the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of [N-methyl-(11)C]2-(4'-(methylaminophenyl)-benzothiazole ([(11)C]BTA-1) as well as [N-methyl-(11)C]2-(3'-methyl-4'-(methylamino)phenyl)-benzothiazole ([(11)C]3'-Me-BTA-1) as diagnostic markers of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD).Brain uptake and clearance was determined in wild-type mice. Binding affinities (K(i)) of [(11)C]BTA-1 and [(11)C]3'-Me-BTA-1 for aggregated Abeta(1-40) fibrils were assessed. Autoradiography was performed on brain sections of AD patients. To demonstrate binding specificity in vivo BTA-1 was injected i.p. in transgenic mice (Tg2576). Brain sections were analysed consecutively. Additionally, a [(11)C]BTA-1 PET study of an AD patient and a healthy control was performed.In mice brain uptake and clearance of [(11)C]BTA-1 is compatible with the half life of (11)C (2 min: 12.7 % ID/g 30 min: 4.6% ID/g). In contrast clearance rate of [(11)C]3'-Me-BTA-1 is too slow (2 min 4% ID/gThe ability to label Abeta plaques in vivo in human subjects supports the suitability of [(11)C]BTA-1 as a plaque imaging agent.
