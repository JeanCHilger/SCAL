Clinical value of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin imaging and ultrasonography in diagnosis of breast cancer: a comparative study. To assess the clinical value of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin ((99m)Tc-TF) planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in comparison with ultrasonography in the diagnosis of breast cancer.Fifty women underwent (99m)Tc-TF planar imaging, SPECT and ultrasonographic examinations, and with the results of histopathological examination as the golden standard, the diagnostic value of the 3 modalities were compared in the detection of malignancies of the breast neoplasms.The sensitivity of planar imaging, SPECT and ultrasonography in breast cancer diagnosis was 74.2%, 93.5%, and 87.1%, with specificity of 66.7%, 77.3%, and 80.0%, respectively.(99m)Tc-TF imaging is a new and effective method for diagnosis of breast cancer.
