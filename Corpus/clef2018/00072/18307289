Synthesis and cerebral uptake of 1-(1-[(11)C]methyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-2-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)ethanone, a novel tracer for positron emission tomography studies of monoamine oxidase type A. ( R)-(-)- and ( S)-(+)-1-(1-[ (11)C]methyl-1 H-pyrrol-2-yl)-2-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)ethanone 4 and 5 were synthesized, and their properties as tracers for positron emission tomography (PET) studies of monoamine oxidase type A (MAO-A) in the brain of living pigs were tested. Parametric maps of the distribution volume ( V d) 4 in pig brain were qualitatively similar to those obtained with [ (11)C]harmine, with prominent binding in the ventral forebrain and mesencephalon. Its binding was highly vulnerable to MAO blockade, suggesting a binding potential as high as 2 for MAO-A sites. The slow plasma metabolism of 4 and 5 may present advantages over [ (11)C]harmine for routine PET studies of MAO-A.
