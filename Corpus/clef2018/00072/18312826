Grading of brain glioma with 1-11C-acetate PET: comparison with 18F-FDG PET. The objective of this study is to reevaluate the clinical significance of 1-11C-acetate (ACE) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with brain glioma, in comparison with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET.Ten patients with histologically proven glioma were included in this study. They underwent PET examination with both FDG and ACE on separate days. For ACE PET, 20-min data acquisition was performed just after the administration of 740 MBq of ACE 10-20-min data were used for the analysis. FDG PET data acquisition for 10 min started 60 min postinjection of 370 MBq of FDG, approximately. Both reconstructed images were converted to standardized uptake value (SUV) images for patient body weight and injected dose. Regions of interest were placed on the tumor and the contralateral cerebral cortex, and SUV and tumor-to-cortex ratio (T/C) were calculatedSUV and T/C of ACE PET showed significant difference (SUV: 2.63+/-0.46 vs. 1.85+/-0.56, P=.03 T/C: 2.36+/-0.63 vs. 1.14+/-0.36, P=.02). In contrast, FDG PET revealed no significant difference in SUV or T/C between high- and low-grade gliomas (SUV: 7.13+/-4.31 vs. 4.71+/-1.27, P=.31This preliminary study revealed that ACE PET is a promising tracer for the grading of brain glioma.
