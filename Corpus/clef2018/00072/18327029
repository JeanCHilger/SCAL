Modern methods to predict costs for the treatment and management of head and neck cancer patients: examples of methods used in the current literature. In the last year, several groups have used various methods to calculate economic costs to patients with early- and late-stage head and neck cancer, cost comparisons of palliative treatments, patient time costs associated with cancer care, and the impact of new diagnostic technologies which need formal cost-effectiveness assessment to determine their value.Late-stage oral and oropharyngeal cancer treatment is more expensive than early-stage. Photodynamic therapy is cost-effective for esophageal cancer. Head and neck cancer patients spend more time receiving care than control cancer. Multimodal therapy for oropharynx cancer has a higher inpatient utilization than a radio (chemo) approach. Positron emission tomography in combination with computed tomography has a high accuracy, positive predictive value, and ability to find unknown primaries. Soluble CD44 and methylation status are highly sensitive and specific for detecting head and neck cancer. The Washington University head and neck cancer comorbidity index was successful at predicting 5-year costs of head and neck cancer.Evidence-based studies to inform head and neck cancer care providers are limited. As this available literature proliferates, it should inform providers and policy makers about optimizing the quality and cost of healthcare expenses.
