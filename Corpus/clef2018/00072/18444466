Import of dogs by public animal shelters and private animal protection societies. Every year thousands of dogs from EU Member States and third countries are brought to Germany by private animal protectionists, animal protection societies and public animal shelters offering them for an average charge of 250,00 Euro each. In addition to violations of current legal regulations, there might also be real crime offence behind the matter. Moreover, people, especially children, are increasingly endangered by various infectious diseases imported to Germany and spreading throughout the country as well as by dogs suffering from bad deprivation damage. The fact that the new owners are often not told the truth about the dogs'foreign origin is another problem. They are often marked with a chip after being brought to Germany and only then they are provided with a national vaccination record or a German pet passport. Finally the question arises whether the "rescue" of dogs and finding a place for them in Germany is just "big business"--for animal protection societies, practitioners, dog shelters, dog psychologists and the media.
