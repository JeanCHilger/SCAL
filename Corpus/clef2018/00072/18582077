Modulate photoinduced electron transfer efficiency of bipolar dendritic systems. Covalent linkage of dendritic carbazole-based donors and 1,3,4-oxdiazole-based acceptors renders novel bipolar dendrimers that can efficiently facilitate the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process. Photodynamic studies indicated that the PET rate of bipolar dendrimers DA1 and DA2 can be modulated by the number of acceptors presented in the molecule.
