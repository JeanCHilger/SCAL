Review: Deoxyglucose compounds labeled with isotopes different from 18-fuoride: is there a future in clinical practice? There are several radionuclide-labeled derivatives of deoxyglucose (DG) that have been developed including 2-fluro-deoxyglucose, ethylenedicysteine-deoxyglucose, diethylenetriaminepentaacetate-deoxyglucose, N-(2'-hydroxybenzyl)-2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose, and methyl D-glucoside that were synthesized and successfully labeled in high labeling fields. The former 4 were used for tumor imaging and methyl-D-glucoside for the diagnosis and the monitoring of the functional status of renal tubules. These derivatives are suitable for imaging examinations when labeled with either fluorine-18 (18F), technetium-99m (99mTc), carbon-11 (11C), or gallium-68 (68Ga). These compounds are suitable both for imaging and for therapy if labeled with rhenium-188 (188Re). In the area of molecular imaging of nuclear medicine, derivatives of radionuclide-labeled deoxyglucose will become an important tool for the diagnosis and carcinoma treatment in the clinic.
