Newer technologies/techniques and tools in the diagnosis of melanoma. A number of non-invasive approaches have been developed over the years to provide an objective means of evaluating and diagnosing skin melanoma. However, the current gold-standard in melanoma diagnosis is the examination of a skin lesion by the trained eye of a physician followed by histological examination of an invasive excisional biopsy of the skin specimen. Diagnosis of melanoma by simple visual examination is incorrect in almost 1 out of every 3 melanoma diagnoses. Therefore, the diagnosis of early stage in-depth melanoma by non-invasive methods remains an active area of research. Recent advancements in computer and digital technology have provided several sensitive tools to evaluate the different characteristics of a melanoma lesion including its contour, edge, color, size, depth, and/or elevation. These tools include (1) digital imaging systems and computer analysis instruments such as MoleMax, SIAscope, SolarScan, MelaFind (2) tape stripping mRNA
