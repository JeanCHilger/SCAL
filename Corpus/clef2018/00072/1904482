The reproducibility of striatal uptake data obtained with positron emission tomography and fluorine-18-L-6-fluorodopa tracer in non-human primates. Cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys have been studied via PET with [18F]-L-6 fluorodopa tracer. Striatal fluorodopa uptake rate constants have been derived by graphical analysis of transaxial slice images centered on the striata. The differences between pairs of values of the rate constant, obtained from two scans on the same monkey separated by two weeks or more, exhibited a relative standard deviation of 34.4%. If the two scans were conducted one immediately after the other, with the position of the monkey undisturbed, the standard deviation was reduced to 14.0%. The utility of this technique was demonstrated by comparing the effects on the scans of halothane and pentobarbital anesthesia and by the administration of NSD 1015, a peripheral and central inhibitor of L-aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase, between back-to-back scans. With NSD 1015, the fluorodopa uptake constant was reduced by an average of 76.0%.
