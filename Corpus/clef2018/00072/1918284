Positron emission tomographic studies during serial word-reading by normal and dyslexic adults. Positron-emission tomography (PET) was used to study regional cerebral metabolic activity during oral reading in right-handed adult males with, and without a childhood and family history of developmental dyslexia. Significant group differences in normalized regional metabolic values were revealed in prefrontal cortex and in the lingual (inferior) region of the occipital lobe. Lingual values were bilaterally higher for dyslexic than normal readers. In contrast to the asymmetry observed in prefrontal and lingual regions in nondyslexic subjects during reading, the dyslexic pattern was more symmetric. These results demonstrate that individuals who suffered from familial developmental dyslexia as children, activate different brain regions during reading as adults, as compared to individuals without such childhood history.
