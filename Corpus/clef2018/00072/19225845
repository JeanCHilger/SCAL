Simultaneous [99mTc]TRODAT-1 and [123I]ADAM brain SPECT in nonhuman primates. This study examined the feasibility of simultaneous dopamine and serotonin transporter imaging using [(123)I]ADAM and [(99m)Tc]TRODAT-1 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Simultaneous [(123)I]ADAM (185 MBq) and [(99m)Tc]TRODAT-1 (740 MBq) SPECT was performed in three age-matched female Formosan rock monkeys. An asymmetric energy window was used for dual, and symmetric energy windows were used for single-isotope imaging. Oral fluoxetine (20 mg) and intravenous methylphenidate HCl (1 mg/kg) were given 24 h and 10 min, respectively, before dual-isotope SPECT to test imaging specificities of [(123)I]ADAM and [(99m)Tc]TRODAT-1.Comparable image quality and uptake ratios between dual- and single-isotope SPECT scans were found. Dual-isotope SPECT in fluoxetine-pretreated monkeys showed decreased uptake of [(123)I]-ADAM, but not of [(99m)Tc]TRODAT-1. Dual-isotope SPECT in methylphenidate-pretreated monkeys showed decreased [(99m)Tc]TRODAT-1 uptake without affecting [(123)I]-ADAM uptake.Simultaneous [(123)I]-ADAM and [(99m)Tc]TRODAT-1 SPECT appears promising in nonhuman primates and may provide a suitable preclinical model with further clinical implications.
