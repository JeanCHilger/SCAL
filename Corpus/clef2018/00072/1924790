Hepatic hemangiomas: diagnosis with fusion of MR, CT, and Tc-99m-labeled red blood cell SPECT images. A method of image analysis was developed for correlation of hemangiomas detected at computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with increased blood pool activity evident at single photon emission CT (SPECT) performed after labeling of red blood cells with technetium-99m. Image analysis was performed in 20 patients with 35 known hepatic hemangiomas. After section thickness and pixel sizes of the different studies were matched, intrinsic landmarks were chosen to identify anatomically corresponding locations. Regions of interest (ROIs) drawn on the CT and/or MR images were translated, rotated, and reprojected to match the areas of interest on the corresponding SPECT images by means of a two-dimensional polynomial-based warping algorithm. Analysis of ROIs on 30 SPECT-MR and 20 SPECT-CT pairs of registered images provided absolute confirmation that 34 suspected hemangiomas identified on SPECT images correlated exactly with lesions seen on CT and/or MR images. Accuracy of fusion was within an average of 1.5 pixels +/- 0.8 (+/- 1 standard deviation). The technique enabled diagnostic confirmation of hemangiomas as small as 1.0 cm and proved useful for evaluating lesions located adjacent to intrahepatic vessels.
