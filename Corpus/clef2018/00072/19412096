Utilization of positron emission tomography in the management of patients with sarcoma. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) is being used with increased frequency in the care of patients with sarcoma. In this review, the recent literature covering all aspects of PET imaging in the management of patients with soft tissue and bone sarcomas will be discussed.In a prospective multicenter study, PET imaging accurately detected primary tumors as well as lymph node and bone metastases in patients with sarcoma. Limitations in detecting lung metastasis can be overcome by using a hybrid PET/CT scanner. In patients with neurofibromatosis, 18F-FDG-PET demonstrated its application to detect and monitor for the malignant transformation of neurofibromas. Changes in tumor 18F-FDG uptake correlate significantly with histopathologic response and survival in patients with sarcoma.PET imaging is emerging as an important imaging modality in the management of patients with sarcoma. Its applications include tumor grading, staging, therapeutic monitoring, and prognostication in adult and pediatric populations.
