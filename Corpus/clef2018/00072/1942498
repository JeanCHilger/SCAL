Relation of change in wall motion and glucose metabolism after coronary artery bypass grafting--assessment with positron emission tomography. Regional myocardial glucose metabolism was assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) in stunned myocardium. PET perfusion and metabolic imaging using N-13 ammonia and F-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) was performed before and 5-7 weeks after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 23 patients with coronary artery disease. Of 22 asynergy segments showing increased FDG uptake preoperatively, the postoperative PET showed a decrease in FDG uptake in 16 segments (73%) and persistent uptake in 6 segments (27%). The improvement in asynergy was observed in all of the segments showing postoperative decrease in FDG uptake, while it was observed in only 50% of those with persistent FDG uptake (p less than 0.01). On the other hand, 4 of 5 segments showing a new FDG uptake postoperatively revealed deterioration of wall motion abnormality. These data suggest that an increase in exogenous glucose utilization may often persist in postischemic myocardium. Improvement in regional function seems to be associated with the improvement in metabolic abnormality after CABG.
