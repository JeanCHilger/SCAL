Effects of W-CDMA 1950 MHz EMF emitted by mobile phones on regional cerebral blood flow in humans. Use of the third generation mobile phone system is increasing worldwide. This is the first study to investigate the effects of the third generation system on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in humans. We compared effects of the electromagnetic field (EMF) emitted from the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA) cellular system versus sham control exposure on rCBF in humans. Nine healthy male volunteers participated in this study. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans were obtained before, during, and after unilateral 30 min EMF exposure. The subtraction analysis revealed no significant rCBF changes caused by the EMF conditions compared with the sham exposure, suggesting that EMF emitted by a third generation mobile phone does not affect rCBF in humans.
