Didactic and experiential training to teach communication skills: the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine collaborative experience. Teaching communication skills to veterinary students is recognized as important however, incorporation of this into an already crowded curriculum is difficult. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine we provide mandatory communication lectures to freshmen and sophomores, and offer elective experiential courses to juniors and seniors. Providing both didactic and experiential training allows students to learn and practice communication techniques in a "safe" setting. Our approach to experiential training is unique in that graduate students in counseling psychology (masters and doctoral level) act as "clients" for the juniors, and professional simulated pet owners are hired for digitally captured role-plays with the seniors. A unique inter-professional partnership has been formed between the Schools of Veterinary Medicine, Education (Department of Counseling Psychology), and (Human) Medicine and Public Health to provide this experiential training for our students. The purpose of this article is to describe the communication training program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine and to encourage other programs to reach across campus and partner with other colleges with the goal of improving training for all of the individuals involved.
