Recurrence-free long-term survival after liver transplantation in patients with 18F-FDG non-avid hilar cholangiocarcinoma on PET. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the value of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET) for predicting biological tumor behavior and outcome after liver transplantation (LT) in patients with otherwise unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC). Preoperative (18)F-FDG-PET scanning was performed in 13 patients with type IV Klatskin tumor before LT. PET+ status indicated patients with an increased pretransplant (18)F-FDG uptake, whereas PET- recipients had no increased preoperative (18)F-FDG uptake on PET. Pretransplant PET findings were correlated with histopathological tumor characteristics and patient outcome after LT. Eight patients demonstrated positive preoperative PET findings (61.5%), whereas five patients had no increased preoperative (18)F-FDG tumor uptake (38.5%) on PET. One PET+ patient died after 1 month due to liver allograft dysfunction. Seven PET+ liver recipients developed tumor recurrence, whereas five PET- patients were tumor-free alive after a median of 76 months post-LT (p = 0.001). The 2-year recurrence-free survival rate after LT was 100% in PET- patients and 28.6% in the PET+ population (log-rank = 0.008). Our results suggest that patients with (18)F-FDG non-avid HC on PET may achieve recurrence-free long-term survival after LT.
