In vitro genotoxicity of dimethyl terephthalate. Dimethyl terephthalate (DMTP), the para configuration of dimethyl phthalate, is one of the basic monomers used in the synthesis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics. Human exposure to DMTP may primarily occur during the manufacture of PET fibers and films. The mutagenic potential of dimethyl terephthalate was evaluated using a battery of in vitro short-term tests: the Ames test DNA single-strand break assays in CO60 cells and in primary rat hepatocytes
