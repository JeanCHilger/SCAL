Standard therapy of advanced Hodgkin lymphoma. ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) continues to be the standard of care for patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Consolidation of primary chemotherapy with radiation or autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has not demonstrated an improvement in overall survival in randomized controlled trials. Regimens such as escalated BEACOPP have more acute and late toxicities and survival benefits have yet to be confirmed. Despite effective therapy, ultimately 30% to 40% of patients with advanced HL will relapse. ASCT has become the standard of care for patients with relapsed or refractory HL based on two randomized trials. The optimal salvage chemotherapy and high dose therapy regimen are not known. Similarly, non-ASCT strategies including salvage radiotherapy or non-ASCT chemotherapy strategies have been reported and have a potential role in selected clinical scenarios. This review summarizes recent clinical trial results in the initial treatment of advanced HL and will focus on second-line treatment strategies for patients with relapsed or refractory disease.
