Neuropathic pain and neuroplasticity in functional imaging studies. Neuropathic pain syndromes are characterised by the occurrence of spontaneous ongoing and stimulus-induced pain. Stimulus-induced pain (hyperalgesia and allodynia) may result from sensitisation processes in the peripheral (primary hyperalgesia) or central (secondary hyperalgesia) nervous system. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms at the nociceptor itself and at spinal synapses have become better understood. However, the cerebral processing of hyperalgesia and allodynia is still controversially discussed. In recent years, neuroimaging methods (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI magnetoencephalography, MEG
