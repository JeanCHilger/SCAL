Advances in radiotherapy of head and neck cancers. Radiation therapy plays a key role in the management of head and neck cancers (HNCs). We reviewed the recent advances in radiotherapy of HNCs and the role of imaging in treatment planning.As shown in a recent update of meta-analysis of chemotherapy in head and neck cancer (MACH-NC), concurrent chemoradiotherapy was confirmed to be a standard of care in the management of locally advanced HNCs. Two recent large-scale randomized trials [Groupe d'Oncologie Radiothérapie Tête et Cou (GORTEC) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)] failed to show additional benefit when combining accelerated radiotherapy with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Updated 5-year results of a phase III pivotal trial confirmed the benefit of targeting epidermal growth factor receptor with cetuximab when combined with radiotherapy. Taxane-platinum-fluorouracil-based induction chemotherapy has been established as a reference induction regimen and has been explored as a possible part of the treatment of locally advanced HNCs, which was particularly successful in larynx preservation. The superiority of intensity-modulated radiation therapy compared with conventional radiotherapy for parotid protection has been shown in a prospective phase III trial. PET-based treatment planning is still to be validated in the HNCs.Concurrent chemoradiotherapy could still be considered as a standard of care several new treatment combinations and new radiation technologies have been recently successfully evaluated in clinical trials.
