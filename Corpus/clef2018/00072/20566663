Increased brain fatty acid uptake in metabolic syndrome. To test whether brain fatty acid uptake is enhanced in obese subjects with metabolic syndrome (MS) and whether weight reduction modifies it.We measured brain fatty acid uptake in a group of 23 patients with MS and 7 age-matched healthy control subjects during fasting conditions using positron emission tomography (PET) with [(11)C]-palmitate and [(18)F]fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid ([(18)F]-FTHA). Sixteen MS subjects were restudied after 6 weeks of very low calorie diet intervention.At baseline, brain global fatty acid uptake derived from [(18)F]-FTHA was 50% higher in patients with MS compared with control subjects. The mean percentage increment was 130% in the white matter, 47% in the gray matter, and uniform across brain regions. In the MS group, the nonoxidized fraction measured using [(11)C]-palmitate was 86% higher. Brain fatty acid uptake measured with [(18)F]-FTHA-PET was associated with age, fasting serum insulin, and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index. Both total and nonoxidized fractions of fatty acid uptake were associated with BMI. Rapid weight reduction decreased brain fatty acid uptake by 17%.To our knowledge, this is the first study on humans to observe enhanced brain fatty acid uptake in patients with MS. Both fatty acid uptake and accumulation appear to be increased in MS patients and reversed by weight reduction.
