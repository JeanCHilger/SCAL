Copper 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane- Somatostatin is a tetradecapeptide acting as an inhibitor of the release of somatotropin, glucagon, gastrointestinal hormones, and other secretory proteins. The targeting of somatostatin receptors with radiolabeled peptides has led to the development of a variety of agents for both diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy of somatostatin receptor-positive tumors, an area of cancer research where considerable progress has been made over the last few years.
