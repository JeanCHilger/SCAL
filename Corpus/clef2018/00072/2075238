Improvement in Fourier analysis of gated blood-pool studies using single photon emission computed tomography: methodology and clinical feasibility. We have developed a new method for obtaining reconstructed left ventricular (LV) planar images acquired from multidirectional views using gated blood-pool single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and have applied Fourier analysis to these planar images. In this paper, we describe the methodology of our new technique and discuss its feasibility for the detection of LV wall motion abnormalities (WMA) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Sagittal long-axis, horizontal long-axis and short-axis sections of the LV were generated from the reconstructed transaxial tomograms. Sections covering only the LV at the same phase of the cardiac cycle were added to reconstruct planar images. Fourier analysis was then performed to construct phase and amplitude images. In 42 patients with significant WMA, a comparative study concerning the detection of WMA was performed between conventional and SPECT methods. The SPECT method had greater sensitivity in all segments of the LV, with no significant loss in specificity. In particular, the sensitivity of the SPECT method was significantly greater than that of the conventional method for inferior and posterior WMA (91% vs 57% and 76% vs 35%, respectively). The method described here shows greater clinical effectiveness for the detection of LV WMA in patients with CAD.
