SPECT imaging of dopamine transporters with (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 in major depression and Parkinson's disease. To investigate dopamine transporter in major depressive disorder and Parkinson's disease, the authors obtained single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain images from 13 patients with major depression, 17 Parkinson's disease patients, and 10 healthy volunteers by using 99mTc-TRODAT-1. The authors found the 99mTc-TRODAT-1 radio signal in the striatum was reduced in the majority of patients with major depressive disorder, and this decrease was even more severe in patients with Parkinson's disease. The results support the hypothesis of dopamine hypofunction in major depressive disorder and suggest that deficient dopamine transporter may be involved in the etiology of severe major depressive disorder.
