Imaging of mesothelioma. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an asbestos-related neoplasm that originates in pleural mesothelial cells and progresses locally along the pleura until it encases the lungs and mediastinum, ultimately causing death. Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosis and optimal management. Computed tomography (CT) continues to be the primary and initial imaging modality. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) complements CT scan and is superior in determining chest wall and diaphragmatic invasion. FDG18-PET/CT provides anatamo-metabolic information and is superior to both CT and MRI in overall staging and monitoring response to therapy. This chapter will detail the imaging finding of MPM and role of imaging in guiding management.
