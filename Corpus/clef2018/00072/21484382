Dosimetry of yttrium-labelled radiopharmaceuticals for internal therapy: 86Y or 90Y imaging? This paper reviews issues concerning (86)Y positron emission tomography (PET), (90)Y PET and (90)Y bremsstrahlung imaging. Specific methods and corrections developed for quantitative imaging, for application in preclinical and clinical studies, and to assess (90)Y dosimetry are discussed. The potential imaging capabilities with the radioisotopes (87)Y and (88)Y are also considered. Additional studies required to assess specific unaddressed issues are also identified.
