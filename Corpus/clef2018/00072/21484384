Three-dimensional radiobiological dosimetry (3D-RD) with 124I PET for 131I therapy of thyroid cancer. Radioiodine therapy of thyroid cancer was the first and remains among the most successful radiopharmaceutical (RPT) treatments of cancer although its clinical use is based on imprecise dosimetry. The positron emitting radioiodine, (124)I, in combination with positron emission tomography (PET)/CT has made it possible to measure the spatial distribution of radioiodine in tumors and normal organs at high resolution and sensitivity. The CT component of PET/CT has made it simpler to match the activity distribution to the corresponding anatomy. These developments have facilitated patient-specific dosimetry (PSD), utilizing software packages such as three-dimensional radiobiological dosimetry (3D-RD), which can account for individual patient differences in pharmacokinetics and anatomy. We highlight specific examples of such calculations and discuss the potential impact of (124)I PET/CT on thyroid cancer therapy.
