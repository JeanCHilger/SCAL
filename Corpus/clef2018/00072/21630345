Quantitative myocardial perfusion imaging with a MR cold pressor test. The response of myocardial blood flow to sympathetic stimulation with cold is modulated by endothelium-related factors. As endothelial dysfunction is an early step in patients with coronary artery disease, the aim of this study was to establish a cold pressor test (CPT) setting for quantitative analysis of myocardial perfusion in a MR scanner. First pass perfusion studies were performed in 10 healthy volunteers using a 1.5 T MR scanner with a multislice steady state free precession perfusion trueFISP sequence in prebolus technique (1 cc/4 cc gadobenate dimeglumine). MR-CPT was established using an over head ice-water bath of the left hand. First pass perfusion imaging was started after 1 min to assure an adequate stimulus followed by a second series after 15 min to evaluate the rest perfusion. After motion correction images were segmented with an adapted, automated tool, myocardial contours were determined. Perfusion was quantitatively evaluated after contamination and baseline correction by deconvolution with the arterial input function using an exponential function model as residuum. All data could be evaluated. Mean myocardial perfusion rose from 0.61 ± 0.22 cc/g/min at rest to 1.15 ± 0.34 cc/g/min under CPT. MR myocardial perfusion values show a comparable increase under CPT as published positron emission tomography data. Consequently, CPT for the presence of endothelial dysfunction is feasible in the MR environment.
