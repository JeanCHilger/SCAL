Influence of CT-based attenuation correction in assessment of left and right ventricular functions with count-based gated blood-pool SPECT. Influence of CT-based attenuation correction (CT-AC) in assessment of left and right ventricular functions with count-based gated blood-pool SPECT (GBPS) was evaluated in a mixed population.Thirty-two patients (81% male mean age 56 ± 12) referred for various symptoms or heart diseases were prospectively included. Data from 32 GBPS acquisitions were reconstructed using an iterative algorithm with (IRAC) and without (IRNC) CT-AC and analyzed using previously described segmentation software based on the watershed algorithm. LV and RV EF and volumes were assessed with and without CT-AC and compared.EF and volumes were correlated (P < .001 for all parameters with r = 0.97 for LV and RV EF r = 0.96 for LV EDVAssessment of both left and right ventricular functions by count-based GBPS with CT-AC showed higher volumes and lower EF. Differences were slight, especially for the range of normal to subnormal ventricular volumes.
