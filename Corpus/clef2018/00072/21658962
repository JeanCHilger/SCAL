Synthesis and radiolabeling of chelator-RNA aptamer bioconjugates with copper-64 for targeted molecular imaging. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) aptamers with high affinity and specificity for cancer-specific cell-surface antigens are promising reagents for targeted molecular imaging of cancer using positron emission tomography (PET). For this application, aptamers must be conjugated to chelators capable of coordinating PET-radionuclides (e.g., copper-64, (64)Cu) to enable radiolabeling for in vivo imaging of tumors. This study investigates the choice of chelator and radiolabeling parameters such as pH and temperature for the development of (64)Cu-labeled RNA-based targeted agents for PET imaging. The characterization and optimization of labeling conditions are described for four chelator-aptamer complexes. Three commercially available bifunctional macrocyclic chelators (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triacetic acid mono N-hydroxysuccinimide [DOTA-NHS] S-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid [p-SCN-Bn-NOTA]
