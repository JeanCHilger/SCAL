Cloning, soluble expression, rapid purification and characterization of human Cofilin1. Cofilin1 is an actin-binding protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and consequently affects various physiological processes. In this study, the human Cofilin1 cDNA was cloned into the expression vector pET-28a(+) with a 6 Ã— His tag and expressed as soluble protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Approximately 78 mg of Cofilin1, which showed high activity as determined by native PAGE, could be purified from each liter of LB medium by His-tag affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Further, high-titer IgG against Cofilin1 was positively detected after immunization in rabbits and the polyclonal antibodies were purified and identified. Together, this report provides the first protocol to efficiently obtain human Cofilin1 with high biological activity and immunogenicity using E. coli BL21 (DE3) expression system.
