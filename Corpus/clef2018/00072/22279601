Asymptomatic melanoma of the superior cavo-atrial junction: The challenge of imaging. METASTATIC LESIONS IN THE SUPERIOR VENA CAVA AND THE RIGHT ATRIUM ARE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE: in computed tomography (CT), they are easily misinterpreted as artifacts, and the same region may be difficult to access using echocardiography. We present a case of asymptomatic metastasis of a malignant melanoma which was overlooked initially due to deficiencies in imaging. Using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-CT, the metastasis was clearly identified and finally treated successfully. We discuss the diagnostic value of the various imaging modalities for intracardiac masses.
