Evaluation of the angiogenesis inhibitor KR-31831 in SKOV-3 tumor-bearing mice using (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(121) and microPET. KR-31831 ((2R,3R,4S)-6-amino-4-[N-(4-chloropheyl)-N-(1H-imidazol-2ylmethyl)amino]-3-hydroxyl-2-methyl-2-dimethoxymethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran), an angiogenesis inhibitor, was evaluated in tumor-bearing mice using molecular imaging technology. Pre-treatment microPET images were acquired on SKOV-3 cell-implanted nude mice after injection with (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(121). KR-31831 (50 mg/kg) was then injected intraperitoneally into the treatment group (n=3), while injection vehicle was injected into the control (n=4) and blocking (n=3) groups. After injections occurred daily for 28 days, all groups of mice underwent post-treatment microPET imaging after injection with (64)Cu-DOTA-VEGF(121). The post-treatment images showed high tumor uptake in the control group and reduced tumor uptake in both the blocking and treatment groups. ROI analysis of the tumor images revealed 6.25%±1.18% ID/g at 1 h, 6.55%±0.69% ID/g at 2 h, and 4.68%±0.63% ID/g at 16 h in the control group 3.87%±0.45% ID/g at 1 h, 4.50%±0.44% ID/g at 2 h, and 3.63%±0.25% ID/g at 16 h in the blocking group
