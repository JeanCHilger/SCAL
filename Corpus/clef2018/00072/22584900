Comparison of in vitro and in vivo ultraviolet protective properties of PET textile samples. Many studies have been devoted to the problem of harmful effects of UV radiation on human skin. The incidence rate for all forms of skin cancer is rising quickly. Considering this fact, there is currently a need for diligent preventive work, not only from dermatologists but also from other doctors and scientists. Textiles represent simple and effective protection against UV radiation. Good protective clothing can reduce UV radiation on the surface of skin by at least 95%. Even though numerous studies present the effects of various textile parameters on UV protection, not many have been conducted for determining the degree of agreement between in vivo and in vitro measurements of UPF.This study presents the effect of various constructional parameters on UPF values (determined using spectrophotometry). The phenomenon of minimal erythema doses on the skin of test subjects was tested based on in vitro calculated UPF values.Despite some differences in values, the study nevertheless showed a good correlation between both methods and confirms the congruity of in vivo and in vitro UPF values.It is clear that both methods are needed for a more precise look at the UV protection offered by textiles.
