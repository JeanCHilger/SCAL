Patterns of extension of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) treated with imatinib (Gleevec®) by 18F-FDG PET/CT. currently it is recognized the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET in assessing response to therapy with imatinib (Gleevec®) in the gastrointestinal tract sarcomas (GIST). To facilitate the follow-up of these studies is important to know the patterns of metastatic spread. The aim of this paper is to describe patterns observed in the 18F-FDG PET/CT.retrospective study included 29 patients who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT after being diagnosed with unresectable or metastatic GIST. In total, 87 PET/CT studies were performed (1-6 controls per patient) with a mean time of follow-up 6-36 months. We analyzed the location of the lesions evidenced in PET, CT and fusion. Images were evaluated visually and semiquantitatively (SUV). In cases in which has been considered necessary, additional images have been undertaken: PET delayed imaging, intravenous contrast CT and inspiratory chest CT.the most common primary site was the stomach (41%), small bowel (35%), and rectum (24%). Significant changes in the location of metastatic disease between pre-treatment and the monitoring were observed, with the appearance of more extra-abdominal disease.individualization of protocol studies and interpretation of PET, CT and fused images were required for evaluation of treatment response to imatinib. Hybrid 18F-FDG PET/CT provides an accurate determination of the extent of GIST. While the most common metastatic site is the liver and peritoneum, in the following cases are common extra-abdominal disease.
