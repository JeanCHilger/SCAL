Coronary vasomotor control in obesity and morbid obesity: contrasting flow responses with endocannabinoids, leptin, and inflammation. This study sought to investigate abnormalities in coronary circulatory function in 2 different disease entities of obese (OB) and morbidly obese (MOB) individuals and to evaluate whether these would differ in severity with different profiles of endocannabinoids, leptin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels.There is increasing evidence that altered plasma levels of endocannabinoids, leptin, and CRP may affect coronary circulatory function in OB and MOB.Myocardial blood flow (MBF) responses to cold pressor test from rest and during pharmacologically induced hyperemia were measured with N-13 ammonia positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Study participants (n = 111) were divided into 4 groups based on their body mass index (BMI) (kg/m(2)): 1) control group (BMI: 20 to 24.9, n = 30) 2) overweight group (BMI: 25 to 29.9, n = 31), 3) OB group (BMI: 30 to 39.9, n = 25)The cold pressor test-induced change in endothelium-related MBF response (ΔMBF) progressively declined in overweight and OB groups when compared with the control group [median: 0.19 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.08, 0.27) and 0.11 (0.03, 0.17) vs. 0.27 (0.23, 0.38) ml/g/min p ≤ 0.01, respectively], whereas it did not differ significantly between OB and MOB groups [median: 0.11 (IQR: 0.03, 0.17) and 0.09 (-0.01, 0.19) ml/g/minContrasting associations of altered coronary endothelial function with increases in endocannabinoid anandamide, leptin, and CRP plasma levels identify and characterize OB and MOB as different disease entities affecting coronary circulatory function.
