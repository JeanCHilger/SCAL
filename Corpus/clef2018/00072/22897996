Regression of inflammation in atherosclerosis by the LXR agonist R211945: a noninvasive assessment and comparison with atorvastatin. The aim of this study was to noninvasively detect the anti-inflammatory properties of the novel liver X receptor agonist R211945.R211945 induces reversal cholesterol transport and modulates inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques. We aimed to characterize with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and dynamic contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (DCE-CMR) inflammation and neovascularization, respectively, in atherosclerotic plaques with R211945 treatment compared with atorvastatin treatment and a control.Twenty-one atherosclerotic New Zealand white rabbits were divided into 3 groups (control, R211945 [3 mg/kg orally], and atorvastatin [3 mg/kg orally] groups). All groups underwent (18)F-FDG-PET/CT and DCE-CMR at baseline and at 1 and 3 months after treatment initiation. Concomitantly, serum metabolic parameters and histology were assessed. For statistical analysis, continuous DCE-CMR and PET/CT outcomes were modeled as linear functions of time by using a linear mixed model, whereas the histological data, animal characteristics data, and nonlinear regression imaging data were analyzed with a 2-tailed Student t test.(18)F-FDG-PET/CT detected a decrease in mean and maximum standard uptake values (SUV) over time in the R211945 group (both p = 0.001), indicating inflammation regression. The atorvastatin group displayed no significant change (p = 0.371 and p = 0.600, respectively), indicating no progression or regression. The control group demonstrated an increase in SUV (p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively), indicating progression. There was a significant interaction between time and group for mean and maximum SUV (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0016, respectively) . DCE-CMR detected a trend toward difference (p = 0.06) in the area under the curve in the atorvastatin group, suggesting a decrease in neovascularization. There was no significant interaction between time and group (p = 0.6350 and p = 0.8011, respectively). Macrophage and apolipoprotein B immunoreactivity decreased in the R211945 and atorvastatin groups (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0004, respectively), and R211945 decreased oxidized phospholipid immunoreactivity (p = 0.02).Noninvasive imaging with (18)F-FDG-PET/CT and DCE-CMR and histological analysis demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects of the LXR agonist R211945 compared with atorvastatin. The results suggest a possible role for LXR agonists in the treatment of atherosclerosis.
