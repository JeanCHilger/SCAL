Pathology of temporal lobe foci: correlation with CT, MRI, and PET. Twenty-six patients with medically refractory complex partial seizures had temporal lobectomy after evaluation, which included prolonged scalp EEG recordings, positron emission tomography (PET), MRI, and x-ray CT. PET showed a region of focal interictal temporal hypometabolism corresponding to electrographic localization of seizure onset in 21. Five patients had a region of increased MRI signal intensity on the spin echo image in the region of the EEG focus, 2 had an abnormality ipsilateral to but distinct from the EEG focus, and 1 had bilateral findings. CT was abnormal in 3 cases 2 had tumors. Three patients had low grade tumors (1 with a normal PET). PET can detect metabolic dysfunction associated with mild pathologic changes in epileptic foci, but increased signal intensity on MRI does not necessarily correlate with the degree of pathologic abnormality. Tumors may be less likely when both CT and MRI are normal.
