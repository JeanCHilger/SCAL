Evaluation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine. Single-photon emission computed tomography was performed in 29 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) using 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG). Segmental myocardial uptake of MIBG and 201T1 was calculated in 21 patients with primary HCM without history of hypertension. Septal thickness was measured by echocardiography and the relationship to septal MIBG uptake was studied. Initial MIBG uptake and 201T1 uptake showed positive correlation with the septal thickness (R = 0.581, p = 0.0058 and R = 0.677, p = 0.0007). When the septal MIBG uptake was divided by the corresponding 201T1 uptake (MIBG/T1), both the early and delayed MIBG/T1 showed negative correlation with the septal thickness (R = -0.485, p = 0.0255 and R = -0.535, p = 0.0125). Significant positive correlation was observed between septal MIBG clearance and the thickness (R = 0.510, p = 0.0182). In patients with severe septal hypertrophy (greater than 20 mm), the MIBG clearance was significantly higher compared with less hypertrophic (less than or equal to 20 mm) group (13.4 +/- 8.0%/hr vs. 3.2 +/- 4.7%/hr, p = 0.0028). Thus, MIBG was useful for the evaluation of sympathetic innervation and activity in HCM. The MIBG clearance and uptake in conjunction with 201T1 study seemed to reflect the severity of hypertrophy in HCM.
