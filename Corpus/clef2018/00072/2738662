Localization of pheochromocytoma: MIBG [correction of MIGB], CT, and MRI correlation. Nineteen patients (8 M, 11F) ranging in age from 15 - 67 yr old (mean = 39 yr) with clinically diagnosed pheochromocytomas were prospectively evaluated with 131I metaiodobenzyl-guanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy (n = 19), computed tomography (CT) (n = 19), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n = 17) in order to determine their relative diagnostic efficacy. Pathologic confirmation was obtained in all 19 patients: 13 intraadrenal and six extraadrenal with metastases in five (Table 1). All three imaging modalities were in agreement in 11 of 14 completed examinations (79%). MIBG and CT agreed in 16 of the 19 patients in whom both were performed (84%). MIBG/MR and CT/MR results were concordant in 12 of 14 (86%) and 13 of 14 (93%) jointly completed examinations, respectively. There was one false-negative (FN) MIBG scan, two FN CT scans, and one FN MR scan. MIBG, CT, and MRI are complementary procedures with MIBG providing more specific functional information and the latter two superior anatomic detail. MIBG scintigraphy is recommended as the initial localizing study of choice (especially for the detection of extraadrenal disease and postoperative recurrence), as a guide for CT and/or MR and specific functional confirmation of their findings. Although MRI is capable of imaging in multiple planes (without exposure to ionizing radiation or the need for i.v. contrast material) with superior contrast compared to CT, it is expensive and has poor patient cooperation. However, it may be capable of differentiating pheochromocytomas from other adrenal masses on the basis of signal characterization.
