Nuclear medicine: current aspects and future. A survey of the range and progress of nuclear medicine procedures is presented and the accuracy of the modalities is described. The priority in nuclear medicine diagnosis has shifted from proof of the non-functioning nodule to localization of biochemical lesions with the aid of new bioindicators and single photon and positron emission computer tomography. Diagnosis has extended to subcellular regions with the introduction of immunoscintigraphy as well as enzyme and receptor scintigraphy. This is a new dimension to which Swiss nuclear medicine specialists have contributed a great deal.
