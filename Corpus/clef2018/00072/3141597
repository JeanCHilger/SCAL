Performance characteristics of a whole-body positron tomograph. This paper describes an investigation of some of the important physical characteristics of a whole-body positron tomograph consisting of two rings of bismuth germanate detectors of dimensions 5.6 mm X 30 mm X 30 mm (512/ring). The resolution applicable to in vivo imaging is six mm or more, depending on radionuclide and reconstruction filter and is very uniform over the field of view normally used. Axial resolution can be varied by moving side collimation (maximum approximately 16 mm FWHM with interplane septa). A simple scheme has been devised to correct for loss of true coincidence events with varying count rate based on the total random and multiple coincidence rates. It is concluded that correction for scattered radiation should be implemented for reliable quantitation.
