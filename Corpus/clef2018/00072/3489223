Results of fatty acid SPECT of the myocardium in coronary disease. New developments in radiopharmacology of 123I-labeled metabolic tracers and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) allow now-a-days the assessment of parameters of cardiac energy metabolism in well-defined areas of the heart muscle. This article will present a brief outline of the basic pathophysiological principles used in the application of 123I-labeled phenyl fatty acids for the evaluation of CAD. First clinical results suggest an important application of cardiac fatty acid metabolic imaging to the detection, localisation and conceivable quantitation of myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction and assessment of tissue viability. In addition to the diagnostic applications in CAD, cardiac fatty acid metabolic imaging may provide new perspectives to pathophysiological investigations of the coupling of local flow and substrate utilisation in vivo and the effect of therapeutic interventions.
