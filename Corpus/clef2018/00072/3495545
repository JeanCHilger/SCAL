Behavioral activation and the variability of cerebral glucose metabolic measurements. Variability in cerebral glucose metabolism was examined between and within subjects when paired studies were performed in the resting state or in a behaviorally activated state. Both normal and demented subjects were studied twice each, from 1 to 6 weeks apart, under near-identical conditions, using positron emission tomography (PET) and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose. Resting state studies were repeated in nine normal and four demented subjects. A picture-viewing test, used for activation during PET, was used repeatedly in seven normal and five demented subjects. Within-subject variability, as assessed by the percent difference in metabolic rates in paired studies, was reduced by 60-70% for activation state compared to resting state studies in normals. It is concluded that PET studies of brain metabolism, which are designed to study the active brain, should indeed be performed in functionally activated states, as in addition to demonstrating metabolism during a defined functional state, activation studies show reduced variability of cerebral metabolic measures.
