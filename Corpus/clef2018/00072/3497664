Assessment of bone marrow blood flow using positron emission tomography: no relationship with bone marrow cellularity. Bone marrow blood flow has been assessed using positron emission tomography and the 15O-labelled carbon dioxide steady-state technique. The measurements were performed at the site of the posterior iliac crest. The bone marrow blood flow was 10.0 ml/min/100 cm3 +/- 3.0 (SD) in normal volunteers. It was markedly increased in patients with polycythaemia vera (26.9 +/- 4.6), chronic granulocytic leukaemia (25.2 +/- 3.9) and myelofibrosis (35.1 +/- 7.3). However, bone marrow blood flow did not differ from normal in patients with aplastic anaemia, chronic haemolysis or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. There was no relationship between bone marrow cellularity and bone marrow blood flow. The data show that bone marrow blood flow is markedly elevated in polycythaemia vera, myelofibrosis and chronic granulocytic leukaemia and suggest that bone marrow cellularity is not a major factor in regulating bone marrow blood flow.
