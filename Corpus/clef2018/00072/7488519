N-[18F]-fluoroalkylation of noraporphines: microwave versus thermal treatment. A comparable study of microwave versus thermal heating is described for the N-[18F]-fluoroalkylation of noraporphines. As compared to thermal treatment, different products were obtained during microwave treatment. Thermal treatment resulted in the loss of the protection of the catechol functionality of the noraporphines (O-deacylation), whereas during microwave treatment N-[18F]-fluoroalkylation was observed. The results described in this report might suggest that the influence of microwaves on chemical transformations is not exclusively thermal.
