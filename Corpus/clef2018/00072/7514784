Post extracorporeal membrane oxygenation single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as a predictor of neurodevelopmental outcome. To determine the incidence and site of single photon emission computed tomography scan (SPECT) abnormalities in survivors of neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and to evaluate the efficacy of SPECT scan as a predictor of neurodevelopmental outcome in these infants.Tertiary care neonatal intensive care unit in Detroit, MI.Survivors of neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation who had a SPECT scan of the brain performed after decannulation and before their discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit were included if they had at least 12 months of follow-up in our developmental assessment clinic.The neurological outcome was reported as normal, suspect, and abnormal on the basis of neurological examination and developmental milestones. The developmental outcome was assessed by Bayley mental development index or McCarthy general cognitive index scores.A total of 59 patients met study criteria. SPECT scan abnormalities were noted in 45 (76%) infants. Global hypoperfusion was the most frequent abnormality followed closely by bilateral focal perfusion defects. The distribution of perfusion abnormalities was not significantly different for right and left hemispheres. Among 14 infants with normal SPECT scans, 13 infants had normal neurological outcome and all had a normal developmental outcome. Of the 45 infants with an abnormal SPECT scan, 7 infants had an abnormal neurological outcomes and 4 infants had an abnormal developmental outcome. SPECT scan abnormalities had no significant correlation with neurodevelopmental outcome of these infants.Although a normal SPECT scan was more likely to predict a normal neurodevelopmental outcome, an abnormal SPECT scan did not predict an abnormal outcome in these infants.
