Changes in myocardial oxygen consumption and efficiency with heart failure therapy measured by 11C acetate PET. The application of 11C acetate kinetics determined by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has been proposed as a noninvasive means to measure myocardial oxygen consumption in order to determine myocardial efficiency. Such an approach considers the balance of the effect of ventricular performance and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2), which may be important in the assessment of heart failure but is not usually evaluated by current methods. In this paper, the authors review their previously published series of studies, in which the aim was to: first, apply the 11C acetate PET approach in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy in order to determine myocardial oxidative metabolism and estimate myocardial efficiency second, verify a correlation between 11C acetate kinetics and directly measured MVO2
