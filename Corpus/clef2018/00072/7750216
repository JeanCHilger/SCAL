Gastric Ga-67 uptake in patients with lymphoma. Gastric accumulation of Ga-67 greater than that seen in the liver was observed in 16 of 162 (9.8%) patients with lymphoma. Endoscopic biopsies in six patients showed one instance each of histiocytic lymphoma, mixed cellularity Hodgkin's disease, adenocarcinoma, and hiatal hernia with mucosal deformity, as well as two instances of benign gastric ulcer. All six patients had chronic gastric symptoms, as well as persistent radiogallium accumulation on sequential examinations of 2 years duration. The remaining 10 patients exhibited transient radiotracer gastric uptake and only two has gastric symptoms. Persistent gastric Ga-67 accumulation is not common in lymphoma and warrants endoscopy when accompanied by prolonged symptoms.
