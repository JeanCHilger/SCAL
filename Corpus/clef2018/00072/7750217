Indium-111 OncoScint CR/OV and F-18 FDG in colorectal and ovarian carcinoma recurrences. Early observations. Indium-111 satumomab pendetide (In-111 OncoScint) planar and SPECT imaging and F-18 FDG positron emission tomography (PET) have been found individually to be helpful in the detection of recurrent colorectal and ovarian cancer, but have not been compared. Twelve patients who were examined for recurrent colorectal or ovarian carcinoma underwent both In-111 OncoScint imaging and F-18 FDG PET imaging. All had normal or equivocal results of CT or MR studies. Tumor detection abilities were similar in most cases. However, Oncoscint demonstrated an advantage in the detection of carcinomatosis. PET demonstrated an advantage in detecting focal tumor recurrence in one case and, not unexpectedly, in detecting liver metastases. All positive nuclear studies for tumor were found to be true-positives at pathology (7 patients), or by diagnostic new CT changes (1 patient). Finally, unreported, bone marrow, bowel, and colostomy sites appear to be normal sites of localization of F-18 FDG 1 hour after injection.
