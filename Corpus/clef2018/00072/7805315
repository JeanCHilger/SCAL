Prominence of the C2 vertebra on SPECT. A normal variant. Mild preferential focal uptake of Tc-99m HDP in the spinous process of C2 was identified with SPECT of the cervical spine performed in patients in whom the indication for bone scintigraphy was suspected of lesions in the limbs. Its presence in all 21 subjects indicates that such uptake is a normal finding.
