A study on the pulmonary amine imaging in asthmatic patients and guinea pig asthma models. Scintigraphic technique (SPECT) with intravenous injection of 131I-HIPDM was used to study pulmonary amine imaging in asthmatic patients and Guinea pig animal models. The results showed that the patients and animals had similar characteristic changes of amine imaging: the amine scanning pictures were not well-distributed, pulmonary amine uptake was significantly decreased but the clearance speed significantly increased as compared with those in healthy controls (P < 0.05-0.01). The only difference between the patients and the animals was that the amine imaging parameters in animals during remission recovered practically to normal, while that in patients during remission did not. The mechanism and clinical significance of the above changes were discussed.
