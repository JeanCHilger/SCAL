NMR studies of human brain function. Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy make it possible to measure localized changes in human brain activity and metabolism in single subjects during sensory stimulation and cognition. Differences between stimulated and unstimulated subjects can be visualized to a resolution of mm3 in less than 1s, a significant improvement over the more established method, positron emission tomography. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the human brain, measuring fluxes in several cm3, has followed changes in metabolic rates during visual stimulation.
