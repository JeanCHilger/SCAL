Enhancement of myocardial [fluorine-18]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by a nicotinic acid derivative. Recently, the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique was shown to give excellent image quality during metabolic steady-state conditions. Acipimox is a new potent nicotinic acid derivative that rapidly reduces serum free fatty acid (FFA) levels by inhibiting lipolysis in peripheral tissue.To compare the effects of acipimox administration and insulin clamp on [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) uptake and myocardial glucose utilization, five nondiabetic and seven type II diabetic patients who had had previous myocardial infarctions were studied twice: once during a clamp study and once after the administration of acipimox (2 x 250 mg orally). All patients also underwent resting SPECT perfusion imaging prior to PET scans.The patients tolerated acipimox well. Although fasting plasma glucose levels were higher in diabetic patients (9.2 +/- 3.4 versus 5.5 +/- 0.3 mM, p = 0.03), they were decreased both during clamping and after acipimox during imaging, no significant differences between the groups and approaches were detected. By visual analysis, the image quality and myocardial [18F]FDG uptake patterns were similar during clamping and after acipimox. Compared with the relative [18F]FDG uptake values obtained during clamping, acipimox yielded similar results in normal, mismatch and scar segments (r = 0.88, p = 0.0001). Similar rMGU values were also obtained during both approaches.Thus, PET imaging with [18F]FDG after the administration of acipimox is a simple and feasible method for clinical viability studies both in nondiabetic and diabetic patients. It results in excellent image quality and gives rMGU levels similar to the insulin clamp technique.
