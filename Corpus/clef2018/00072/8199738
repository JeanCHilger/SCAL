Residual left ventricular pump function following acute myocardial infarction in postmenopausal diabetic women. The Framingham Study indicated that women with diabetes mellitus developed cardiac failure four times more often than those without diabetes mellitus after acute myocardial infarction. However, there is little information on residual left ventricular pump function after myocardial infarction in female diabetic patients.To evaluate the difference between postmenopausal women and age-matched men in the impact of diabetes mellitus on left ventricular pump function during the first year after myocardial infarction, radionuclide angiography was performed during the third week after acute myocardial infarction and again 1 year later in 50 patients (21 women, 29 men) with diabetes mellitus and 62 patients (25 women, 37 men) without diabetes mellitus.Although the radionuclide angiographic indices did not change during the first year after myocardial infarction in non-diabetic patients, left ventricular end-diastolic volume increased, and the left ventricular ejection fraction, the regional ejection fraction of the non-infarcted area, and the ratio of arterial systolic blood pressure to left ventricular end-systolic volume (pressure:volume ratio) decreased in the diabetic patients. Furthermore, the degree of change in the left ventricular end-diastolic volume, the left ventricular ejection fraction, the regional ejection fraction of the non-infarcted area, and the pressure:volume ratio in diabetic women was larger than that in diabetic men.The increase in the left ventricular end-diastolic volume and the decrease in the regional ejection fraction of the non-infarcted area during the first year after myocardial infarction in postmenopausal women with diabetes mellitus indicate that female sex associated with diabetes mellitus may be important factors in left ventricular remodeling in postmenopausal women.
