Brain imaging in late-life schizophrenia and related psychoses. Despite disagreements about nomenclature, patients who develop schizophrenic or schizophrenia-like symptoms in later life are often seen in clinical practice. Questions about the etiology of late-life psychotic disorders and about their similarities or differences from early-onset disorders remain unanswered. Neuro-imaging techniques have been used to study patients with late onset of psychosis, and in substantial subgroups of patients (from 25% to 100% in various studies) compared with age-matched control subjects, structural and functional abnormalities have been found. We review the literature on imaging in late-life schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, and we present data from our own investigations of patients with these disorders. We discuss the potential usefulness of imaging evaluations in patients with late-onset disorders, and we offer suggestions for future investigations.
