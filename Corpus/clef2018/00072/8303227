Quantitative D2 dopamine receptor PET and structural MRI changes in late-onset schizophrenia. Late-onset schizophrenia (LOS) is likely a syndrome of diverse etiology. In a series of related studies, we compared LOS patients with normal controls, elderly patients with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS), and Alzheimer's disease patients, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuroreceptor positron emission tomography measures, which had previously been reported to be abnormal in EOS. EOS and LOS patients showed similar MRI changes. LOS drug-naive patients had elevated Bmax (receptor density) values for dopamine D2 receptors compared with age and gender norms, a phenomenon previously reported by our group in young schizophrenia patients.
