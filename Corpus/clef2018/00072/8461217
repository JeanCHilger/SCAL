Non-invasive three-dimensional localisation of arrhythmogenic foci in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and in ventricular tachycardia by radionuclide ventriculography: phase analysis of double-angulated integrated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). A new tomographic technique combined with phase analysis was used to detect premature and ectopic ventricular contraction patterns in 15 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and during ventricular tachycardia in seven patients. Data generated by gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were analysed by backprojection of the Fourier coefficients, double-angulation, and integration to thick slices containing the ventricles, thus allowing visualisation of the contraction patterns in three perpendicular views. The results were compared with those of catheter mapping. In nine patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome the site of initial contraction detected was identical with the site of the accessory pathway found by catheter mapping. The sites of origin of the ventricular tachycardias determined by catheter mapping were within 3 cm of the sites detected by the new technique. This new technique seems to be a promising non-invasive method for localising ectopic ventricular activity that will considerably shorten the time required for subsequent invasive procedures.
