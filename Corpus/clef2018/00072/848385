Automated data processing. An essential decision-making aid in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Automated data processing is playing an increasing role in evaluations of left ventricular function, infarct size, and ventricular dysrhythmia in patients with acute myocardial infarction. For example, radionuclide angiocardiography permits accurate, serial non-invasive assessments of ejection fraction and detection of ventricular wall motion abnormalities estimation of infarct size from observed and projected plasma CPK changes facilitates evaluation of interventions designed to reduce ischemic injury
