Single photon emission computerized tomography in obsessive compulsive disorder: a preliminary study. Patterns of cerebral perfusion in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder were evaluated using single photon emission computerized tomography. Eleven patients, who satisfied the DSM-III-R criteria and Research Diagnostic Criteria for the disorder, were evaluated using the distribution of 99m-Tc-HMPAO as a radiotracer. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale was administered to each patient to assess the severity of their symptoms. The images obtained were evaluated qualitatively and semi-quantitatively by a physician in nuclear medicine who was blind to the patients' diagnoses. Eight of the 11 patients demonstrated asymmetric perfusion of the basal ganglia the left side showed impaired perfusion in six patients.
