New agents and new techniques in nuclear cardiology. With the availability of new 99mTc perfusion tracers, nuclear cardiology imaging techniques can provide information on myocardial blood flow and left ventricular function from a single imaging session. Ejection fraction, regional wall motion, and changes in wall thickness can be measured and specificity can be improved by gating the images, without increasing the acquisition time. Similarly, the ability to use conventional gamma cameras to image important positron-emission tomography radiotracers, such as fluorodeoxyglucose, allow cost-effective and widespread applications of positron-emission tomography technology. Thus, new radiotracers and imaging techniques in nuclear cardiology provide incremental and cost-effective diagnostic information in the assessment of coronary artery disease.
