Functional brain maps of retrieval mode and recovery of episodic information. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to identify brain regions associated with two component processes of episodic retrieval those related to thinking back in subjective time (retrieval mode) and those related to actual recovery of stored information (ecphory). Healthy young subjects recognized words that had been encoded with respect to meaning or the speaker's voice. Regardless of how the information had been encoded, recognition was associated with increased activation in regions in right prefrontal cortex, left anterior cingulate, and cerebellum. These activations reflect retrieval mode. Recognition following meaning encoding was specifically associated with increased activation in left temporal cortex, and recognition following voice encoding involved regions in right orbital frontal and parahippocampal cortex. These activations reflect ecphory of differentially encoded information.
