Are hallucinogens psychoheuristic? The author argues in this chapter for a reconsideration of the perception of hallucinogens as being only toxic, damaging, and therefore strictly condemnable for being abused. The author advocates that hallucinogens be viewed as powerful psychoheuristic tools that, in combination with other necessary conceptual (such as holarchic theory) and laboratory tools (such as PET scan or MRI), may help solve a major mystery of nature: the workings of human brains and minds.
