Three-dimensional bone scintigraphy using volume-rendering technique and SPECT. Three-dimensional bone scintigraphic images were made and their usefulness and limitations discussed.After usual bone scan procedures, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) data were taken and reconstructed into three-dimensional images. Volume rendering methods were used.Three cases of three-dimensional bone scintigraphy were obtained one of a normal patient, one of a case of transplanted kidney and incomplete fracture of the left femoral head, and one of a case of degenerative joint disease (DJD) on the left temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The three-dimensional structure of the skeletal system was depicted more clearly by the three-dimensional images than by a conventional bone scan.Three-dimensional bone scintigraphs were thought to provide additional information for better understanding of the nature of bone lesions. Some technical improvements including automated threshold level determination and feature extraction for detecting abnormal high uptake are required before routine use can be envisaged.
