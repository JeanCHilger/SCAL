Decline in glucose metabolism in the brain in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) in English setter--evidence by positron emission tomography (PET). Positron emission tomography scans were performed on brains of homozygous and heterozygous English setters with neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis (NCL) from 13 months of age to 24-25 months of age for homozygous dogs and to 38 months for heterozygous dogs, respectively. After iv injection of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), 7 coronal brain scans as well as sequential arterial blood samplings were performed for 45 min under pentobarbital anesthesia. From these data, three different functional images (DAR (standardized uptake value), FDG uptake (fractional uptake) and glucose uptake) were reconstructed and quantitatively analysed. In the age range from 13 to 15 months, glucose images were comparable for both homozygous and heterozygous dogs, so that no differentiation was possible between healthy and diseased dogs on the basis of PET findings. Between 18 and 24 months of age, a drastic decline in glucose metabolism was observed in homozygous dogs, while the decline in glucose utilization was very mild in this period for heterozygous dogs. Furthermore, in PET scans, cerebral atrophy and ventricular enlargement were clearly shown in homozygous dogs. Consequently at the age from 20 to 24 months, a clear differential diagnosis between healthy (heterozygous) and diseased (homozygous) dogs became possible even if the clinical symptoms were still not clear in the latter. We conclude that the biochemical alterations in the brain in canine NCL occurs and progresses very rapidly in the last quarter of their lives.
