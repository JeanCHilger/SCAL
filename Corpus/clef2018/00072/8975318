Computerized tomography with single photon emission (SPECT) with technetium-99m MIBI (99mTc-MIBI) in the identification of viable myocardium in patients with chronic ischemic cardiopathy and left ventricular dysfunction. Resting 99mTc-MIBI cardiac imaging may be poorly accurate in identifying the presence of viable myocardium in patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD). In this study, we directly compared the results of resting 99mTc-MIBI SPECT with initial (1 hr) and delayed (5 hrs) images with those of 99mTc-MIBI SPECT after nitroglycerine (NTG) administration in 31 patients with chronic CAD. All patients also underwent rest-redistribution thallium-201 (201Tl) SPECT. In 8 patients, echocardiography was performed before and after coronary revascularization (Rev). Of 682 myocardial segments, 197 showed a marked reduction (< 50% of peak) in MIBI uptake on initial images. MIBI uptake (> or = 10%) was increased in 47 (24%) segments on delayed images (from 43 +/- 8% to 60 +/- 8%, p < 0.001) and in 54 (27%) segments after NTG (from 42 +/- 8% to 60 +/- 8%, p < 0.001). The results of delayed and NTG MIBI images were in agreement in most segments (n = 160, 81%). The results of delayed and NTG MIBI images were in disagreement in the remaining 37 (19%) segments. In particular, 15 segments showed reversible defects on delayed, but not on NTG MIBI images, while 22 on NTG, but not on delayed MIBI images. All the segments with reversible MIBI defects on delayed and/or NTG images were identified as viable on TI-201. In the 8 pts examined before and after Rev. 83% of segments with reversible MIBI defects on delayed images and 87% of those with reversible defects after NTG showed functional recovery after Rev furthermore, in these patients a significant improvement in global left ventricular function was observed after Rev, as shown by ejection fraction values (from 42 +/- 7% to 47 +/- 7%, p < 0.01). These comparative results show that resting delayed and NTG MIBI imaging provide similar information to identify viable myocardium and to predict functional recovery after coronary Rev in chronic CAD.
