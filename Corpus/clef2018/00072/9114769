F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging alters clinical decision making in patients with impaired ventricular function. The effect of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging on decision making in the selection of patients with impaired ventricular function for revascularization was determined in 87 patients. In 57% of patients, positron emission tomography data influenced management decisions, indicating an important effect of myocardial viability determination on difficult therapy decisions in these patients.
