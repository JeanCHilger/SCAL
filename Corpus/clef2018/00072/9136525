The usefulness and the problems of attenuation correction using simultaneous transmission and emission data acquisition method: studies on normal volunteers and phantom. Attenuation correction using simultaneous transmission data (TCT) and emission data (ECT) acquisition method was applied to 201Tl myocardial SPECT with ten normal adults and the phantom in order to validate the efficacy of attenuation correction using this method. Normal adults study demonstrated improved 201Tl accumulation to the septal wall and the posterior wall of the left ventricle and relative decreased activities in the lateral wall with attenuation correction (p < 0.05: paired t-test). The counts of the posterior wall were however, significantly higher than those of the anterior wall and the lateral wall (p < 0.05: unpaired t-test). Moreover, relative low uptake of the apex was enhanced using attenuation correction. Static phantom studies revealed the self scatter from high 201Tl uptake organs such as the liver and the stomach pushed up the activities in the septal wall and the posterior wall. Cardiac dynamic phantom studies showed partial volume effect due to cardiac motion contributed to under-correction of the apex, which might be overcome using gated SPECT. Although simultaneous TCT and ECT acquisition was conceived of the advantageous method for attenuation correction, miss-correction of the special myocardial segments should be taken into account in assessment of attenuation correction compensated images.
