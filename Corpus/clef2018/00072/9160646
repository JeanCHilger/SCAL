Effects of self-generated sad mood on regional cerebral activity: a PET study in normal subjects. This study investigated the cerebral regions modulated by self-generated sad mood in normal subjects. Eleven healthy men experienced a temporary sad mood by recalling sad personal memories. Two control states were used for comparison: a resting condition, and a condition involving the recall of affectively neutral personal events. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) images were obtained using [15O]-H2O Positron Emission Tomography. A statistical comparison of the images during negative mood and neutral recall conditions revealed that sad mood was associated with a decrease in rCBF in the left dorsolateral prefrontal, left medial prefrontal, and left temporal cortex no increase in activity was noted in this comparison. Our results are consistent with the noted left prefrontal decrease in metabolism found in depressed patients through a variety of methodologies
