Myocardial glucose metabolism is different between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypertensive heart disease associated with asymmetrical septal hypertrophy. Myocardial glucose metabolism has been shown to be heterogeneous in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We tested the hypothesis that myocardial glucose metabolism differs between patients with HCM and those with hypertensive heart disease (HHD) associated with asymmetrical septal hypertrophy. We studied 12 patients with HCM, 7 HHD patients associated with asymmetrical septal hypertrophy using 18F 2-deoxyglucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography. We calculated % FDG fractional uptake in the inter-ventricular septum and posterolateral wall. Heterogeneity of FDG uptake was evaluated by % interregional coefficient of variation of FDG fractional uptake in each wall segment. In both the interventricular septum and posterolateral wall, % FDG fractional uptake was not significantly different between the two groups. The % interregional coefficient of variation for both interventricular septum (10.6 +/- 1.6 vs. 4.1 +/- 0.5, p < 0.01) and posterolateral wall (5.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.5, p < 0.05) was significantly larger in patients with HCM than in HHD patients associated with asymmetrical septal hypertrophy. Echocardiography demonstrated that the degree of asymmetrical septal hypertrophy was similar between the two groups. These results suggest that myocardial glucose metabolism may be more heterogeneous in patients with HCM compared to HHD patients associated with asymmetrical septal hypertrophy, although the left ventricular shape is similar. The difference in the heterogeneity might have resulted from differences in the pathogeneses of the two diseases.
