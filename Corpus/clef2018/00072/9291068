Technical considerations for acquiring and processing indium-111 capromab pendetide images. A diagnostic quality 111In capromab pendetide study depends on parameters such as the quality control of the camera, thorough patient preparation, adequate imaging time and accurate computer processing. Comparisons of different patient preparation methods, imaging times, and camera and processing parameters were evaluated to provide high-quality 111In capromab pendetide images and to develop acquisition and processing parameters for 111In capromab pendetide imaging. SPECT images provide the best views of metastatic pelvic nodal involvement. Volume rendered three-dimensional registration best differentiates between normal vasculature and metastatic disease. Optimal acquisition parameters for delayed imaging included 128 x 128 matrix and 65 sec/step. The LFOV dual-head SPECT camera required only one SPECT acquisition that encompassed both the pelvis and abdomen. Planar and SPECT positioning was critical in evaluating questionable lymph nodes. In processing these images, the most diagnostic results were obtained with a three-dimensional low-pass post filter. The most effective patient preparation consisted of an oral cathartic, enema and catheterization when needed.
