Test/retest reproducibility of iodine-123-betaCIT SPECT brain measurement of dopamine transporters in Parkinson's patients. Iodine-123-beta-CIT has been used as a probe of dopamine transporters in Parkinson's disease patients using SPECT. We studied the test/retest reproducibility of SPECT measures in Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls obtained after injection of [123I])beta-CIT in part to assess the utility of this tracer for longitudinal evaluation of striatal dopamine transporters as a marker of disease progression.Seven Parkinson's disease patients and seven healthy control subjects participated in two [123I]beta-CIT SPECT scans separated by 7-21 days. Subjects were imaged at 24 hr post injection of 360 MBq (9.7 mCi) of [123I]beta-CIT. Two outcome measures were evaluated 1) the ratio of specific striatal (activity associated with DA transporter binding) to nondisplaceable uptake, also designated V3," and 2) the total specific striatal uptake (%SSU) expressed as a percentage of injected radiotracer dose. For both measures, test/retest variability was calculated as the absolute difference of test minus retest divided by the mean of test/retest and expressed as a percent. In addition, the reproducibility of left and right striatal asymmetry and putamen:caudate ratios were determined.The two outcome measures demonstrated excellent test/retest reproducibility for both the Parkinson's disease and healthy subject groups with variability of striatal V3" = 16.8 +/- 13.3% and percent striatal uptake = 6.8 +/- 3.4% for Parkinson's disease patients and V3" = 12.8 +/- 8.9% and %SSU = 7.0 +/- 3.9% for control subjects. There were no statistically significant differences in test/retest variability between control subjects and Parkinson's disease patients for either outcome measure. The reproducibility of left/right asymmetry indices and putamen-to-caudate ratios showed no patient versus control subject differences. The asymmetry index had greater test/retest variability than the other outcome measures.These data suggest that SPECT imaging performed at 24 hr postinjection of [123I]beta-CIT permits calculation of reliable and reproducible measures of dopamine transporters in both Parkinson's disease patients and control subjects and supports the feasibility of using [123I]beta-CIT in the evaluation of disease progression in Parkinson's disease.
