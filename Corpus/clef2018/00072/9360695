Variability of peritoneal equilibration test in children on continuous peritoneal dialysis by repeated testing with solutions of different osmolarity. To evaluate (1) differences in the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) achieved using continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD) solutions containing different amounts of glucose and (2) intraindividual reproducibility of PETs performed twice within an interval of 8 months on CPD, we investigated 39 PETs in 13 children aged 2.4-19.0 years (median 10.6 years) on stable CPD regimens. The fill volume was 1 L/m2 body surface area. We used a standard CPD solution (Fresenius) with a 2.3% glucose content (groups 2.3a and 2.3b) two times within an interval of 1-8 months. A third test was done between the two with a CPD solution of 1.5% glucose (group 1.5). Equilibration quotients, that is, substrate concentration in dialysis fluid divided by substrate concentration in plasma (D/P), did not show any statistically significant differences between groups 1.5 and 2.3a or between groups 2.3a and 2.3b. A significant difference was seen in the decline of glucose content of dialysate between groups 1.5 and 2.3 but not between groups 2.3a and 2.3b. Ultrafiltration was higher in groups 2.3a and 2.3b compared with group 1.5. Inter- and intraindividual variability between solute transfer was small during follow-up in stable CPD patients. Different glucose contents of 1.5 and 2.3 g/dL dialysis fluid had no measurable influence on PET results of stable CPD patients. For standard PETs, reducing the glucose content of dialysis fluid to isoosmolarity is not necessary.
