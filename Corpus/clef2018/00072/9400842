Novel application of breath-hold turbo spin-echo T2 MRI for detection of acute myocardial infarction. To assess the clinical utility of the breath-hold turbo spin-echo T2-weighted MRI in patients with acute myocardial infarction, the results of MRI were compared with those of electrocardiography, coronary angiography, and thallium-201 single photon emission tomography (SPECT) in 23 patients and 5 healthy volunteers. To compare MRI and thallium-SPECT, the left ventricle was divided into five segments, and the presence of myocardial infarction was determined in each segment. MRI demonstrated an abnormally bright signal in 49 of 140 segments (five segments each from 23 patients and 5 volunteers) thallium-SPECT showed a fixed perfusion defect in 52 segments, for an 85% diagnostic concordance rate. The size of the myocardial infarction measured on MRI corresponded well to that measured on thallium-SPECT (r = .70, P < .01). Breath-hold turbo spin-echo T2 MRI can be used for detection of acute myocardial infarction in conjunction with thallium-SPECT, especially when accurate localization of lesion, increased spatial resolution, and anatomic landmarks are needed.
