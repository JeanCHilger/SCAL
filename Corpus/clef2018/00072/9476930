Tumor metabolic rates in sarcoma using FDG PET. In a busy clinical environment, the arterial blood sampling and long imaging time used for the determination of tumor metabolic rates are not always feasible. In this study, the relationship of tumor standard uptake value (SUV) and metabolic rate of FDG (MRFDG) was investigated in a group of patients with sarcoma. To further investigate the implications of reducing blood sampling requirements for determining tumor metabolic rate, the relationship between FDG blood clearance, obtained from serial venous blood sampling and from a hybrid method of early cardiac blood pool imaging, and late venous blood sampling was analyzed.Comparisons of the sarcoma SUV and MRFDG obtained using graphical analysis, dynamic FDG imaging and venous blood sampling were made. Also, venous and hybrid blood time-activity curves were analyzed for similarity and for their effect on the estimated tumor metabolic rate.For this group of patients with sarcoma (n = 42), the tumor SUV and MRFDG had a consistent relationship, with an overall correlation coefficient of 0.94. The MRFDG, determined by venous blood sampling, had a 6% average overestimate, compared to the same value obtained by the hybrid method of early blood pool imaging and late venous sampling.Both the correlation of SUV and MRFDG and the hybrid blood pool/tumor imaging protocol provide clinically feasible methods for obtaining tumor metabolic rate information in a busy clinical PET service.
