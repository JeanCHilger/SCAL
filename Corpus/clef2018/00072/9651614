Imaging and cochlear implant. The auditory pathway imaging may be morphologic and/or functional. The high resolution computed tomography and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide an evaluation of the anatomical and structural landmarks useful for a safe and successful cochlear implantation. The electrical stimulations supplied by the cochlear implant give rise to ascending electrochemical activities reaching the cortex. These activities can be recorded with scalp electrodes by Evoked Potentials (EP) or fields techniques and eventually translated in isochronic or isopotential brain mapping. These techniques provide a very sharp temporal resolution with an imprecise spatial resolution. The late auditory EP of implantees are closely comparable to the responses of normal hearing people. The neuronal metabolism's increase is associated with a cerebral blood flow increase. Comparing regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) between two or more conditions allows the localisation of brain areas involved in a fixed task. Single photon or positron emission tomography and functional MRI (fMRI) demonstrate cBF changes associated with an auditory stimulation. (f)MRI is contraindicated in cochlear implantees.
