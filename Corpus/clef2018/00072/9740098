Validation of the three-dimensional acquisition mode in positron emission tomography for the quantitation of [18F]fluoro-DOPA uptake in the human striata. Three-dimensional (3D) positron emission tomography (PET) is attractive for [18F]fluoro-DOPA studies, since the sensitivity improvement is maximal for radioactive sources located in central planes, which is usually the case for the human striata. However, the image quantitation in that mode must be assessed because of the nearly threefold increase in scattered coincidences. We report the results of [18F]fluoro-DOPA studies performed on six normal volunteers. Each one was scanned in the 3D and two-dimensional (2D) modes on the same tomograph. The quantitation in the 3D and 2D modes was compared for a Patlak graphical analysis with the occipital counts as the input function (Ki) and a striatooccipital ratio analysis. We find that, in 3D PET, a scatter correction is required to preserve the same quantitation as in 2D PET. When the 3D data sets are corrected for scatter, the quantitation of the [18F]fluoro-DOPA uptake, using the Patlak analysis, is similar in the 2D and 3D acquisition modes. Conversely, analysis of the striatooccipital ratio leads to higher values in 3D PET because of a better in-plane resolution. Finally, using the 3D mode, the dose injected to the subjects can be reduced by a factor greater than 1.5 without any loss in accuracy compared to the 2D mode.
