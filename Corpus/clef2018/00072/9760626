SPECT (HMPAO) support for activation of the medial prefrontal cortices during toe graphaesthesia. This experiment was designed to test the construct validity of psychometric analyses that suggested a strong functional association between the accuracy for toe graphaesthesia and selective activation of neurons within the medial prefrontal regions. Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) profiles were obtained for three volunteers (2 men, 1 woman) after they had been exposed to a toe graphaesthesia task or had been exposed to the control setting. The two measurements for each participant were separated by at least one week. Qualitative evaluation, using criteria employed for clinical diagnoses, of serial coronal, sagittal, and horizontal sections clearly indicated a specific increase in uptake of tracer within the rostral one-third to one-half of the medial prefrontal cortices of all three subjects during the toe graphaesthesia task compared to that during baseline conditions. The results are consistent with our neuropsychological research which indicates that toe graphaesthesia may be an accurate and useful indicator of the functional integrity of the medial surfaces of the anterior cerebral hemispheres.
