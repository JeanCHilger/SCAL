Localized MR spectroscopy: basic principles. Radiologic techniques such as positron-emission tomography and single-photon emission tomography have been used for many years to determine metabolic changes in disease processes. Because of increased radiation exposure, these techniques are normally not used to perform extended serial studies to monitor disease processes. This article discusses the basics of MR spectroscopy, various techniques, and terminology used in clinical MR spectroscopy.
