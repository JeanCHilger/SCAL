99mTc-MIBI myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with diabetes. Seventy-four patients with diabetes were taken on both stress and rest 99m-Tc-MIBI SPECT imaging: 44 patients (59.5%) were found having myocardial ischemic disorders, including 28 cases of myocardial ischemia, 7 cases of myocardial infarction and 9 cases of both conditions. 113 segments were involved and 46% were located in the posterior and inferior walls, indicating that the right coronary artery is most susceptive to ischemia. Diabetic patients complicated hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia were at higher risk of either early occurrence of coronary disease. 99mTc-MIBI SPECT imaging is helpful in early diagnosis and therefore is significant in directing.
