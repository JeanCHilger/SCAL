Magnetoencephalography: a new functional diagnostic technique for the neurosciences. We present a review on the technical, methodological and clinical advances in the functional study of the brain by means of magneto-encephalography. We look back the milestones of its historical development, through the work of the major research groups on this field and through our group's works and database (including doctoral thesis). Discussion on the neurophysiological and biomagnetism basis is provided as well as description of technical developments in superconducting detectors (SQUID, Superconducting Quantum Interference Device), signal processing, enhancement of noise-signal ratio and dipole modeling.The need for brain functional studies has led to newer imaging procedures (functional magnetic resonance, PET, SPECT, etc.). Their spatial and temporal resolution and invasivity are compared to that of magneto-encephalography. Current equipment, up to 306 whole-head channels, may accurately detect cortical and subcortical activity. Apart from the physiological activity, it may be applied to a number of conditions: epilepsy (ictal, interictal and presurgical) dementia, movement disorders, stroke, eloquent cortex delimitation prior to tumour or lesion resectionMagnetoencephalography provides with an excellent temporal, very good spatial resolution, acquires in real-time, without references and minimal interference. It entails a great advance in the diagnostic approach in neurosciences.
