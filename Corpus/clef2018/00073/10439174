Cognitive impairment in patients with renal failure is associated with multiple-infarct dementia. Patients undergoing long-term renal replacement therapy (such as dialysis) have an increased risk for significant cognitive impairment, which may result in memory problems and subsequently missed attendance at dialysis. The aim of this study was to try to identify any abnormalities of cerebral perfusion that could explain a patient's cognitive impairment and to determine if the pattern of these abnormalities would suggest a cause.17 patients (13 men mean age, 60 yearsDiscrete cortical defects consistent with infarcts were seen in 14 patients. The mean right and left frontal-to-cerebellar ratio was 0.837 (SD, 0.09) and 0.837 (SD, 0.08), respectively. This was not significantly different from the right and left temporal-to-cerebellar ratios of 0.843 (SD, 0.07) and 0.848 (SD, 0.07), respectively. Both were within normally accepted ranges.Patients in end-stage renal failure who also had cognitive impairment appear to have a high number of cortical defects consistent with infarcts (suggesting a multiple-infarct type of dementia). There was no evidence of Alzheimer-type dementia.
