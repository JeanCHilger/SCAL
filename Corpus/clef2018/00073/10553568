The nurse's role in delivery of radioisotope for ictal SPECT scan. The Medical College of Georgia Hospital and Clinics (MCG) was one of the first centers in the United States (US) to institute a video electroencephalography (EEG) epilepsy monitoring unit and epilepsy surgery program. In order to surgically remove the area in the brain giving rise to seizures, the epileptogenic zone must be identified and localized. One of the newer methods used to identify the epileptogenic seizure focus is the ictal Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scan, which MCG began performing in 1993. The nurses staffing the six bed Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) are trained by the Nuclear Radiology Department and Radiation Safety Officer to bandle the radioisotope during mixing, calibration and injection. The bedside nursing protocol developed assures patient and staff radiation safety and efficacious injection. Over 300 patients have been injected by nurses with a high degree of safety to patients and staff. This has resulted in positive scans that aid diagnosis. The success of the ictal SPECT protocol can be attributed to the active collaboration of our multidisciplinary team.
