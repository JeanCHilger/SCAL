Current and future imaging of acute cerebral ischemia: assessment of tissue viability by perfusion imaging. With the advances and availability of new imaging modalities, the role of imaging of acute stroke has been broadened from making diagnosis to providing valuable information for patient management. We need to have rapid diagnostic modalities that distinguish reversible ischemic tissue from irreversibly damaged tissue for successful thrombolytic therapy. Although diffusion imaging has been reported to have both high sensitivity and specificity for acute ischemia in clinical studies, previous reports do not conclude whether the diffusion abnormality is indicative of reversibly or irreversibly injured tissue. Perfusion imaging such as perfusion magnetic resonance imaging and single-photon emission computed tomography may have the potential for providing useful information that determines tissue viability and/or reversibility. Cerebral blood flow thresholds evaluated by pretreatment single-photon emission computed tomography provide important information that is potentially useful in the management of acute stroke patients with intra-arterial thrombolysis. Perfusion imaging, when combined with diffusion imaging, may thus be potentially useful in improving patient selection for thrombolytic therapy.
