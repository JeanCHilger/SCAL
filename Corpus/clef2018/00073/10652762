Non-invasive evaluation of extracranial and intracranial vascular disease. Over the last 10 years the diagnosis of chronic and acute cerebrovascular disorders has been greatly improved. We have available now not only better anatomical imaging methods that allow a more precise localization and subtyping of the problem, but also physiological methods that look at the function and interaction between the brain's parenchyma and its perfusion.In this article the utility and clinical indications of ultrasonography (duplex and Transcranial Doppler) including the modern techniques of embolus detection are described. Also discussed are Magnetic resonance angiography, perfusion-diffusion magnetic resonance, computed tomographic angiography (angio-CT), single photon emission tomography (SPECT). Clinical examples of real cases exemplify the use of these techniques.
