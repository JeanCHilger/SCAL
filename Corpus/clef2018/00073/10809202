Limited incremental diagnostic values of attenuation-noncorrected gating and ungated attenuation correction to rest/stress myocardial perfusion SPECT in patients with an intermediate likelihood of coronary artery disease. Either gated myocardial perfusion SPECT or attenuation-corrected SPECT can be used to improve specificity in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). We investigated whether attenuation-noncorrected gating and ungated attenuation correction could improve the diagnostic performance of rest/stress perfusion SPECT in patients having an intermediate pretest likelihood of CAD.Sixty-eight patients (29 men, 39 women mean age, 59 +/- 12 y) with coronary artery stenosis > or =70% (1 vessel, n = 13When higher than grade 3 was used as the criterion for CAD, no differences in sensitivity and specificity were found among the 3 methods for each operator. Areas under receiver-operating-characteristic curves for the diagnosis of CAD and stenosis revealed no differences for each modality (P > 0.05 for each comparison).In patients with an intermediate risk of CAD, viewing attenuation-noncorrected gated poststress SPECT and ungated attenuation-corrected rest/stress SPECT images did not improve the diagnostic performance for CAD and stenosis.
