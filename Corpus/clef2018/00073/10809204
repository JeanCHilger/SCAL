Reproducibility and accuracy of gated SPECT for determination of left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction: experimental validation using MRI. Quantitative gated SPECT (QGS) has been used for computation of left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. This study evaluated, first, the effect of injected dose, time of imaging, and background activity on the reproducibility of QGS and, second, the accuracy of QGS, compared with cine MRI, for determining left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions in dogs with and without perfusion defects.Sixteen dogs were subjected to either chronic occlusion of the circumflex artery (group I, no perfusion defect) or acute occlusion of the anterior descending coronary artery (group II, perfusion defect). Both groups underwent serial MRI and SPECT.( QGS was very reproducible using the automated program (r = 0.99997). Correlation between left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 15 and 45 min was poor after the low-dose injection (r = 0.54 SE = 9%) and only fair after the high-dose injection (r = 0.77QGS provides a highly reproducible estimate of LVEF. However, QGS is affected by changes in background activity, time of imaging, and injected dose. In the presence of perfusion defects, QGS overestimated volume relative to MRI. The correlation between QGS- and MRI-derived LVEF was poor in this canine model.
