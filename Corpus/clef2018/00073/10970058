Neural bases of learning and memory: functional neuroimaging evidence. Positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have identified brain regions associated with different forms of memory. Working memory has been associated primarily with the bilateral prefrontal and parietal regions semantic memory with the left prefrontal and temporal regions
