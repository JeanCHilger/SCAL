Cardiac sympathetic dysfunction contributes to left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction. To investigate the role of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system in left ventricular remodelling, 50 patients with first-time acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and patency of the infarct-related artery after reperfusion underwent quantitative iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging at 4 days and 4 weeks (n=42), and quantitative technetium-99m tetrofosmin imaging at 2 days after AMI. They also underwent both ventriculography and coronary angiography on admission and about 4 weeks after AMI. On the basis of left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), patients were divided into two groups. Patients with LVESV dilatation (n=20) had a significantly lower ejection fraction (P<0.003) and a significantly higher severity score of 99mTc-tetrofosmin (P<0.04), and total severity (P<0.01), delta extent (P<0.007) and delta severity (P<0.0008) scores of MIBG than patients without LVESV dilatation (n=30). delta severity score of MIBG was directly correlated with change in LVESV at 4 weeks (r=0.63, P<0.0001). Stepwise linear discriminant function analysis showed that delta severity score of MIBG (P<0.0002) was the only discriminator of LVESV dilatation. Patients with LVESV dilatation had higher regional washout rates in both the infarct and the non-infarct zones than patients without such dilatation. Furthermore, no MIBG parameters changed significantly between 4 days and 4 weeks after AMI. In reperfused AMI, delta severity score of MIBG was related to the degree of ventricular dilatation and was the only powerful discriminator of ventricular dilatation. These results suggest that cardiac sympathetic nervous abnormality might contribute to left ventricular remodelling in reperfused AMI. MIBG imaging may allow identification of reperfused AMI patients at high risk for left ventricular remodelling.
