Non-invasive assessment of the effect of cardiac sympathetic innervation on metabolism of the human heart. The role of cardiac sympathetic nerves in the regulation of myocardial metabolism is not well defined. Owing to the presence of incomplete reinnervation, heart transplant recipients provide a unique model to study the effects of efferent sympathetic innervation. Using this model, we sought to determine the influence of cardiac sympathetic signals on substrate utilisation and overall oxidative metabolism. In 21 transplant recipients, positron emission tomography was applied to determine sympathetic innervation with the noradrenaline analogue carbon11 hydroxyephedrine, oxidative metabolism with carbon11 acetate (n=14), and glucose utilisation with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (n=7). The reinnervated area comprised 22% +/- 20% of the left ventricle. Oxidative metabolism was similar in denervated and reinnervated myocardium [0.06 +/- 0.01 vs 0.06 +/- 0.01/min for k(mono)], while glucose uptake was significantly higher in denervated myocardium (6.9 +/- 6.6 vs 6.0 +/- 6.2 micromol/min/100 g P=0.03). Reinnervation mainly occurred in the territory of the left anterior descending artery, where retention of 11C-hydroxyephedrine (6.8 +/- 2.7%/min) was higher compared with territories of the left circumflex (4.1 +/- 1.7%/min
