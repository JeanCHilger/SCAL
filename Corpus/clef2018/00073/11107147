Combined (111)In-pentetreotide scintigraphy and (123)I-mIBG scintigraphy in neuroblastoma provides prognostic information. High-affinity somatostatin receptors (SRs) have been characterized in neuroblastomas and may be used as target structures for in vivo detection of SR.Eighty-eight children with histologically proven neuroblastoma were investigated at diagnosis or relapse by (123)I-mIBG and (111)In-pentetreotide scintigraphy. All tumors were investigated for MYCN copy number, chromosome 1p36 status, and 68/88 also for DNA content, followed for a median follow-up of 35 months (range 1-88 months).SR expression was detected in 56/88 tumors and (123)I-mIBG showed positivity in 83/88. (111)In-pentetreotide was less sensitive in detecting tumor tissue than was (123)I-mIBG (64% vs. 94%, P = 0.005). Survival (SUR) and event-free survival probability (EFS) according to Kaplan-Meier was significantly better for children with positive SR scintigraphy than for the children with a negative SR scan (SUR: 90% vs. 48% at 4 years log rank P < 0.003, EFS: 83% vs. 39% at 4 years, log rank P < 0.0002).(123)I-mIBG scintigraphy remains the best scintigraphic method for detecting neuroblastoma tumor tissue, whereas additional SR scintigraphy is able to provide significant prognostic information with a minimum of invasiveness.
