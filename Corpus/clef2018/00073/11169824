Echo-planar magnetic resonance myocardial perfusion imaging: parametric map analysis and comparison with thallium SPECT. Magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion FLASH imaging has been used for assessing coronary artery disease (CAD). Echo-planar MR techniques have advantages in speed and in making MR perfusion imaging results more clinically accessible through parametric maps, but have not been previously assessed. We implemented a spin-echo, echo-planar MR technique and applied it at rest and during adenosine stress in 26 patients with CAD and abnormal thallium single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT), and analyzed the results by using a newly developed parametric map analysis of time to peak, peak intensity, and slope of contrast washin. The results were compared with the results of conventional visual analysis of the perfusion cine series. For detecting abnormal coronary territories, MR and SPECT were comparable for sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (thallium, 70%, 78%, and 73% MR, 79% 83%, and 80%
