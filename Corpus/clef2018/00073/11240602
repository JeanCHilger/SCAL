Ictal perfusion changes during occipital lobe seizures in infancy: report of two serial ictal observations. Serial-ictal single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) examinations are presented in two infants (ages 1 and 2 years), with early ictal and ictal in one, and ictal and late ictal images in the other. Both had pharmacoresistant occipital epilepsy, due to focal cortical dysplasia. In the first case, size of ictal hyperperfusion increased in the course of the seizure from early ictal to ictal state. A concomitant ictal hypoperfusion was observed around the hyperperfused area. In the second patient, there was a dramatic difference between ictal and late ictal images. In the late ictal state, the previous occipital ictal hyperperfusion and extraoccipital ictal hypoperfusion disappeared, together with homolateral posterotemporal and contralateral occipital hyperperfusion, corresponding to seizure propagation. Ictal extratemporal blood-flow changes are therefore highly dynamic, particularly in very young children.
