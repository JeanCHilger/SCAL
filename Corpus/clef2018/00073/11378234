Diffusion and perfusion MR imaging in acute ischemic stroke: a comparison to SPECT. Diffusion (DWI) and perfusion (PWI) magnetic resonance imaging are relatively new methods of clinical imaging that probably can detect infarcted (DWI) and hypoperfused but still salvageable tissue (PWI) in acute human stroke. Forty-six acute stroke patients were imaged within 24 h of ictus, on the second day and after a week. SPECT was also performed on 23 patients in the acute phase (first or second day). On the first day, mean volume of hypoperfused tissue was significantly greater (P<0.001) than the infarcted tissue. The initial hypoperfusion volume correlated significantly with the final infarct size (P<0.001). The initial perfusion-diffusion mismatch correlated significantly with the infarct growth (P< or =0.001). The hypoperfusion volumes measured from PWI and SPECT correlated significantly (P<0.001). In conclusion, combined DWI and PWI is a powerful tool in evaluating the hemodynamics of acute ischemic stroke and can predict the infarct growth during 1 week.
