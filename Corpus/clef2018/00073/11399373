The use of gated perfusion scanning in the assessment of left ventricular volume. A total of 34 patients underwent both gated SPECT perfusion imaging and echocardiography, with each test blinded to the other. Wall motion analysis, calculation of ejection fraction and ventricular volume were obtained by each technique. A close correlation was observed between the ejection fractions calculated by each method (r=0.79). There was a less close relationship between the left ventricular volumes calculated by each method (r=0.61) this is probably due to the errors which result from geometric assumptions for each technique. Wall motion analysis revealed a good level of agreement between each method with no significant discrepancies between the techniques.
