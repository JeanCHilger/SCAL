Alteration of rCBF in Alzheimer's disease patients with delusions of theft. We investigated the neural substrate of the delusion of theft in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nine AD patients with only one type of delusion (delusions of theft) and nine age, cognitive function-matched AD patients without any type of delusions were selected from 334 consecutive outpatients of Ehime University Hospital. All subjects underwent (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT scanning, and SPECT images were analyzed by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). AD patients with delusions of theft showed significant hypoperfusion in the right medial posterior parietal region compared to patients without delusions. Our data suggest that attention impairment or lack of awareness of illness caused by right parietal dysfunction might play a role in producing the delusion of theft.
