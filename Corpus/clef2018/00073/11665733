Determination of permeation parameters of experimental PET films coated with SiOx to ethyl acetate, oxygen and water vapour. The permeation parameters of conventional PET films, films coated with SiOx and SiOx-coated films laminated to LDPE were determined for ethyl acetate using the permeation cell/gas chromatography method. Permeation to O2 and water vapour was also determined to monitor overall changes in the barrier properties of the experimental films. Coating of the PET film was achieved by a 'directed evaporation' method that increased the yield of the coating process from 30-35 to > 70%. It was shown that the SiOx coating increased the film barrier to ethyl acetate by approximately 20-30 times. Permeation values showed low reproducibility, indicating the need for further development and standardization of the 'directed evaporation' web-coating process. The barrier to oxygen and water vapour increased by 20-25 and 12-14 times respectively after coating. The web-coating speed did not seem to influence the barrier properties of the films. Permeation coefficients, diffusion coefficients and solubility coefficients were calculated for all samples.
