Electronic Structures of Copper(I) and Silver(I) beta-Diketonate Complexes. The valence electronic structures of [Cu(hfac)L] (hfac = CF(3)C(O)CHC(O)CF(3) L = PMe(3), CNMe), [Ag(hfac)(PMe(3))], and [Ag(fod)(PEt(3))] (fod = t-BuC(O)CHC(O)C(3)F(7)) have been studied by recording their photoelectron spectra and by performing Xalpha-SW calculations on the model compounds [M(dfm)(PH(3))] (dfm = HC(O)CHC(O)H
