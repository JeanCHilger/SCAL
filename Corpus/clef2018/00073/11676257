Radiation diagnosis of malignant neoplasms at the current stage. The paper presents all currently available oncological radiation diagnostic tools as compared to the well-known ones. It discusses different methods of obtaining images depending on their physical features: digital plain radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, bone scintigraphy, positron emission tomography, radioimmunoassay, ultrasonography (by using Doppler, intraoperative ultrasound, laparoscopy and thoracoscopy ultrasound, endoscopy ultrasound, contrast-medium ultrasound). The feasibilities of interventional radiology in malignancies are more precisely defined. There are prospects for developing different radiology techniques with the advent of high-performance computer technologies that make it possible to set up a digital radiology unit. The developed PACS system of data reception, keeping, and transmission will accumulate and keep images during unlimited time, transmit them at any distances, process them in different 3 ways, modify and improve, make paper and film hard disks at any time.
