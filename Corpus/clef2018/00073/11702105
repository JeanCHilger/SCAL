Reproducibility of the brain perfusion index for measuring cerebral blood flow using technetium-99m compounds. We previously developed an alternative method for estimating the brain perfusion index (BPI) using technetium-99m compounds and spectral analysis (SA) for quantification of cerebral blood flow (CBF). In this study, we investigated the reproducibility of the BPI values obtained by SA (BPIS) using a double injection of technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer without any intervention, and compared it with that of the BPI values obtained by graphical analysis (BPIG). The BPIS values in the first (x) and second sessions (y) correlated closely (y=0.921x+0.036 r=0.962
