An automated synthesis module for preparation of L-3-[123I]iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine. L-3-[123I]iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine (IMT) is an artificial amino acid suitable for SPECT imaging of various tumours. Manual synthesis of this radiopharmaceutical is reliable, but time-consuming and may require handling of large quantities of radioactivity. We developed an automated IMT synthesis module, which prepares a ready-to-inject product that meets radiopharmaceutical requirements and is identical to the manually synthesised equivalent. Current advantages include decreased operator assistance time and reduced radiation exposure. Application may be extended to other radiopharmaceuticals, including high-dose preparations for therapeutic use.
