Effect of expression of P-glycoprotein on technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile single photon emission computed tomography of brain tumors. The expression of P-glycoprotein was investigated immunohistochemically in 26 brain tumor tissues and compared with the findings of technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile single photon emission computed tomography (99mTc-MIBI SPECT) to clarify the effect of P-glycoprotein on the diagnostic accuracy. P-glycoprotein labeling index of both tumor cells and vascular endothelial cells showed no clear relationship with the findings of 99mTc-MIBI SPECT imaging. Expression of P-glycoprotein has no effect on the diagnostic accuracy of 99mTc-MIBI SPECT.
