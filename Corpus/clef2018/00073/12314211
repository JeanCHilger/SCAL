Problems of world population:  what do the numbers mean?. A review of recent global population trends is presented.  The focus is on the consensus that seems to have developed between the world population conferences of 1974 in Bucharest and 1984 in Mexico concerning the relationship between population factors and socioeconomic development.  Consideration is given to possible developments through the end of the 21st century, both with regard to population projections and to their implications for food supplies, employment, migration, and demographic aging.
