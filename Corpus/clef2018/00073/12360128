Transient postischemic stunning evaluation by stress gated Tl-201 SPECT myocardial imaging: Effect on systolic left ventricular function. Transient postischemic stunning (TIS) has been reported in images obtained (1/2) to 1 hour after stress with technetium 99m tracers but has not been investigated in images obtained shortly after stress with thallium 201. We also quantified the global extent and severity of TIS, which has not been done previously.We evaluated 82 patients with either treadmill or dobutamine stress Tl-201 myocardial perfusion imaging. Images were semiquantitatively examined with a 20-segment model. The extent and severity of myocardial ischemia and TIS were assessed by the summed difference score from the early and delayed scores of perfusion, wall motion (WM), and wall thickening (WT). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly lower in early images than in delayed images in patients with ischemia (P <.01), TIS by WM (P <.001), and TIS by WT (P <.001), and the LVEF difference was more significantly different as the summed difference score of perfusion, WM, or WT increased. No significant LVEF difference was seen in patients with ischemia who did not have TIS.In stress gated Tl-201 single photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging, early TIS is frequently seen in patients with ischemia and is equivalently detected by WM and WT assessments. Significant exercise-induced transient left ventricular global dysfunction is associated with more severe and extensive ischemia and can be predicted by the measurement of the extent and severity of TIS from the same images.
