Endorectal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging in rectal cancer staging. The majority of rectal cancers have local disease only at presentation, but despite meticulous surgery, a number of factors will influence outcome. Preoperative identification of adverse prognostic factors provides a rational basis for selecting preoperative therapy. Thin section MRI can influence preoperative therapeutic algorithms by T and N staging, demonstrating operability, and the potential risk of circumferential margin involvement. Endosonography may contribute to this, but has a greater role in determining intramural invasion for early tumors. The assessment of residual tumor after chemoradiotherapy remains difficult PET scanning has been used in this situation [32], but has not been compared with MRI and is unlikely to show only residual cells with extensive fibrosis.
