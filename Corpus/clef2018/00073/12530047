Correlation of 99mTc-MIBI brain spect (functional index ratios) and survival after treatment failure in malignant glioma patients. This preliminary study was conducted to determine the association between 99mTc-SESTAMIBI (MIBI) brain SPECT and survival in malignant glioma patients after treatment failure.Twenty-five malignant glioma patients with clinical deterioration were studied. Tomoscintigraphy was performed 15 minutes after intravenous injection of 1110 Mbq MIBI. The images were obtained from a dual head gamma camera using fan beam collimators. Transverse, coronal and sagittal views were reconstructed. Maximum uptake of MIBI in the lesion was expressed as a ratio to that in the controlateral hemisphere.A MIBI uptake was found in all 25 patients. This uptake was correlated to tumour recurrence proved by histological fragments and/or the rapid fatal evolution of these patients. From scintigraphic parameters, two groups of patients were noted. Group 1 (20 patients) had a significantly better survival time (8.25 months) than did Group 2 (5 patients) (2.9 months). Tumour volume predicted survival (group 1 vs group 2, p < 0.0006). A significant correlation between the tumour/background ratio and survival time for each group was observed.A correlation between functional index ratios and the time of survival of patients was noted. The functional index ratios of brain SPECT are in accordance with the potential aggressiveness of the recurrent malignant glioma.
