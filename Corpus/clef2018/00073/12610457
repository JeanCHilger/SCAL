Positron emission tomography in clinical oncology. A NEW FORM OF MEDICAL IMAGING: Positron emission tomography (PET) is used for the non-invasive in vivo visualisation of biochemical cell processes. It reveals the metabolic characteristics of neoplastic lesions and hence their identification by compensating the lack of lesion specificity of radiological techniques. VARIOUS INDICATIONS: Using the current oncology marker, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), excellent results with PET have been established at all stages of neoplasia, notably for the diagnosis of initial malignancy and the identification of residual lesions and early detection of relapses. Moreover, the fact that the whole of the body can be explored makes PET the tool of choice in the control of the extension and operability of cancers. With the close correlation between imaging and the metabolism of the lesions, PET is the earliest and most precise for assessing the effects of treatment. LIMITS AND PERSPECTIVES: The existence of benign inflammatory FDG binding should lead to the development of markers of other metabolisms directly linked to cell proliferation. The lack of anatomical reference points characteristic of PET does not permit the precise localisation of the lesions detected and could be corrected by combining, in a single apparatus, the PET camera and an X scan, the anatomical resolution of which is irreplaceable. This type of equipment represents the development of a new branch of medical imaging, oncological imaging.
