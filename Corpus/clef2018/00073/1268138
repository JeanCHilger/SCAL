Studies on the effect of maternal pre-eclamptic toxaemia on placental weight and on head size and birth weight of the newborn. The influence of pre-eclamptic toxaemia (PET) on head size and birth weight of newborn infants and placental weight was studied in single live births after 35 to 42 weeks gestation from mothers with or without toxaemia. There were no significant differences in the distribution of mean birth weight, head size, placental weight, head size/birth weight ratio or placental weight/birth weight ratio between the toxaemic and non-toxaemic groups. There were significant differences between toxaemic and non-toxaemic mothers as regards parity, height and smoking habits. Since such maternal characteristics influence birth weights a correction was applied for them. The influence of maternal mid-term weight and sex of the infants was also taken into account. No significant differences in corrected birth weights, between toxaemic and non-toxaemic groups were detected on further analysis. It is suggested that the present obstetric management has prevented the retarding effect of pre-eclamptic toxaemia on fetal and placental growth by reducing the severity and duration of the illness.
