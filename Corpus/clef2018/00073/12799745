Alterations in brain activation in posttraumatic stress disorder patients with severe hyperarousal symptoms and impulsive aggressiveness. We wanted to assess possible alterations in brain activation in PTSD patients with severe hyperarousal symptoms and impulsive aggressiveness.25 Croatian War (1991-1995) veterans with combat-related PTSD with severe hyperarousal symptoms and impulsive aggressiveness were assessed for possible alterations in cerebral blood flow in single photon emission computed tomography brain scans.Increased regional cerebral blood flow in projection area of nucleus accumbens was found in 13 of 25 subjects, and for all in the dominant brain hemisphere.We believe that at least some of PTSD symptoms, and especially the impulsive aggression, can be associated with increased regional cerebral blood flow in the projection area of nucleus accumbens.
