Beneficial effect of coronary artery bypass grafting as assessed by quantitative gated single-photon emission computed tomography. The development of quantitative gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has enabled the assessment of left ventricular perfusion, function and wall thickness in a single examination. Accordingly, the present study used gated SPECT to assess the benefit of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with coronary artery disease 47 of those patients were evaluated before and 5 months after CABG. As a result of coronary revascularization, a significant improvement was observed in global ejection fraction (50+/-12 --> 53+/-11%
