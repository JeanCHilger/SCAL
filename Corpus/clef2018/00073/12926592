Quantitative in vivo measurement of central benzodiazepine receptors in the brain of cats by use of positron-emission tomography and [11C]flumazenil. To map central benzodiazepine receptors (BZRs) in the brain of cats by use of positron-emission tomography (PET) and [11C]flumazenil.6 male cats that weighed between 2.0 and 3.6 kg.Brain images obtained by PET evaluation of [11C]flumazenil were superimposed on T2-weighted magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the same cats. Detailed anatomic regions, such as the cerebral cortex, striatum, thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellum, on the PET images were evident by PET-MRI registration. Regional binding of [11C]flumazenil to BZRs was quantitatively measured by use of a model with 2 tissue compartments and 4 variables.The highest value for distribution volume was observed in the cerebral cortex, and the lowest value was found in the midbrain of cats.Binding of [11C]flumazenil to BZRs in the brain of cats can be quantitatively measured by use of PET with the aid of PET-MRI registration. It is difficult to diagnose changes in these neuroreceptors within the field of current veterinary science. In the future, PET should prove useful for investigating and diagnosing brain disorders in animals in clinical settings.
