Thalamocortical diaschisis: positron emission tomography in humans. To investigate further the relations between cortical energy metabolism and neuropsychological impairment after unilateral thalamic lesion, 55 patients underwent positron emission tomography studies of either cortical oxygen consumption or glucose utilisation, including eight repeat studies, at times ranging from 4 days to 98 months after the onset of the lesion [stroke (n = 44) or stereotaxic VL-Vim thalamotomy performed for movement disorders (n = 11)]. Patients with thalamotomy were also studied preoperatively and the surgery induced a significant fall in cortical metabolism on both sides (more so ipsilaterally) post-operatively the magnitude of the ipsilateral cortex hypometabolism was positively correlated to the severity of global neuropsychological impairment
