Workflow management of HIS/RIS textual documents with PACS image studies for neuroradiology. Reviewing brain tumor patients' complete medical record is a daunting task for any clinician. In current practice, the radiologist examines the most recent documents and then dictates an assessment of the patient's condition based on a review of the most current imaging study and compared with the most recent previous image study. Occasionally, the radiologist searches other clinical documents when more precise detail is needed. The purpose of this research is to develop effective methods to review all of the pertinent information in a patient medical record incorporating HIS (Hospital Information Systems), RIS (Radiology Information Systems) and PACS (Picture Archiving and Communications Systems) information in three distinct ways: filtering the document worklist for pertinent clinical data, identification of key clusters of clinical information, and an automatic hanging protocol that displays the MR images for optimal image comparison.
