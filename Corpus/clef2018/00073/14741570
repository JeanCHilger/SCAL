Imaging recognition of multidrug resistance in human breast tumors using 99mTc-labeled monocationic agents and a high-resolution stationary SPECT system. Imaging recognition of multidrug-resistance by 99mTc-labeled sestamibi, tetrofosmin and furifosmin in mice bearing human breast tumors was evaluated using a high-resolution SPECT, FASTSPECT. Imaging results showed that the washout rates in drug-resistant MCF7/D40 tumors were significantly greater than that in drug-sensitive MCF7/S tumors. Furifosmin exhibited greater washout from both MCF7/S and MCF7/D40 than sestamibi, while tetrofosmin washout was greater than sestamibi in MCF7/D40 only. Feasibility of the monocationic agents for characterizing MDR expression was well clarified with FASTSPECT imaging.
