A novel electrophilic synthesis and evaluation of medium specific radioactivity (1R,2S)-4-[18F]fluorometaraminol, a tracer for the assessment of cardiac sympathetic nerve integrity with PET. (1R,2S)-4-[18F]fluorometaraminol (4-[18F]FMR), a tracer for cardiac sympathetic innervation, was synthesized by electrophilic aromatic substitution. A trimethylstannyl precursor, protected with tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting groups, was radiofluorinated with high specific radioactivity [18F]F2. Specific radioactivity of 4-[18F]FMR, in average 11.8 +/-3.3 GBq/micromol, was improved 40-800-fold in comparison to the previous electrophilic fluorinations. The biodistribution of 4-[18F]FMR in rat was in accordance with the known distribution of sympathetic innervation. 4-[18F]FMR showed no metabolic degradation in left ventricle of rat heart, where the uptake was high, rapid and specific.
