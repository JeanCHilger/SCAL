Identification of proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis with thallium-201 defect patterns in patients with angina pectoris. We determined the accuracy of perfusion defect patterns in predicting the presence of proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery stenosis in patients with angina pectoris. The development population consisted of 80 patients with single-vessel LAD stenosis and reversible LAD territory defects on thallium-201 tomography. The types of defect patterns associated with angiographic proximal LAD stenosis in this population were categorized as "proximal LAD patterns." The accuracy of these patterns for identifying proximal LAD stenosis was evaluated in a separate validation population of 152 patients with angina pectoris. The development population demonstrated LAD territory defects of type I (most of the LAD territory n = 12)
