Q-wave regression after acute myocardial infarction assessed by Tl-201 myocardial perfusion SPECT. The actual relationship between the interval change of myocardial thallium 201 (Tl-201) radioactivity in the infarct area and the pattern of Q-wave regression is still unknown. This study was conducted to evaluate their relationship after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).A total of 30 patients who had a first Q-wave AMI (11 without Q-wave regression and 19 with Q-wave regression) were retrospectively included. Two sets of 12-lead surface electrocardiograms and Tl-201 myocardial perfusion images were obtained 0 to 2 months and 14 to 84 months after the AMI event, respectively. The acute/subacute redistribution Tl-201 radioactivity was similar between the patients with and those without Q-wave regression. However, the patients with Q-wave regression had higher chronic redistribution Tl-201 radioactivity than those without Q-wave regression. Moreover, the patients with Q-wave regression presented a higher gradient in the redistribution Tl-201 radioactivity between the chronic and acute/subacute images than those without Q-wave regression.This study supports the role of functional recovery of stunning and/or hibernating myocardium in the disappearance of Q waves after AMI.
