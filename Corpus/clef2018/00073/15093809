Synthesis of 2'-deoxy-2'-[18F]fluoro-5-bromo-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil ([18F]-FBAU) and 2'-deoxy-2'-[18F]fluoro-5-chloro-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-uracil ([18F]-FCAU), and their biological evaluation as markers for gene expression. [(18)F]-FBAU and [(18)F]-FCAU have been synthesized and evaluated in vivo as markers for HSV1-tk gene expression. At 2 hours, uptake of [(18)F]-FBAU and [(18)F]-FCAU in HSV1-tk-positive tumors was 7.9-fold and 6.0-fold higher than the control tumors, respectively. Micro-PET images also showed very high uptake in HSV-tk tumors. Compared to [(14)C]-FMAU, total uptake of [(18)F]-FBAU and [(18)F]-FCAU was similar in tk-positive cells, but the uptake ratio (tk+/wild) was higher. [(18)F]-FBAU and [(18)F]-FCAU appear to be potential PET imaging agents for gene expression.
