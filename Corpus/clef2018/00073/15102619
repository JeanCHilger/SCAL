'In the course of time': a PET study of the cerebral substrates of autobiographical amnesia in Alzheimer's disease. Neuroimaging studies in healthy subjects have yielded controversial results about the neural substrates of autobiographical memory. Moreover, the neural networks responsible for autobiographical amnesia remain poorly understood. Since autobiographical memory is frequently altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we used this degenerative disorder as a model and applied a correlative approach between resting cerebral glucose utilization (CMRGlc) and temporally graded memory scores to identify the cerebral structures whose synaptic dysfunction subserves the impairment in autobiographical memory. To this end, we studied a group of 17 AD patients with mild to moderate dementia in whom autobiographical memory was assessed using a specially designed task from three broad time periods [the previous 5 years (period A) middle age (period B)
