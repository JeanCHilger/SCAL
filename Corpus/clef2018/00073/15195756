The predictive value of 201Tl rest-redistribution and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose SPECT for wall motion recovery after recent reperfused myocardial infarction. 201Tl and 18F-FDG are useful for acute myocardial infarction (MI) assessment. The goal of this study was to compare their predictive value for wall motion recovery in the culprit area after a recent reperfused MI using SPECT technique.Forty-one patients (mean age: 56 +/- 12 years) were included, 81% of them male all were studied within 1-24 days post MI. They underwent angioplasty in 27 cases (12 primary)Sensitivity [Confidence Interval] for 201Tl R-R was 74.6% [60.5-84.5], for FDG it was 82.1% [70.8-90.4] specificities were 73% [64.3-80.5] and 54.8% [45.6-63.7], respectively. 18F-FDG tended to be more sensitive than 201Tl R-R, but the latter was more specific (p < 0.0004). Both 201Tl RR and 18F-FDG presented high negative predictive value (p: ns).In recent MI, SPECT 201Tl R-R is a valuable and widely available technique for viability detection, with similar sensitivity and significant better specificity than SPECT 18F-FDG.
