Single photon emission computed tomography scanning in the diagnosis of knee pathology. To evaluate the role of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) bone scan for the diagnosis of knee lesions in routine clinical practice.40 consecutive case records were examined in patients who underwent a SPECT scan prior to knee arthroscopy in routine clinical practice. The accuracy of clinical examination, SPECT scan results, and arthroscopic findings (as the gold standard) in diagnosing knee lesions were compared.The sensitivity of SPECT scans in detecting medial meniscal, lateral meniscal, anterior cruciate ligament lesions, osteochondral defects, and chondromalacia patellae was 77%, 14%, 33%, 50%, and 74%, respectively. The specificities for the same structural lesions were high at 89%, 94%, 97%, 94%, and 69%, respectively.SPECT bone scan appears to be useful in the diagnosis of knee pathology in routine practice and in selecting patients for arthroscopy, especially most useful for the diagnosis of medial meniscal tears.
