Assessment of ventilation during the performance of elective endoscopic-guided percutaneous tracheostomy: clinical evaluation of a new method. To evaluate the feasibility of uninterrupted translaryngeal open ventilation delivered through a pediatric, uncuffed endotracheal tube during percutaneous endoscopic tracheostomy (PET).Prospective, observational clinical study in a six-bed ICU of a university hospital.Forty consecutive adult patients requiring an elective tracheostomy.We employed the basic Ciaglia technique with multiple dilators (n = 10), a single dilator (n = 15), and the Fantoni method (n = 15). During PET, pressure-controlled ventilation was maintained through an uncuffed, 4-mm inner-diameter pediatric tube. The fraction of inspired oxygen was 1.0. Ventilator settings were as follows: pressure-controlled ventilation, 40 cm H(2)O respiratory rate, 25/minMeasurements of arterial blood gas (ABG) tensions were obtained before the start of each tracheostomy and every 3 min during the procedure. An average of 8.28 +/- 2.28 ABG measurements were obtained from each patient (+/- SD). All patients were successfully assisted during performance of the tracheostomy, and no patient required ventilation through a cuffed endotracheal tube. The maximum increase in PaCO(2) was 8.49 +/- 5.50 mm Hg, and the maximum decrease in pH related to hypercarbia was 0.04 +/- 0.04. The PaO(2) increased in all patients (maximum change, 69.75 +/- 57.00 mm Hg p < 0.01), and no patient had desaturation during the procedure.The technique that we propose for airway management during PET was safe and effective. A mild increase in PaCO(2) was not associated with significant metabolic and hemodynamic consequences, and an adequate PaO(2) was maintained throughout the study.
