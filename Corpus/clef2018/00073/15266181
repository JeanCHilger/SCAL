Preparation and pharmaceutical evaluation for clinical application of high specific activity S-(-)[11C]CGP-12177, a radioligand for beta-adrenoreceptors. Although S-(-)[C]CGP-12177 is a useful positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for beta-adrenoreceptors, the difficulty in radiolabelling the compound has prevented its extensive clinical application. Recently, we have developed a simple synthesis method for S-(-)[C]CGP-12177. In the present study, we attempted to prepare S-(-)[C]CGP-12177 with a high specific activity for intravenous injection which is feasible for the clinical evaluation of beta-adrenoreceptors.The [C]methane produced during irradiation of a N2--H2 (95/5) mixture with an 18 MeV proton beam (20 microA, 30 min) was chlorinated using Cl2 to yield [C]carbon tetrachloride. S-(-)[C]CGP-12177 was synthesized by reacting the diamino precursor with [C]phosgene produced by oxidizing [C]carbon tetrachloride on a Fe--Fe2O3 column. The product was purified by using reversed phase, high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and the radioactive fraction containing S-(-)[C]CGP-12177 was collected and evaporated to dryness. S-(-)[C]CGP-12177 dissolved in physiological saline was sterilized through a 0.22 microm membrane filter. The radiochemical purity and the mass of the compound were determined with RP-HPLC. The residual organic solvents were determined with GC. Tests for sterility and the presence of bacterial endotoxins were also performed.S-(-)[C]CGP-12177 for intravenous injection was prepared in 25 min after the end of bombardment with a yield of 1.5+/-0.2 GBq. Specific activity was found to be 385.4+/-133.0 GBq/ micromol at the end of synthesis (EOS) (n=3). Radiochemical purity was found to be more than 99%. Toluene was not detected in the solution. The ethanol concentration was determined to be 60.3+/-52.5 ppm. Tests for sterility and bacterial endotoxins showed negative results.We successfully prepared S-(-)[C]CGP-12177 formulated for intravenous injection with high purity and high specific activity, which is feasible for the clinical evaluation of beta-adrenoreceptors.
