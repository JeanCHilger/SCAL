Differentiation of malignant and benign solitary thyroid nodules using 30- and 120-minute tc-99m MIBI scans. Technetium-99m methoxy isobutylisonitrate (MIBI) has been found to be taken up by various tumors, including thyroid cancer. We prospectively evaluated 77 patients with cold thyroid solitary nodules on Tc-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy to evaluate the diagnostic value of Tc-99m MIBI scintigraphy. The aim of this study was to find out if thyroid nodules can be characterized on the basis of retention of MIBI and whether preoperative evaluation of malignancy is possible using this method. Single injection, dual-phase (30 and 120 minutes) thyroid scintigraphy using Tc-99m MIBI was performed in all these patients. In the following days and weeks, all patients underwent surgery. Using the 120/30-minute thyroid lesion to background radiouptake ratio (RUR), malignant and benign thyroid nodules could be separated with a sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 84.4%, 95.45%, and 93.33%, respectively. The mean RUR for malignant thyroid lesions was found to be 1.57+/-0.32, whereas for benign lesions, the ratio was significantly lower, 0.32+/-0.19. In conclusion, fine needle aspiration cytology along with the 120/30 minutes Tc-99m MIBI scintigraphy ratio appears to be useful in the preoperative assessment of solitary thyroid nodules.
