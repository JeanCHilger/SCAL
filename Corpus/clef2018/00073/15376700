How to diagnose and treat epilepsy. The mainstay for the diagnosis of epilepsy is a comprehensive history and eyewitness descriptions. For further diagnostic evaluation electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are employed, but also such newer methods as positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission tomography (SPECT) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG). Treatment of epilepsy is in the first instance medical. The choice of anticonvulsant is based on effectiveness, the spectrum of side effects and patient comorbidity. Difficult-to-treat and drug-resistant epilepsy should be treated surgically and the patients should be referred to an epilepsy center for a pre-operative diagnostic work-up.
