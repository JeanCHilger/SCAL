Brain uptake and release of amino acids in nondiabetic and insulin-dependent diabetic subjects: important role of glutamine release for nitrogen balance. We measured net uptake and release of amino acids in the brain of 7 nondiabetic and six diabetic subjects. Duration of insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) was 19.4 +/- 2.1 years. Arteriojugular vein measurements were performed before and after 120 minutes of insulin infusion and ensuing Biostator-regulated normoglycemia. Cerebral blood flow was measured during normoglycemia by 11-CH3-F and positron emission tomography. During hyperglycemia in the IDDM subjects, arterial concentrations of valine and leucine were higher, and those of glutamic acid and arginine lower, than in nondiabetic subjects. Insulin infusion lowered levels of most amino acids in both groups. Insulin treatment did not significantly affect the uptake or release of amino acids. Significant net uptake of branched-chain amino acids was noted in both groups, as well as uptake of lysine and phenylalanine in the IDDM subjects. The sum of measured differences was not different from zero in either group. Nitrogen balance depended on impressive release of glutamine from the brain (-963 +/- 147 and -960 +/- 303 nmol/100 g/min), which amounted to 73% and 69% of net release in nondiabetic and IDDM subjects, respectively. We conclude that balance between uptake and release of amino acids is similar in nondiabetic and in long-term IDDM subjects.
