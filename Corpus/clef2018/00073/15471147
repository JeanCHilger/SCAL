Importance of spinal cord stimulation in the treatment of refractory angina. A small non-quantified number of patients is reported to be affected by forms of angina pectoris already treated by traditional therapy but no longer able to achieve better results by drugs or surgery: this is called "refractory angina". Treatments like external counterpulsation, transmyocardial laser revascularization, stem cell transplantation or spinal cord stimulation may be suitable for these patients. The analysis of major studies on spinal cord stimulation based on exercise ECG, Holter monitoring and positron emission tomography, has shown a reduction in anginal attacks and in nitroglycerin pills. Though in small figures, an improved perfusion of the ischemic areas, an increase in the time of ischemia and cardiac mortality comparable to bypass surgery as well as a better quality of life and lower costs with respect to traditional treatment are also evident. Patients who are at high risk of mortality for bypass surgery, and who cannot receive significant benefits from revascularization or improved pharmacological therapy are candidate to spinal cord stimulation. Spinal cord stimulation is safe and effective in about 70% of patients. Some issues have not been investigated yet: the clinical characteristics of "non-responders" and the possibility of avoiding sudden cardiac death in stimulated patients.
