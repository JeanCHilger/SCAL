Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum: increased uptake on FDG PET. The objective of our study was to evaluate FDG uptake in patients with cardiac lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum (LHIS).Increased FDG uptake occurs in LHIS, a benign fatty infiltration of the interatrial septum. Increased uptake in the right heart on FDG PET warrants correlation with additional imaging to assess for LHIS and avoid false interpretation of malignancy.
