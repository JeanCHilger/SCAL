Single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with diabetes. Diabetes mellitus has reached epidemic proportions, creating a large population of people at increased risk for cardiac events. Single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT MPI) provides an effective tool to accurately diagnose and risk stratify patients with diabetes, similar to patients without diabetes. Diabetics, however, are at increased risk for coronary events. Diabetics with normal MPI have increased late cardiac events, and even those with mild perfusion defects have increased event rates compared with nondiabetics with similar perfusion abnormalities. Stress MPI can provide valuable risk stratification data for both sexes, with or without diabetes. However, diabetes appears to exert a greater relative impact in women than in men. Despite the absence of symptoms, the incidence and prevalence of coronary artery disease is increased in patients with diabetes. Further studies and research will be needed to define the eventual role of SPECT MPI in asymptomatic diabetics.
