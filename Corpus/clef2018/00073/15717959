Assessment of myocardial viability by nuclear imaging techniques. The assessment of myocardial viability has become important in the diagnostic and prognostic work up of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Patients with viable myocardium may benefit from revascularization in terms of improvement of function, symptoms, and prognosis. In contrast, patients without viable myocardium do not benefit and should be treated conservatively. Various nuclear imaging techniques are available.
