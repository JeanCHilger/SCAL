PET imaging of brain with the beta-amyloid probe, [11C]6-OH-BTA-1, in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the capacity of [11C]6-OH-BTA-1 and positron emission tomography (PET) to quantify beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD).PET imaging was performed with the NIH ATLAS small animal scanner in six elderly transgenic mice (Tg2576 age 22.0+/-1.8 monthsTACs for [11C]6-OH-BTA-1 in all ROIs peaked early (at 30-55 s), with radioactivity washing out quickly thereafter in both transgenic and wild-type mice. Peak uptake in all regions was significantly lower in transgenic mice than in wild-type mice. During the later part of the washout phase (12-30 min), the mean FR/CE and PA/CE ratios were higher in transgenic than in wild-type mice (1.06+/-0.04 vs 0.98+/-0.07, p=0.04 1.06+/-0.09 vs 0.93+/-0.08 p=0.02) while ST/CE, TH/CE, and PO/CE ratios were not. Ex vivo staining revealed widespread Abeta plaques in cortex, but not in cerebellum of transgenic mice or in any brain regions of wild-type mice.Marked reductions in brain uptake of this radioligand in transgenic mice may be due to reduced cerebral blood flow relative to that in wild-type mice. Specific [11C]6-OH-BTA-1 binding to Abeta plaques, if any, is probably very low, as reflected in the small FR/CE and PA/CE ratio differences. FR/CE and PA/CE ratios are considerably higher in AD patients while Abeta plaque densities in 22-month-old transgenic mice may be expected to show essentially the same density as is observed in the AD brain. This implies that the absence of tracer retention in 22-month-old transgenic mice may be due to the smaller number of Abeta plaque binding sites and/or to lower affinity of the binding sites for [11C]6-OH-BTA-1 as compared with AD patients. [11C]6-OH-BTA-1 shows excellent brain uptake in mice.
