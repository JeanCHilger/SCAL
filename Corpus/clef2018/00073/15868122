Detection of residual tumor after radiofrequency ablation of liver metastasis with dual-modality PET/CT: initial results. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of dual-modality positron emission tomography(PET)/computed tomography (CT) in the detection of residual tumor after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver metastasis of colorectal cancer. Eleven patients with 16 hepatic metastases (mean size 2.9 cm) from colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, and 19 RFA procedures and 32 PET/CT examinations were performed. The patients had PET/CT before and after RFA using [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose. CT images alone were read by two radiologists, PET images alone were evaluated by two nuclear physicians. Fused images were read by one physician of each speciality in consensus. The accuracy for detection of residual tumor by the different imaging modalities following RFA was assessed. Eleven patients with a mean age of 63 (range 55-71) years were evaluated. The mean follow-up period was 393 days. The overall procedure-based sensitivity for detection of residual tumor was 65% for PET and PET/CT and 44% for CT alone. The accuracies were 68% and 47%, respectively. Four patients had residual tumor after RFA, six patients total developed local recurrence. PET/CT therefore possibly proved superior to CT alone when assessing the liver for residual tumor after RFA.
