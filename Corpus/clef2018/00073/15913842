Differential effects of ammonia on the benzodiazepine modulatory site on the GABA-A receptor complex of human brain. Ammonia is a key factor in the pathogenesis of encephalopathies associated with liver failure. A direct effect of ammonia on GABAergic neurotransmission was proposed as a mechanism that may explain its neurotoxic effect on the basis of electrophysiological and biochemical studies performed in animal models of liver failure. In the present study, we investigated using a radiometric assay the effect of ammonia on the binding of GABA-A receptor ligands to membranes from normal human brains. Ammonium tartrate significantly decreased the maximal binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to well-washed frontal cortical membranes (366+/-63 fmol/mg protein in absence of ammonia versus 294.1+/-51 fmol/mg protein in presence of 2 mM ammonia p<0.05). The efficacy of the effects of ammonia was within the millimolar range (IC50=4.8 mM). This effect was not seen in cerebellum or hippocampus. Ammonia exposure decreased the maximal binding of [3H]flumazenil (284.9+/-24.2 fmol/mg protein in absence of ammonia versus 146.4+/-15.6 fmol/mg protein in presence of 2 mM ammonia
