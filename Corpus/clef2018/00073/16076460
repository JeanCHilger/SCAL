Nature and properties of ionomer assemblies. II. The principle subject in the current paper is to summarize and characterize the ionomers based on polymers and copolymers such as polystyrene (PSt), polyisoprene (PIP), polybutadiene (PB), poly(styrene-b-isobutylene-b-styrene) (PSt-PIB-PSt), poly(butadiene-styrene) (PB-PSt), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(butylene adipate) (PBA), poly(butylene succinate) (PBSi), poly(dimethylcarbosiloxanes), polyurethane, etc. The self-assembly of ionomers, models concerning ionomer morphologies, physical and rheological properties of ionomer phase and percolation behavior of ionomers were discussed. The ionomer phase materials and dispersions have been characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), small-angle X-ray catering (SAXS), small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), etc. The wide range of compositions, molecular architectures, and morphologies present in ionomeric disperse systems are of great interest. The research is particularly devoted to the potential application of these materials and an understanding of the fundamental principles of the ionomers. They are extremely complex systems, sensitive to changes in structure and composition, and therefore not easily amenable to modeling and to the derivation of general patterns of behavior. The reviewed data indicate that a large number of parameters are important in influencing multiplet formation and clustering in random ionomers. Among these are the ion content, size of the polyion and counterion, dielectric constant of the host, T(g) of the polymer, rigidity or persistence length of the backbone, position of the ion pair relative to the backbone, steric constraints, amount and nature of added additive (plasticizer), thermal history, etc.
