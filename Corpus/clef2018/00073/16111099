The differentiation between pancreatic neoplastic cysts and pancreatic pseudocyst. The number of small and often asymptomatic cystic lesions detected in pancreas has increased during the last decade. Historically the vast majority of the pancreatic cystic lesions were considered pseudocysts, but in recent series the incidence of various neoplastic cysts, such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, serous cystadenomas and cystic endocrine tumours, has increased. The possible malignant potential in these cystic neoplasms warrants careful diagnostic workup to choose the optimal treatment for each patient. Patient's age, symptoms and a possible history of acute or chronic pancreatitis with known aetiology together with high quality imaging studies are important in the differential diagnosis between pseudocysts and neoplastic cysts. Endoscopic ultrasound, cyst fluid analysis and positron emission tomography may be used in selected patients, but the accuracy of these methods needs further investigation.
