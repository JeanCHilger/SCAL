Multielement analysis of soft drinks by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. Several commercial soft drinks and respective plastic bottles were analyzed for their multielement contents employing the synchrotron radiation total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry technique (SRTXRF). The SRTXRF method has been developed and validated, and about 20 elements were detected in the investigated samples, including some trace elements, which can be toxic for human beings, such as Ti, Cr, Sb, As, and Pb in soft drinks and Al, Sb, As, and Pb in poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) containers. Statistical analysis was performed using chemometric techniques (principal component analysis and cluster analysis), and similarities were verified in the multielement contents of the samples. The results demonstrated that the SRTXRF offers a good multielemental approach for the quality control of food products. Moreover, on the basis of enrichment factors, the possibility of the trace elements in the PET container may be leached to the beverages under normal commercial situations and other results were discussed.
