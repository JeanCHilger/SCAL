Assessment of tumor radiosensitivity using functional and metabolic nuclear imaging in research and clinical practice. A review. During the last half of century considerable research on radiosensitivity biomarkers has been published. However, to date there is no non-invasive marker of cellular radiosensitivity identified for clinical routinely use. In this review, the main functional and metabolic imaging isotopic techniques for tumor radiosensitivity that have been explored over the last years are being described. This indirect evaluation fall into 3 topics associated with tumor proliferation rate or apoptosis, tumor hypoxic fraction, neoangiogenesis and the intrinsic radiosensitivity of clonogenic tumor cells. The final objective of the radiosensitivity monitoring during radiotherapy would be to adapt treatment strategy for overcoming the identified radioresistance mechanism such as hypoxia by the addition of radiosensitisers for example. This would allow better tumor control rather than continue inefficient and costly treatment delivery, which in addition could compromise outcome.
