Imaging of serotonin mechanisms in epilepsy. Advances in positron emission tomography (PET) techniques have allowed the measurement and imaging of neurotransmitter synthesis, transport, and receptor binding to be performed in vivo. With regard to epileptic disorders, imaging of neurotransmitter systems not only assists in the identification of epileptic foci for surgical treatment, but also provides insights into the basic mechanisms of human epilepsy. Recent investigative interest in epilepsy has focused on PET imaging of tryptophan metabolism, via the serotonin and kynurenine pathways, as well as on imaging of serotonin receptors. This review summarizes advances in PET imaging and how these techniques can be applied clinically for epilepsy treatment.
