Pregnancy outcome in adolescent and adult - a case comparison study. This study outlined the consequences of adolescent pregnancy with comparison to adults in Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh. It was a case-comparison study. The study population was the mothers who admitted and delivered at the Obstetrics and Gynaecology ward of hospital during April-June 2003. Sample size was 220 mothers, out of which 110 were primigravidae adolescent mothers and 110 were adults. The study finding showed that adolescents were 2.105 times and 3.679 times more at risk than adults to suffer from anaemia and UTI during pregnancy. Among adolescents 74(67.3%) and in adults 39(35.5%) had obstetric complications during pregnancy and the adolescents were 3.742 times more at risk than the adults. PET and Eclampsia were more common in adolescent than adult mothers. 86(78.2%) adolescents and 36(32.7%) adult mothers had complications before delivery. Pre term labour, Premature rupture of membrane (PROM) and Intra-uterine foetal death (IUD) were more common in adolescents than adult mothers. Stillbirths were more in adolescent mothers 23(20.9%) and adults 11(10.0%). There was more low birth weight (LBW) newborns in adolescents 42(38.2%) than adults 18(16.4%). As a result the adolescents were 3.157 times more likely to give birth to low birth weight babies . The newborns of the adolescent mothers were nearly 2 times more at risk to develop asphyxia neonatorum (p< 0.030, odds ratio=1.806).
