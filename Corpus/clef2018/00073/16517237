Positron emission tomography/computed tomography: protocol issues and options. Combined positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) became FDA-approved for clinical use in late 2001. There are several design advantages of combined PET/CT over PET and CT acquired on separate devices, including more accurate CT and PET data co-registration, improved lesion localization, consolidation of imaging studies, and reduced scan times compared to dedicated PET. There are several protocols that can used to scan patients on combined PET/CT devices. Although there is no single "correct" protocol for performing a PET/CT scan, the use of oral and intravenous contrast media may improve the diagnostic value of the CT component. Whether to utilize contrast media depends on important clinical variables, including the specific type of tumor and the likelihood of encountering viable abdominal and pelvic malignancy. This article discusses various protocols pertinent to PET/CT imaging, including how the CT portion of a PET/CT scan can be performed and optimized, as well as PET/CT interpretation and reporting issues.
