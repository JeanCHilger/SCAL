Evaluation of efficacy and clinical impact of positron emission tomography with 18F fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) in patients with suspicion of recurrent laryngeal carcinoma. To evaluate the efficacy and clinical impact of FDG-PET in patients with suspected recurrent laryngeal carcinoma.15 patients, with suspicion of recurrent laryngeal carcinoma and ambiguous conventional imaging modalities. In all patients a whole body scan was performed with FDG-PET in fasting patients following i.v. administration of 370-444 MBq FDG. The results were confirmed by histology and clinical evolution (follow-up period > 12 months).Prevalence of recurrence was 86.6%. FDG-PET was positive in 13 patients, with confirmation in all cases, and 2 were true negative (TN). Overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy were 100%. FDG-PET changed the modality of treatment in 10 patients (clinical impact 63.3%).FDG-PET has high clinical impact in patients with a suspicion of recurrent laryngeal carcinoma, and should be incorporated to the diagnostic protocols before making a therapy decision.
