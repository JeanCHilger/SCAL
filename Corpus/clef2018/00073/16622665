F-18 FDG-PET imaging and correlation with CT in staging and follow-up of pediatric lymphomas. We hypothesized that F-18 FDG-PET could be a useful, functional imaging modality for assessing the initial staging, response to therapy and follow-up of children diagnosed with lymphoma.To assess the role of whole-body F-18 FDG-PET imaging in patients with lymphoma as an initial staging modality and to measure its predictive value for monitoring the response to therapy and disease recurrence compared to CT and clinical follow-up studies.As part of their routine clinical care, 24 patients with histologically proven lymphoma (18 Hodgkin disease and 6 non-Hodgkin lymphoma) underwent an F-18 FDG-PET and a CT scan. A total of 28 studies were performed and the entire set of scans retrospectively reviewed. Seven studies were performed for initial staging, 12 for monitoring therapy response and 9 for detecting recurrence. Initial diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology while the gold standard at follow-up was established by clinical follow-up, additional imaging modalities and/or biopsy. F-18 FDG-PET was visually compared to CT on a lesion-by-lesion basis. Fifteen anatomic regions (seven nodal and eight extranodal) were analyzed.Of the 414 regions analyzed, PET and CT were concordant in 366 (positive in 16 and negative in 350). Discordance was found in 48 regions. Overall sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values were 78%, 98%, 94% and 90% for F-18 FDG-PET and 79%, 88%, 90% and 46% for CT, respectively.F-18 FDG-PET imaging is a useful technique for the staging and follow-up of pediatric patients with lymphoma.
