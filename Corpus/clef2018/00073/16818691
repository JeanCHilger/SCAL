Positron emission tomography using [18F]Galacto-RGD identifies the level of integrin alpha(v)beta3 expression in man. The integrin alpha(v)beta3 plays a key role in angiogenesis and tumor cell metastasis and is therefore an important target for new therapeutic and diagnostic strategies. We have developed [18F]Galacto-RGD, a highly alpha(v)beta3-selective tracer for positron emission tomography (PET). Here, we show, in man, that the intensity of [18F]Galacto-RGD uptake correlates with alpha(v)beta3 expression.Nineteen patients with solid tumors (musculoskeletal system, n = 10 melanoma, n = 4Two tumors showed no tracer uptake (mean SUV, 0.5 +/- 0.1). All other tumors showed tracer accumulation with SUVs ranging from 1.2 to 10.0 (mean, 3.8 +/- 2.3 T/B, 3.4 +/- 2.2Molecular imaging of alpha(v)beta3 expression with [18F]Galacto-RGD in humans correlates with alpha(v)beta3 expression as determined by immunohistochemistry. PET with [18F]Galacto-RGD might therefore be used as a new marker of angiogenesis and for individualized planning of therapeutic strategies with alpha(v)beta3-targeted drugs.
