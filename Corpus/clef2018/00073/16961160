Dipyridamole/aspirin combination in secondary stroke prevention: effects on absolute myocardial blood flow and coronary vascular resistance. In the European Stroke Prevention Study (ESPS 2), oral administration of a fixed combination of 200 mg extended-release dipyridamole and 25 mg aspirin (twice daily) after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, significantly reduced the risk of stroke compared to placebo as well as compared to aspirin or dipyridamole alone. However, the i.v. application of dipyridamole over 4 - 6 min is known to increase myocardial blood flow up to 6-fold, and thereby potentially provoke ischemic wall motion abnormalities in patients with coronary artery disease. We therefore assessed the cardiac side effects of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination on absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary vascular resistance (CVR).MBF and CVR were measured using 150-water positron emission tomography in 24 patients after stroke or transient ischemic attack, before and 6.7 +/- 1.9 days after starting the dipyridamole/aspirin combination (Aggrenox) therapy.Resting MBF increased by 39% (max. 112%), from 0.92 +/- 0.13 (ml x g(-1) x min(-1)) at baseline to 1.28 +/- 0.27 (ml x g(-1) x min(-1)) under ongoing dipyridamole/aspirin combination therapy (p < 0.0005). CVR consecutively decreased from 105.3 +/- 16.9 to 74.1 +/- 16.5 (mmHg x ml(-1) x g x min) (p < 0.0005). The relative increase in MBF correlated negatively with the body surface area. No correlation was found between relative MBF increase and duration of dipyridamole/aspirin combination therapy (range 4 - 10 days).Orally administered dipyridamole/aspirin combination therapy in secondary stroke prevention increases MBF and decreases CVR significantly. These cardiac side effects of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination should be taken into account in stroke patients with proven or suspected coronary artery disease, particularly in combination with a small body surface area.
