In vivo quantitation of intratumoral radioisotope uptake using micro-single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography. This study was undertaken to determine the ability of micro-single photon emission computed tomography (micro-SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) to accurately quantitate intratumoral radioisotope uptake in vivo and to compare these measurements with planar imaging and micro-SPECT imaging alone.Human pancreatic cancer xenografts were established in 10 mice. Intratumoral radioisotope uptake was achieved via intratumoral injection of an attenuated measles virus vector expressing the NIS gene (MV-NIS). On various days after MV-NIS injection, (123)I planar and micro-SPECT/CT imaging was performed. Tumor activity was determined by dose calibrator measurements and region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis. Agreement and reproducibility of tumor activity measurements were assessed by Bland-Altman plots and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC).Intratumoral radioisotope uptake was detected in all mice. Scatterplots demonstrate strong agreement (CCC = 0.93) between micro-SPECT/CT ROI image analysis and dose calibrator tumor activity measurements. The differences between dose calibrator activity measurements and those obtained with ROI image analysis of micro-SPECT alone and planar imaging are less accurate and more variable (CCC = 0.84 and 0.78, respectively).Micro-SPECT/CT can be used to accurately quantify intratumoral radioisotope uptake in vivo and is more reliable than planar or micro-SPECT imaging alone.
