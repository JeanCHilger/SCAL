Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibitors modify the accumulation of tumor-diagnostic PET tracers in cancer cells. To establish the effects of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) blockers on 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)FDG) and (11)C-choline accumulation in different cancer cells.The tumor cells were incubated with NCX inhibitors, and the uptakes of (18)FDG and (11)C-choline were measured. Flow cytometric measurements of intracellular Ca(2+) and Na(+) concentrations were carried out. The presence of the NCX antigen in the cancer cells was proved by Western blotting, flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy.The NCX is expressed at a noteworthy level in the cytosol and on the cytoplasmic membrane of the examined cells. Incubation of the cells with three chemically unrelated NCX blockers (bepridil, KB-R7943 or 3',4'-dichlorobenzamil hydrochloride) resulted in an increase in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, with a simultaneous decrease in the intracellular Na(+) concentration. The treatment with the NCX inhibitors increased the energy consumption of the tumor cells by 50-100%. Thapsigargin abolished the NCX-induced (18)FDG accumulation in the cells. The NCX blockers applied decreased the (11)C-choline accumulation of all the investigated cancer cells by 60-80% relative to the control.A possible masking effect of NCX medication must be taken into consideration during the diagnostic interpretation of PET scans.
