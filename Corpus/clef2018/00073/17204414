Molecular imaging in heart failure. Heart failure (HF), a heterogeneous syndrome of epidemic proportions, is increasingly defined by its underlying molecular and genomic alterations. Molecular cardiac imaging has emerged as a complementary discipline that has improved the understanding of the pathophysiologic principles governing experimental HF and has a potential to revolutionize assessment and management of HF in humans.
