Serial assessment of left ventricular function in various patient groups with Tl-201 gated myocardial perfusion SPECT. The present study was performed to assess stress-related left ventricular (LV) function variations in various patient groups and to determine if they were affected by sex or the type of stress experienced. We used thallium (Tl)-201 gated myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the analysis.A total of 270 patients were examined by electrocardiography-gated myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging to assess LV function. After injection of Tl-201 at a dose of 111 MBq at peak stress, SPECT scans were acquired at 10 min (after stress) and 3 h (rest) after injection on a three-headed camera.In the normal perfusion group, the mean LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly higher, and both the end-diastolic volume index (EDVI) and end-systolic volume index (ESVI) were significantly lower in women than in men (P < 0.05). Poststress stunning occurred in 29 of 98 patients (30.0%) in the ischemia group and in 42 of 90 patients (46.7%) in the fixed group. There was a significant difference in poststress stunning between bicycle ergometer stress and dipyridamole stress (P < 0.05).In patients with normal perfusion, LVEF, EDVI, and ESVI determined by gated Tl-201 SPECT should be corrected for sex. In addition, the influence of the type of stress should be considered when assessing stress-related LV function variations.
