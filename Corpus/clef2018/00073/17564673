Contraction-induced [18F]-fluoro-deoxy-glucose uptake can be measured in human calf muscle using high-resolution PET. Contraction-induced glucose uptake can be imaged and quantified by the use of positron emission tomography (PET). In the human extremities, such data may reveal important information regarding the in vivo mechanical function of e.g. the force transmitting tissues such as tendons. However, to investigate structures of limited size, a PET scanner with high resolution is required. We tested the potential of the recently developed high-resolution brain PET scanner (ECAT HRRT) for imaging of human lower extremities. [18F]-fluoro-deoxy-glucose uptake following voluntary and stimulated isometric muscle contractions was studied in a 30-year-old male. The results showed that the activated muscle or muscles are clearly delineated in the high-resolution PET images. Furthermore, the load-induced gain in tendon uptake was clearly visualized. In conclusion, the HRRT scanner is an appropriate tool for investigating physiological processes within the human extremities, and the very high resolution yields a potential for more accurate conclusions when target tissues are limited in size.
