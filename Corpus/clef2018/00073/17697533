Detection of metastases in patients with cutaneous melanoma using FDG-PET/CT. This study aimed to detect metastases in patients with stage III or IV cutaneous melanoma by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT). Thirty-nine patients with clinically evident stage III or IV melanoma underwent whole-body FDG-PET/CT scans for metastatic disease and these results were compared with those of biopsy. Scans for 38 of the patients were evaluated one patient's scan could not be evaluated. There were 11 true-positive, two false-positive, 24 true-negative and one false-negative scans for the detection of melanoma metastases, with sensitivity 91%, specificity 92%, accuracy 92%, and positive and negative predictive values 84% and 96%, respectively. False-positive FDG-PET/CT scans were due to sarcoidosis in the lung and infected cyst in the liver. It is concluded that FDG-PET/CT scanning has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting stage III or IV metastatic melanoma.
