A pilot study of early 18F-FDG PET to evaluate the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases. The objective of our study was to collect pilot data about the use of FDG PET within hours after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver metastases.Total photopenia on early PET can potentially be regarded as a macroscopic tumor-free margin focal uptake can be regarded as macroscopic residual tumor.
