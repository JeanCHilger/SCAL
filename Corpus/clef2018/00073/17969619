Leak detection in polyethylene terephthalate bottles filled with water and pulped and unpulped orange juice using a vacuum decay system. This research evaluated an offline vacuum decay leak detection system for 1775-ml polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. These bottles were filled with water and pulped and unpulped orange juice and induction sealed with an aluminum liner and an outer 38-mm continuous thread polypropylene cap. The objectives of this study were to evaluate (i) minimum leak size sensitivity of the instrument (ii) ability to identify weak but nonleaking seals
