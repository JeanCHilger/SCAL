Hepatic yttrium-90 radioembolotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab or bevacizumab. Yttrium-90 microspheres have been recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration and have become available to physicians in the United States for the treatment of hepatic neoplasia. Published results regarding the benefits of 90Y radioembolotherapy within the rapidly evolving landscape of systemic therapies for advanced unresectable colorectal cancer are limited. In that context, outcomes in patients who have received the recently approved biologic agents bevacizumab and cetuximab in addition to chemotherapy are unknown. This report briefly describes the authors' treatment experience with this cohort of patients.
