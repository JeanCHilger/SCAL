Outcome of [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine therapy of neuroblastoma: seven years after. Beginning in 1984 and based on a total of 40 treatments with [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) in most cases with a follow-up of 5 years or more, it seems to be worthwhile reevaluating our clinical data and draw some final conclusions: We treated 12 children with a neuroblastoma (NB) IV and 3 with a NB III. In no case 131I-MIBG was the primary therapy. The great majority suffered from recurrence. The mean treatment interval after chemotherapy was 6 months (range 0-54). We calculated a median cumulative tumor dose of 77 Gy (range 0-259) in patients with stage III and 30 Gy (range 4-267) in stage IV NB. The tumor half-life time of 131I-MIBG does not significantly differ between stage III (3 days) and IV (2-5 days). Although the median tumor dose of stage III NB exceeded that of stage IV, we found in NB IV a significant tumor remission in 7 out of 12 cases. On the other hand, a slight reduction of tumor size was seen in only 1 case of stage III NB. This indicates a lower radiation sensitivity of stage III NB. Despite this fact, the two patients with stage III NB who presented a sufficient 131I-MIBG-tumor uptake turned to become operable after 131I-MIBG. Stage IV patients improved, too, even if most of them suffered from recurrence with a very poor prognosis: 3 patients of stage IV lived longer than 48-60 month or are still alive. However, no one of this group remitted completely.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
