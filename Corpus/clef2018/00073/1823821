Treatment of neuroblastoma with [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine: long-term results in 25 patients. From 1984 to 1990 we have treated altogether 25 children with [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) for a refractory, relapsed or metastasized neuroblastoma. Three children had stage III and 22 children had stage IV of the disease at diagnosis their ages were between 4 months and 10 years. Children with stage III disease had at diagnosis a median age of 3.0 years and at treatment 3.8 years. After first-line chemotherapy 2 children had achieved a complete remission (CR), while in 1 child the tumor did not respond (NR) to the initial treatment. At the time of 131I-MIBG treatment 2 children had relapsed and in the other one no further response was achievable. The children were treated by a 13.5 +/- 12.9 mCi/kg BW per course with a mean total dose of 280.7 +/- 243.9 mCi. One child achieved CR by 131I-MIBG alone, while in 2 cases no measurable success was observed. All 3 children were treated additionally by surgery, chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Two children have died but one is alive and in CR. The 22 children with stage IV disease were treated in two different study groups. In group A, 14 children were studied for side-effects and response to 131I-MIBG. All children were pretreated with standard chemotherapy. Five were treated in relapse, 5 in progression and 3 at a refractory state of the disease
