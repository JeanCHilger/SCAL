Therapeutic use of [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine in neuroblastoma: a phase II study in 26 patients. "Société Française d'Oncologie Pédiatrique" and Nuclear Medicine Co-investigators. Seven French Medical Centers were involved in a cooperative study evaluating [131I]Metaidobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) therapy in advanced neuroblastoma. Children (median age 4 years) had initially a stage III (4 patients) or stage IV (22 patients) neuroblastoma. Before MIBG treatment, 14 patients had a primarily refractory disease, 10 patients were relapsing in 8 cases, autologous bone marrow transplantation had been performed. Tumour sites were in 24 patients: 13/24 local disease, 8/24 bone metastases, and 7 bone marrow involvement. Catecholamines were elevated in 7/24 patients. The median activity of 131I-MIBG per injection ranged from 30 to 108 mCi
