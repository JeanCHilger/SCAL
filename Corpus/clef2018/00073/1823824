131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine and high-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow rescue in advanced neuroblastom. High-dose chemotherapy (HDT) and autologous bone marrow rescue (ABMR) is routinely used as consolidation treatment in advanced neuroblastoma. This study is presently examining the efficacy and toxicity of combined [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) therapy with HDT and ABMR. Five children (4 male, 1 female), median age of 8 years (range 4-11 years) were treated, 3 at relapse and 2 after initial chemotherapy. A single infusion of 131I-MIBG (median activity 11.1 GBq, range 7.4-11.2 GBq) was followed by HDT and ABMR 14-32 days later. High-dose chemotherapy consisted of carboplatin and melphalan in 4 patients, and vincristine, etoposide, carboplatin and melphalan in 1. One patient developed a septicaemia and died, and another failed to engraft both had extensive bone marrow infiltration at the time of 131I-MIBG therapy. The combined therapy was well tolerated by the three other patients. Two children have relapsed and died (including one who failed to engraft), and 2 are alive 17 and 41 months after ABMR. In the absence of extensive bone marrow metastases, combined therapy offers potential as a means of consolidating treatment in advanced neuroblastoma.
