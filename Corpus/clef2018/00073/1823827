Efficacy and safety of [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine therapy for patients with refractory neuroblastoma. Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a guanethidine derivative that is selectively concentrated in sympathetic nervous tissue. MIBG labeled with 123I or 131I has proven to be a specific and sensitive tool for detection of primary and metastatic pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma. Eleven patients, with refractory stage IV neuroblastoma were treated with a total of 23 courses of 131I-MIBG, 100-400 mCi/m2/course. Total activity administered per course ranged from 90-550 mCi maximum cumulative radioactivity per patient was 1356 mCi. The 131I-MIBG was given as a 2 hour infusion. Total body dose was calculated from whole body activity measurements, ranging from 73-250 cGy. The main toxicity was thrombocytopenia, with platelet nadirs to less than 25,000/microL in 5/23 courses (5 patients), all occurring in patients with greater than 25% replacement by tumor in the bone marrow. Neutropenia to a nadir of less than 500/microL was seen in only 2 patients, both with greater than 50% bone marrow replacement after 2 and 4 courses of 131I-MIBG, respectively. Tumor doses were calculated in patients with an evaluable measurable lesion, and ranged from 312-6329 cGy per course. Two of the eleven patients had partial responses, with one long-term survivor with stage IV neuroblastoma with no evidence of active disease now 4 years off treatment. Two other patients survive with stable disease after 3 treatments, at 3+ and 5+ months. Seven patients died with progressive disease. This study shows that treatment with 131I-MIBG is safe and can be effective in refractory neuroblastoma, particularly in patients who do not have extensive bone and bone marrow involvement.
