Brain SPECT Simulation Using Half-Cone-Beam Collimation and Single-Revolution Helical-Path Acquisition. In this study related to human brain SPECT imaging, simulation of half-cone-beam collimation and helical-path data acquisition is performed. We discuss problems related to circular-orbit acquisition using cone-beam collimation, such as shoulder interference resulting in object truncation, and insufficient sampling of the object resulting in axial distortions in the reconstructed images. We demonstrate that a triple-camera SPECT system with half-cone-beam collimation and single-revolution helical-path acquisition eliminates both issues and offers substantially improved sampling and almost artifact-free reconstruction of the object.
