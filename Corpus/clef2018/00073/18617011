Targeted imaging: an important biomarker for understanding disease progression in the era of personalized medicine. The key to applying targeted imaging to personalized medicine is the choice of the right radiolabeled probe for the right target for the right disease following the lead of pharmaceutical development. The imaging approach differs depending on whether the target is a single disease control point (e.g. a specific receptor or transport protein linked to the mechanistic activity of a drug) or a general disease control point applicable to a number of treatment paradigms (e.g. proliferation, angiogenesis, inflammation). But in either case, the number of control points must be small given the time constraints on molecular imaging procedures in the clinic. Regardless of the choice, the radiotracer must be validated as binding to the target with the appropriate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for effective external imaging. Such an imaging agent developed in concert with drug development has a built in synergy that will accelerate the drug development process, targeted imaging and personalized medicine as well.
