Highly iodinated intravenous contrast material for PET/CT - a feasibility study. Intravenous contrast materials (CM) are of benefit in PET/CT imaging. However, CM may influence tracer quantification and may cause artifacts when using the CT data for PET attenuation correction. The aim of the study was to assess the feasibility of applying a highly concentrated CM (HCCM, 400 mg iodine/ml) in PET/CT in comparison to a lower concentrated CM (LCCM, 300 mg iodine/ml).In 60 whole-body FDG PET/CT scans (30 scans each with HCCM and LCCM), tracer uptake (maximal standardized uptake value - SUVmax) and CT attenuation (Hounsfield Units) were quantified at 16 positions in different vessels and parenchyma. The number of potential PET artifacts was documented. The Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test was performed for statistical assessment (p < 0.05).HCCM did not cause a significant increase in the SUVmax (p > 0.05) or the number of PET artifacts (p = 0.69) while simultaneously significantly increasing CT attenuation (p = 0.002) as compared to LCCM in 11 / 16 positions.The application of HCCM seems feasible in PET/CT and should be considered in future protocols.
