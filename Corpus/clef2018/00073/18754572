Fluorine-18-labeled phospholipid quantum dot micelles for in vivo multimodal imaging from whole body to cellular scales. We have designed new nanoprobes applicable for both positron emission tomography (PET) and optical fluorescence in vivo imaging. Fluorine-18, which is commonly used for clinical imaging, has been coupled to phospholipid quantum dot (QD) micelles. This probe was injected in mice and we demonstrated that its dynamic quantitative whole body biodistribution and pharmacokinetics could be monitored using PET as well as the kinetics of their cellular uptake using in vivo fibered confocal fluorescence imaging. Phospholipid micelle encapsulation of QDs provides a highly versatile surface chemistry to conjugate multiple chemicals and biomolecules with controlled QD:molecule valency. Here, we show that, in contrast with several previous studies using other QD polymer coatings, these phospholipid QD micelles exhibit long circulation half-time in the bloodstream (on the order of 2 h) and slow uptake by reticulo-endothelial system.
