Brain dysfunction during motor activation and corpus callosum alterations in schizophrenia measured by cerebral blood flow and magnetic resonance imaging. Sixteen unmedicated (14 never-medicated, 2 with washout periods of 1-2 weeks) schizophrenic patients displaying positive symptoms (e.g., formal thought disorder, hallucinations, delusions) without negative symptoms (e.g., flattening of affect, loss of energy, anhedonia--type I patients), 15 unmedicated (with washout periods from 1 week to 2 years) patients with marked negative symptomatology [type II patients criterion score below 15/above 35 on the Munich version of the Scale of Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), respectively], and 31 matched normal controls were investigated using regional cerebral blood flow [rCBF
