Two-stage hepatectomy (R0) with portal vein ligation--towards curing patients with extended bilobular colorectal liver metastases. Patients with bilobular colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) experience poor prognosis, especially when curative resection cannot be achieved. However, resectability in these patients is often limited by low future remnant liver volume (FRLV). The latter can be enhanced by a two-stage liver resection, using portal vein ligation to induce liver hypertrophy. The aim of this prospective pilot study was to evaluate safety, secondary resectability, and time to recurrence of two-stage hepatectomy with portal vein ligation (PVL) and complete surgical clearance of the FRLV in patients with bilobular CRLM.Out of 24 patients (63+/-8.26 years) with extended bilobular CRLM (metachronous n=10, synchronous n=14), 18 received preoperative 5-FU-based chemotherapy combined with oxaliplatin or irinotecan. Staging included thoracoabdominal computed tomography and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans. First-stage procedure consisted of PVL, resection of all CRLM in the FRLV, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of CRLM situated near the future resection plane.During first-stage procedure, 7x RFA, 4x non-anatomical resections, and 4x bisegmentectomies were performed additionally to PVL. FRLV/body-weight ratio increased from 0.4% to 0.6% within 55 days (median) after PVL. Second-stage hepatectomy was performed in 19 patients without tumor progression. R0 resection was possible in 14 patients. During a median follow-up of 17 months, intrahepatic recurrence occurred in two, and extrahepatic recurrence in nine out of 14 patients.Two-stage hepatectomy with PVL and complete surgical clearance of FRLV is safe even after intensified systemic chemotherapy resulting in a curative resection rate of 58.3% (73.7% of re-explored cases).
