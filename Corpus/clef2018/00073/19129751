Assessment of MAO-B occupancy in the brain with PET and [11C]-L-deprenyl-D2: a dose-finding study with a novel MAO-B inhibitor, EVT 301. Inhibition of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) activity in the brain is a putative strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We performed a dose-selection and validation study of a novel, reversible MAO-B inhibitor, EVT 301. Sixteen healthy volunteers received selegiline (10 mg) or EVT 301 (25, 75, or 150 mg) daily for 7-8 days, and four subjects with AD received 75 mg of EVT 301. MAO-B occupancy in the brain was assessed using positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]-L-deprenyl-D2. EVT 301 was found to dose-dependently occupy MAO-B in the human brain, with occupancy ranging from 58-78% at a dose of 25 mg to 73-90% at a dose of 150 mg. The corresponding occupancy after selegiline was 77-92%. Determination of MAO-B inhibition in blood platelets underestimated the actual brain occupancy achieved with EVT 301. A daily EVT 301 dose of 75 or 150 mg appears suitable for clinical efficacy studies in patients with AD.
