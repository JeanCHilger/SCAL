PET-CT in detection of meningeal metastasis in neuroblastoma. Neoplastic meningitis is being recognized with increasing frequency in patients with cancer: the common causes being adenocarcinomas originating from the lung, stomach, breast, ovary, malignant melanoma, leukemia, lymphoma, Ewings sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, retinoblastoma and primary CNS malignancies. Meningeal metastases, though rare can be seen in advanced stages of neuroblastoma. Recognition of meningeal metastases is crucial for successful diagnosis and prompt treatment of these patients. Here, we present two patients of neuroblastoma in whom positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) examination resulted in detection of meningeal metastases at diagnosis thus, emphasizing the need of inclusion of brain imaging in PET-CT protocol in all cases of advanced neuroblastoma.
