A Phase 1 study of beta-methyl-p-(123I)-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid (123I-BMIPP). Phase 1 study of beta-methyl-p-(123I)-iodophenylpentadecanoic acid (123I-BMIPP), a new radiopharmaceutical developed for the evaluation of myocardial fatty acid metabolism, was performed in six normal volunteers to evaluate its biodistribution and safety. After intravenous injection of 111 MBq of 123I-BMIPP, the agent accumulated to the myocardium rapidly (5.4 +/- 0.6% at 1.5 hr after injection) and was washed-out slowly (5.1 +/- 0.4% at 3.0hr). 123I-BMIPP demonstrated no significant accumulation to any specific organs other than myocardium, liver and muscle. Myocardium was clearly visualized in the planar and SPECT images obtained 30 min and 3 hrs after injection. The absorption doses from 123I-BMIPP estimated by MIRD method were lower than those from 201Tl in all organs. Neither adverse reactions nor abnormal clinical laboratory findings were found in the safety evaluation. These results suggest 123I-BMIPP is a promising agent for evaluating myocardial fatty acid metabolism.
