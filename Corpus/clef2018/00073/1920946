Evaluation of brain perfusion SPECT imaging using 99mTc-ECD. Fundamental and clinical evaluation was performed on 99mTc-ECD, a new agent for brain perfusion SPECT. Radiochemical purity reaches a plateau of approximately 98% at 30 min after reconstitution and remains stable up to 24 hours later. A biodistribution study showed approximately 5% injected dose in the brain, very slow brain washout of 5.6% per hour on the average, and rapid washout from the other organ mainly through the urinary system. Brain ECD distribution was determined within 2 min postinjection and remained stable for up to 1 hour. Three hours later, slight but significant changes in brain distribution were observed, that were relative reduction of cerebral cortical activity and gray to white matter activity ratio, and relative elevation of white matter and thalamic activities. Comparative studies of ECD images with IMP and HMPAO images revealed that radioactivity contrast between affected and unaffected areas was less prominent in ECD than in IMP in cerebral and cerebellar cortical lesions, more prominent in ECD than in IMP in striatal and thalamic lesions, and somewhat more prominent in ECD than in HMPAO in both lesions. Imaging around 1 hour postinjection seems to be more appropriate than immediate postinjection imaging because of the clearance of the extracranial radioactivity and somewhat better radioactivity contrast between affected and unaffected areas.
