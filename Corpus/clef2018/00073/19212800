Assessment of myocardial triglyceride oxidation with PET and 11C-palmitate. The goal of this study was to test whether myocardial triglyceride (TG) turnover including oxidation of TG-derived fatty acids (FA) could be assessed with PET and (11)C-palmitate.A total of 26 dogs were studied fasted (FAST), during Intralipid infusion (IL), during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp without (HIEG), or with Intralipid infusion (HIEG + IL). (11)C-palmitate was injected, and 45 minutes were allowed for labeling of myocardial TG pool. 3D PET data were then acquired for 60 minutes, with first 15 minutes at baseline followed by 45 minutes during cardiac work stimulated with constant infusion of either phenylephrine (FAST, n = 6 IL, n = 6This is the first study to demonstrate that using PET and pre-labeling of intracardiac TG pool with (11)C-palmitate, noninvasive assessment of myocardial TG use is feasible under metabolic conditions that favor endogenous TG use such as increased metabolic demand (beta-adrenergic stimulation of cardiac work) with limited availability of exogenous substrate (HIEG).
