Adverse events in a freestanding radiology office. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency, types, and severity of adverse events that occur in a freestanding outpatient radiology office setting and discuss the actions taken for patient treatment and subsequent triage.Adverse event records from a freestanding outpatient radiology office were reviewed from January 2003 through December 2006. Data were grouped into different modalities, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography/computed tomography, and interventional radiology. Adverse reactions and events were reviewed, including what, if any, immediate treatment was provided in the office, how the patient responded, whether the patient was discharged home, and whether emergency medical services were called.A total of 106,800 patients were evaluated over 4 years, among whom 59 experienced (0.06%) adverse events. Seventy-six percent of the patients (n = 45) were treated in the office and were discharged home or returned to work. Thirty-one percent of the patients (n = 18) required assistance from emergency medical services.The outpatient radiology office setting is a safe arena for patients to undergo imaging studies and selected interventional procedures. Medical personnel in office settings are able to assess and treat those patients experiencing adverse events and can appropriately judge whether further aid is needed for patients in distress via emergency medical services or hospital care.
