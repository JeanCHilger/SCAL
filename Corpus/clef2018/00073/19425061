Alzheimer's disease and corticobasal degeneration presenting as corticobasal syndrome. The aim of this article is to compare patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and corticobasal degeneration pathology (CBD) presenting as corticobasal syndrome (CBS). Clinicopathologic series was used. Five patients with AD and 11 patients with CBD were clinically diagnosed with CBS. Patients with AD pathology had an earlier age of onset than patients with CBD pathology (58 vs. 68 years, P = 0.004), but the two groups had similar disease duration and core features of CBS. Tremors were only present in CBD cases (73%, P = 0.026), but myoclonus was more common in AD than CBD (80 vs. 18%, P = 0.036). Neuropsychological testing showed similar degrees of memory impairment and attentional deficits. (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT imaging demonstrated parietal hypoperfusion in AD patients and frontotemporal hypoperfusion in CBD patients. AD patients with clinical CBS have similar characteristics to CBD patients. Functional brain imaging may have greater utility than the clinical and neuropsychological features in differentiating AD presenting as CBS from CBD.
