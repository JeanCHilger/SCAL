Prevalence of noncardiac findings on low dose 64-slice computed tomography used for attenuation correction in myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT. Electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered, low dose computed tomography (CT) is increasingly used for attenuation correction in myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with SPECT. The purpose of the study was to assess the prevalence of relevant noncardiac findings in the field-of-view of such attenuation correction CT scans. Five hundred and eighty-two consecutive patients (211 female, 371 male mean age: 64 +/- 11 years
