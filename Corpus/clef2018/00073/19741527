Primary central nervous system lymphoma. This review will summarize recent advances in the understanding and treatment of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL).The molecular and genetic characteristics that distinguish PCNSL are beginning to be elucidated. New tools such as flow cytometry and PET are improving the diagnosis and management of PCNSL. Although the current standard of care is high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with whole brain radiotherapy, multiple questions remain regarding the optimal treatment of PCNSL, in general, and unusual variants of PCNSL.Although recent advances have improved our understanding of PCNSL, the need for additional collaborative research is critical.
