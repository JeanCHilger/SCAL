Neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced rectal tumors. We investigated the response rate and side effects of simultaneous, neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT) in locally advanced rectal cancer. Between 2005 and 2007, we treated 112 patients in stage II-III rectal carcinoma at the Institute of Oncotherapy, University of PÃ©cs. For staging abdomino-pelvic CT (112) and transrectal US (49) or pelvic MR (10), or PET-CT (1) was performed. Radiation therapy was delivered with 3D CRT-based technique using belly-board with 18 MV photon energy, while patients in prone position. A total dose of 45 Gy (single dose 1.8 Gy) was delivered to the tumor and the pelvic lymph nodes. 5-FU and Ca-folinate was administered concomitantly in the 1st and 5th week of radiotherapy. Four weeks after delivering neoadjuvant RCT the patients' control CT was evaluated according to RECIST criteria. RCT was followed by surgery in 6-9 weeks. We graded the histology using the Mandard regression score system. Side effects were registered using CTCAE v 3.0. Grade 1, 2 or 3 acute gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 12%, grade 3 hematological toxicity in 9.5% of the patients. The response rate determined by using control CT was 64.85%. According to the Mandard regression score, TRG1 occurred in 15%, TRG2 in 30.4%, TRG3 in 28%, TRG4 in 24% and TRG5 in 2.6% of the cases. Radical surgery was performed in 89 cases, 72 with R0 resection. By assessing the histological samples we found downstaging in 46% of the T and 34.5% of the N stage. We have no information on increased postoperative complications. We followed 86 patients after neoadjuvant therapy. Until March 2009 there was no progression in 48 of our patients. In 13 cases local relapse occurred, and in 25 cases the disease progressed because of distant metastasis, although local control was maintained. 10 patients had local relapse and distant metastases. 17 patients passed away. As a conclusion, neoadjuvant RCT of Stage II-III patients is an effective and well tolerated treatment, allowing for high R0 resection rate and bearing no higher risk for postoperative morbidity.
