Positron Emission Tomography and Computer Tomography (PET/CT) in Prostate, Bladder, and Testicular Cancers Positron emission computed tomography (PET) is a functional, noninvasive method for imaging regional metabolic processes that is nowadays most often combined to morphological imaging with computed tomography (CT). Its use is based on the well-founded assumption that metabolic changes occur earlier in tumors than morphologic changes, adding another dimension to imaging. This article will review the established and investigational indications and radiopharmaceuticals for PET/CT imaging for prostate cancer, bladder cancer and testicular cancer, before presenting upcoming applications in radiation therapy.
