Development of [F-18]fluorine-substituted Tanaproget as a progesterone receptor imaging agent for positron emission tomography. The level of progesterone receptors (PRs) in breast tumors can be used to guide the selection of endocrine therapies for breast cancer patients. To this end, we have prepared a fluorine-18 labeled analogue of Tanaproget, a nonsteroidal progestin with very high PR binding affinity and low affinity for androgen and glucocorticoid receptors, and have studied its tissue distribution in estrogen-primed rats to evaluate its potential for imaging PR levels by positron emission tomography. 4-[(18)F]Fluoropropyl-Tanaproget ([(18)F]9, FPTP) was prepared in three steps, within 140 min at an overall decay-corrected yield of 5% and effective specific activity of >550 Ci/mmol. In biodistribution studies, [(18)F]9 uptake was high in target tissues at both 1 and 3 h (uterus, 4.55 and 5.26%ID/g ovary, 2.32 and 2.20%ID/g, respectively) and was cleanly blocked by coinjection of excess unlabeled compound. Uterus to blood and muscle activity ratios were 9.2 and 5.2 at 1 h and 32 and 26 at 3 h, respectively. The biodistribution of [(18)F]9 compares favorably to that of previously prepared F-18 labeled steroidal progestins, FENP and FFNP. Its high target tissue uptake efficiency and selectivity, and prolonged retention, suggest that it has excellent promise as a PET imaging agent for PR-positive breast tumors.
