Two more cases of evaluation of POEMS syndrome using 18-FDG PET/CT. Following the article of Alberti et al., we would like to provide our own experience with two more cases in evaluation of POEMS syndrome using morphological and functional imaging modalities, including plain X-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scintigraphy and positrons emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT). Among them, 18-FDG PET/CT proved its usefulness allowing extensive screening of the bony lesions involved.
