PET and CT cross-modality medical image fusion based on out-location frame. To develop a new method of PET and CT cross-modality medical image fusion based on out-location frame.PET/CT cross-modality medical images were obtained based on the out-location frame and the external fiducial marker on the frame was used for rigid medical image registration. A variation model based on the wavelet transform was used for image fusion.The CT images were displayed by grey scale and overlaid with the PET images displayed by chromatic scale to obtain the image after registration and fusion.The method of external markers registration can be effective and accurate in achieving PET and CT image fusion.
