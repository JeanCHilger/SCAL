Molecular imaging with SPECT as a tool for drug development. Molecular imaging techniques are increasingly being used as valuable tools in the drug development process. Radionuclide-based imaging modalities such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) have proven to be useful in phases ranging from preclinical development to the initial stages of clinical testing. The high sensitivity of these imaging modalities makes them particularly suited for exploratory investigational new drug (IND) studies as they have the potential to characterize in vivo pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the compounds using only a fraction of the intended therapeutic dose (microdosing). This information obtained at an early stage of clinical testing results in a better selection among promising drug candidates, thereby increasing the success rate of agents entering clinical trials and the overall efficiency of the process. In this article, we will review the potential applications of SPECT imaging in the drug development process with an emphasis on its applications in exploratory IND studies.
