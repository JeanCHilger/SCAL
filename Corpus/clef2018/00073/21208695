Incidence of focal myocardial (18)F-FDG uptake and correlation with coronary calcifications by PET/CT. To evaluate the incidence of (18)F-FDG focal uptake in the myocardium as well as its correlation with coronary vessel calcifications.A total of 130 patients who underwent an oncological PET/CT study were reviewed retrospectively. Sixty-five had undergone a myocardial perfusion study because of clinical suspicion of coronary artery disease (group 1). There were no significant differences in age and gender regarding another group of the same series (n=65 group 2). Focal myocardial (18)F-FDG uptake and the presence of coronary vessel calcifications were identified by 2 independent observers.Group 1: in 18 out of 65 patients (28%) focal myocardial (18)F-FDG uptake was identified (5 had 2 foci total: 23 foci). In 43 out of 65 studies (66%), calcification was identified in the coronary vessels. Group 2: in 6 out of 65 patients (9%) focal myocardial (18)F-FDG uptake was identified (1 had 2 fociPET/CT allows simultaneous assessment of focal myocardial (18)F-FDG uptake and myocardial vessel calcifications. Patients with clinical suspicion of coronary artery disease have a higher incidence of focal myocardial (18)F-FDG uptake and coronary calcifications. However, (18)F-FDG focal uptake is often observed in sites remote from those with calcification.
