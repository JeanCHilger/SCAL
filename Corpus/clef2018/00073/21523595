Regional and whole-body imaging in pediatric oncology. The goals of tumor imaging include tumor detection, tumor characterization and differential diagnosis, imaging-guided biopsy, evaluation of tumor extent and staging, assessment of treatment responses, and surveillance for residual tumor or tumor recurrence. In clinical practice, various combinations of imaging modalities are used to achieve these goals. Recently introduced tumor imaging methods, such as diffusion MRI, perfusion MRI, whole-body MRI, and positron emission tomography (PET-CT), have shown promising results. Depending on tumor type and management plan, imaging protocols for children should be individually optimized to achieve the shortest examination time, the highest image quality, the lowest risk, and maximum clinical benefits. In this article, the roles of regional and whole-body tumor imaging will be reviewed, and several important issues related to recent technical developments will be discussed.
