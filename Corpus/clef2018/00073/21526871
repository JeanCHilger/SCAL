Pancreatic endocrine tumors or apudomas. pancreatic endocrine tumors (PET) are difficult to diagnose. Their accurate localization using imaging techniques is intended to provide a definite cure. The goal of this retrospective study was to review a PET series from a private institution.the medical records of 19 patients with PETs were reviewed, including 4 cases of MEN-1, for a period of 17 years (1994-2010). A database was set up with ten parameters: age, sex, symptoms, imaging techniques, size and location in the pancreas, metastasis, surgery, complications, adjuvant therapies, definite diagnosis, and survival or death.a total of 19 cases were analyzed. Mean age at presentation was 51 years (range: 26-67 y) (14 males, 5 females), and tumor size was 5 to 80 mm (X: 20 mm). Metastatic disease was present in 37% (7/19). Most underwent the following imaging techniques: ultrasounds, computed tomography (CT) an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fine needle aspiration punction (FNA) was performed for the primary tumor in 4 cases. Non-functioning: 7 cases (37%), insulinoma: 2 cases [1 with possible multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)], Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) from gastrinoma: 5 (3 with MEN-1), glucagonoma: 2 cases, 2 somatostatinomas carcinoid: 1 case with carcinoide-like syndrome. Most patients were operated upon: 14/19 (73%). Four (4/14:28%) has postoperative complications following pancreatectomy: pancreatitis, pseudocyst, and abdominal collections. Some patients received chemotherapy (4), somatostatin (3) and interferon (2) before or after surgery. Median follow-up was 48 months. Actuarial survival during the study was 73.6% (14/19).age was similar to that described in the literature. Males were predominant. Most cases were non-functioning (37%). Most patients underwent surgery (73%) with little morbidity (28%) and an actuarial survival of 73.6% at the time of the study.
