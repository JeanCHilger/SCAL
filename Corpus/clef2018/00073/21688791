Red-emission fluorescent probe sensing cadmium and pyrophosphate selectively in aqueous solution. A fluorescent sensor for cadmium (CS) based on the BODIPY fluorophore exploiting the PET (Photoinduced Electron Transfer) mechanism was prepared. CS exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity for detecting cadmium in aqueous buffer solution. In addition, the complex of CS with cadmium could detect pyrophosphate (PPi) selectively and sensitively.
