Urinary bladder carcinoma associated with Paget's disease of skull: Imaging findings on Tc99m-MDP bone scintigraphy, F18-Fluoride PET/CT and F18-FDG PET/CT. We report the imaging findings of a patient with Paget's disease in metastatic carcinoma bladder evaluated by Tc99m-Methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scintigraphy, F18-Fluoride positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and F18-fluorodeoxy glucose (FDG) PET/CT. Tc99m-MDP bone scan showed intense uptake in the skull bones without any other abnormal tracer distribution. F18-Fluoride PET/CT revealed intense uptake in the pelvic bones along with skull bones, but F18-FDG PET/CT showed intense multifocal FDG uptake in the bladder and bilateral inguinal lymph nodes, with no abnormal uptake in the skull bones. CT images showed thickening of skull bones.
