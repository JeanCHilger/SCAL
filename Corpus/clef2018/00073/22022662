FDG-PET/CT and parathyroid carcinoma: Review of literature and illustrative case series. Parathyroid cancer is an uncommon malignant cancer and is associated with a poor prognosis. The staging of parathyroid cancer represents an important issue both at initial diagnosis and after surgery and medical treatment. The role of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) as an imaging tool in parathyroid cancer is not clearly reported in the literature, although its impact in other cancers is well-defined. The aim of the following illustrative clinical cases is to highlight the impact of PET/CT in the management of different phases of parathyroid cancer. We describe five patients with parathyroid malignant lesions, who underwent FDG PET/CT at initial staging, restaging and post-surgery evaluation. In each patient we report the value of PET/CT comparing its findings with other common imaging modalities (e.g., CT, planar scintigraphy with 99mTc-sestamibi, magnetic resonance imaging) thus determining the complementary benefit of FDG PET/CT in parathyroid carcinoma. We hope to provide an insight into the potential role of PET/CT in assessing the extent of disease and response to treatment which are the general principles used to correctly evaluate disease status.
