The association between availability of serotonin transporters and time to relapse in heroin users: a two-isotope SPECT small sample pilot study. Neuroimaging evidence supporting an association between either dopamine or serotonin and time to relapse of heroin users is limited. In this two-isotope SPECT small sample (N=9) pilot study, the relationship between the availability of serotonin transporter (SERT) and dopamine transporter (DAT) and the relapse of heroin users was investigated. A significant negative association between SERT availability and time to relapse among those who relapsed (N=7) was found.
