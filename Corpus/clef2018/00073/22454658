Effect of toki-shakuyaku-san on regional cerebral blood flow in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of toki-shakuyaku-san (TSS) on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). All subjects were administered TSS (7.5â€‰g/day) for eight weeks. SPECT and evaluations using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and Physical Self-Maintenance Scale were performed before and after treatment with TSS. Three patients with MCI and five patients with AD completed the study. No adverse events occurred during the study period. After treatment with TSS, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the posterior cingulate was significantly higher than that before treatment. No brain region showed a significant decrease in rCBF. TSS treatment also tended to improve the score for orientation to place on the MMSE. These results suggest that TSS could be useful for treatment of MCI and AD.
