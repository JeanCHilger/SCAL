Imaging of a case of extramedullary solitary plasmacytoma of the trachea. We describe a case of extramedullary tracheal plasmacytoma that was incidentally discovered in a 73-year-old man on a PET scan performed for assessing the extent of colon cancer. CT scan showed the tumor multiplanar reformation coupled with virtual bronchoscopy allowed proper treatment planning. The tracheal tumor was resected during rigid bronchoscopy. Relevant investigations excluded multiple myeloma. Follow-up CT showed persistent thickening of the tracheal wall, but there has been no recurrence after one-year followup.
