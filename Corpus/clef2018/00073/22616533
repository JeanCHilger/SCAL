Perspectives of molecular visualization in cardiology. The lecture concerns prospects of molecular visualization in cardiology. The term molecular visualization, its aims and problems are characterized Methods of molecular visualization involve such non-invasive techniques as ultrasonic investigation, optic visualization, MR tomography, x-ray CT radionuclide examinations (single photon emission computed tomography and positron-emission tomography). The scope of the above methods and their limits in visualization of biomarker target molecules in different pathological processes on the molecular level, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are outlined. The discussion covers various methodological approaches to molecular visualization of the processes associated with development and progression of atherosclerosis, visualization of atherosclerotic plaques of a high risk underlying myocardial infarction or stroke, thrombosis, inflammation, apoptosis, cardiac failure with myocardial regeneration after myocardial infarction, angiogenesis and other conditions as well as assessment of effect of novel target approaches to CVD treatment. For each of the processes (atherosclerosis, thrombosis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, gene expression and other pathological conditions) biomarker target molecules are considered. Optimal among them are molecular targets with established biological and clinical significance, target-receptors or enzymes, contrast substances, molecular probes tropic to biomarker molecular targets having adequate affinity and pharmacodynamics which allows molecular visualization in clinical setting. The investigators are faced with many unsolved problems which can be studied with methods of molecular visualization.
