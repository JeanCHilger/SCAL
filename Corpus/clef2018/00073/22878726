Peptide immobilization on polyethylene terephthalate surfaces to study specific endothelial cell adhesion, spreading and migration. To control specific endothelial cell (EC) functions, cell adhesive RGDS, EC specific REDV and YIGSR peptides, and angiogenic SVVYGLR sequences were covalently immobilized onto polyethylene terephthalate (PET) surfaces for the purpose of cell culture. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and contact angle measurement were employed for characterization of surface modifications. The peptide density on PET surfaces was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. The surfaces immobilized with peptides were exposed to human umbilical vein endothelial cells to study their specific effects onto EC functions. The results showed that the surface functionalized by these peptides enhanced the EC adhesion, spreading and migration as compared with native PET surfaces. Specifically, the RGDS peptides induced more cell adhesion than other peptides. The YIGSR and SVVYGLR sequences induced more cell spreading and cell migration, represented by intense focal adhesion at the leading edges of cell spreading and migration. The bi-functionalization of RGDS and SVVYGLR peptides (MIX) combined the advantages of both peptides and induced significant EC adhesion, spreading and migration. Our study indicates that the surface functionalization by peptides specific for ECs, especially the combination of RGDS with SVVYGLR or YIGSR peptides, has potential applications in promoting endothelialization of vascular prostheses and for construction of vascularized tissues in tissue engineering.
