Contrast enhanced MRI and ¹⁸F-FDG PET-CT in the assessment of multiple myeloma: a comparison of results in different phases of the disease. The aim of our study was to compare the accuracy of contrast enhanced MRI and FDG PET-CT in the staging, treatment evaluation and follow-up of multiple myeloma.We retrospectively reviewed 210 PET-CT and 210 MRI studies of patients affected by multiple myeloma. MRI was always performed within 15 days of PET-CT. All the images have been evaluated by two expert oncologic radiologists.Patient population included 81 females and 110 males (age 61.9 ± 9.9 years-old). Sixty-two patients have been evaluated at diagnosis, 58 at the end of therapies and 90 during follow-up. In 12/62 patients (19.4%) at diagnosis, differences between MRI and PET-CT findings determined changes in the staging: PET-CT was responsible for 11 down-staging (17.7%) and MRI only for one (1.6%). In 27/40 patients (67.5%) with good or complete clinical response to therapies the normalization of findings was faster for PET-CT than MRI. Ten out of 90 patients (10/90 - 11.1%) in follow-up protocol presented clinical recurrence of the disease: MRI detected active lesions in 8 of them (80.0%) and PET-CT in 5 patients (50.0%, all detected by MRI too).MRI achieved better results than PET-CT in the staging and in patients with multiple myeloma recurrence. PET-CT, showed prompt change of imaging findings, faster than MRI, in patients with positive response to therapy.
