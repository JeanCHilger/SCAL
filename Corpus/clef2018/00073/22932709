Selective syntheses of no-carrier-added 2- and 3-[18F]fluorohalopyridines through the radiofluorination of halopyridinyl(4'-methoxyphenyl)iodonium tosylates. No-carrier-added 2- and 3-[(18)F]fluorohalopyridines were readily synthesized as potentially useful labeling synthons for prospective PET radiotracers through the selective radiofluorination of halopyridinyl(4'-methoxyphenyl)iodonium tosylates, themselves conveniently prepared in a single pot from iodohalopyridines.
