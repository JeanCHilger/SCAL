Optimization of [11C]DASB-synthesis: vessel-based and flow-through microreactor methods. The intention for the present study was to implement a microfluidic set-up for N-(11)C-methylations in a flow-through microreactor device with [(11)C]DASB as model-compound and [(11)C]CH(3)I and [(11)C]CH(3)OTf, respectively, as (11)C-methylation agents. Due to an observed "aging" effect of the (11)C-methylation agents' solution, this goal was not achieved. Nevertheless, based on these observations, the time consumption for the vessel-based routine production of [(11)C]DASB was reduced (34±1 min) and RCY was increased to 45.1±4.6% (EOB 5.2±0.95 GBq EOS).
