Cerebral hemodynamics in multiple cerebral infarction with or without dementia. Cerebral blood flow and metabolism in 25 patients with multiple cerebral infarcts (14 with dementia) and 5 healthy age-matched controls were measured to investigate the difference in cerebral blood low (CBF) and cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) between patients with dementia and patients without dementia. None of the patients had any lesions in the cortex, but all had multiple lesions in the basal ganglionic region, and in the white matter, according to CT images. CBF, CMRO2 and oxygen extraction fraction were measured by positron emission tomography (PET) using the 15O2, C15O2 steady state inhalational technique. In patients with multiple cerebral infarcts the absolute values of CBF and CMRO2 were decreased significantly from normal control values, and there was no significant difference in the absolute values of CBF and CMRO2 between patients with dementia and patients without dementia. In most patients with dementia, relative values (regional value/mean cortical value) of CBF and CMRO2 decreased in the frontal and the parietal cortex. Four patients had repeated PET studies. In two of them, decrease in CMRO2 was preceded by decrease in CBF. These results suggest that dysfunction of frontal cortex and parietal cortex, and chronic ischemia might be related to the occurrence of dementia in patients with multiple cerebral infarcts, which were in the basal ganglia and the white matter.
