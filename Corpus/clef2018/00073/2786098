Detection of multivessel disease in patients with myocardial infarct using exercise myocardial scintigraphy--usefulness of SPECT with qualitative and quantitative analysis. The detection of multivessel disease (MVD) in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) was performed using exercise myocardial scintigraphy with qualitative and quantitative analysis, to compare the diagnostic ability of planar (PL), planar + washout rate (PL + WR), SPECT, Bull's eye + WR (BE + WR) and SPECT + BE + WR. Forty seven patients of anterior MI (SVD: DVD: TVD = 29: 8: 10) and thirty four patients of infero-posterior MI (SVD: DVD: TVD = 16: 8: 10) were reviewed. SPECT was superior to PL to detect ischemia of RCA in patients with anterior MI (50% vs. 100%) and to detect ischemia of diagonal branch in patients with infero-posterior MI (0% vs. 83%). The detection of ischemia of LCX in patients with anterior MI revealed low sensitivity in both PL and SPECT. SPECT + BE + WR showed the highest diagnostic ability to detect MVD in patients with both anterior (87%) and infero-posterior MI (82%). We conclude that SPECT with qualitative and quantitative analysis is the most useful to detect MVD in patients with MI.
