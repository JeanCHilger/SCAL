Serotonin uptake in cerebral cortex cultures: imipramine-like inhibition by N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine. In cultured rat neocortex, uptake of [3H]serotonin (5-HT) and the SPECT radiopharmaceutical N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (IMP) was demonstrated after 4 and 14 days in vitro. Both imipramine and cold IMP inhibited [3H]5-HT uptake. Uptake of [123I]IMP was inhibited by imipramine but not by cold 5-HT. The similarity in the behaviors of IMP and imipramine indicates that uptake of IMP might be related to a serotonergic uptake system in a way that is similar to that in which imipramine is related to such a system.
