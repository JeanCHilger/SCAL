Cerebral glucose and dopa metabolism in movement disorders. The development of positron emission tomography (PET) has enabled us to perform in vivo measurements of certain aspects of regional cerebral function. Regional cerebral glucose metabolism may be readily quantified with [18F] fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) and presynaptic dopaminergic function may be studied with the labelled dopa analog 6-[18F] fluoro-L-dopa. We have applied a model to the analysis of 6-FD/PET data with which in vivo age-related changes in dopaminergic function may be demonstrated in normal subjects. With this technique, we have studied a series of asymptomatic MPTP-exposed subjects and have shown evidence of subclinical nigrostriatal pathway damage. Studies of regional cerebral glucose metabolism with FDG in early Huntington's disease have shown a characteristic impairment in caudate function which precedes the development of caudate atrophy. In addition, some asymptomatic individuals who are at risk for HD have caudate hypometabolism. We feel that, at the present time, PET provides information which is complementary to the clinical examination in establishing a diagnosis of HD. In the future these studies may also help in the investigation of at risk individuals.
