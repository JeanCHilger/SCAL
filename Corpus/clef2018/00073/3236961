Accomplishments of tumor surgery in tumors of the large intestine. Surgical therapy of primary colorectal cancer follows the guidelines of oncological surgery. Radical and radicular dissection of the lymphatic drainage of the primary tumor results in an increased rate of curative resection and a decreased rate of locoregional recurrences. The more standardized resection techniques have led to lower rates of anastomotic leakage and perioperative mortality. While new technology such as PET facilitates discrimination between local recurrences and scar tissues, it has not been proven that adjuvant perioperative therapy improves survival rates. Colectomy and ileo-anal pouch formation allows a sphincter-sparing treatment of patients with adenomatosis coli and ulcerative colitis.
