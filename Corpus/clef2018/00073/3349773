Sensitization to patch test acrylates. Data on allergic contact dermatitis from acrylates and 4 patients sensitized during routine patch testing are reported. During 1982-1985, we used 7 different acrylates for tests. 1 patient out of 22 (= 4.5%) was sensitized to ethyl acrylate and butyl acrylate (1% pet.). Since September 1985, we have used a commercial (meth)acrylate series containing 28 substances. 3 of 24 patients tested became sensitized to ethyl acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate and 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate (0.5% pet.). Because active sensitization with acrylates can be very harmful, it may be necessary to use lower concentrations than recommended. Currently, we test ethyl acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate and 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate at 0.167% pet.
