Dual isotope (81Krm and 99Tcm) SPECT in lung function diagnosis. A method is presented for deriving regional values for lung volume, ventilation, perfusion and dV/dQ ratios suitably plotted for clinical interpretation. Necessary data are obtained from a 12 min dual-head, dual isotope (81Krm and 99Tcm) SPECT acquisition and subsequent graphics and image processing. Computed histograms make possible a detailed quantitative impression of lung function.
