Effect of vascular activity in the determination of rate constants for the uptake of 18F-labeled 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose: error analysis and normal values in older subjects. Regional cerebral blood volume (CBV) can be calculated using data obtained during the kinetic analysis of 18F-labeled 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake measured by positron emission tomography (PET). As a result the influence of vascular activity upon the determination of FDG rate constants can be minimized. The method is investigated by simulation experiments and by analysis of PET studies on seven older, healthy human volunteers aged 52-70 years. The accuracy of measured FDG rate constants k1, k2, and k3, obtained either by omitting the early portion of the uptake curve or by explicit inclusion of CBV as a fit parameter, is compared. The root mean square error in measured rate constant for the latter method is equivalent to that obtained by omitting the first 2.5-3 min of tissue data and neglecting the CBV term. Hence, added information about the physiological state of the tissue is obtained without compromising the accuracy of the (FDG) rate constant measurement. In hyperemic tissue the explicit determination of the vascular fraction results in more accurate estimates of the FDG rate constants. The ratio of CBV determined by this method to CBV obtained using C15O in six subjects with CBV in the normal range was 0.92 +/- 0.32. A comparison of the CBV image obtained by this method with that obtained using C15O in an arteriovenous malformation case demonstrates the accuracy of the approach over a wide range of CBV values. The mean value for CBV fraction in gray matter obtained by this method in the older control group was 0.040 +/- 0.014. Average gray matter rate constants obtained were k1 = 0.084 +/- 0.012, k2 = 0.150 +/- 0.071, and k3 = 0.099 +/- 0.045 min-1.
