Study of quantitative evaluation of liver volume and accumulation rate of radioactive agent with single photon emission computed tomography. The quantitative evaluation on measurement of liver volume and the hepatic accumulation rate of the radioactive agent were studied with respect to body constitution, background activity and splenic consumption rate, using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The optical cut-off level for liver volume determination was proved to be reasonable as 35%. The background less than 5% had no influence to their clinical estimation with the error of less than 1.6%. The estimation of liver volume was mostly influenced by the splenic activity. When the splenic activity was increased two times of the hepatic activity, the liver volume was determined as 4.2% larger. Calculated counts by SPECT was well correlated with the hepatic activity. This study proved that SPECT was useful for the quantitative evaluation of the liver volume and the hepatic accumulation rate.
