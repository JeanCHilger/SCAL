Initial experience with SPECT (single-photon computerized tomography) of the brain using N-isopropyl I-123 p-iodoamphetamine: concise communication. Forty-six patients were studied with N-isopropyl I-123 p-iodoamphetamine (IMP) and the Harvard Scanning Multidetector Brain System. In nine control patients, good differentiation between the gray and white matter of the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia was evident. Regional uptake was affected by physiologic maneuvers (visual stimulation). In 24 patients studied for stroke, IMP images demonstrated areas that were involved in acute infarction in eight patients whose initial transmission computerized tomography (TCT) was normal IMP also showed perfusion abnormalities larger than the TCT abnormality in ten patients. Perfusion abnormalities were present in 23/24 of these patients. Seven patients studied with a history of TIA had normal TCT and IMP images. In three patients studied during seizure activity, regions of hyperperfusion corresponded to the EEG seizure focus. Markedly decreased activity was present in three patients with brain tumor and corresponded to the focal abnormality on the TCT study. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of assessing regional brain perfusion using a radiopharmaceutical that is lipid soluble and has a high extraction fraction in the brain, together with single-photon ECT.
