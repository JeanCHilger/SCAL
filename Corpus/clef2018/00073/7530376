5-HT2 and D2 dopamine receptor occupancy in the living human brain. A PET study with risperidone. It has been suggested that a combined blockade of 5-HT2 and D2 dopamine receptors may be superior to D2 dopamine antagonists alone in the treatment of schizophrenia. Risperidone, which has a high affinity for 5-HT2 and D2 dopamine receptors in vitro, is a new antipsychotic drug that has been developed according to this hypothesis. The aim of this study was to examine if risperidone indeed induces 5-HT2 and D2 dopamine receptor occupancy in vivo in humans. Central receptor occupancy was examined by positron emission tomography (PET) in three healthy men after oral administration of 1 mg risperidone. [11C]N-methylspiperone ([11C]NMSP) was used as a radioligand for determination of 5-HT2 receptor occupancy in the neocortex. Both an equilibrium ratio analysis and a kinetic three-compartmental analysis indicated a 5-HT2 receptor occupancy about 60%. [11C]raclopride was used as a radioligand for determination of D2 dopamine receptor occupancy in the striatum and the calculated occupancy was about 50%. This is the first quantitative determination of 5-HT2 receptor occupancy induced by an antipsychotic drug in the living human brain. The results indicate that 5-HT2 receptor occupancy should be very high at the dose level of 4-10 mg risperidone daily, as suggested for clinical use. Risperidone is thus an appropriate compound for clinical evaluation of the benefit of combined 5-HT2 and D2 dopamine receptor blockade in the treatment of schizophrenia.
