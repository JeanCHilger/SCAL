Immunolocalization of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with intravesically administered technetium-99m labelled HMFG1 monoclonal antibody. The aim of this study was the immunolocalization of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with a radiolabelled murine tumour-associated monoclonal antibody and the measurement of the absolute uptake of the antibody by the tumour. Fourteen patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder received 3-6 mCi (111-222 MBq) of technetium-99m labelled HMFG1 monoclonal antibody intravesically and one patient, 2 mCi (74 MBq) of iodine-131 labelled 11.4.1, which is a non-tumour-specific monoclonal antibody. Four of the 15 patients were evaluated with single-photon emission tomography (SPET) 1 1/2 to 2 h post administration. All patients underwent transurethral resection of the bladder tumour within 12-20 h following intravesical administration of the radiolabelled antibody. The radioactivity of biopsy specimens from normal urothelium and tumour areas were counted in a gamma counter. The mean uptake of the radiolabelled antibodies from normal and tumour sites was expressed as a percentage of the administered dose per kilogram of tissue. Conventional histology and immunohistochemistry using HMFG1 monoclonal antibody were performed on paraffin sections of the biopsy specimens. Although our results are preliminary, it can be concluded that: (a) bladder tumours are well imaged by SPET when using 99mTc-HMFG1 (b) intravesically administered radiolabelled antibody remains on the bladder tissue and does not escape into the systemic circulation
