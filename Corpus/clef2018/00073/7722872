M-mode echocardiographic evaluation of contractility and distensibility of infarcted area in patients with inferior myocardial infarction. The relationship between degree of myocardial damage and distensibility and contractility of the infarcted area was evaluated by M-mode echocardiography. Echocardiography was performed to evaluate the left ventricular inferior wall motion in 33 patients with myocardial infarction (MI) at mean 87.03 days after onset. Exercise 201Tl single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was also performed. Eighteen non-MI subjects were analyzed as a control group. Percentage Tl uptake (% TU) of the infarcted area, calculated from SPECT scans, was positively correlated with the mean systolic inferior wall velocity (mSIWV), and with the mean diastolic inferior wall velocity (mDIWV) (r = 0.36, p < 0.05 r = 0.47, p < 0.01, respectively). These data indicate that both velocities were decreased in proportion to the degree of myocardial damage. The patients with MI were divided into two groups based on % TU determined by SPECT. Group I consisted of 17 patients with % TU > or = 60%, and group II 16 patients with % TU < 60%. The patients in group I were diagnosed as having slight myocardial damage, and no relationship between % TU and mSIWV or mDIWV was observed. All patients in group II were diagnosed as having severe myocardial damage, and % TU was closely correlated with mSIWV (r = 0.72, p < 0.01) and with mDIWV (r = 0.70, p < 0.01). All patients in both MI groups displayed a slower mDIWV than the the control subjects (p < 0.05 for group I and p < 0.01 for group II).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
