Effect of successful angioplasty following thrombolysis on infarct size and left ventricular function. The role of the angioplasty following thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction has been discussed in several studies, however the effect of successful angioplasty on infarct size and left ventricular function has not been properly evaluated. Successful reperfusion was achieved in 79 out of 104 patients with primary anterior acute myocardial infarction. These patients were classified as follows, according to the type of intervention during the acute phase: 50 patients in which thrombolysis was successful (the thrombolysis group) 12 patients who underwent successful immediate angioplasty following successful thrombolysis (the immediate angioplasty group)
