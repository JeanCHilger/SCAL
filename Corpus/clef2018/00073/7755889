Network analysis of brain cognitive function using metabolic and blood flow data. Functional neuroimaging has become a powerful tool for investigating the neurobiological foundations of cognition. An overview is presented of the two major strategies by which such data are currently analyzed. One strategy compares the pattern of activity between two (or more) tasks, looking for those brain areas that show significant changes. The second investigates the functional relationships between regional activities in an attempt to determine the systems-level neural networks mediating the tasks. Object and spatial visual processing tasks are used to illustrate each of these strategies.
