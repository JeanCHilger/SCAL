Depression in the elderly. 1. Depression in the elderly is a major health concern that can be life threatening if not recognized and treated. An untreated depression may result in needless suffering, institutionalization, and suicide. Lack of treatment may occur because the signs and symptoms of depression in the elderly are different from those in the young, and because depressive symptoms may be viewed by the older person, the family, and the physician as a normal part of aging. 2. Depression can occur secondarily to physical illness. Because physical illnesses occur frequently in the older population, the combination of physical illness and depression is common. 3. Through noninvasive procedures, such as positron emission tomography (PET), a greater understanding of depression will be achieved that will result in development of more specific and effective treatment. Accurate and early diagnosis and adequate treatment favor a good prognosis.
