IBZM-SPECT as predictor for dopamimetic responsiveness of patients with de novo parkinsonian syndrome. IBZM-SPECT is useful as a predictor for the responsiveness to oral L-DOPA therapy in de novo parkinsonian patients. A reduction of postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptors in de novo parkinsonian patients makes the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease rather unlikely. Normal IBZM binding does not prove the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease however, together with a positive apomorphine test, it strongly supports the clinical diagnosis. At present the combination of IBZM-SPECT and apomorphine testing appears to be a useful procedure for selecting de novo patients for clinical trials with new anti-parkinsonian therapy.
