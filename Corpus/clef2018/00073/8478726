Parametric images for quantitative measurements of regional myocardial blood flow in humans: a step in the right direction. Choi et al. describe a useful method for producing parametric images of myocardial blood flow from dynamic PET 13N-ammonia images of the myocardium. The method is important because it provides a convenient vehicle for quickly displaying anatomically oriented information about absolute values of myocardial blood flow in humans. Absolute values of myocardial blood flow will enhance our ability to assess relative coronary flow reserve and will make it possible to noninvasively and routinely measure absolute coronary flow reserve. In addition, absolute measurements of myocardial blood flow will be useful in addressing important clinical problems, such as myocardial viability, stunning and hibernation. We look forward to the time when technical advances make it possible to obtain accurate parametric images not only of transmural but also endocardial epicardial distribution of blood flow.
