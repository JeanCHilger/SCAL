Scintigraphic assessment of silent myocardial ischaemia after early infarction using myocardial SPET imaging with 201Tl and 123I-MIBG. To test the hypothesis that myocardial sympathetic denervation reflects silent myocardial ischaemia early after infarction, 12 patients with myocardial infarction but without post-infarction angina pectoris underwent single photon emission tomography (SPET) at rest with 201Tl and 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) shortly after and 3 months after infarction. Short-axis SPET images at the basal, mid-ventricular and apical portions of the left ventricle were selected, and each short-axis image was divided into eight segments. Tracer uptake in each of the 24 segments was scored using a 4-point scale. The total score in each segment was calculated as the defect score for each image, and the difference between the total defect score for the 201Tl and 123I-MIBG images was calculated as the delta defect score. All 12 patients underwent exercise stress 201Tl scintigraphy 1 month after infarction, and they were divided into two groups: those patients with (Group A, n = 7) and those patients without (Group B, n = 5) transient perfusion defects in the peri-infarcted region without chest pain. For the 123I-MIBG defect score, a marked reduction at 3 months was observed in Group A (24 +/- 12 vs 13 +/- 6 P < 0.01), whereas the defect score remained unchanged in Group B (25 +/- 7 vs 23 +/- 8
