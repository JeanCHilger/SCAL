Impaired fatty acid uptake in ischemic but viable myocardium identified by thallium-201 reinjection. Iodine 123-labeled 15-iodophenyl-3-methyl-pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) has been proposed as a potential myocardial fatty acid probe. We studied BMIPP uptake in ischemic myocardium identified by thallium reinjection. Fifty-five patients with coronary artery disease who had persistent defects on standard exercise-redistribution thallium imaging were investigated. Patients underwent exercise-redistribution-reinjection thallium and resting BMIPP imaging. BMIPP uptake less than that seen with thallium on reinjection imaging was observed in 105 (82%) of 128 myocardial segments with new fill-in after thallium reinjection and 87 (37%) of 238 segments with reversible thallium defects. In contrast, only 32 (19%) of 166 segments with no fill-in showed discordantly decreased BMIPP uptake. Quantitative analysis showed reduction in BMIPP activity compared with differential uptake of thallium, an index of resting myocardial perfusion, especially in the area of fill-in (53.5% +/- 15.0% vs 76% +/- 12.1% of peak p<0.01). These observations are consistent with impaired fatty acid uptake in ischemic myocardium, particularly in the area of fill-in after thallium reinjection.
