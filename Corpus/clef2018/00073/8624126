Clinical and neuroimaging features of familial Alzheimer's disease. Subtle phenotypic differences between familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) pedigrees can be identified which may reflect the genetic and allelic heterogeneity of the disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) of APP mutation and chromosome 14-linked FAD pedigree members reveals biparietal bitemporal hypometabolism. Scanning of asymptomatic at-risk individuals reveals a similar, but quantitatively less severe, pattern of hypometabolism.
