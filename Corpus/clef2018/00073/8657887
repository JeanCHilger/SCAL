Dopamine (D2) receptor SPECT with 123I-iodobenzamide (IBZM) in diagnosis of Parkinson syndrome. For effective drug therapy of Parkinson's syndrome (PS), it is necessary to distinguish between idiopathic and secondary genesis and PS in neuronal systemic degeneration. [123I]Iodobenzamide ([123I] IBZM) is a radiolabelled benzamide and binds specifically to the cerebral dopamine receptor (D2) in the basal ganglia. The purpose of this study was to determine the value of the [123I]IBZM D2-receptor SPECT in the differential diagnosis of PS. A total of 38 patients (20 females, 18 males age 61 +/- 13.3 years), with typical extrapyramidal symptoms were investigated. Twenty suffered from idiopathic and 11 from secondary PS. Seven patients in whom a neurological disease could be excluded, served as controls. SPECT data were acquired 90 min after i.v. injection of 185-200 MBq [123I]IBZM. After reconstruction with a Butterworth filter (cutoff frequency 0.5) and attenuation correction (coefficient 0.12 cm(-1)) we quantify the IBZM basal ganglia uptake as ratio to teh frontal D2-receptor-free cortex (BG/FC). The patients with idiopathic PS (IPS) and the controls revealed high and specific IBZM uptake in the basal ganglia compared to the adjacent frontal brain tissue (IPS: BG/FC = 1.44 +/- 0.10
