Positron emission tomography for primary tumor detection in lymph node metastases with unknown primary tumor. In a prospective study 16 patients with cervical lymph node metastases from an occult tumor were analyzed by (18F)FDG positron emission tomography (PET). The aim of this study was to locate the primary tumor. In 7 patients a localized increase in activity was seen on PET, with this site of activity histologically proven in 4 patients. No biopsies were taken in 3 patients in areas with a high risk of complications. In a follow-up procedure at 2-22 months after primary radiation therapy in the other 9 patients, no primary tumor has been identified to date.
