Cost-saving approach to normal technetium-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion scan. We conducted a 1-year follow-up of 116 patients with normal poststress technetium-99m sestamibi without images at rest. Although 2 patients with proven coronary artery disease needed cardiac intervention, no patient suffered cardiac mortality or myocardial infarction, suggesting that early interpretation of normal poststress images without images at rest may imply an excellent prognosis for at least 1 year.
