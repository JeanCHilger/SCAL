Pre- and post-therapy thallium-201 and technetium-99m-sestamibi SPECT in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We prospectively studied the diagnostic potential of 201Tl and 99mTc-sestamibi (MIBI) SPECT for evaluating the extent of primary disease and differentiating residual/recurrent disease from post-therapy changes in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).Fifty patients (20 initial presentation, 30 post-therapy evaluation) underwent 201Tl and MIBI imaging. The findings were correlated with CT/MRI results. Tumor-to-background ratios were obtained. Biopsy confirmation (14 patients) and/or 6-12 mo clinical follow-up data (16 patients) were available in the post-therapy group.All primary disease sites were accurately detected by both imaging studies in the pretherapy group. However, MIBI-SPECT was superior to 201Tl SPECT (p = 0.0057) in detecting regional metastases (sensitivities of 95% versus 68%). In the post-therapy group, MIBI and 201Tl imaging were true-positive in 14 of 16 patients with proven residual/recurrent. In 17 patients who had no evidence of residual/recurrent tumor. CT/MRI was false-positive in 13 when MIBI and 201Tl imaging were true-negative in 10 and false positive in 3. MIBI, 201Tl and CT/MRI had sensitivities of 87.5%, 87.5%, 100%, specificities of 82.4%, 76.5%, 23.5% and accuracies of 85%, 82%, 61%, respectively. Tumor-to-background ratios were < or = 1.5 in all false-positive cases except one.MIBI-SPECT proves more accurate than 201Tl SPECT in detecting regional metastases at initial presentation. MIBI and 201Tl imaging have higher specificity and accuracy than CT/MRI and MIBI-SPECT is slightly more specific than 201Tl SPECT in differentiating residual/ recurrent disease from post-therapy changes in patients with NPC.
