Cerebral blood flow imaging in paediatrics: a review. The ability to study regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) is available in many institutions, especially with the spread of multi-headed gamma cameras. The use of this technique in paediatrics requires special attention to detail in the manner of data acquisition and handling the child. The interpretation of the rCBF study in a child requires knowledge of normal brain maturation. The major clinical use in paediatrics is epilepsy because of the advances in surgery and the frequency of complex partial seizures. Other indications in paediatric neurology include brain death, acute neurological loss including stroke, language disorders, cerebral palsy, hypertension due to renovascular disease, traumatic brain injury and migraine. There are paediatric psychological conditions in which rCBF assessment has been undertaken, including anorexia nervosa, autism, Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) and attention deficit disorder-hyperactivity (ADHD). This article attempts to review all aspects of rCBF studies in paediatrics.
