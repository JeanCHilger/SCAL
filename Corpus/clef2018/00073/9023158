Age and referral to coronary angiography after an abnormal treadmill thallium test. This study investigated the association between age and referral to coronary angiography among ambulatory adults with an abnormal treadmill thallium scan. The subjects studied were 416 consecutive adults who were > or = 30 years old, under the care of cardiologists, and had an abnormal treadmill thallium scan between 1990 and 1993 at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The primary end point was performance of coronary angiography within 90 days of the treadmill test. Coronary angiography was performed in 163 subjects. Coronary angiography was performed in 46% of patients aged 30-49 years, in 53% of those aged 50 to 64 years, in 33% of those aged 65 to 74 years, and in only 18% of those aged > or = 75 years (chi2 test for trend, p < 0.0001). After adjustment for potential confounders, age remained associated with a lower rate of referral to angiography (p < 0.0001). During 2 years of follow-up 34 deaths occurred (14 cardiac), with particularly high mortality rates among those aged >74 years (cumulative rate 31%, 95% confidence interval 16% to 47%). The number of abnormal thallium scan segments was predictive of death (p = 0.02). These data suggest that increasing age is associated with a lower rate of referral to coronary angiography after an abnormal treadmill thallium test.
