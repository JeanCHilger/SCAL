The study group also obtained statistical data from a questionnaire sent to hospitals dealing with the disease. [The data collected were analyzed.]The estimated number of patients in Japan through 1994 was 3800. Characteristic epidemiologic data were: female dominance (male to female ratio = 1:1.7) highest rate of onset in the age group below 10 years, with a second mild peak from 30-40 yearsThe clinical features of moyamoya disease are becoming more elucidated.
