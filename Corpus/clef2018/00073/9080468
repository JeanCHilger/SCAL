Development of radioligands for the imaging of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors using SPECT. Part I: Asymmetric synthesis and structural characterization of five new iodine-containing beta-adrenoceptor antagonist derivatives. The asymmetric synthesis of a series of iodinated beta-adrenoceptor ligands is described. One ligand, (S)-(-)-[1-(2-iodophenoxy)]-3'-(tert-butylamino)-2'-propanol (CYBL3), is based on the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist penbutolol. The other ligands are N-iodovinyl and N-iodoaryl analogues of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP12177. These have been synthesized from 2-amino-3-nitrophenol. Furthermore, radioiodinated [123I]CYBL3 and [123I](2'S,2"E)-[4-(3'-(1",1"-dimethyl-3"-iodo-2" propenylamino)-2'-hydroxy propoxy)]-benzimidazol-2-one have been prepared by radiolabelling the corresponding trialkyltin precursors using [123I]-NaI in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.
