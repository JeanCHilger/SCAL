Effect of food intake on liver and spleen volume: assessment with single photon emission computed tomography. The authors evaluated the influence of food intake on liver and spleen size. The rationale was that since a meal induces a marked increase in splanchnic blood flow, organ volume might also be affected. This could influence conclusions made at clinical examination.Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed in 20 healthy volunteers after administration of technetium-99m albumin colloid before and after ingestion of a standardized meal. A semiautomatic technique was used to determine liver and spleen size.There was a nonsignificant reduction in liver volume of 1.5% (P = .063) and a significant reduction in spleen volume of 3.2% (P = .00033) after food intake.Liver and spleen volume are marginally affected by food intake, and the changes are within the methodologic error of radiologic modalities.
