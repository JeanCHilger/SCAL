Assessment of brain perfusion in coma and comparison between SPECT and CT scan data: preliminary report. In this study we submitted 24 comatose patients (Glasgow Coma Score <8) to Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) during the clinical course of coma to verify its utility and the relationship between SPECT and CT scan data. SPECT was recorded following i.v. injection of Xe-133 in 17 patients and of Tc-99m-HMPAO or Tc-99m-ECD in the remaining 7. SPECT data recorded during the acute phase of coma did not show a clear correlation between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and outcome. SPECT and CT scan detected abnormalities in the same areas in 6 cases (25%) 6 patients (25%) with focal CT-scan lesions showed no focal CBF alterations in the same regions
