Dynamic susceptibility contrast MR imaging of regional cerebral blood volume in Alzheimer disease: a promising alternative to nuclear medicine. The goal of our study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity for Alzheimer disease of semiquantitative dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MR imaging as compared with results of qualitative single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in the same patients and with previously published semiquantitative SPECT results.Fifty subjects were studied: 19 patients with probable Alzheimer disease with moderate cognitive impairment, eight mildly impaired patients with possible or probable Alzheimer disease, 18 group-matched elderly healthy comparison subjects, and five elderly comparison patients with psychiatric diagnoses. Relative values of temporoparietal regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were measured as a percentage of cerebellar rCBV, and group classification was assessed with logistic regression. The DSC MR imaging results were compared with SPECT scans in these same subjects and with previously published semiquantitative SPECT data.Temporoparietal rCBV ratios were reduced 20% bilaterally in the patients with Alzheimer disease. Using left and right temporoparietal rCBV as index measures, sensitivity was 95% in moderately affected patients with Alzheimer disease and 88% in patients with mild cases. Specificity was 96% in healthy comparison subjects and in psychiatric comparison subjects. Sensitivity with DSC MR imaging was considerably better than with visual clinical readings of SPECT scans (74% in moderate and 50% in mild Alzheimer disease cases), and was similar to previous published SPECT temporoparietal measurements (90%). Specificity with SPECT was 100% visually and 87% based on previous temporoparietal measurements.DSC MR imaging of rCBV is promising as a safe, potentially lower-cost alternative to nuclear medicine imaging for the evaluation of patients with dementia.
