Clinical value of SPECT scanning in children with neurological disorders. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical value of Tc-99-HMPAO brain single photon emission tomography (SPECT) in 21 children with neurological disorders of varied aetiology. All 21 patients were examined with electroencephalograms (EEGs), 17 with computed tomography (CT) and ten with magnetic resonance imaging (MR). New relevant information was obtained from SPECT in all 21 cases and in four of these cases the investigation directly led to a change in diagnosis and better assessment of the prognosis. It is concluded that SPECT is an important investigational method in children with neurological symptoms of partly or completely unknown aetiology.
