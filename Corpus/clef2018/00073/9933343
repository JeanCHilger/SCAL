Introducing fluorine-18 fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography for the localisation and quantification of pig liver hypoxia. Fluorine-18 labelled fluoromisonidazole ([18F]FMISO) has been shown to accumulate in hypoxic tissue in inverse proportion to tissue oxygenation. In order to evaluate the potential of [18F]FMISO as a possible positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for imaging of liver tissue hypoxia, we measured the [18F]FMISO uptake in 13 domestic pigs using dynamic PET scanning. Hypoxia was induced by segmental arterial hepatic occlusion. During the experimental procedure the fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was set to 0.67 in group A (n=6) and to 0.21 in group B (n=7) animals. Before and after arterial occlusion, the partial pressure of O2 in tissue (TPO2) and the arterial blood flow were determined in normal flow and flow-impaired liver segments. Standardised uptake values [SUV=kBq tissue (in g) / body weight (in kg) x injected dose (in kBq)] for [18F]FMISO were calculated from PET images obtained 3 hours after injection of about 10 MBq/kg body weight [18F]FMISO. Immediately before PET scanning, the mean arterial blood flow was significantly decreased in arterially occluded segments [group A: 0. 41 (0.32-0.52) group B: 0.24 (0.16-0.33) ml min-1 g-1] compared with normal flow segments [group A: 1.05 (0.76-1.46)
