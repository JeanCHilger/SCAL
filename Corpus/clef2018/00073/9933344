Three-step radioimmunotherapy with yttrium-90 biotin: dosimetry and pharmacokinetics in cancer patients. A three-step avidin-biotin approach has been applied as a pretargeting system in radioimmunotherapy (RIT) as an alternative to conventional RIT with directly labelled monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). Although dosimetric and toxicity studies following conventional RIT have been reported, these aspects have not previously been evaluated in a three-step RIT protocol. This report presents the results of pharmacokinetic and dosimetric studies performed in 24 patients with different tumours. Special consideration was given to the dose delivered to the red marrow and to the haematological toxicity. The possible additive dose to red marrow due to the release of unbound yttrium-90 was investigated. The protocol consisted in the injection of biotinylated MoAbs (first step) followed 1 day later by the combined administration of avidin and streptavidin (second step). After 24 h, biotin radiolabelled with 1.85-2.97 GBq/m2 of 90Y was injected (third step). Two different chelating agents, DTPA and DOTA, coupled to biotin, were used in these studies. Indium-111 biotin was used as a tracer of 90Y to follow the biodistribution during therapy. Serial blood samples and complete urine collection were obtained over 3 days. Whole-body and single-photon emission tomography images were acquired at 1, 16, 24 and 40 h after injection. The sequence of images was used to extrapolate 90Y-biotin time-activity curves. Numerical fitting and compartmental modelling were used to calculate the residence time values (tau) for critical organs and tumour, and results were compared the absorbed doses were estimated using the MIRDOSE3.1 software. The residence times obtained by the numerical and compartmental models showed no relevant differences (<10%)
