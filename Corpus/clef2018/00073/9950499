Bilateral decrease in interictal hippocampal blood flow in unilateral mesiotemporal epilepsy. The goal of this study was to determine whether regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes that were found contralaterally to a verified unilateral epileptic focus were associated with the spatiotemporal organization of epileptic abnormalities.The CBF in both hippocampi was assessed using stable Xe-enhanced computerized tomography in a series of 19 patients with unilateral mesiotemporal epilepsy. Results were compared according to the distribution of interictal spiking and the spatiotemporal organization of the ictal discharges as determined by stereoelectroencephalography. Two groups were defined: in Group 1 (nine patients), the discharge remained unilateral in Group 2 (10 patients), the discharge spread to contralateral mesiotemporal structures. For Group 1, the rates of ipsi- and contralateral hippocampal blood flow (HBF) were 32.88+/-15.53 and 45.88+/-17.19 ml/100 g/minute, respectively, whereas in Group 2 they were 36.7+/-11.54 and 36.4+/-11.27 ml/100 g/minute (mean+/-standard deviation). A two-way analysis of variance combining type of seizure (Group 1 compared with Group 2) and HBF (ipsi- compared with contralateral absolute values) demonstrated a main effect for HBF (F[1,17] = 5.051In unilateral mesiotemporal epilepsy, asymmetrical interictal hippocampal perfusion was correlated with restricted unilateral ictal discharges, whereas bilateral hippocampal hypoperfusion was correlated with ictal discharges spreading to the contralateral mesiotemporal structures. The lack of correlation between the degree of hypoperfusion and the percentage of neuron cell loss indicated that the decrease in rCBF has both functional and lesional origins.
