Apolipoprotein E and Alzheimer's disease: a genetic, molecular and neuroimaging review. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and an increasingly significant health concern in our aging population. In the past 10 years, our understanding of this disease has increased dramatically. While the discovery of three rare genetic mutations that can cause AD has provided much information about the causes and progression of the disease, a great deal of attention has been focused on apolipoprotein (ApoE) because of its involvement in the more common, later onset form of AD. Due to the rapid pace of recent advances, it has not been easy for health care professionals, researchers and the general public to keep abreast of these developments. This paper reviews recent research in ApoE and late-onset AD, emphasizing molecular neuropathological, genetic and neuroimaging findings and highlighting current controversies that remain to be addressed.
