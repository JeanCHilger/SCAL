Neuronal nAChR stereoselectivity to non-natural epibatidine derivatives. The frog toxin epibatidine is one of the most powerful ligands of the neuronal nicotinic receptors and derivatives show promising possibilities for labeling in positron emission tomography studies. In an attempt to reduce epibatidine toxicity, new methyl derivatives were synthesized, tested in positron emission tomography imaging and in electrophysiology. labeling as well as physiological experiments highlighted the differences in sensitivity of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors between two methyl enantiomers and the reduction in sensitivity caused by introducing the methyl group. At present, epibatidine derivatives seem the most promising compounds for in vivo labeling of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
