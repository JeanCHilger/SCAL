Composition and structure of the apatite formed on PET substrates in SBF modified with various ionic activity products. An apatite layer was formed on polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) substrates by the following biomimetic process. PET substrates were placed on granular particles of a CaO-SiO2-based glass in simulated body fluid (SBF) with ion concentrations nearly equal to those of human blood plasma to form apatite nuclei on their surfaces (first treatment). They then were soaked in modified SBFs, the ion concentrations of which were changed to give a variation in ionic activity product of apatite (IP), in order to make the apatite nuclei grow (second treatment). The Ca/P atomic ratio and the lattice constant c of the formed apatite decreased from 1.54 to 1.40 and from 6.880 to 6.838 A, respectively, with increasing ion concentrations from 0.75 to 2.00 times those of SBF, that is, with increasing IP from 10(-96.6) to 10(-91.9). This was attributed to an increase in the concentration of HPO4(2-) ion substituting for the PO4(3-) ion sites, which gave an increase in the Ca2+ in the apatite. Even the apatite formed in 1.00 SBF showed a Ca/P ratio of 1.51 and lattice constants a of 9.432 A and c of 6.870 A. The Ca/P ratio and lattice constant c were smaller and the lattice constant a was larger than those of the bone apatite its Ca/P ratio and its lattice constants a and c, were 1.65, 9.419 A, and 6.88 A, respectively. This was attributed to the lower content (2.64 wt%) of the CO3(2-) ion substituting for the PO4(3-) ion sites of the apatite compared to that of the bone apatite (5.80 wt%). The lower content of the CO3(2-) ion in the apatite might be caused by the lower concentration of HCO3- ion in 1.00 SBF compared to that in human blood plasma.
