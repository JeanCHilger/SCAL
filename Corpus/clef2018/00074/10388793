Mechanisms underlying gait disturbance in Parkinson's disease: a single photon emission computed tomography study. Single photon emission computed tomography was used to evaluate regional cerebral blood flow changes during gait on a treadmill in 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and 10 age-matched controls. The subjects were injected with [99mTc]hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime twice: while walking on the treadmill, which moved at a steady speed, and while lying on a bed with their eyes open. On the treadmill, all subjects walked at the same speed with their preferred stride length. The patients showed typical hypokinetic gait with higher cadence and smaller stride length than the controls. In the controls, a gait-induced increase in brain activity was observed in the medial and lateral premotor areas, primary sensorimotor areas, anterior cingulate contex, superior parietal cortex, visual cortex, dorsal brainstem, basal ganglia and cerebellum. The Parkinson's disease patients revealed relative underactivation in the left medial frontal area, right precuneus and left cerebellar hemisphere, whereas they showed relative overactivity in the left temporal cortex, right insula, left cingulate cortex and cerebellar vermis. This is the first experimental study showing that the dorsal brainstem, which corresponds to the brainstem locomotor region in experimental animals, is active during human bipedal gait. The reduced brain activity in the medial frontal motor areas is a basic abnormality in motor performance in Parkinson's disease. The underactivity in the left cerebellar hemisphere, in contrast to the overactivity in the vermis, could be associated with a loss of lateral gravity shift in parkinsonian gait.
