A report system for PET assessment of myocardial viability. Coronary bypass surgery can improve the prognosis of patients with heart failure due to coronary artery disease. However, these patients have a high operative risk and should be operated on only if they have a sizeable amount of viable tissue (i.e. asynergic myocardium) that can recover contractile function following coronary revascularization. In the clinical setting, regional wall motion is usually evaluated by two-dimensional echocardiography, whereas retained metabolic activity assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose is a well-established means for the evaluation of myocardial viability. Unfortunately, the two-dimensional echocardiography and PET reports are often different, and this renders the matching of information difficult and the estimation of the risk-benefit ratio of the operation unreliable. In this paper, we present a report system for the evaluation of myocardial viability with PET. We divided the left ventricle into 16 segments following the proposal of the American Society of Echocardiography for wall motion analysis by two-dimensional echocardiography. Following this partition, three portions of the left ventricle are identified along the long axis: basal, mid and apical. Each plane of the basal and mid portions is automatically divided into six segments with the super-imposition of a radial divider over the short-axis images. Similarly, each plane of the apical portion is automatically divided, but into four segments. This partition of the left ventricle permits a precise match between the information on wall motion obtained with two-dimensional echocardiography and that on viability obtained with PET.
