Effect of regional hyperemia on myocardial uptake of 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose. 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) may be used to predict glucose kinetics when the factor relating differences in transport and phosphorylation between compounds remains constant ("lumped constant"). It is not clear whether hyperemia alters that factor. In anesthetized swine, myocardial FDG uptake was estimated by positron emission tomography, during an intracoronary infusion of either adenosine, ATP, or bradykinin (40 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1), 40 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1), and 2 nmol x kg(-1) x min(-1), respectively n = 6 for all groups). In controls during normal perfusion (n = 6), FDG uptake was 0.78 +/- 0.32 micromol x g(-1) x min(-1), whereas glucose uptake by Fick was 0.71 +/- 0.25 micromol x g(-1) x min(-1) (r = 0.73
