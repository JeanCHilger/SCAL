Lateralized cognitive visuospatial processing: is it primarily gender-related or due to quality of performance? A HMPAO-SPECT study. The brain activity of 13 right-handed students (6 men and 7 women) was determined using high resolution (99m)Tc-HMPAO brain SPECT images during visuospatial tasks. The results showed that there was no significant gender-specific difference in solving the visuospatial tasks and that no meaningful statistical difference in brain activity between the two sexes could be found. When the sample was split into groups of good and poor performers, the results showed that there was a relatively symmetrical brain activity both frontal and parietal in subjects with poor test results. The results for those who performed the tests well, on the other hand, showed increased left frontal and right parietal brain activity. These results would suggest an asymmetric type of processing for better visuospatial brain performance independent of gender.
