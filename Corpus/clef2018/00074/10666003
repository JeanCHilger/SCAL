The inhibition of GLUT1 glucose transport and cytochalasin B binding activity by tricyclic antidepressants. Under normal metabolic conditions glucose is an important energy source for the mammalian brain. Positron Emission Tomography studies of the central nervous system have demonstrated that tricyclic antidepressant medications alter cerebral metabolic function. The mode by which these drugs perturb metabolism is unknown. In the present study the interactions of tricyclic antidepressants with the GLUT1 glucose transport protein is examined. Amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine, and imipramine all inhibit the influx of 3-O-methyl glucose into resealed erythrocytes. This inhibition is observed with drug concentrations in the millimolar range. All four antidepressants also noncompetitively displace cytochalasin B binding to GLUT1. The K(I) for this displacement ranges from 0.56 to 1.43 millimolar. This value is in a range greater than that associated with clinical doses and this effect may not be directly applicable to side effects observed with normal use. The observed interaction of these drugs with GLUT1 may reflect an affinity for other glucose-transport or glucose-binding proteins, and may possibly contribute to tricyclic antidepressant toxicity.
