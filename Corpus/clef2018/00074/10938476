A PET study of adenosine A1 receptor in anesthetized monkey brain. We demonstrated the distribution of adenosine A1 receptors in the anesthetized monkey brain with positron emission tomography (PET) using [(11)C]KF15372 ([1-propyl-(11)C]8-dicyclopropylmethyl-1, 3-dipropylxanthine). [(11)C]KF15372 was injected intravenously. The regional standardized uptake values and the distribution volume were calculated. We also investigated the effect of carrier on the uptake and regional brain distribution of [(11)C]KF15372. The use of [(11)C]KF15372 with dynamic PET scanning could be an appropriate method to analyze the regional binding potential of adenosine A1 receptors in living brain.
