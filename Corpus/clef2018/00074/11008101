18F-FDG Uptake in the Anterior Mediastinum. Physiologic Thymic Uptake or Disease? Purpose: We reviewed 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) studies to determine the frequency of thymic visualization, to characterize this uptake to facilitate differentiation from disease, and to ascertain effects of therapy on visualization.Methods: Hybrid positron emission tomography images performed on 14 patients with known or suspected malignancy before therapy, and on six of the patients after treatment, were reviewed. Mediastinal uptake was characterized by location, contour and intensity.Results: Thymic uptake seen in five patients, 13-16-years-old, was characterized by an anterior midline location, regular contours, and a mean uptake ration of 2.5, and involved large glands. In five patients with mediastinal disease, 16-23-years-old, uptake was more posterior and eccentric in location with irregular borders and a mean uptake ratio of 4.3. One patient had anterior (thymic) and posterior (disease) mediastinal uptake. Three patients, 15-22-years-old, without disease and small thymus glands had no uptake. Five patients, including two with baseline uptake, showed no thymic uptake subsequently. One patient, negative initially, had thymic uptake five months after therapy.Conclusions: Thymic 18F-FDG uptake occurs in younger patients, before or after treatment, and is associated with larger glands. Its midline anterior mediastinal location and mild intensity should facilitate discrimination from disease.
