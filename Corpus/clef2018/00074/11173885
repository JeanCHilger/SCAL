Cerebrospinal fluid tau levels increase with age in healthy individuals. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau is a promising biochemical ante-mortem marker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Levels are increased in AD compared to other dementias, neurological diseases and healthy controls. An age-related decrease in both soluble tau and tau bound to paired helical filaments has been shown in brains from non-demented subjects. To study tau levels in normal ageing, we investigated CSF in 29 healthy individuals aged 45-80 years. A statistically significant increase in CSF tau with increasing age was found which might be caused by neuronal loss during normal ageing and redistribution of soluble tau from the brain into CSF. We could not demonstrate any influence by the APOE genotype, though larger populations have to be investigated to confirm this result. In conclusion, we found an age-dependent increase in CSF tau in healthy individuals. We emphasise the importance of establishing an age-dependent interval of CSF tau in non-demented subjects.
