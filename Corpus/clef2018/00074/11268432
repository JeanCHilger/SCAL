Detection of esophageal carcinoma using single photon emission computed tomography with technetium-99m tetrofosmin. Technetium-99m tetrofosmin (Tc-TF) a thallium-201 (Tl-201) and technetium-99m methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (Tc-MIBI) competitor, being used as a new radiopharmaceuticalfor myocardial imaging was assessed to understand its value in detecting esophageal carcinoma (Eso-Ca). Forty patients with Eso-Ca underwent Tc-TF single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the chest. Meanwhile 15 controls also accepted Tc-TF SPECT of the chest for comparison. Among the 40 patients Tc-TF chest SPFCT detected Eso-Ca in 33 (82.5%) but not in 7 (17.5%). In contrast all 15 normal controls (100.0%) had negative Tc-TF chest SPECT Detection sensitivities were higher for tumors located in the middle portion of the esophagus for epidermoid ca and for tumors with poor differentiation when compared with tumors in the upper or lower portion for adenocarcinoma and tumors with moderate differentiation. However, the differences were not significant (p values < 0.05). Significantly higher detection sensitivity was found for tumors of larger size than for tumors of smaller size (p value < 0.05). Our results suggest that Tc-TF chest SPECT is a helpful test for detecting Eso-Ca especially larger tumors.
