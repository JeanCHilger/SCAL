Biogenic amine metabolites and thiamine in cerebrospinal fluid in heredo-degenerative ataxias. The aims of the present study were: i) to measure levels of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA), the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) and precursor tryptophan, as well as the noradrenaline metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol (MHPG) and thiamine in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Friedreich's ataxia (FA), olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA), and the autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSAC), as compared with sex- and age-matched control subjects.CSF amine related compound levels and thiamine results were compared in 40 FA, 44 OPCA and nine ARSAC patients with those of 94 sex- and age-matched subjects. Neuroimaging (CT scans and single photon emission computed tomographies i.e. SPECT) were carried out in all patients and controls. Genetic studies were conducted on OPCA patients. CSF amine related compounds were measured by high performance liquid chromatography, whereas CSF thiamine levels were measured by a microbiological method.FA patients had significantly lower CSF HVA, 5HIAA and thiamine values than control patients and a trend for lower MHPG levels. In OPCA patients, CSF HVA, MHPG and thiamine values were markedly lower whereas CSF 5HIAA values showed only a trend towards lower levels in ARSAC patients only thiamine and HVA CSF values were lower than those in control subjects.After presenting the relationships between neurochemical findings on one side, the degree of ataxia, the degree of cerebellar atrophy and the SPECT findings on the other, the authors concluded that replacement and neuroprotective clinical trials in these patients would have to include two or three drugs because the neurotransmitter deficiencies are multiple.
