Clinical analysis of myocardial perfusion and metabolism in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by single photon emission tomography and positron emission tomography. Changes in myocardial energy metabolism and their relation to coronary flow reserve in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were assessed by myocardial fatty acid imaging with iodine-123 beta-methyliodophenyl pentadecanoic acid single photon emission tomography (123I-BMIPP SPECT) (fasting), glucose imaging with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) (fasting), and perfusion imaging with nitrogen-13 (13N)-ammonia PET (dipyridamole-stress and at rest) in adult patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and with asymmetric septal hypertrophy.123I-BMIPP defects mismatched with thallium-201 (201Tl) uptake were often observed in the hypertrophic septal regions indicating reduced fatty acid utilization incidence of 59% (22/37). 18F-FDG images showed diffusely increased uptake in most of the patients (73%, 27/37), but showed regionally increased 18F-FDG uptake at the septal regions in only two patients. Study of 18 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with the mismatched 123I-BMIPP defects found that the severity of the defects correlated with reduced coronary flow reserve determined by the 13N-ammonia PET study. On the other hand, changes in 18F-FDG images were not related to those in coronary flow reserve.These results suggest that the mismatched 123I-BMIPP defects, which indicate abnormality in myocardial fatty acid metabolism, occur under reduced coronary flow reserve, and may contribute to the prediction of progressive myocardial failure in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The significance of 18F-FDG in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is still uncertain.
