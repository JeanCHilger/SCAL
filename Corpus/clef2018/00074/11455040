Analysis of HMPAO SPECT scans in head injury using Statistical Parametric Mapping. The paper examines the ability of Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) to contribute towards the quantitative analysis of HMPAO SPECT images containing lesions. A validation study is described in which SPECT images were created that contained synthetic lesions and were analysed with SPM. The study established a set of guidelines concerning the alignment, smoothing, and statistical analysis of images. These were then applied to analysis of SPECT scans from head injured patients. A demonstration is given of the use of SPM to identify localised blood flow abnormalities associated with cognitive deficits after head injury. Correlations between blood flow abnormalities and a test of visual memory are illustrated.
