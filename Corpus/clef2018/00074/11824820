Identification of metabolites of fluorine-18-labeled M2 muscarinic receptor agonist, 3-(3-[(3-fluoropropyl)thio]-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine, produced by human and rat hepatocytes. An accurate, rapid method for the determination of unmetabolized 3-(3-[(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)thio]-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yl)-1.2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine (FP-TZTP), a selective M2 muscarinic agonist, is necessary in order to obtain quantitative information from positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Using LC-MS-MS to analyze products from cultured human and rat hepatocytes, we identified metabolites resulting from oxidation of the nitrogen in the tetrahydropyridine ring, sulfur-oxidation, demethylation of the tertiary amine, and oxidation of the tetrahydropyridine ring. From the knowledge of the structure of the metabolites, we have developed a two-step extraction sequence that allows rapid determination of the parent fraction in plasma without time-consuming chromatographic analysis.
