No change in dopamine D1 receptor in vivo binding in rats after sub-chronic haloperidol treatment. A frequent side effect in the long-term treatment of schizophrenia with the dopamine D2 antagonist haloperidol (HAL) is the appearance of tardive dyskinesia or, in animals, of repetitive involuntary vacuous chewing movements (VCMs). In rats, chronic HAL-induced or D1 receptor-stimulated VCMs are suppressed by D1 antagonists, suggesting that this behavioral supersensitivity is mediated by D1 receptors. The goal of this study was to investigate in vivo the possible relationship between D1 receptor binding and D1-mediated behavioral supersensitivity, after subchronic HAL treatments. D1 agonist R-SKF 82957 and antagonist SCH 23390, both labeled with carbon-11, were used to assess in vivo D1 receptor binding. Rats were treated with HAL (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle for 21 days, followed by a 4 day washout period. No significant difference was found in the regional brain binding of either radioligand. D1 receptor-mediated behaviors including VCMs, grooming, and rearing were measured in control or HAL-treated rats. VCMs were significantly increased in HAL-treated rats, suggesting D1 receptor stimulation and possibly receptor supersensitivity. This study failed to link the purported D1 receptor-mediated behaviors with in vivo receptor binding measures of R-[11C]SKF 82957 or [11C]SCH 23390 in rat brain regions.
