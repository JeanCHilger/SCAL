Negative symptoms, depression and Alzheimer's disease. To apply the negative symptoms (NS) concept used in schizophrenia to patients with AD, to compare the results with the frontal lobe perfusion in ethyl cysteinate dimmer (ECD) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and with the apolipoprotein E genotype.32 patients with a diagnosis of probable AD were assessed by the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS-N), the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS), the NeuroPsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE). Each patient underwent ECD SPECT and APO E genotyping. PANSS-N, MADRS, NPI, and MMSE were administered to 19 normal elderly control subjects.The mean PANSS-N score for AD patients (20.56, SD: 8, range: 7-40) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than that of controls (7, SD: 0). MADRS scores were not significantly different (p = 0.75) between AD patients (9.03, SD: 6.14, range: 0-25) and controls (6.2, SD: 3.61, range: 1-15). The NPI apathy score (0-12) was correlated with PANSS-N (p < 0.001). Correlation between prominent frontal hypoperfusion (six cases) and NS was at the limit of significance. No relation was found between epsilon E4 and NS.This consideration is important in distinguishing between depression and AD.
