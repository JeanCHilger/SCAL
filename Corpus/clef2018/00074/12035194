From puppy to service dog: raising service dogs for the rehabilitation team. Service dogs, also known as assistance dogs, are seen increasingly in public places, including healthcare settings. Whereas an earlier article reviewed literature relevant to the human-animal bond in general, this article recounts my personal and professional experiences as a volunteer for Canine Companions for Independence (CCI). Rehabilitation professionals are advocates for their clients, and this article provides important information about the issues, benefits, and challenges in obtaining, training, and living with a service dog. For additional information, sources available through the Internet and a bibliography are provided.
