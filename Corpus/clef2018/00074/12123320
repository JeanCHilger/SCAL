The incidence of discrepant regional myocardial uptake between 201 thallium and 123 I-BMIPP SPECT in patients with coronary heart disease. Myocardial perfusion and fatty acid uptake at rest were assessed by SPECT with 201Tl (Tl) and 123I-BMIPP (BMIPP) in 50 consecutive patients with coronary heart disease. Discrepant regional myocardial uptake was observed in 19 patients and classified into the following two groups: mismatch (MM Tl uptake > BMIPP uptake, n = 14, mean age, 66 years) and paradoxical mismatch (PM
