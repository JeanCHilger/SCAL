Technetium-99m tetrofosmin imaging in malignant lymphomas. To assess the utility of 99mTc tetrofosmin (TF) scintigraphy as a diagnostic modality in lymphomas.Seventeen patients (14 with Hodgkin's disease and three with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas age range, 10-59 years) were investigated. Planar and SPECT images of the supradiaphragmatic region (including neck and chest) were obtained. All patients were untreated at the time of the first scintigraphy. Follow-up scans after therapy were acquired in six patients (in five twice), so a total of 28 scintigraphic studies were performed. Mediastinal, pulmonary, cervical, supraclavicular and axillary activity was evaluated and results were compared in a blinded fashion with those of CT.TF imaging demonstrated pathological focal uptake at 38 sites (16 in the mediastinum, eight in the lungs, four in the axillae, eight in the supraclavicular region and two in the cervical region) in 16 of 17 untreated patients. CT identified 24 lesions (16 in the mediastinum, two in the lungs, two in the axillae, two in the supraclavicular and two in the cervical region) in 17 patients. Scintigraphy detected 22 of the 24 lesions demonstrated by CT and revealed 16 unknown tumor sites in 10 patients. The only negative pre-treatment scintigraphy result was found in a patient with axillary lymph node involvement. On the first post-treatment scintigrams there was a reduction in the number of visualized pathological sites (seven vs 16) in five of the six patients examined. The second follow-up study demonstrated only two lesions in two of the five patients examined.Our preliminary results indicate that TF imaging is effective in depicting supradiaphragmatic lymphoma lesions in untreated patients and suggest that serial scintigraphic studies may be suitable for monitoring response to treatment. However, larger series are needed to better define the possible role of TF scintigraphy in the follow-up of the response to therapy.
