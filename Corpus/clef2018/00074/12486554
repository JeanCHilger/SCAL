Valence of F-18-FDG-PET in the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. PET enables tomographic imaging and quantification of molecular metabolism with high temporal and spatial resolution. For routine clinical questions in oncology F-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose is the tracer of choice. In malignant lymphoma staging, response control and follow-up studies are valid indications. The initial glucose-uptake and especially the response of metabolism to therapy are in correlation with the outcome of the disease. Complementary to conventional staging PET is able to detect further lymphnode manifestation or extranodal involvement that can result in up-staging. Down-staging is less frequent. In follow-up studies PET is valuable, to assess therapy response, to differentiate viability of lymphoma from fibrous remnants at end of therapy and to detect relapse at an early stadium. In this context it proves to be superior to conventional tomographic imaging. In individual cases relevant therapeutic consequences arise from the metabolic PET-informations. Whether in future PET will be able to partially replace conventional imaging and whether it withstands to cost/effectiveness analysis requires additional prospective studies.
