FDG-PET for preoperative differential diagnosis between benign and malignant soft tissue masses. To evaluate the standardized uptake value (SUV) of [(18)F]2-deoxy-2-fluoro- d-glucose at positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for preoperative differential diagnosis between benign and malignant soft tissue masses.One hundred and fourteen soft tissue masses (80 benign, 34 malignant) were examined by FDG-PET prior to tissue diagnosis. The SUVs were calculated and compared between benign and malignant lesions and among different histologic subgroups which included three or more cases.There was a statistically significant difference in SUV between benign (1.80+/-1.42 [SD]) and malignant (4.20+/-3.16) soft tissue masses in total (P<0.0001). However, a considerable overlap in SUV was observed between many benign and malignant lesions. Liposarcomas (2.16+/-1.72) and synovial sarcomas (1.60+/-0.43) did not show significantly higher SUV than any benign lesions. Metastases (4.23+/-2.35) showed no statistically significant difference in SUV as compared with schwannomas (1.75+/-0.84), desmoids (2.77+/-1.32), sarcoidosis (3.62+/-1.53), or giant cell tumors of tendon sheath (GCT of TS 5.06+/-1.63). Even malignant fibrous histiocytomas (5.37+/-1.40) could not be differentiated from sarcoidosis or GCT of TS, based on the SUV.A large accumulation of FDG can be observed in both benign and malignant histiocytic, fibroblastic, or neurogenic lesions. SUV at conventional FDG-PET is limited to differentiating benign from malignant soft tissue masses, when all kinds of histologic subtypes are included.
