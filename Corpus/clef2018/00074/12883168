A novel magnetic resonance-positive emission image registration based on morphology. Structures were obtained from images with morphological characteristics to register with voxel-based method. We applied simple morphological operations to obtain human brain cortex and chose normalized mutual information as similarity measure for the geometric alignment of PET and MR images. Evaluation used nine patients, and the results showed that sub-voxel accuracy was achieved and the registration process was significantly more rapid. Thus this new automated multi-modality registration method is more robust and has high accuracy.
