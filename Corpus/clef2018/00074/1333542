Effects of sodium bicarbonate on the end-tidal CO2,PaCO2, HCO3-, PH and cerebral blood flow. To estimate the quantitative reactivity of cerebral blood flow (CBF), the effects of sodium bicarbonate on the end-tidal CO2, arterial PaCO2, HCO3-, PH and CBF were examined. The CBF was measured by 133Xe inhalation method with ring type SPECT (HEADTOME). Activation study with sodium bicarbonate administration was performed after 30 minute of resting study, and the reactivity of each parameters was investigated. The arterial HCO3- and PH increased with similar reactivity, but PaCO2, end-tidal CO2 and CBF in the non-injured hemisphere changed with irregular reactivity. The excellent correlation between PaCO2 and end-tidal CO2 was vanished by the administration of sodium bicarbonate. The reactivity of CBF did not correlate with reactivity of PaCO2 and end-tidal CO2, but correlated with arterial HCO3- and PH. Thus the measurement of arterial HCO3- and PH may be indispensable to estimate the CBF reactivity with the administration of sodium bicarbonate.
