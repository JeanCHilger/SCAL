Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with 1-Aminocyclobutane-1-[(11)C]carboxylic Acid (1-[(11)C]-ACBC) for Detecting Recurrent Brain Tumors. This study was done to determine whether 1-[(11)C]ACBC PET has any advantages over 2-[(18)F]FDG PET, CT, or MRI in detecting recurrent brain tumors, and whether quantitative 1-[(11)C]ACBC PET information improves the accuracy of "visual" image interpretation.Twenty patients with recurrent brain tumor underwent dynamic PET. Images were analyzed by visual interpretation in addition, standardized uptake values (SUVs) and Patlak values (k(1)*k(3)/k) were evaluated.1-[(11)C]ACBC identified 19/20 recurrent brain tumors, [18F]FDG 13/19, MRI 13/19, and CT 8/16. Based on SUVs, the average tumor-to-contralateral gray matter ratio of 1-[(11)C]ACBC was 5.0 and 0.5 for 2-[(18)F]FDG. Mean Patlak values of 1-[(11)C]ACBC were 0.044 +/- 0.047 for high and 0.034 +/- 0.026 for low grade tumors. However, visual interpretation was effective without quantitative PET data.1-[(11)C]ACBC, accurately detects recurrent tumors for selecting biopsy sites and treatment planning.
