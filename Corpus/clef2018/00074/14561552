Deformable biomechanical models: application to 4D cardiac image analysis. This article describes a methodology for creating a generic volumetric biomechanical model from different image modalities and segmenting time series of medical images using this model. The construction of such a generic model consists of three stages: geometric meshing, non-rigid deformation of the mesh in images of various modalities, and image-to-mesh information mapping through rasterization. The non-rigid deformation stage, which relies on a combination of global and local deformations, can then be used to segment time series of images, e.g. cine MRI or gated SPECT cardiac images. We believe that this type of deformable biomechanical model can play an important role in the extraction of useful quantitative local parameters of cardiac function. The biomechanical model of the heart will be coupled with an electrical model of another collaborative project in order to simulate and analyze a larger class of pathologies.
