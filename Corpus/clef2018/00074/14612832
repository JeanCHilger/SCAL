The usefulness of single photon emission computerized tomography with pinhole collimator (P-SPECT) in preoperative localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. In this study the usefulness of parathyroid scintigraphy was evaluated in a group of patients affected by secondary hyperparathyroidism, combining the conventional double-tracer subtraction planar scintigraphy with pinhole-SPECT (P-SPECT) acquisition and comparing the scintigraphic data with those obtained by ultrasonography.Twenty-four patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism were enrolled, 19 with chronic renal failure on haemodialysis and 5 with renal transplant. All patients underwent parathyroidectomy because of their unresponsiveness to medical therapy and/or severe osteodystrophy. Histology ascertained a single adenoma each in 3 patients and 61 hyperplastic glands in the remaining 21 cases. Before surgery, all patients were submitted to high resolution ultrasonography and afterwards to double-tracer subtraction planar parathyroid scintigraphy ((99m)Tc-pertechnetate/(99m)Tc-tetrofosmin) followed by neck P-SPECT acquisition.P-SPECT was true positive in all 24 patients, while both planar and ultrasonography were false negative in one case. Globally, P-SPECT identified 60/64 hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands, planar 47/64 and ultrasonography 45/64. P-SPECT sensitivity (93.7%) was significantly higher than both planar (73.4% p<0.001) and ultrasonography (70.3%The data of the present study seem to indicate that P-SPECT is a reliable diagnostic method in preoperative localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. This procedure identified a significantly higher number of hyperplastic glands than both double-tracer subtraction planar parathyroid scintigraphy and ultrasonography in our cases, thus proving a more useful guide for the surgeon. Given its low false negative rate, a wider use of P-SPECT is suggested in the preoperative management of patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism undergoing either a first operation of parathyroidectomy or a second operation for recurrence.
