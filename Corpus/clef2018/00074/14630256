FDG-PET scanning after radiation can predict tumor regrowth three months later. Positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is well known for providing excellent clinical information regarding malignant tumors. We investigated whether dual-time FDG-PET performed immediately post radiation could predict early regrowth of malignant tumors.Twenty patients with malignant tumors were included in this study. All patients received radiation, and each underwent FDG-PET before the initiation of therapy and within 10 days of completing their course of irradiation. PET images after irradiation were obtained at 60 min and 180 min post FDG injection. For 26 lesions in 20 patients, standardized uptake value (SUV) before and after treatment was calculated and then correlated with postradiation tumor response and outcome at 3 months status post irradiation.Retention index [RI = (SUV on delayed image - SUV on early image)/SUV on early image] after irradiation showed a significant difference between patients with residual tumor and those without residual tumor at 3 months status post irradiation (p < 0.0025). All 9 lesions in 6 patients with residual tumors showed more than 0.1 of RI, whereas none of the lesions with less than 0.1 of RI revealed residual tumors.Dual-time FDG-PET imaging just after irradiation is potentially useful for predicting early regrowth of malignant tumors.
