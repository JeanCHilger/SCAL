Feasibility of continuous venous infusion of SonoVue for qualitative assessment of reversible coronary perfusion defects in stress myocardial contrast echocardiography. To study the feasibility of continuous intravenous SonoVue contrast echocardiography for qualitative assessment of reversible myocardial perfusion in dipyridamole stress tests.Eleven patients (10 male and 1 female, mean age 66 years) with a history of chest pain and a clinical indication for stress sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) underwent concurrent SonoVue 99mTc myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE).Of the total 176 segments obtained, 53 (30%) were regarded as indeterminate, 39 (22%) as discordant, and 84 (48%) as concordant between MCE and SPECT imaging. Two patients had abnormal SPECT results. The overall feasibility and specificity of MCE were 70 and 74%, respectively. The concordant (p = 0.59) and discordant (p = 0.55) segments were comparable with either MCE technique. However, continuous low-mechanical-index imaging produced fewer indeterminate segments (17 segments, 32%) than intermittent harmonic B-mode imaging (36 segments, 68%) (p = 0.04). Significantly more indeterminate segments were found in the left anterior descending artery territory. However, the overall concordance was similar (p = 0.5) in all three coronary artery territories. The concordance and discordance rates at different left ventricular levels (i.e., basal, mid, and apical) were similar (p = 0.50 and 0.08, respectively).Continuous-infusion SonoVue contrast echocardiography is feasible, with high specificity, for detecting myocardial perfusion defects as assessed by dipyridamole SPECT.
