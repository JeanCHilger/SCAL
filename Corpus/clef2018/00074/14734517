Randomized, controlled dose-ranging study of the selective adenosine A2A receptor agonist binodenoson for pharmacological stress as an adjunct to myocardial perfusion imaging. Dipyridamole and adenosine cause frequent side effects as a result of nonspecific adenosine receptor stimulation. Selective agonism of the adenosine A2A receptor should result in a similar degree of coronary vasodilation (and thus similar perfusion images) with fewer side effects.In a multicenter, randomized, single-blind, 2-arm crossover trial, 240 patients underwent 2 single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging studies in random order, first after pharmacological stress with adenosine and a second study with the selective adenosine A2A receptor agonist binodenoson, using 1 of 4 dosing regimens. Safety, tolerability, and SPECT image concordance between the 2 agents were examined. Exact categorical agreement in the extent and severity of reversible perfusion defects ranged from 79% to 87%, with kappa values from 0.69 to 0.85, indicating very good to excellent agreement between binodenoson and adenosine. The risk of any safety event/side effect was significantly lower with any dose of binodenoson than with adenosine (P< or =0.01) because of a dose-related reduction in subjective side effects, as objective events were infrequent. There was a reduction in the severity of chest pain, dyspnea, and flushing in all binodenoson doses compared with adenosine (P<0.01), and the magnitude of severity reduction was dose-related.The selective adenosine A2A receptor agonist binodenoson results in an extent and severity of reversible perfusion defects on SPECT imaging similar to nonselective adenosine receptor stimulation, accompanied by a dose-related reduction in the incidence and severity of side effects.
