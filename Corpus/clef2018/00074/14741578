Rapid and reproducible radiosynthesis of [18F] FHBG. 9-(4-[18F] Fluoro-3-hydroxymethylbutyl) guanine ([18F] FHBG), an imaging agent for gene therapy using PET, was prepared in a one-pot, two-step synthesis. Microwave (MW) mediated nucleophilic fluorination of N2, monomethoxytrityl-9-[4-(tosyl)-3-monomethoxytrityl-methylbutyl] guanine using no-carrier-added [18F] fluoride, followed by deprotection with hydrochloric acid and HPLC purification, gave [18F] FHBG. The radiochemical yield (decay corrected) was 12+/-5% (n = 35), the synthesis time was 55-60 min, and the radiochemical purity was >99%. The compound was used for lung imaging and was injected into Sprague-Dawley rats previously infected with the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) reporter gene. MicroPET imaging showed accumulation confined to the lungs.
