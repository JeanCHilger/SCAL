Comparison of gated PET with MRI for evaluation of left ventricular function in patients with coronary artery disease. The aim of this study was to compare left ventricular (LV) volumes and regional wall motion determined by PET with those determined by the reference technique, cardiovascular MRI.LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), LV end-systolic volume (LVESV), and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured and regional wall motion was scored in 38 patients with chronic coronary artery disease by both gated (18)F-FDG PET and MRI. A 9-segment model was used for PET and MRI to assess regional wall motion.Good correlations were observed between MRI and gated PET for all parameters (r values ranging from 0.91 to 0.96). With PET, there was a significant but small underestimation of LVEDV and LVEF. Mean +/- SD LVEDV, LVESV, and LVEF for MRI were 131 +/- 57 mL, 91 +/- 12 mL, and 33% +/- 12%, respectively, and those for gated PET were 117 +/- 56 mL, 85 +/- 51 mL, and 30% +/- 11%, respectively. For regional wall motion, an agreement of 85% was found, with a kappa-statistic of 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.89 SE, 0.049).LV volumes, LVEF, and regional wall motion can be assessed with gated (18)F-FDG PET and correlate well with these parameters assessed by MRI.
