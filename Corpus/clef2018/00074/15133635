FDG-PET for axillary lymph node staging in primary breast cancer. Management of the axilla in patients with operable breast cancer is still one of the most controversial areas in clinical oncology. The best procedure to examine the lymph nodes is still standard axillary lymph node dissection nevertheless, the morbidity associated with this procedure is well known. Based on these considerations, it is important for progress in the treatment of operable breast cancer that strategies are found that permit a less invasive method of axillary sampling which does not impair the patient's quality of life. The technique of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has recently been proposed for this purpose, with very important results. SLN has now become routine practice in the surgical management of breast cancer, and in many institutions patients with a negative SLN biopsy are spared axillary dissection, while those with a positive SLN biopsy are submitted to axillary node dissection. The good accuracy of SLN biopsy represents a significant advance in the management of primary breast cancer
