Learning and memorization impairment in childhood chronic fatigue syndrome manifesting as school phobia in Japan. For the last 15 years, we have tried to understand the pathophysiology of childhood chronic fatigue syndrome (CCFS) in Japan. In this condition, two major symptoms are important: easy fatigability and disturbed learning and memorization. In CCFS patients we clinically evaluated autonomic nervous system function, circadian rhythm of hormonal secretion (melatonin, cortisol and 3-endorphin), core body temperature, and sleep-wake pattern. Most patients showed autonomic nervous system dysfunction and circadian rhythm disturbances, similar to those observed in jet lag. Radiological imaging studies (SPECT, Xe-CT, and MRS) revealed decreased blood flow in the frontal and thalamic areas, and accumulation of choline in the frontal lobe. We analyzed the relationship between the laboratory data and clinical symptoms in CCFS.
