Reproducibility of dopamine transporter density measured with 123I-FPCIT SPECT in normal control and Parkinson's disease patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of 123I-FPCIT SPECT by using whole striatal region of interest (ROI) and subdivided ROI in normal controls (NC) and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.Ten NC and 6 PD received a SPECT scan for 6 hours postinjection of FPCIT. The distribution volume ratio (R(V)) and specific-nonspecific tissue activity ratio (RT) were measured as an outcome measure. The test/retest reproducibility of R(V) and R(T) was evaluated by calculating the test/retest difference, variability, and reliability.There were no significant test/retest differences for any regions in either the NC or PD. The test/retest variability/reliability of Rv was 5.53+/-4.12%/0.89 in NC, 4.50+/-5.31%/0.99 in PD with whole striatal ROI, 4.29+/-0.78%/ 0.94+/-0.03 in NC, and 6.87+/-1.23 %/0.98+/-0.01 in PD with subdivided ROI. The test/retest variability/reliability of RT was 11.1+/-10.4%/0.59 in NC, 7.84+/-8.94%/0.95 in PD with whole striatal ROI, 11.9+/-1.22%/0.65+/-0.06 in NC, and 12.2+/-4.00%/0.95+/-0.03 in PD with subdivided ROI.R(V) is highly reproducible and reliable compared with RT in both NC and PD as an outcome measure.
