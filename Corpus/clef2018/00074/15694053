Simultaneous evaluation of the myocardial perfusion and contraction for cardiac scintigraphy synchronized to the electrocardiogram for the differential diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy and the ischemic ventricular damage. We evaluated the precision of the perfusion and ventricular function through cardiac scintigraphy 99mTc-MIBI SPECT synchronized to the electrocardiogram to differentiate the ventricular damage of ischemic origin from the dilated cardiomyopathy.Thirty patients with myocardial damage with ejection fraction =30% were included. We analyzed the prognostic value of clinical, angiographic, and 99mTc-MIBI SPECT variables.We studied 30 patients with myocardial damage, 26 men (86.7%) and 4 women (13.3%), with an average age of 45.7 +/- 9.3 years. The diagnosis established by cardiac catheterization was dilated cardiomyopathy in 17 patients (56.6%) and 13 with ischemic cardiomyopathy (43.4%). The study by cardiac scintigraphy 99mTc-MIBI SPECT synchronized to the electrocardiogram established the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy in 18 patients, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 92%. The predictive positive value was 100% and the predictive negative value 94.4%.Cardiac scintigraphy 99mTc-MIBI SPECT synchronized to the electrocardiogram differs in the etiology of the myocardial damage produced by dilated cardiomyopathy from that of ischemic origin in a noninvasive way and with high sensitivity and specificity.
