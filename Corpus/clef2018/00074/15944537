Myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging in patients with myocardial bridging. Although myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging is widely used to assess myocardial ischemia in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, only a few patients with myocardial bridging have been evaluated with nuclear techniques. Furthermore, it has been suggested that dipyridamole stress images might underestimate perfusion defects compared with exercise stress images. This study was done to determine the concordance of exercise stress SPECT images with that obtained by dipyridamole stress SPECT images as a means of detecting ischemia in patients with myocardial bridging.Sixteen consecutive patients with angina and normal arteries but myocardial bridging of the left anterior descending artery underwent rest-exercise stress SPECT imaging. Within 2 weeks after angiograms were obtained, only dipyridamole stress images were repeated. The mean angiographic systolic occlusion within the myocardial bridges was 73% +/- 10%. Overall, the prevalence of an abnormal scan was no different in patients who underwent exercise stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) as compared with patients who underwent dipyridamole stress MPI (14/16 [88%] vs 13/16 [81%], respectively P = .953). Exercise stress MPI showed a higher stress score than dipyridamole stress MPI, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (7.5 +/- 3.3 vs 6 +/- 2.7, P = .147). The strength of agreement among exercise stress MPI and dipyridamole stress MPI studies was good (kappa = 0.765Cardiac SPECT studies can be used effectively for assessing ischemia in patients with angina and myocardial bridging. The evaluation of myocardial perfusion with dipyridamole stress SPECT imaging showed a good agreement with exercise stress SPECT imaging for the detection of ischemia in this group of patients.
