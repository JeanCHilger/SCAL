Preoperative staging of esophageal carcinoma with multidetector CT and virtual endoscopy. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), including virtual endoscopy (VE) for detection, precise localization, preoperative evaluation and staging of esophageal cancer (EC) by comparison with surgical and histopathological findings.Between September 2003 and April 2005, 44 patients with histologically proven EC underwent MDCT and VE. Among 44 patients, the findings were confirmed in 24 at surgery. The accuracy of three-dimensional MDCT for detection, localization, and staging of EC was determined, and compared with surgical finding and histopathology.The overall accuracy of three-dimensional multidetector row CT for detection of EC was 100% (24/24). MDCT staging was correct in 20 patients (83.3%). The T parameter was correctly assessed in 22 (91.7%) cases (understaged in 1 and overstaged in 1). The N parameter was correctly evaluated in 20 (83.4%) patients (understaged in 2 and overstaged in 2). The overall accuracy of VE for the morphologic classification of EC was 81.5%.Three-dimensional MDCT, along with VE is a promising method for preoperative evaluation and staging of EC. Although accuracy in N staging remains low in comparison to PET, it provides a larger amount of diagnostic and staging information.
