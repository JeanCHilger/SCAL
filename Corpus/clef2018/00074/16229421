An efficient reconstruction method for nonuniform attenuation compensation in nonparallel beam geometries based on Novikov's explicit inversion formula. This paper investigates an accurate reconstruction method to invert the attenuated Radon transform in nonparallel beam (NPB) geometries. The reconstruction method contains three major steps: 1) performing one-dimensional phase-shift rebinning 2) implementing nonuniform Hilbert transform
