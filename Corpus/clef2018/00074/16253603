Effect of dynamic left ventricular dyssynchrony on dynamic mitral regurgitation in patients with heart failure due to coronary artery disease. In patients with heart failure, exercise-induced increases in mitral regurgitation (MR), which convey a poor prognosis, are related to the dynamic distortion of mitral valve geometry. It was hypothesized that dynamic MR may also be related to intermittent changes in left ventricular synchronicity during exercise.
