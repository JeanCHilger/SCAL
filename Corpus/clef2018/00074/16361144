The radiology of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) comprise a group of smooth muscle mesenchymal alimentary tract tumours of variable malignancy. Recently, the pathophysiology and radiology of these tumours has generated enormous interest following the discovery of a specific, highly effective, chemotherapeutic agent in the form of ST-571 (Imatinib Glivec, Novartis, Frimley UK). At the time of this review, 106 patients with malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumours seen at the Royal Marsden Hospital have been entered into trials examining the efficacy of varying doses of Imatinib. Burkill et al., also from the Royal Marsden Hospital, have previously reported the distribution, imaging features and pattern of metastatic spread of these tumours (Burkill GJ, Badran M, Al-Muderis O et al.
