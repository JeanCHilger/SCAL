Polymer film based sensor networks for non-invasive medical monitoring. An instrumentation system based upon laminate polymer film composition with embedded ultra-flat imaging sensors has been designed for application to both external and internal monitoring during medical procedures or post-operative care. This technology is based upon a common architecture employing PET (polyethelene terephthalate) film substrates laminated with conductive printed circuit logic and the inclusion of discrete ultra-flat imaging sensors which are based upon the principle of compound eye vision. The system enables the construction of variable-size, variable-geometry sheets that can be applied physically to different locations including objects in an environment that requires frequent monitoring.
