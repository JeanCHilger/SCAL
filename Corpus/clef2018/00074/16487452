Binding kinetics of 123I[ADAM] in healthy controls: a selective SERT radioligand. [123I]ADAM (2-((2-((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl)thio)-5-iodophenylamine) is a promising radioligand for in-vivo quantification of serotonin transporters (SERT) using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in man. We performed tracer kinetic analysis in various brain regions to determine the optimum equilibrium time for SERT quantification with [123I]ADAM and SPECT. Radiosyntheses of [123I]ADAM were performed at MAP Medical Technologies Oy, Tikkakoski, Finland. Thirty healthy male volunteers (21-41 yr) received between 104 and 163 MBq [123I]ADAM intravenously as a bolus. Consecutively, multiple SPECT scans were performed between 14 and 420 min post-injection (p.i.) using a Siemens Multispect 3 camera. Reconstruction was performed applying filtered back projection with a Butterworth filter (cut-off 0.7, order 7) in 128x128 matrices. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn manually on the individual T1-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI) comprising midbrain/hypothalamus for specific binding to SERT, and the cerebellum as reference region. After re-orientation to the MRI, the ROI template was applied to SPECT studies. We generated time-activity curves for the ROI and calculated the ratio countstarget/countscerebellum minus 1 (=V3'') as a measure for specific SERT binding. Counts were corrected for applied activity, acquisition time and body-weight. Peak uptakes were observed between 14 and 50 min after bolus injection. Counts per voxel were highest in the midbrain/hypothalamus, 798 (max. 872, min. 728), whereas 462 counts per voxel (max. 599, min. 412) were measured in the cerebellum at a mean time of 31 min p.i. Stable values for V3'' reached 205-320 min p.i. Mean peak V3'' value was 1.43 (95% CI 171-230) for the midbrain/hypothalamus at 205 min p.i. [123I]ADAM is a useful ligand for in-vivo quantification of human SERT by means of SPECT, with a comparatively better signal-to-noise ratio compared to beta-CIT. Our data suggest that the acquisition time for the SPECT scan is optimally, under pseudo-equilibrium conditions, between 205-320 min post-bolus injection of the tracer.
