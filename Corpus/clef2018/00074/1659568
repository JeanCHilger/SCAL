Comparison of procedures for assessing adequacy of dog foods. Dog foods with similar claims for nutritional adequacy were tested by chemical analysis and the American Association of Feed Control Officials' growth trial. All foods tested were similar chemically, however, dogs given one regionally marketed food had lower growth rate and food efficiency as well as suboptimal PCV and hemoglobin values during the growth trial. Pups fed this diet also had clinical signs typical of zinc and copper deficiencies. We concluded that American Association of Feed Control Officials' approved feeding tests provide valid assessment of pet food quality, and procedures involving only chemical analysis or calculated values may not.
