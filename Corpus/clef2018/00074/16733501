Development of an automatic analytical tool for quantitative cerebral blood flow measurement using 99mTc-ECD, and verification of clinical examples. The following process conventionally has been followed to develop quantitative images of cerebral blood flow: (1) mean cerebral blood flow (mCBF) is calculated by the Patlak plot method (2) a SPECT slice that includes the basal ganglia is selected
