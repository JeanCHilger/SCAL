Screening for bone metastases: whole-body MRI using a 32-channel system versus dual-modality PET-CT. The diagnostic accuracy of screening for bone metastases was evaluated using whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) compared with combined fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) (FDG-PET-CT). In a prospective, blinded study, 30 consecutive patients (18 female, 12 male 24-76 years) with different oncological diseases and suspected skeletal metastases underwent FDG-PET-CT as well as WB-MRI with the use of parallel imaging (PAT). With a 32-channel scanner, coronal imaging of the entire body and sagittal imaging of the complete spine was performed using T1-weighted and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences in combination. PET-CT was conducted using a low-dose CT for attenuation correction, a PET-emission scan and diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT scan covering the thorax, abdomen and pelvis. Two radiologists read the MRI scans, another radiologist in combination with a nuclear medicine physician read the PET-CT scans, each in consensus. The standard of reference was constituted by radiological follow-up within at least 6 months. In 28 patients, 102 malignant and 25 benign bone lesions were detected and confirmed. WB-MRI showed a sensitivity of 94% (96/102), PET-CT exams achieved 78% (79/102
