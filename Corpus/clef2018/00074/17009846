Radiolabeled multimeric cyclic RGD peptides as integrin alphavbeta3 targeted radiotracers for tumor imaging. Integrin alphavbeta3 plays a significant role in tumor angiogenesis and is a receptor for the extracellular matrix proteins with the exposed arginine-glycine-aspartic (RGD) tripeptide sequence. These include vitronectin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, lamin, collagen, Von Willibrand's factor, osteoponin, and adenovirus particles. Integrin alphavbeta3 is expressed at low levels on epithelial cells and mature endothelial cells, but it is overexpressed on the activated endothelial cells of tumor neovasculature and some tumor cells. The highly restricted expression of integrin alphavbeta3 during tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis presents an interesting molecular target for both early detection and treatment of rapidly growing solid tumors. In the past decade, many radiolabeled linear and cyclic RGD peptide antagonists have been evaluated as the integrin alphavbeta3 targeted radiotracers. Significant progress has been made on their use for imaging tumors of different origin by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) in several tumor-bearing animal models. [18F]Galacto-RGD is under clinical investigation as the first integrin alphavbeta3 targeted radiotracer for noninvasive visualization of the activated integrin alphavbeta3 in cancer patients. This review will focus on the radiolabeled multimeric cyclic RGD peptides (dimers and tetramers) useful as radiotracers to image the tumor integrin alphavbeta3 expression by SPECT and PET, and some fundamental aspects for the development of integrin alphavbeta3 targeted radiotracers. These include the choice of radionuclide and bifunctional chelators, selection of targeting biomolecules, and factors influencing the integrin alphavbeta3 binding affinity and tumor uptake, as well as different approaches for modification of radiotracer pharmacokinetics.
