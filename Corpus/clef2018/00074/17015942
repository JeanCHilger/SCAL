In vivo evaluation of radioiodinated 1-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl)-piperazine derivatives as new ligands for sigma receptor imaging using single photon emission computed tomography. New series of radioiodinated analogues of 1-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-4-[3-(2-iodophenyl)propyl]piperazine (o-BON) and 1-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-4-[3-(3-iodophenyl)propyl]piperazine (m-BON) were evaluated as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) radiopharmaceuticals for mapping sigma receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral organs. In vivo biodistribution studies of [125I] o- and m-BON in mice demonstrated high initial uptakes and prolonged retention in the brain. In contrast to high brain uptake and retention, the blood accumulations were low, resulting in good brain-blood ratios (7.9-9.2). In the other tissues, high uptake of [125I] o- and m-BON were observed in the liver, kidney, heart, lung, and pancreas. Moreover, selective interactions of [125I] o- and m-BON with sigma receptors were confirmed by pretreatment experiments with various sigma and other receptor ligands. Haloperidol posttreatment induced decreases in the accumulation of [125I] o- and m-BON. These data suggest that [125I] o- and m-BON binding to sigma receptors is reversible and competitive. Furthermore, ex vivo autoradiograms of [125I] o- and m-BON in rats showed high uptake in the parietal cortex, vestibular nucleus, and pons nucleus and moderate uptake in the thalamus, inferior colliculus, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and temporal cortex. These ex vivo autoradiograms were comparable with the histochemical distribution of sigma receptors. Furthermore, the uptake of [125I] o- and m-BON reflected quantitative amounts of sigma receptor in the brain. These results demonstrated that radiolabeled o- and m-BON have good characteristics for mapping sigma receptors in the CNS and the peripheral organs with SPECT.
