Age-related structural and functional changes in the breast: multimodality correlation with digital mammography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. Preliminary results generated from digital mammography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography demonstrate concordant findings of decreasing glandular tissue and decreasing metabolic activity with increasing age. These results are presented in the context of a detailed literature review summarizing age-related changes in the breast, both from the histologic/physiologic and the imaging perspectives. We also discuss potential applications of this approach and emphasize the importance of new advanced imaging technologies to offer high levels of quantitative precision for tissue characterization for research and clinical purposes.
