Assessment of age-related changes in abdominal organ structure and function with computed tomography and positron emission tomography. With the size of the aged population in the United States expected to grow considerably during the next several decades, the number of imaging studies performed on such aged individuals will similarly increase. Thus, it is important to understand normal age-related changes in the structural and functional imaging appearance of the abdominal organs. We therefore present preliminary data and a review of the literature relevant to structural and functional changes in the abdominal organs of children and older adults. In a retrospective study of both adult and pediatric populations, we used computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and PET/CT imaging to investigate age-associated changes in size, attenuation, and metabolic function of the abdominal organs. Organs of interest include the liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, adrenal glands, stomach, small bowel, colon, and rectum. Although volumes of adult liver, spleen, pancreas, and kidneys do not change significantly with age, adult left and right adrenal gland volumes do significantly increase with age (r = 0.2823, P = 0.0334, and r = 0.3676, P = 0.0049, respectively). Also, the attenuation of adult liver (r = -0.2122, P = 0.0412), spleen (r = -0.4508, P < 0.0001), pancreas (r = -0.5124, P = 0.0007), and left and right adrenal gland (r = -0.5835, P < 0.0001 and r = -0.6135, P < 0.0001, respectively) decrease significantly with increasing age. Every organ studied in the pediatric population demonstrates a positive association between organ volume and age. Significant age-related changes in organ function are noted in the adult liver and small bowel, with the liver demonstrating a positive association between metabolic activity and age (r = 0.4434, P = 0.0029) and the small bowel showing an inverse association between mean small bowel standardize uptake value and age (r = -0.2435, P = 0.0174). Also, the maximum overall small bowel and colon metabolic activity in children increases with age (r = 0.6478, P = 0.0008). None of the other organs studied (ie, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, stomach, colon, rectum) demonstrate significant changes in metabolism with advancing age. The metabolic volumetric product (calculated as the product of organ volume and mean organ SUV) of the liver and spleen does not change significantly with age. In conclusion, various abdominal organs demonstrate differential changes in volume, attenuation, and/or metabolism with increasing age in pediatric and adult populations.
