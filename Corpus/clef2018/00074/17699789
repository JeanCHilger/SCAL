Use of a peptide derived from foot-and-mouth disease virus for the noninvasive imaging of human cancer: generation and evaluation of 4-[18F]fluorobenzoyl A20FMDV2 for in vivo imaging of integrin alphavbeta6 expression with positron emission tomography. Expression of the epithelial-specific integrin alphavbeta6 is low or undetectable in most adult tissues but may be increased during wound healing and inflammation and is up-regulated dramatically by many different carcinomas, making alphavbeta6 a promising target for the in vivo detection of cancer using noninvasive imaging. In addition, alphavbeta6 is recognized as promoting invasion and correlates with aggressive behavior of human cancers and thus agents that recognize alphavbeta6 specifically in vivo will be an essential tool for the future management of alphavbeta6-positive cancers. Recently, we identified the peptide NAVPNLRGDLQVLAQKVART (A20FMDV2), derived from foot-and-mouth disease virus, as a potent inhibitor of alphavbeta6. Using flow cytometry and ELISA, we show that this peptide is highly selective, inhibiting alphavbeta6-ligand binding with a IC50 of 3 nmol/L, an activity 1,000-fold more selective for alphavbeta6 than for other RGD-directed integrins (alphavbeta3, alphavbeta5, and alpha5beta1). A20FMDV2 was radiolabeled on solid-phase using 4-[18F]fluorobenzoic acid, injected into mice bearing both alphavbeta6-negative and alphavbeta6-positive (DX3puro/DX3purobeta6 cell lines) xenografts and imaged using a small animal positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. Rapid uptake (<30 min) and selective retention (>5 h) of radioactivity in the alphavbeta6-positive versus the alphavbeta6-negative tumor, together with fast renal elimination of nonspecifically bound activity, resulted in specific imaging of the alphavbeta6-positive neoplasm. These data suggest that PET imaging of alphavbeta6-positive tumors is feasible and will provide an important new tool for early detection and improved management of many types of cancers.
