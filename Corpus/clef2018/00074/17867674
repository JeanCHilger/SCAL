Cluster carbonyls of the [Re6(mu3-Se)8]2+ core. The first [Re(6)(mu(3)-Se)(8)](2+) core-containing cluster carbonyls, [Re(6)(mu(3)-Se)(8)(PEt(3))(5)(CO)][SbF(6)](2) and trans-[Re(6)(mu(3)-Se)(8)(PEt(3))4(CO)(2)][SbF(6)](2), were produced by reacting [Re(6)(mu(3)-Se)(8)(PEt(3))(5)I]I and trans-[Re(6)(mu(3)-Se)8(PEt(3))(4)I2], respectively, with AgSbF(6) in CO-saturated dichloromethane solutions. Spectroscopic and crystallographic studies suggest significant cluster-to-CO back-donation in these novel cluster derivatives and interesting electronic structures. Thermal and photolytic studies of the mono-carbonyl complex revealed its interesting and synthetically useful reactivity in producing new cluster derivatives.
