Feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of a gated SPECT early-imaging protocol: a multicenter study of the Myoview Imaging Optimization Group. The aim of this study was to investigate whether early (time 1, or T1) myocardial tetrofosmin imaging is feasible and as accurate in detecting coronary artery disease as is standard delayed (time 2, or T2) imaging.One hundred twenty patients (100 men and 20 women mean age +/- SD, 61 +/- 10 y) with anginal symptoms underwent tetrofosmin gated SPECT. Stress/rest T1 imaging was performed at 15 min and T2 at 45 min after injection. Image quality was visually evaluated using a 4-point scale (from 0 = poor to 3 = optimal). Myocardial perfusion analysis was performed on a 20-segment model using quantitative perfusion SPECT software, and reversible ischemia was scored as a summed difference score (SDS). Coronary angiography was performed within 1 mo on all patients, and stenosis of more than 50% of the diameter was considered significant.Overall, quality was scored as optimal or good for 94% of T1 images and 95% of T2 images (P = not statistically significant). Heart, lung, liver, and subdiaphragmatic counts did not differ for stress and rest T1 and T2 imaging. A good linear relationship was seen between T1 and T2 SDS (r = 0.69 P < 0.0001), and Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between the 2 conditions. In terms of global diagnostic accuracy, areas under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve were comparable between T1 and T2 (0.80 vs. 0.81, P = not statistically significant). Discrepancies between T1 and T2 SDS were observed in 44% of patients (T1 - T2 SDS > 2). Linear regression analysis showed a good correlation between T1 and T2 SDS (r = 0.67T1 imaging is feasible and as accurate as T2 imaging in identifying coronary artery disease. However, in a discrete subset of patients, early acquisition strengthens the clinical message of defect reversibility by permitting earlier, more accurate identification of more severe myocardial ischemia.
