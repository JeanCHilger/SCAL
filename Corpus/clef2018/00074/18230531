Optimization of signal detection in SPECT. Parallel-hole collimators of varying design are discussed, using the display signal-to-noise ratio of R.F. Wagner et al. (Med. Phys., vol.6, p.83-94, 1979) to obtain contrast-detail diagrams and analytical expressions for the signal-to-noise ratio in SPECT (single-photon-emission computed tomography). It is concluded: (1) that the detectability of deeply embedded small objects (more than ~10 cm deep) may be improved only slightly by improvements in the resolution and geometric efficiency of parallel-hole collimators (2) that a long-bore collimator outperforms a low-energy general-purpose collimator for objects smaller than ~2 cm, but only to a minor degree
