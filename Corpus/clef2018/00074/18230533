Resampling estimates of precision in emission tomography. Methods for estimating the regional variance in emission tomography images which arise from the Poisson nature of the raw data are discussed. The methods are based on the bootstrap and jackknife methods of statistical resampling theory. The bootstrap is implemented in time-of-flight PET (positron emission tomography) the same techniques can be applied to non-time-of-flight PET and SPECT (single-photon-emission computed tomography). The estimates are validated by comparing them to those obtained by repetition of emission scans, using data from a time-of-flight positron emission tomograph. Simple expressions for the accuracy of the estimates are given. The present approach is computationally feasible and can be applied to any reconstruction technique as long as the data are acquired in a raw, uncorrected form.
