Technology Insight: advances in molecular imaging and an appraisal of PET/CT scanning. PET/CT imaging has rapidly emerged as an important imaging tool in oncology. The success of PET/CT imaging is based on several features. First, patients benefit from a comprehensive diagnostic anatomical and functional (molecular) whole-body survey in a single session. Second, PET/CT provides more-accurate diagnostic information than PET or CT alone. Third, PET/CT imaging allows radiation oncologists to use the functional information provided by PET scans for radiation treatment planning. In this Review we discuss the technical features of PET/CT, its economic aspects within the health-care system, and its role in diagnosis, staging, restaging and treatment monitoring as well as radiation planning in patients with cancer.
