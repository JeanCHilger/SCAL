Advances in anatomic, functional, and molecular imaging of angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is a fundamental process in various physiologic and pathologic processes. The ability to visualize and quantify angiogenesis will allow early diagnosis and monitoring for clinical determination of angiogenesis states before, during, and after adjuvant antiangiogenic and therapeutic angiogenesis treatments.
