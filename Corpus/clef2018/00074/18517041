123I-MIBG cardiac scintigraphy provides clues to the underlying neurodegenerative disorder in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder. RBD is considered to be a manifestation of an evolving synucleinopathy, such as Parkinson disease (PD), dementia of Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). We tested whether the degree of accumulation of cardiac 123I-MIBG scintigraphy can distinguish the clinical syndromes associated with Lewy body-related disease from the syndrome of PSP (a tauopathy) and MSA.Cross-sectional.University-based sleep disorders laboratory.Subjects comprised 95 patients (31, idiopathic RBD 26, PDTo compare tracer uptake of cardiac 123I-MIBG between idiopathic RBD, PD, MSA, DLB, and PSP and control subjects.Cardiac 123I-MIBG accumulation was evaluated by the heart/mediastinum (H/M) ratio. Mean value of the H/M ratio (early, delayed) was significantly reduced in patients with idiopathic RBD compared to MSA patients, PSP patients, control subjects (P < 0.001 in each group) and PD patients in early images (P < 0.05). There was a correlation between the H/M ratio and disease duration in the idiopathic RBD group. ROC analysis revealed that an H/M cut-off value of 1.9 was useful for differentiating RBD from MSA and PSP as well as distinguishing control subjects from those with RBD in both early and delayed images.Cardiac 123I-MIBG findings are similar among idiopathic RBD and the syndromes of PD and DLB, but differ from those of PSP and MSA.
