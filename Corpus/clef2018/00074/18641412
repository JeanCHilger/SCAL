The placenta in pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Placental examination in pregnancies with complications such as pre-eclampsia/toxaemia of pregnancy (PET) or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) can provide insight into specific diagnoses, recurrence risk and chronicity. Placental findings have clinical significance as they can identify the aetiology of the IUGR (as in inborn errors of metabolism) and predict recurrence (as in maternal floor infarcts). Evaluation of obstetric pathology in such pregnancies should be an integral part of clinical care. This review will highlight the placental findings in IUGR and PET.
