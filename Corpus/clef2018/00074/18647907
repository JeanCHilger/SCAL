The role of imaging in the diagnosis, staging, and management of testicular cancer. The objective of this article is to describe recent developments in imaging patients with testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs).Most patients with testicular GCTs can now be expected to be cured, so the focus on management moves toward identifying patients who need more aggressive treatment and avoiding long-term complications. CT remains central in the selection of a management strategy, although the roles of MRI and PET continue to evolve.
