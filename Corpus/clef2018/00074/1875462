Acetabular roof reconstruction with femoral head bone-graft for severe acetabular deficiency in total hip replacement. From July 1984 to September 1989 at Taichung Veterans General Hospital, 14 patients (15 hips) received femoral head bone-grafting by modified Harris method as a part of their total hip replacement for acetabular bony deficiencies. They were followed up for an average of 31.7 months (range from 7 to 66 months). The clinical results were classified as excellent (58.3%) and good (41.7%) by Harris hip scoring system. All the grafts presented as "solid incorporation" with the pelvic wall and only one of the grafts was assessed to be "definite resorption" (volume reduction greater than 50%) by radiologic study. The "biologic viability" of these grafts were proved to be positive by scintigraphy in three-dimensional technique (SPECT). According to our limited experience and primary follow-up studies, we found that good clinical results depend on ideal positioning of the acetabular component in the true acetabulum and femoral head bone-grafting is an ideal procedure for the reconstruction of severe acetabular dysplasia in total hip arthroplasty.
