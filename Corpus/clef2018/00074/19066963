Biotechnological advances in the diagnosis of little-known parasitoses of pets. Dogs, cats, and horses are popular pets in many countries of the World and they have lived in close proximity with human beings for thousands of years. The effect of pet ownership on human health is well known and there is significant merit in preserving the health and welfare of these animals. Some infections caused by parasitic nematodes and arthropods of dogs, cats, and horses are now spreading in several areas of the world. This is the case of canine spirocercosis, feline aelurostrongylosis, and equine gastro-intestinal and nasal nematode and botfly infections. These diseases affect animal health and welfare and may be life-threatening. In spite these infections causing illnesses of major importance in clinical practice are spreading in new geographical foci, they are little known and underestimated also as an effect of difficulties in traditional diagnostics. Importantly, the limited reliability of conventional methodologies has also limited our knowledge of epidemiology, ecology, and biology of these parasitoses. This article reviews the DNA-based assays that have been recently developed for diagnosing these neglected pet parasitic diseases focusing on the advantages they have over classical techniques. Moreover, the opportunities for further epidemiological, ecological, and biological investigations are discussed.
