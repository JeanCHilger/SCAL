Proliferation markers for the differential diagnosis of tumor and inflammation. FDG, the most common radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging in oncology, is not tumor-specific. Significant tracer accumulation can also occur in viral, bacterial and fungal infections, in other forms of inflammatory tissue and in brown fat. FDG accumulation in inflammatory tissue may cause false positives during cancer screening and false classification as a nonresponder during drug treatment. Yet, discrimination between benign and malignant processes is often possible when the kinetics of FDG uptake is taken into account (e.g., by delayed, dual or dynamic PET imaging). Other PET tracers which are considered as proliferation markers may allow an improved differential diagnosis of tumor and inflammation. These include lipid precursors, amino acids, nucleosides and receptor ligands. Strictly speaking, only labelled nucleosides which are incorporated into DNA (e.g. 2-(11)C-thymidine, (76)Br-bromofluorodeoxyuridine, (11)C-FMAU) are true proliferation markers, but the tissue kinetics of radiopharmaceuticals tracing amino acid transport, membrane metabolism, enzyme activity or receptor expression can be a surrogate marker of cellular proliferation if the activity of such processes is increased in rapidly dividing cells. Well-known imaging targets for oncology are: (i) glucose transport ((18)F-FDG) (ii) choline kinase activity ((11)C-choline)
