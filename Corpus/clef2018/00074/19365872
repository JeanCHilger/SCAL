Enzymatic surface modification and functionalization of PET: a water contact angle, FTIR, and fluorescence spectroscopy study. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes induced by a lypolytic enzyme on the surface properties of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Changes in surface hydrophilicity were monitored by means of water contact angle (WCA) measurements. Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in the Attenuated Total Reflectance mode (ATR) was used to investigate the structural and conformational changes of the ethylene glycol and benzene moieties of PET. Amorphous and crystalline PET membranes were used as substrate. The lipolytic enzyme displayed higher hydrolytic activity towards the amorphous PET substrate, as demonstrated by the decrease of the WCA values. Minor changes were observed on the crystalline PET membrane. The effect of enzyme adhesion was addressed by applying a protease after-treatment which was able to remove the residual enzyme protein adhering to the surface of PET, as demonstrated by the behavior of WCA values. Significant spectral changes were observed by FTIR-ATR analysis in the spectral regions characteristic of the crystalline and amorphous PET domains. The intensity of the crystalline marker bands increased while that of the amorphous ones decreased. Accordingly, the crystallinity indexes calculated as band intensity ratios (1,341/1,410 cm(-1) and 1,120/1,100 cm(-1)) increased. Finally, the free carboxyl groups formed at the surface of PET by enzyme hydrolysis were esterified with a fluorescent alkyl bromide, 2-(bromomethyl)naphthalene (BrNP). WCA measurements confirmed that the reaction proceeded effectively. The fluorescence results indicate that the enzymatically treated PET films are more reactive towards BrNP. FTIR analysis showed that the surface of BrNP-modified PET acquired a more crystalline character.
