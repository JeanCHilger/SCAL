The present status of MR cardiac diagnosis. The spectrum of diagnostic procedures in cardiology has been decisively extended by magnetic resonance (and also by ultrafast computed tomography) because of its superior visualization of morphological (myocardium, pericardium) and functional (LVMM/EDV) parameters. The continuous development of faster echo sequences makes it possible to perform heart studies over a shorter time and to reduce the frequency of movement and ECG-induced image artefacts. This means that magnetic resonance studies will be simplified, the image quality will be improved, and therefore the numbers of heart studies can be expected to increase. With respect to the range of diagnostic procedures available, magnetic resonance can be seen between echocardiography and heart catheter studies. Coronary angiography cannot be replaced at this time. The true potential of magnetic resonance (and also of ultrafast computed tomography), however, cannot be exploited without evaluation of the prognostic parameters that determine the form and the optimal timing for a conservative and/or surgical treatment of defined cardiac diseases. Therefore, systematic interdisciplinary studies are necessary.
