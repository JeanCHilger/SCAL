EANM procedure guideline for brain perfusion SPECT using 99mTc-labelled radiopharmaceuticals, version 2. These guidelines summarize the current views of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine Neuroimaging Committee (ENC). The purpose of the guidelines is to assist nuclear medicine practitioners when making recommendations, performing, interpreting, and reporting the results of brain perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies using (99m)Tc-labelled radiopharmaceuticals. The aim is to achieve a high quality standard for brain perfusion SPECT imaging, which will increase the diagnostic impact of this technique in clinical practice. The present document replaces a former version of the guideline published in 2001 which was inspired by the Society of Nuclear Medicine Procedure Guideline for Brain Perfusion SPECT [1], the views of the Society of Nuclear Medicine Brain Imaging Council [2], and the individual experience of experts in European countries. The guidelines are intended to present information specifically adapted to European practice. The information provided should be taken in the context of local conditions and regulations.
