Cerebrocerebellar relationship during behavioral activation: a PET study. The effect of behavioral activation on cerebral and cerebellar glucose metabolism was studied in normal subjects when performing either a verbal memory task or a tactile somatosensory task. Each subject was also studied in a resting state control condition, either 1 h earlier or later than the activation task. Compared to the resting state, both tasks produced asymmetrical metabolic activation, which was opposite in direction within the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. In both tasks, the difference of activation of CMRglc in the right and left hemispheres in the cerebellum was negatively correlated with that in the sensory-motor region. This apparently coupled metabolic activation of one cerebellum and areas within the opposite cerebral hemisphere represents the inverse of the crossed cerebellar diaschisis phenomenon commonly observed when a vascular lesion affects one cerebral hemisphere and hypometabolism occurs in the opposite cerebellum. Because these correlations were selective and concordant with known anatomical connections, and were found in two different tasks, they suggest strong functional connections between these specific brain regions.
