FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography studies of Wilms' tumor. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the utility of FDG PET/CT scanning in patients with Wilms' tumors.A total of 58 scans were performed in 27 patients (14 male, 13 female ages: 1.9-23 years, median: 7 years) with proven Wilms' tumor. Twenty-six patients (56 scans) were studied at the time of suspected relapse, progressive disease, persistent disease, or for monitoring of therapy.In the 27 patients with Wilms' tumor, 34 scans showed areas of abnormal uptake consistent with metabolically active tumors. Of the patients, 8 (24 scans) had pulmonary metastases larger than 10 mm in diameter, 10 (12 scans) had hepatic metastases, 11 (11 scans) had regional nodal involvement, 3 (3 scans) had bone metastases, 1 (1 scan) had chest wall involvement, 2 (2 scans) had pancreatic metastasis, and 5 (5 scans) had abdominal and pelvic soft tissue involvement. Two of eight patients with lung metastases had variable uptakes. Lung lesions 10 mm or smaller were not consistently visualized on PET scans. One patient with a liver metastasis showed no uptake on PET scan after treatment (size decreased from 45 to 15 mm).Most Wilms' tumors concentrate FDG. However, small pulmonary metastases may be better visualized with CT. FDG PET/CT appears useful for defining the extent of involvement and assessing the response to treatment.
