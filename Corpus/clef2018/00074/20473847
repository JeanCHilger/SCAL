Focus on Nutrition: Cats and carbohydrates: implications for health and disease. It has been suggested that high-carbohydrate diets contribute to the development of feline diabetes and obesity. The evidence does not support this. Healthy cats efficiently digest and metabolize properly processed starches and complex carbohydrates. Dietary carbohydrate can efficiently meet cats' cellular requirement for carbohydrate (glucose), sparing protein that would otherwise be needed for gluconeogenesis. Excess calories, regardless of source, contribute to obesity and obesity-related problems, but low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets pose a greater risk for obesity. The increasing prevalence of feline diabetes appears to be due to obesity and aging rather than to dietary carbohydrates. However, once cats become diabetic, consumption of a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet may be beneficial.
