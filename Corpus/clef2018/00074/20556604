Ultrafast assessment of left ventricular dyssynchrony from nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging on a new high-speed gamma camera. To validate the ultrafast assessment of left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony by phase analysis using high-speed nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) on a new gamma camera with cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) solid-state detector technology.In 46 patients rest MPI with 960 MBq (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin was acquired on a dual-head detector SPECT camera (Ventri, GE Healthcare) and an ultrafast CZT camera (Discovery NM 530c, GE Healthcare) with acquisition times of 15 and 5 min, respectively. LV dyssynchrony was assessed using the Emory Cardiac Toolbox with established values for histogram bandwidth (male <62.4° female <49.7°) and standard deviations (male <24.4°In LV dyssynchrony the mean histogram bandwidths with the CZT camera (n = 8) and the Ventri camera (n = 9) were 123.3 ± 50.6° and 130.2 ± 43.2° (p not significant) and 42.4 ± 13.6° vs. 43.2 ± 12.7° (p not significant). Normal bandwidths and SD obtained with the CZT camera (35.9 ± 7.7°, 12.6 ± 3.5°) and the Ventri camera (34.8 ± 6.6°, 11.1 ± 2.1°, both p not significant) excluded dyssynchrony in 38 and 37 patients, respectively. Intraclass correlation and the level of agreement between the CZT camera with a 5-min scan time and the Ventri camera were 0.94 (p < 0.001, SEE 14.4) and 96% for histogram bandwidth and 0.96 (p < 0.001, SEE 3.9) and 98% for SD.This ultrafast CZT camera allows accurate assessment of LV dyssynchrony with a scan time of only 5 min, facilitating repeat measurements which would potentially be helpful for parameter optimization for cardiac resynchronization therapy.
