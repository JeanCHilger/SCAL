Double In Situ Approach for the Preparation of Polymer Nanocomposite with Multi-functionality. A novel one-step synthetic route, the double in situ approach, is used to produce both TiO(2) nanoparticles and polymer (PET), and simultaneously forming a nanocomposite with multi-functionality. The method uses the release of water during esterification to hydrolyze titanium (IV) butoxide (Ti(OBu)(4)) forming nano-TiO(2) in the polymerization vessel. This new approach is of general significance in the preparation of polymer nanocomposites, and will lead to a new route in the synthesis of multi-functional polymer nanocomposites.
