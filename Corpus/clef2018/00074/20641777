 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), also known as vascular permeability factor, is a homodimeric glycoprotein weighing ~45 kDa (1). The VEGF family consists of six groups: VEGF-A, -B, -C, -D, -E, and the placental growth factor (PIGF) (2). Structurally, VEGFs are related to the platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF), and they all contain the characteristic eight-cysteine residues known as the cysteine knot motif (3). Intrachain and interchain disulfide bonds are formed between these cysteine residues in conserved positions (2). VEGFs bind specifically to three cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinases, including fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1) or VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR) or VEGRF-2, and Flt-4 or VEGFR-3. Each VEGFR contains a 750-amino acid-residue extracellular domain that is organized into seven immunoglobulin-like folds. VEGF and VEGFRs have been implicated in angiogenesis in many solid tumors, including breast cancer, colon cancer, hepatoma, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and prostate cancer (3). VEGFR-2 (~220 kDa) is expressed exclusively in endothelial cells in cell differentiation, tumor vascularization, and metastasis. VEGF-A (the original VEGF) binds to the second and third extracellular immunoglobulin G loop of VEGFR-2 with a dissociation constant of ~100 pM (4). Hypoxia appears to be an important stimulus for producing VEGF in malignant and normal endothelial cells (3). Upon binding to its receptor VEGFR-2, VEGF-A elicits a pronounced angiogenic response, so it is considered as a predominant stimulator of angiogenesis. Human VEGF-A has five different isoforms generated by alternative slicing of a single pre-mRNA species, VEGF-A
