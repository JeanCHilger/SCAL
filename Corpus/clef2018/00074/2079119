A review of animal bites in Delaware--1989 to 1990. Rabies, a disease associated with aggression in animals, has been endemic in terrestrial wildlife in New Castle County, Delaware, since November 1987. There have been four documented deaths in humans in Delaware since 1919, although the last case originated in Maryland and was hospitalized in Delaware in 1975. Because of the potential association of pet animals with wild animals and the subsequent contact with humans, emphasis is placed on preventive medicine (vaccinations) and prevention of animal bites. People are bitten more often by dogs than any other domestic animal, causing injury, pain and sometimes death.
