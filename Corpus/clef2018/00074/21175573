Development of radiotracers for oncology--the interface with pharmacology. There is an increasing role for positron emission tomography (PET) in oncology, particularly as a component of early phase clinical trials. As a non-invasive functional imaging modality, PET can be used to assess both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of novel therapeutics by utilizing radiolabelled compounds. These studies can provide crucial information early in the drug development process that may influence the further development of novel therapeutics. PET imaging probes can also be used as early biomarkers of clinical response and to predict clinical outcome prior to the administration of therapeutic agents. We discuss the role of PET imaging particularly as applied to phase 0 studies and discuss the regulations involved in the development and synthesis of novel radioligands. The review also discusses currently available tracers and their role in the assessment of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as applied to oncology.
