The role of insects in mechanical transmission of zoonotic human parasites. Arthropods can be found on human or animals as ecto-parasites as well as endo-parasites. The ecto-parasites or vectors can contaminate stored foods and transmit illness, or introduced diseases in new area. Pet species facilitating infestations, and different risk factors related to infestation were identified. Insect prevention and control is necessary to prevent the transmission of pathogens that could affect animal and human health and the maintenance of good hygiene. We conclude that although biological control looks promising, more research should be done concerning its side effects. Currently, optimal monitoring and prevention seem to offer the best solution.
