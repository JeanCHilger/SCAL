Elevated endocannabinoid plasma levels are associated with coronary circulatory dysfunction in obesity. Aim of this study was to evaluate a possible association between endocannabinoid (EC) plasma levels, such as anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and coronary circulatory function in obesity.Myocardial blood flow (MBF) responses to cold pressor test (CPT) and during pharmacological vasodilation with dipyridamole were measured with (13)N-ammonia PET/CT. Study participants (n = 77) were divided into three groups based on their body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)): control group 20 ≤ BMI <25 (n = 21) overweight group, 25 ≤ BMI <30 (n = 26)Increased EC plasma levels of AEA and 2-AG are associated with coronary circulatory dysfunction in obese individuals. This observation might suggest increases in EC plasma levels as a novel endogenous cardiovascular risk factor in obesity, but needing further investigations.
