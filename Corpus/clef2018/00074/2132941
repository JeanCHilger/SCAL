Dynamic infrared functional mapping of the cerebral cortex. Although many neuroimaging methods (computer tomography, H+ and isotope clearance, [14C]deoxyglucose utilization, potential-sensitive dyes, electroencephalogram and magnetoencephalogram-mapping, nuclear magnetic resonance tomography, single photon emission computer tomography, and positron emission tomography) are now being used to map brain structure and function, there still exists a need for a new approach that is functional, dynamic, remote, and noninvasive, and that also has reasonable sensitivity and spatial and temporal resolution. Such a method is described here. Thermoencephaloscopy (TES), based on thermovision and digital image processing techniques, is a method of neuroimaging consisting of recording through the intact skull the very weak changes in infrared radiation that are connected with brain activity. The parameters of the method are: temperature sensitivity of 0.002 degrees C, instrumental spatial resolution of 70 microns pixel-1, and instrumental temporal resolution of 40 ms (enabling up to twenty-five maps to be produced per second). The distribution over the rat cerebral cortex of local, multiple, and modally and regionally specific thermoresponses to various sensory stimuli, direct cortical stimulation, and associative learning (conditioning), have been studied, as well as the spreading of thermowaves over the brain cortex. The underlying mechanisms which form the basis of the technique of TES, such as joule heating, local changes in brain metabolism and local cerebral blood flow, as well as the formation of thermodipoles, are discussed.
