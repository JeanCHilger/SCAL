Assessment of infarct-related coronary arteries using the bull's eye view method and unfolded surface mapping in thallium-201 myocardial tomography. Infarct-related coronary lesions and collaterals were assessed by the bull's eye view and the unfolded surface map derived from thallium-201 myocardial tomography (Tl-201 SPECT) in 25 patients with anterior myocardial infarction. The patients were categorized in six groups according to their cine-angiographic findings: locations of stenosis (proximal or distal portions of the first diagonal branch or distal site of the first septal branch), and the presence or absence of collaterals. The anterior half of the left ventricle on the bull's eye view map was divided into eight regions from the anterior septum to the lateral wall and from the apex to the cardiac base. Tl-201 SPECT images were expressed as functional maps using maximum-count circumferential profile analysis: an "extent image" showing the extent of perfusion defect, and a "severity image" demonstrating the degree of hypoperfusion. The following results were obtained: 1. Perfusion defect of the "extent image" at the basal portion of the anterior septum reflected poor collaterals, with a sensitivity of 81.3%, a specificity of 77.8%, and a diagnostic accuracy of 80.0%. 2. Coronary stenosis at segment 6 (AHA classification) was differentiated from that at segment 7 by detecting hypoperfusion at the basal septum on the "severity image", with a sensitivity of 71.4%, a specificity of 77.8%, and a diagnostic accuracy of 75.0%. 3. Perfusion defect at the basal section of the proximal portion of the anterior wall on the "extent image" indicated stenosis at the proximal segment 6, with a sensitivity of 57.1% and a specificity of 88.9%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
