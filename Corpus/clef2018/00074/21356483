Image-based biomarkers in clinical practice. The growth of functional and metabolically informative imaging is eclipsing anatomic imaging alone in clinical practice. The recognition that magnetic resonance (MR) and positron emission tomography (PET)-based treatment planning and response assessment are essential components of clinical practice and furthermore offer the potential of quantitative analysis being important. Extracting the greatest benefit from these imaging techniques will require refining the best combinations of multimodality imaging through well-designed clinical trials that use robust image-analysis tools and require substantial computer based infrastructure. Through these changes and enhancements, image-based biomarkers will enhance clinical decision making and accelerate the progress that is made through clinical trial research.
