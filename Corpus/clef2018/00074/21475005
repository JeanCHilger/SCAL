Positron emission tomography/computed tomographic scans compared to computed tomographic scans for detecting colorectal liver metastases: a systematic review. To review diagnostic accuracy of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for colorectal liver metastases.Colorectal liver metastases can be treated with surgical resection however, recurrence is seen in 58% of patients. PET/CT may better detect extra-hepatic disease before surgery to more accurately identify eligible candidates for surgery and, through better selection, improve patient prognosis.We conducted a comprehensive systematic review on adults with colorectal liver metastases who received PET/CT and CT scans to detect metastases. The gold standard to confirm the diagnosis was histology. Study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction were completed independently by 2 investigators. Pooling of results was not feasible because of heterogeneity. A qualitative summary of results is presented.From 1083 citations, we identified 6 studies (440 patients) for the review. For extra-hepatic lesions (3 studies 178 patients), PET/CT was more sensitive than CT, but specificities were similar (PET/CT sensitivity [SN] = 75%-89% and specificity [SP] = 95%-96% vs. CT SN = 58%-64% and SP = 87%-97%). For hepatic lesions (5 studiesBased on this systematic review, we conclude that PET/CT has a higher accuracy for detection of extra-hepatic and hepatic colorectal metastatic disease than CT alone. However, the results are based on a small number of studies and should be interpreted cautiously.
