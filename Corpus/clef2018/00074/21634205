Temporal lobe epilepsy in adults and possibilities of neurosurgical treatment: the role of magnetic resonance. Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common type of focal epilepsy diagnosed in adult patients. According to the location of seizure generation it is classified as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and neocortical lateral lobe epilepsy. Diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy can be proved by the combination of the clinical manifestation of partial complex seizures, scalp-video EEG monitoring, results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and imaging of interictal fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography. Mesial temporal sclerosis is the most common finding on MRI. Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most surgically amenable diagnosis and results of surgery treatments are clearly superior to the prolonged medical therapy surgical treatment of the mesial temporal epilepsy with mesial temporal sclerosis has the best clinical results. Except for standard microsurgical approaches such as anterior temporal resection and selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy, stereotactic thermocoagulation amygdalo-hippocampectomy is provided in our epilepsy centre. This alternative approach has comparable clinical outcome to the standard surgery approaches in 2 years clinical follow-ups. MRI is important not only in diagnostic procedures, but also in neuronavigation of surgery approaches, per operation control of the extent of resections and postoperative follow-ups, especially in failed epilepsy surgery.
