Pelvic/retroperitoneal salvage lymph node dissection for patients treated with radical prostatectomy with biochemical recurrence and nodal recurrence detected by [11C]choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography. The management of patients with clinical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy (RP) remains challenging.To determine whether the removal of positive lymph nodes at [11C]choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan may have an impact on the prognosis of patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) and nodal recurrence after RP.Prospective analysis of 72 patients affected by BCR after RP associated with a nodal pathologic [11C]choline PET/CT scan.Patients underwent salvage lymph node dissection (LND).Biochemical response (BR) to treatment was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <0.2 ng/ml at 40 d after salvage LND. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses addressed time to and predictors of clinical recurrence (CR) after salvage LND, respectively.Overall, 56.9% of patients achieved BR. Mean and median follow-up after LND were 39.4 and 39.8 mo, respectively. The 5-yr BCR-free survival rate was 19%. Preoperative PSA <4 ng/ml (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.12 p = 0.005), time to BCR <24 mo (HR: 7.52Salvage LND is feasible in patients with BCR after RP and nodal pathologic uptake at [11C]choline PET/CT scan. Biochemical response after surgery can be achieved in a consistent proportion of patients. Although most patients invariably progressed to BCR after surgery at longer follow-up, 35% of patients showed the absence of CR at 5 yr.
