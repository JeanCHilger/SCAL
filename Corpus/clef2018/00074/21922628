3D amino-induced electroless plating: a powerful toolset for localized metallization on polymer substrates. The "3D amino-induced electroless plating" (3D-AIEP) process is an easy and cost-effective way to produce metallic patterns onto flexible polymer substrates with a micrometric resolution and based on the direct printing of the mask with a commercial printer. Its effectiveness is based on the covalent grafting onto substrates of a 3D polymer layer which presents the ability to entrap Pd species. Therefore, this activated Pd-loaded and 3D polymer layer acts both as a seed layer for electroless metal growth and as an interdigital layer for enhanced mechanical properties of the metallic patterns. Consequently, flexible and transparent poly(ethylene terephtalate) (PET) sheets were selectively metalized with nickel or copper patterns. The electrical properties of the obtained metallic patterns were also studied.
