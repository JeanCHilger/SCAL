Surgical management of radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: report of 14 cases. Radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis is a rare and serious late complication in irradiated patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Treatment of radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis with surgery has been seldom thoroughly investigated.We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 14 patients with radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis treated with surgical intervention.Radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis presented as obvious cystic formation or as heterogeneous enhanced nodule on MRI. Among 3 patients with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET-CT scan, increased uptake of (18)F-FDG was observed in 2 cases. Four patients were anesthestized nasotracheally and 1 was through tracheostomy during surgery because of other radiation complications, including trismus and skull base osteoradionecrosis. The temporal approach was applied in all cases, with the removal of bone flap in 11 patients. During follow-up, 1 patient died of exhaustion.Surgery benefits selected patients with NPC with radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis. The goals of surgery are to relieve the increased intracranial pressure and to establish the accurate diagnosis.
