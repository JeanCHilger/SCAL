Isolation of a gastroprotective arabinoxylan from sugarcane bagasse. After industrial processing, one-third of sugarcane culms is converted into residual bagasse. The xylan-rich hemicellulose components of the bagasse were extracted with hot aqueous alkali (AX-CRUDE). Approximately 82% of the extracted hemicelluloses was precipitated with ethanol (AX-PET). Both AX-CRUDE and AX-PET contained an arabinoxylan as confirmed by 13C NMR and methylation analysis. Fraction AX-PET was fed to female Wistar rats with ethanol-induced gastric lesions. Oral administrations of 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg reduced the gastric lesion area by over 50%, and replenished ethanol-induced depletion of glutathione. The polysaccharide also increased mucus production by over 70%, indicating its cytoprotective action on experimentally induced gastric ulcers. These findings are significant, since a biologically active compound can be extracted in high yields from an abundant, readily available residue.
