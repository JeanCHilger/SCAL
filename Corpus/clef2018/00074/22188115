Management of children with high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma. Most children and adolescents with newly diagnosed high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) will achieve remission and cure with conventional chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. However, these therapies can lead to long-term side effects. Therapy is titrated on the basis of risk group stratification using clinical prognostic factors and, in most cases, then refined through assessment of interim or end of chemotherapy response, primarily using functional imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. No study has clearly demonstrated the factors that are sufficient in identifying the patients at highest risk for relapse that may benefit from therapy intensification. This review summarizes recent clinical trials in paediatric high-risk HL, along with key findings from studies in adults with high-risk HL that are applicable to the paediatric population. New directions in prognostic classification and targeted therapies are reviewed. Considerations for clinical practice at the current time outside the clinical trial setting are provided.
