Burkitt lymphoma: staging and response evaluation. The refinements in both the staging and response evaluation of children with Burkitt lymphoma (BL) have contributed to the improvements in treatment outcome observed over the past 40Â years. Ziegler and Magrath designed a staging system in the 1970s for children with BL in equatorial Africa. Currently, the most widely used staging system around the world is that described by Murphy in 1980, which was developed for children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of any histology. There are opportunities for refinement in this system, particularly with respect to certain extra-nodal sites, such as skin and bone. The findings obtained at diagnosis with novel technologies (functional imaging [e.g., positron emission tomography [PET]] and minimal residual disease [MRD] technology), which are more sensitive with respect to disease detection than historic modalities, also need to be considered. Technological advances have also had impact on the assessment of response evaluation. Standard x-rays were routinely used in the 1960s nuclear imaging became widely used in the 1970s
