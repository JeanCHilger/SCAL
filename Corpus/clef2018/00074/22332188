Prediction of cognitive decline by positron emission tomography of brain amyloid and tau. To determine whether 2-(1-{6-[(2-fluorine 18-labeled fluoroethyl)methylamino]-2-napthyl}ethylidene) malononitrile ([(18)F]FDDNP) brain regional values in individuals without dementia predict and correlate with future cognitive change.Two-year, longitudinal follow-up study.A university research institute.Volunteer sample of 43 middle-aged and older persons (median age, 64 years), including 21 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 22 with normal aging.Longitudinal [(18)F]FDDNP positron emission tomography (PET) binding values in the medial and lateral temporal, posterior cingulate, parietal, frontal, and global (mean) regions of interest neuropsychological test battery measuring 5 cognitive domains, including memory, language, attention (and information-processing speed), executive functioning, and visuospatial ability.For the entire study group (MCI and normal aging), increases in frontal, posterior cingulate, and global binding at follow-up correlated with progression of memory decline (r = -0.32 to -0.37, P = .03 to .01) after 2 years. Moreover, higher baseline [(18)F]FDDNP binding was associated with future decline in most cognitive domains, including language, attention, executive, and visuospatial abilities (r = -0.31 to -0.56, P = .05 to .002). For the MCI group, frontal and parietal [(18)F]FDDNP binding yielded the greatest diagnostic accuracy in identifying converters to Alzheimer disease vs nonconverters after 2 years, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.72-1.00) compared with 0.68 (95% CI, 0.45-0.91) for medial temporal binding.[(18)F]FDDNP PET regional binding patterns are consistent with known neuropathologic patterns of plaque and tangle brain accumulation, spreading from the medial temporal to other neocortical regions as disease progresses. Because binding patterns predict future cognitive decline and increase over time along with clinical decline, [(18)F]FDDNP PET scanning may have practical utility in identifying people at risk for future cognitive decline and in tracking the effectiveness of novel interventions designed to prevent or delay neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.
