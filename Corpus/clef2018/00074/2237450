An overview of the contribution of regional cerebral blood flow studies in cerebrovascular disease: is there a role for single photon emission computed tomography? Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) findings and their application to cerebrovascular disease are reviewed. Although the coupling of cerebral blood flow and metabolism are best studied with positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography measurements of rCBF can contribute to patient management. Potential indications for the use of rCBF functional brain imaging include differential diagnosis, early prediction of late recovery in the late subacute and chronic phases of stroke (3 months or more postonset), and evaluation of vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.
