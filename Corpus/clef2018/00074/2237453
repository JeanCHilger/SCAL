Brain imaging in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome dementia complex. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are accompanied by many different types of neurological complications. Opportunistic infections and neoplasms, particularly lymphoma, are often an underlying cause for these complications in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Frequently, these can be detected by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, double-dose contrast transmission computed tomography (CT), and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It has become apparent that the HIV itself is responsible for a significant percentage of neurological disease in the HIV-seropositive individual. The onset may be subtle and may occur before the onset of frank immunosuppression. Diagnosis of HIV encephalitis or AIDS dementia complex (ADC) is complicated by the frequent coexistence of opportunistic infections. Structural neuroimaging (CT or MRI) shows atrophy and in some case white matter abnormalities, but imaging-pathological correlation suggests that these modalities are relatively insensitive to the presence of HIV brain infection. Functional neuroimaging, both 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) for evaluation of glucose metabolism and 123I iodoamphetamine or 99mTc-HMPAO single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for evaluation of cerebral perfusion, can demonstrate abnormalities in the subcortical gray matter structures and the cerebral cortex in patients with ADC. These abnormalities may be observed early in the course of ADC even when MRI is negative and the patient is relatively asymptomatic. Also, PET and SPECT may be useful to follow progression of the dementia or response to therapy.
