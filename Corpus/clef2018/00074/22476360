18F]-5-Fluoro-5-deoxyribose, an efficient peptide bioconjugation ligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imagin. [(18)F]-5-Fluoro-5-deoxyribose ([(18)F]-FDR) conjugates much more rapidly than [(18)F]-FDG under mild reaction conditions to peptides and offers new prospects for mild and rapid bioconjugation for fluorine-18 labelling in PET imaging.
