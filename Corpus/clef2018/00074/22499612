PET imaging-based evaluation of hepatobiliary transport in humans with (15R)-11C-TIC-Me. It is well accepted that drug transporters play a pivotal role in hepatobiliary excretion of anionic drugs, in which drug-drug interactions and genetic polymorphisms are known to cause variations. However, PET probes for in vivo functional characterization of these transporters have not been established yet. We used PET to investigate hepatic uptake and subsequent canalicular efflux of (11)C-labeled (15R)-16-m-tolyl-17,18,19,20-tetranorisocarbacyclin methyl ester [(15R)-(11)C-TIC-Me)] in healthy subjects.Serial PET scans of the abdominal region in healthy male subjects were obtained with or without the organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitor rifampicin after intravenous injection of (15R)-(11)C-TIC-Me as a radiotracer. Venous blood samples and PET images were obtained at frequent intervals up to 30 min after administration of the PET tracer. Dynamic imaging data were evaluated by integration plots of data collected for 2-10 min and for 10-30 min after tracer administration for the determination of tissue uptake clearance and biliary efflux clearance, respectively.After rapid hydrolysis in blood, the acid form-(11)C-labeled (15R)-16-m-tolyl-17,18,19,20-tetranorisocarbacyclin [(15R)-(11)C-TIC]-accumulated in the liver (37% of the dose by 17 min), and the radioactivity was then excreted into the bile (6.2% by 30 min). Rifampicin (600 mg by mouth), a potent OATP inhibitor, significantly reduced the radioactivity excreted into the bile (by 44%) by inhibiting both uptake (by 45%) and subsequent canalicular efflux (by 62%). (15R)-(11)C-TIC is an in vitro substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and clinically relevant concentrations of rifampicin inhibited uptake by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These results demonstrated that in humans, (15R)-(11)C-TIC-associated radioactivity is excreted into the bile by organic anion transport systems.We demonstrated that PET image analysis with (15R)-(11)C-TIC-Me is useful for investigating variations in OATP function in the human hepatobiliary transport system.
