Radioembolization as locoregional therapy of hepatic metastases in uveal melanoma patients. To retrospectively evaluate the overall survival, safety, and efficacy of metastatic uveal melanoma patients after radioembolization as salvage therapy.Thirteen patients were treated with radioembolization of branches of the hepatic artery with resin-based yttrium-90 ((90)Y)-labelled microspheres. Twelve patients underwent a single application, and 1 patient underwent 4 interventions. Dosages from 644 to 2,450 MBq (mean activity 1,780) were applied. Treatment response was evaluated by way of liver magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography (CT) as well as whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)/CT with evaluation of percentage changes in SUV(max) before and at 2-3 months after therapy. Kaplan-Meier analysis was calculated to determine overall survival.Partial remission (PR) was observed in 8 (62 %), stable disease (SD) in 2 (15 %), and progressive disease (PD) in 3 (23 %) patients under terms of standard criteria and PR in 3 (23 %), SD in 3 (23 %), and PD in 7 (54 %) patients according to PET criteria. Neither RECIST nor PET criteria showed a significant difference in predicting overall survival (P = 0.12 and 0.11, respectively). Median survival time after radioembolization was 7 months. No acute toxicity with in-hospital morbidity was observed. One patient developed hepatomegaly, and 1 patient developed gastric ulceration. Throughout follow-up, progression of extrahepatic metastases was observed.Radioembolization may be a promising therapy in uveal melanoma patients with predominant hepatic metastases. At first follow-up, we observed PR or SD in 77 % patients under terms of standard criteria with an acceptable toxicity profile.
