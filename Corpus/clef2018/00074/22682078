Prospective efficacy and safety study of neoadjuvant gemcitabine with capecitabine combination chemotherapy for borderline-resectable or unresectable locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. To determine the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant gemcitabine/capecitabine followed by surgery for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (LAPC).Patients with histologically confirmed LAPC were given 3-6 cycles of fixed-dose rate gemcitabine/capecitabine every 3 weeks. At the end of chemotherapy, patients were restaged and underwent surgery if the disease was not classified as unresectable. Our institutional criteria were used to classify respectability, which was recategorized on the basis of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria retroactively. The primary end point was rate of microscopic curative resection.Forty-three eligible patients (18 with borderline resectable disease and 25 with unresectable disease on the basis of NCCN criteria) were enrolled. The radiologic response rate was 18.6%. Grade three or worse adverse events were mainly hand-foot syndrome (11%), and there were no grade four adverse events. Surgery was performed in 17 patients (39.5%) pathologic curative resection (R0) was achieved in 14 patients (32.5%) among total 43 patients, and 82.3% (14/17) among the 17 resected patients. With 43-month follow-up, the median overall was 16.6 months with a median progression-free survival of 10.0 months. Median overall survival was 23.1 months in patients who underwent surgery and 13.2 months in patients who could not complete the surgery (P = .017).A subset of patients with borderline or unresectable pancreatic cancer could be performed curative tumor resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Some patients might be benefit on survival from neoadjuvant chemotherapy after surgical resection.
