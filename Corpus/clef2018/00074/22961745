Angular benzoperylenetetracarboxylic bisimides. Benzoperylene derivatives with two angularly attached dicarboxylic imide rings, which were prepared by the Diels-Alder-reaction, exhibit strong fluorescence and their free peri positions allow either control of the UV/Vis spectra through their substituents or form anchor positions for the attachment of functional units. The angular chromophore 3 may be used both for fluorescent labeling such as for primary amines or enzymes or as building blocks for more complex assemblies where they may act as energy donors for FRET or electron acceptors in PET such as for photovoltaic solar cells.
