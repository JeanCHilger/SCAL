PET studies of parkinsonian patients treated with autologous adrenal implants. Transplantation of autologous adrenal medulla tissue into the striatum has recently been proposed as a treatment for Parkinson's disease. We report the use of positron emission tomography (PET) to evaluate patients who had adrenal implants placed into the right caudate. 6-[18F] fluoro-L-dopa (6-FD) scans were performed to study the integrity and activity of the implant, and the nigrostriatal dopamine system before and six weeks after transplantation surgery. [68Ga] Gallium-ethylenediaminetetraacetate (Ga) scans were also performed to assess the blood brain barrier. The Ga scans performed on two patients showed increased permeability of the blood brain barrier at the surgical site. 6-FD PET scans in five patients did not show a consistent change in striatal uptake following adrenal medullary implantation after six weeks. Further assessment of implant viability with 6-FD PET scans after longer follow up may provide useful information if the blood-brain barrier becomes re-established with the passage of time.
