Primary structure of the bc1 complex of Rhodopseudomonas capsulata. Nucleotide sequence of the pet operon encoding the Rieske cytochrome b, and cytochrome c1 apoproteins. The nucleotide sequence of the pet operon of Rhodopseudomonas capsulata strain SB1003 has been determined. This operon consists of the petA, petB and petC genes, which encode the Rieske Fe-S protein, cytochrome b and cytochrome c1, respectively, all components of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c2 oxidoreductase. The deduced amino acid sequences of the pet genes show homology to the corresponding proteins from other organisms, and particularly high homologies (over 90% for amino acid and nucleotide sequences) to the previously described fbc operon from a strain previously identified as Rhodopseudomonas spheroides GA. The amino acid sequences of the pet proteins are discussed with reference to the structure and function of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c2 oxidoreductase.
