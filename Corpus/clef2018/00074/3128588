Quantitative thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography after oral dipyridamole for assessing the presence, anatomic location and severity of coronary artery disease. The objective of this investigation was to determine whether analysis of thallium-201 images as detected by quantitative single photon emission computed tomography after a single high oral dose of dipyridamole (300 mg) would accurately detect the presence of coronary artery disease and the anatomic location of the individual stenosis. Analyses were performed on 100 patients who concomitantly underwent diagnostic coronary arteriography and myocardial imaging. Tomographic myocardial perfusion defects were quantified using computer-generated polar maps. Eighty-four patients had significant coronary artery disease defined as greater than 50% luminal diameter stenosis. The sensitivity for detecting patients with coronary disease was 92% overall, 89% in patients without previous myocardial infarction and 97% in those with prior infarction. The technique had a sensitivity of 80, 87 and 51% for localizing coronary artery stenosis of the left anterior descending, the right coronary and the left circumflex artery, respectively. The corresponding specificity was 84, 92 and 92%. Furthermore, the presence of severe (greater than or equal to 70%) multivessel disease was identified with a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 87%. In conclusion, quantitative thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography after oral dipyridamole has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing the presence of coronary disease, ascertaining the location of stenosed vessels and identifying the presence of multivessel disease.
