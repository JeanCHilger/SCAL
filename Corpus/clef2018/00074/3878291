Myocardial positron computed tomography with 13N-ammonia at rest and during exercise. To assess the value of myocardial-perfusion positron computed tomography (PCT) for the evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD), 13N-ammonia PCT using a whole-body multislice PCT device was performed at rest and during exercise in 6 normal subjects and 19 patients with angiographically documented CAD. The 13N-ammonia distribution in the myocardium was assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively. At rest and during exercise, the tracer distribution was homogeneous in the 6 normal cases. In the 19 patients with CAD, regional hypoperfusion was observed in 14 cases (74%) at rest and in 18 cases (95%) during exercise. Additional perfusion abnormalities were detecting during exercise in 12 cases. Segmental analysis of the myocardial perfusion identified 30 out of 34 stenosed vessels (88%) during exercise, with only one false-positive finding of diseased vessels (specificity, 98%). For the quantitative analysis of myocardial perfusion by PCT, the percentage of change in the tracer concentration in the same region between the rest and stress images was calculated. The concentration was slightly increased in normal myocardial segments (14.4% +/- 5.8% P less than 0.001), whereas in CAD, it was significantly decreased in segments with stenosed vessels (-18.0% +/- 18.3%
