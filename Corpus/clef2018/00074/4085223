Diagnostic patch test concentration for Kathon CG. Patch test studies, 21-day cumulative irritancy assays and Draize repeat insult patch tests with Kathon CG, were used to ascertain an appropriate diagnostic patch test concentration. A dilution of 100 ppm a.i. (aq. or pet.) appears to have low irritancy potential. Further observations are required to verify if this concentration is high enough to detect most cases of sensitization.
