Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), planar scintigraphy, and transmission computed tomography: a comparison of accuracy in diagnosing focal hepatic disease. A prospective evaluation of conventional planar scintigraphy (PS), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and transmission computed tomography (TCT) was performed in 98 patients with suspected focal hepatic disease (FHD). The three examinations were performed on the same day. TCT had slightly higher sensitivity (91%) and specificity (96%) than either PS or SPECT. The sensitivity and specificity of TCT was also higher than that of the combination of PS and SPECT, which was more accurate than either radionuclide technique alone, with a sensitivity of 85-87% and a specificity of 90%. These differences were not statistically significant. However, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the performance of TCT was significantly better. The ROC curves also showed, without statistical significance, that SPECT appears to have better diagnostic accuracy than PS and that it seems desirable to complement SPECT imaging with PS views, to reduce the number of equivocal results.
