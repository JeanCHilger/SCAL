Coronary thrombolysis with intravenously administered human tissue-type plasminogen activator produced by recombinant DNA technology. Coronary thrombolysis was induced by intravenous infusion of human tissue-type plasminogen activator (recombinant human t-PA or rt-PA) obtained by expression of the cloned gene in a mammalian cell system. Thrombolysis was detected by the appearance of reperfusion arrhythmia and confirmed by repeat angiography in anesthetized dogs with 1-hr-old thrombi of the left anterior descending coronary artery that were induced with a copper coil. Infusion of 1000 IU (10 micrograms)/kg/min intravenous rt-PA (n = 9) elicited reperfusion within 13.7 +/- 1.9 min (mean +/- SE) without producing systemic fibrinolysis or distal coronary embolization. Infusion of urokinase at the same rate elicited thrombolysis in seven of 10 dogs within an average of 19.3 +/- 2.2 min. However, distal coronary embolization occurred in two dogs and systemic fibrinolysis was observed in all. In three dogs treated with urokinase thrombolysis was obtained only with subsequent intracoronary infusion. Restoration of myocardial perfusion and metabolism assessed with positron-emission tomography was consistently noted in dogs treated with rt-PA. Thus, rt-PA, a clot-selective thrombolytic agent that does not activate the fibrinolytic system systemically and that is potentially available in large quantities, in view of its synthesis by recombinant DNA technology, offers a promising practical approach for coronary thrombolysis in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
