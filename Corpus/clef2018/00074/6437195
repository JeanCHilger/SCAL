Complex partial seizures. Complex partial seizures, the most common of the adult seizure types, originate in the temporal lobe or limbic system. They include spells with emotional content, cognitive defects, hallucinations and automatisms. Video recordings, EEG telemetry and positron emission tomography have provided a better understanding of the electrophysiology of these seizures. Computed tomography reveals lesions in 50 to 70 percent of the patients. Seizures that are intractable to medical therapy can be treated by temporal lobe resection, with benefits in at least 70 percent of patients.
