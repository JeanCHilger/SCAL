F-18-labeled 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-D-glucose for the study of regional metabolism in the brain and heart. Glucose is the major physiological substrate of the brain and an important physiological substrate for the myocardium. [19F]fluoro-3-deoxy-glucose [3-FDG(F-18)] was studied to determine whether it is a suitable tracer for evaluating the metabolic function of the brain and myocardium. 3-FDG(F-18) was rapidly accumulated in the mouse myocardium (10-12% injected dose/g) and remained constant up to 120 min. Blood, liver, and lung activities exhibited a rapid accumulation of activity (4% injected dose/g) at 1 min, followed by elimination of activity up to 30 min (2% injected dose/g), and then remaining unchanged for a period of 120 min. The arterial blood curve in the dog was fit best by three exponential components (T 1/2 = 0.52 min, 2.75 min, and 142.8 min). Transverse-section images were obtained of the dog's brain and myocardium. From sequential two-dimensional images, a clearance half-time of 26.88 min was determined for the canine brain. Radiation doses for man were calculated from tissue distribution data for mice.
