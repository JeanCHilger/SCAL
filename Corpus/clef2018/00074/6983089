N-isopropyl(I-123)p-iodoamphetamine brain scans with single-photon emission tomography: discordance with transmission computed tomography. Transmission computed tomography (CT) brain scans were compared with N-isopropyl (I-123)-p-iodoamphetamine (IMP) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain scans to determine if there was a correlation between morphology, as seen on CT, and cerebral perfusion changes detected by IMP SPECT. In 12 patients with acute stroke, four showed no discordance between the edema seen on CT and perfusion deficits seen on IMP SPECT five had positive IMP scans while initial CT scans were negative and follow-up CT scans demonstrated edema in the region of perfusion deficit seen on the IMP scans
