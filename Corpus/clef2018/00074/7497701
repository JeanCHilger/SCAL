Medical image processing utilizing neural networks trained on a massively parallel computer. While finding many applications in science, engineering, and medicine, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have typically been limited to small architectures. In this paper, we demonstrate how very large architecture neural networks can be trained for medical image processing utilizing a massively parallel, single-instruction multiple data (SIMD) computer. The two- to three-orders of magnitude improvement in processing time attainable using a parallel computer makes it practical to train very large architecture ANNs. As an example we have trained several ANNs to demonstrate the tomographic reconstruction of 64 x 64 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images from 64 planar views of the images. The potential for these large architecture ANNs lies in the fact that once the neural network is properly trained on the parallel computer the corresponding interconnection weight file can be loaded on a serial computer. Subsequently, relatively fast processing of all novel images can be performed on a PC or workstation.
