Home environment and severe asthma in adolescence: a population based case-control study. To investigate the effects of the home environment on the risk of severe asthma during adolescence.A questionnaire based case-control study drawn from a cross sectional survey of allergic diseases among secondary school pupils in Sheffield in 1991.763 children whose parents had reported that over the previous 12 months they had suffered either 12 or more wheezing attacks or a speech limiting attack of wheeze. A further 763 children were frequency matched for age and school class to act as controls. Analysis was restricted to 486 affected children and 475 others born between 1975 and 1980 who had lived at their present address for more than three years.Independent associations with severe wheeze were seen for non-feather bedding, especially foam pillows (odds ratio 2.78 95% confidence interval 1.89 to 4.17), and the ownership of furry pets now (1.51Either our study questionnaire failed to detect the avoidance or removal of feather bedding by allergic families or there is some undetermined hazard related to foam pillows. Synthetic bedding and furry pets were both widespread in this population and may represent remediable causes of childhood asthma.
