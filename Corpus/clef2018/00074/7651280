Nuclear medicine methods for the diagnosis of adrenal tumors. Adrenal scintigraphy using 131I-6-beta-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol or 6-methyl-75Se-methyl-19-norcholesterol is a function-dependent imaging method which, in association with high-resolution spatial imaging techniques, plays an essential role in the study of adrenocortical hyperfunction. It can distinguish between bilateral cortical hyperplasia and monolateral adenoma or carcinoma and can lateralise the adenoma. In patients with Cushing syndrome, in addition to allowing a distinction to be made between ACTH-dependent forms and independent forms, adrenocortical scintigraphy is particularly appropriate to identify non-common forms of adenomatous hyperplasia. Adrenocortical scintigraphy, performed during dexamethasone administration, is an accurate mean of differentiating bilateral adrenal hyperplasia from monolateral forms (adenoma or carcinoma) in patients with Conn's syndrome. Owing to the gradual spread of high-resolution spatial imaging techniques, the problem of the diagnostic classification of so-called "incidentalomas" (clinically silent masses discovered by chance) is a subject of considerable interest. Adreno-cortical scintigraphy appears to be able to provide an important contribution to identifying the functional behaviour of these tumours. Since the early 80s meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine (MIBG), marked with 131I or 123I, with a structure similar to norepinephrine and characterized by selective tropism for sympathetic and chromaffin tissue, has been used for the scintigraphic study of adrenal medulla. MIBG scintigraphy has been found to be particularly appropriate for the study of intra- and extra-adrenal, single and multiple, benign and malignant pheochromocytomas. This method has a high overall sensitivity and specificity. Lastly, MIBG scintigraphy is useful in the study of neuroblastoma.
