S.P.E.C.T., E.E.G. and M.R.I. investigations in complex partial epilepsy. We present SPECT, electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of a homogeneous group of 12 young adults with rare focal seizures and a good response to carbamazepine. Our data suggest that the alterations of the rCBF are independent of severity and duration of the epilepsy and of the frequency of seizures. Based on our experimental data, it may be suggested that complex partial epilepsy is a good biological model to investigate the neurogenic control of cerebral flow and metabolism.
