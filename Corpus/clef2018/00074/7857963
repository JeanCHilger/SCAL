The nuclear-encoded MSS2 gene is involved in the expression of the mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase subunit 2 (Cox2). Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells carrying the mss2-1 pet mutation contain no Cox2 protein (cytochrome-c oxidase subunit 2), through COX2 transcripts are synthesized and processed normally. Gene MSS2 was cloned and sequenced. It is localized on chromosome IV. The Mss2 protein does not show any significant homology with published sequences.
