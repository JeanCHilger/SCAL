Removal of the preputial diverticulum in swine. A new technique for removal of the preputial diverticulum in swine was performed on 33 sexually intact male potbellied pigs, 12 domestic boar cadavers, and 4 domestic swine (2 sexually intact males and 2 barrows). With each pig under general anesthesia, the body and horns of the diverticulum were everted through the preputial orifice and excised. In some cases, the stump of the diverticulum was sutured. Remaining tissues were allowed to retract through the preputial orifice. The technique was more rapid than the conventional method because skin incision and blunt dissection were unnecessary. Although the technique was developed as a preventive sanitary procedure to accompany routine castration of pet pigs, it has application to domestic swine practice.
