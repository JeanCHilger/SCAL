Peritoneal equilibration test curves and adequacy of dialysis in children on automated peritoneal dialysis. Peritoneal equilibration tests (PETs) and adequacy studies have been performed to guide dialysis prescriptions in adult continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients, although few studies have been reported in pediatric patients on nightly cycling peritoneal dialysis. We performed 49 PETs in 28 children on automated peritoneal dialysis (mean age, 8.9 years age range, 0.2 to 19.8 years
