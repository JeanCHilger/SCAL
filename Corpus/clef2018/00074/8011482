Cerebellum and non-motor behaviour. This paper summarizes research work done on the non-motor and behavioural functions of the cerebellum. In 73 patients with bilateral cerebellar damage deficits in visuo-spatial organization for concrete tasks as well as in planning and programming of daily activities were found. Deficits in spatial learning were also observed in mutant mice with cerebellar damage. The studies suggest that the cerebellum is involved in cognition through the cerebello-frontal and cerebello-parietal loops.
