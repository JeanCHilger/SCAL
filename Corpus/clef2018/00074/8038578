Frontal lobes and behaviour. A number of studies have appeared during the past year that contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of the frontal cortex in learning, memory, and response control. In addition to the traditional approaches that involve the investigation of the behavioural effects of lesions and the recording of the activity of single neurons, important information is now provided by functional activation studies carried out using positron emission tomography on normal human subjects.
