Computer-assisted 3D reconstruction of the terminal branches of the cerebral arteries. I. Anterior cerebral artery. We present a three-dimensional anatomical computer model of the terminal branches of the anterior cerebral artery, acquired from equidistant serial anatomical slices of three brains. The reconstructions provide a clear picture from all angles of the complicated course of the terminal branches of the cerebral arteries, which can help to identify them on conventional and magnetic resonance angiography. Our rendition of the cerebral arteries can also be matched with CT, MR or PET images to indicate the areas of extension of individual branches, allowing neuromorphological and functional correlations.
