Ictal patterns of cerebral glucose utilization in children with epilepsy. To determine seizure propagation patterns, we analyzed ictal positron emission tomography (PET) studies of regional cerebral glucose utilization in 18 children (11 male and 7 female aged 2 weeks to 16 years) with epilepsy (excluding infantile spasms IS). Three major metabolic patterns were determined based on degree and type of subcortical involvement: Nine children had type I asymmetric glucose metabolism of striatum and thalamus. Of these, the 7 oldest children showed unilateral cortical hypermetabolism (always including frontal cortex) and crossed cerebellar hypermetabolism. Two infants (aged < 1 year) had a similar ictal PET pattern but no cerebellar asymmetry, presumably owing to immaturity of corticopontocerebellar projections. Five children had type II, symmetric metabolic abnormalities of striatum and thalamus
