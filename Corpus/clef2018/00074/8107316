Evaluation of early kinetics of 123I-BMIPP in patients with ischemic heart disease. Early kinetics of 123I-BMIPP was evaluated in 200 left ventricular myocardial segments from 10 patients with old myocardial infarction, employing dynamic SPECT. Dynamic SPECT acquisition was performed from 2 minutes to 14 minutes after injection of 123I-BMIPP. Conventional static SPECT with 123I-BMIPP (BM-S) at 20 min after injection and delayed image from stress 201Tl SPECT (Tl-RD) were visually evaluated by dividing each myocardial segment into the following four groups, NL (the segments with normal radioactivity in BM-S and Tl-RD), Tl < BM (the segments with reduced radioactivity in Tl-RD compared with BM-S), Tl > BM (the segments with reduced radioactivity in BM-S compared with Tl-RD) and Tl = BM < NL (the segments with equally reduced radioactivity in BM-S and Tl-RD). In the dynamic SPECT, washout rate (WR) from 2-4 to 12-14 minutes images was calculated. The WR of Tl > BM group (12.9 +/- 15.5% (mean +/- SD), 55 of 200 segments) was significantly higher than those of NL (-8.6 +/- 11.9%, 95 of 200 segments), Tl = BM < NL (-0.6 +/- 16.0%, 45 of 200 segments) and Tl > BM (-4.4 +/- 9.2%, 5 of 200 segments) groups. This high WR of Tl > BM group may reflect "back diffusion" from myocardium in early phase after injection of 123I-BMIPP.
