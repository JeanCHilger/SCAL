Rationale for, and recent progress in, 3D reconstruction of the heart and lungs. Three-dimensional information of the structure and function of the heart and lungs is needed for several reasons including the following: (a) An apparent change in shape or location of the imaged ventricular wall may either be due to the heart moving through the imaged region, or because it truly represents that change in geometry, or a mixture of the two. In addition, as diseases of the heart and lungs are often heterogeneous in their spatial distribution, we expect the structural and functional consequences to also be heterogeneous in their spatial distribution (b) Comparison of a selected anatomic feature (e.g., a coronary artery stenosis or pulmonary opacity) at long time intervals may make detection and/or quantitation of lesion progression questionable. The use of a 3D reconstruction to calculate a projection image with a reproducible angle of view is a particularly powerful consequence of 3D image reconstruction
