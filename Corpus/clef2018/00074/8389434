Requirement of adenosine 5'-triphosphate and Ca2+ for guanosine 5'-triphosphate-binding protein-mediated phospholipase D activation in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. In digitonin-permeabilized PC12 cells labeled with [3H]palmitic acid, formation of [3H]phosphatidylethanol ([3H]PEt), a marker of phospholipase D (PLD) activity, was increased with increasing concentrations of Ca2+ in the presence of ATP, Mg2+ and ethanol. Guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio-triphosphate) (GTP gamma S) significantly enhanced Ca(2+)-stimulated [3H]PEt formation. The effect of GTP gamma S was abolished when any one of Ca2+, ATP or Mg2+ was excluded. ATP could not be replaced by other nucleotides except for ADP. Thus, the GTP-binding protein-mediated PLD activation absolutely required both Ca2+ and Mg-ATP.
