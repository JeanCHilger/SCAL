Preliminary evaluation in humans of Tc-99m-Q3, a new tracer for myocardial perfusion imaging. Trans[99m-Tc-acac2en(TMPP)2]+, where acac2en is N,N'-ethylenebis(acetylacetone iminate) and TMPP is tris-(3 methoxy propyl) phosphine, (shortened Q3) is a new lipophilic Technetium-99m-labelled compound developed for myocardial perfusion imaging. Encouraging data were obtained in the experimental animal. Aim of this study was to perform a preliminary evaluation of Q3 imaging in humans and to compare it with a reference coronary flow tracer such as Tc-99m microspheres. Eight coronary artery disease patients (males, age 58.5 +/- 10 years) were studied. They were injected with 740 MBq of Q3 and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed 90 minutes later. After 3 days 740 MBq of Tc-99m microspheres were injected through a pig-tail catheter in the left ventricle (LV), during heart catheterization, and SPECT was acquired 60 minutes later. Q3 images showed a good target/background activity ratio:LV wall/LV cavity = 4.16 +/- 1.2 myocardium/lung = 3.95 +/- 0.52
