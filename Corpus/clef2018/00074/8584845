Gamma Knife surgery for angiographically occult vascular malformations. To evaluate the effect of radiosurgery on angiographically occult vascular malformations (AOVMs), 9 patients treated with Gamma Knife surgery were followed up for 21-37 months. Eight patients had bleeding episodes, 1 had uncontrollable epilepsy. Rebleeding occurred in 3 AOVMs 5 or 6 months after treatment. One patient experienced transient radiation-induced edema. One patient underwent surgical extirpation due to uncontrollable epilepsy 21 months after Gamma Knife surgery. Histological findings revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and a cavernous angioma. There was hypertrophy of the internal membrane of the AVM, but no effect on the cavernous malformation. Radiosurgery should only be considered in cases of inoperable AOVM, because there is no definite proof that radiosurgery prevents AOVMs from rebleeding.
