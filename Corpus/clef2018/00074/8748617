PET studies of the striatal dopaminergic system in Parkinson's disease (PD). Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging technique which allows detection of biochemical and pharmacological dysfunction of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system and provides the opportunity to investigate living patients with PD. This paper reviews the contribution of PET studies to the understanding of neurochemical changes underlying Parkinson's disease.
