Production, automatic delivery and bolus injection of [15O]water for positron emission tomography studies. An automatic system allowing repetitive bolus injection of oxygen-15-labeled water for PET studies is described in this report. The production of this radiopharmaceutical by the 16O(p,pn)15O nuclear reaction on H2(16O), its purification and delivery nearby the PET camera, the injection system, and the quality controls are presented.
