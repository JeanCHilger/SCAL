Pattern of cerebral blood flow and cognition in patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis treatment. We studied 20 patients aged 46-69 years (mean 57 years) undergoing long-term haemodialysis (HD) and 20 age- and sex-matched controls with single photon emission tomography (SPET) and 99Tcm-hexamethyl-propyleneamine-oxime to look for regional abnormalities in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and their relation to cognitive dysfunction. Global hemispheric tracer uptake relative to the cerebellum was similar in both groups, but regional over cerebellar activity was significantly reduced in the frontal cortex (85.9 +/- 5.1 vs 90.4 +/- 5.3 P = 0.01) and thalamus (99.2 +/- 8.8 vs 104.9 +/- 8.4
