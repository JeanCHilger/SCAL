Cerebral activation during the exertion of sustained static force in man. The aim of our study was to determine alterations of cerebral activity during prolonged static force exertion. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using H2(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) while six male normal subjects pressed a morse-key with their right index finger with a constant force of 20% of their maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) for different periods of time (1.5-4.5 min). Exertion of static force led to activation which was at least as extensive as that during exertion of repetitive dynamic force pulses. Despite a considerable sense of fatigue and increased effort at the end of a 4.5 min key press, no compensatory changes of activity were detected in motor or sensory related structures. The right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex demonstrated a significant correlation between rCBF and duration of key-press, possibly reflecting processes over-riding fatigue. Prominent basal ganglia activation was demonstrated in this static force task, but not in a previous force task involving repetitive dynamic force pulses. This suggests that sustained exertion of a static force is an active process modulated, at least in part, by the basal ganglia.
