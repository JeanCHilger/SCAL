SPECT measurements of brain function in dementia a review. A brief review of the role of SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) in the diagnosis of dementing brain disease is given. Between 1990 and 1995 some 100 original articles deal with SPECT measurements with radioactive tracers of brain function in demented patients. The main field is measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) but there is an increasing number of studies concerning receptor functions in the demented brain.
