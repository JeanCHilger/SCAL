Clinical value of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. Studies of pre- and intraoperative localization of gastrointestinal and pancreatic tumors. [111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]-pentetreotide scintigraphy is able to detect neuroendocrine tumors not shown by radiological methods.In 270 patients with neuroendocrine gastroenteropancreatic tumors (GEP tumors) 400 somatostatin receptor scintigraphies were performed. 70 patients (38 female, 32 male, aged 28 to 74 [56 +/- 12.6] years) underwent surgery and follow-up over 2 years. The aim of the present study was the comparison of preoperative somatostatin receptor scintigraphy with radiological methods (sonography, CT) and intraoperative localization of GEP tumors with a hand-held gamma-probe.Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy was successful in localizing primary tumors in all patients. Liver- and lymph node metastases could be visualized with a sensitivity of 94 and 95 percent. In 7 patients 35 lesions could be identified by intraoperative tumor localization using a hand held gamma probe. Radiological methods identified only 11, surgical palpation 15 and preoperative somatostatin receptor scintigraphy 27 lesions.Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy improves detection of small and occult GEP tumors. Intraoperative probe counting with a hand-held gamma probe can identify tumors even when they are small and impalpable, but receptor positive.
