D2-dopamine-receptor occupancy during treatment with haloperidol decanoate. We investigated in an open, explanatory study a total of 24 patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia. Eighteen patients were treated for at least 4 weeks with a fixed dose of orally administered haloperidol for at least 4 weeks (mean daily dosage ranging from 0.07 to 0.35 mg/kg b.w.), and 6 patients received haloperidol decanoate with a fixed dose for at least 4 months (dosage range 50-150 mg/4 weeks calculated mean daily dosage ranging from 0.02 to 0.09 mg/kg b.w.). One week after injection of haloperidol decanoate, the single photon emission computed tomography examination was performed. Our data suggest that D2-dopamine-receptor occupancy of 50 mg/4 weeks haloperidol decanoate 1 week after injection corresponds to an oral dose of 4.5 mg/day haloperidol.
