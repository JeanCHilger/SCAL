Evaluation of pre- and post-reconstruction count-dependent Metz filters for brain PET studies. In this study we evaluated pre- (PR-R) and post-reconstruction (PO-R) count-dependent Metz filters for PET brain studies in order to increase signal-to-noise ratio. A set of studies using a 3D Hoffman brain phantom was performed at various count levels, and a reference image set was created from extremely high count images. Several combinations of PR-R and PO-R filtering were considered to find the optimal means of processing, including: Hann filter alone PR-R Metz filter without or with a PO-R low pass filter
