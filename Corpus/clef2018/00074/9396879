Design, construction and six years' experience of an integrated system for automated handling of discrete blood samples. The present paper describes the design of an integrated system to aid in the taking and measurement of manual blood samples during nuclear medical examinations requiring blood sampling. In contrast to previously published systems, the present system is not used in the actual sampling of the blood, but aims to aid in all other aspects of handling and measurement. It consists of two main parts. One part is a distributed software system running on the scanner host computer used to register sample times, to display information pertaining to the ongoing examination and to collect data from a number of well crystals. The other main part consists of an industrial robot used to perform the actual weighing, centrifugation, pipetting and measurement of the samples. The system has been operational for 6 years, during which time it has had an "up-time" in excess of 95% and has handled and measured the blood samples from more than 5000 examinations, each comprising an average of 15 blood samples. The throughput of the system is 50 whole blood samples or 21 plasma samples per hour. In addition it has to a large extent removed the "human factor" from the process, thereby increasing the reliability of the data.
