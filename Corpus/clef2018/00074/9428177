Antibiotic and antithromboembolic prophylaxis in hip arthroplasty (a review of 700 primary implants). The authors report the results obtained with antibiotic and antithromboembolic prophylaxis used in 700 consecutive primary total hip arthroplasties. As for antibiotic prophylaxis (5 cases of infection: 0.7%) the various types of antibiotic used always kept the infection rate under 1%, confirming the effectiveness of the preventive use of antibioticotherapy. The incidence of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolia were 3.7% and 0.7%, respectively (26 cases of DVT and 5 of PET). The incidence of DVT rose to 34.4% in a selected group of cases in which phlebography had been carried out even in the absence of symptoms of DVT. This confirms that the routine use of this method would without a doubt be useful in preventing complications with a high risk for the life of the patient (pulmonary embolia). As for pharmacological prophylaxis, indobufene and calcium heparin were the drugs used most: their effectiveness was nearly similar, despite the fact that the use of calcium heparin in patients considered to be at a higher risk for thromboembolic complications should be made clear.
