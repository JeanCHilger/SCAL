Usefulness of SPECT (single-photon emission-computed tomography) in the detection of coronary disease. To evaluate the clinical usefulness of cardiac SPECT in the detection of coronary artery disease, and the relation with the site, number and severity of the angiographic lesions.We studied 216 patients with myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT (T1-201 and/or Tc-99 Sestamibi) and coronary angiogram. We defined the localization of myocardial perfusion defects (anterior, inferior, septal, lateral or apex), and their correlation with coronary angiogram, based on the location, number and severity of coronary angiographic lesions. We considered significative coronary stenosis obstructions of 60% or more.Of the 216 patients studied, 181 (83.8%) were male and 35 (16.2%) female. Age ranged between 30 and 82 years 143 males and 23 females had a previous myocardial infarction. The SPECT sensitivity for diagnosing ischemia of one, two and three vessel disease was 94%, 96% and 100%. The sensitivity for diagnosing disease in specific vascular territories was 91.6% for LAD 100% for RCA, 92.8% for CX and 100% for left main.Myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT has high sensitivity for diagnosing coronary artery disease. The sensitivity and specificity were more accurate in proximal anterior descending artery disease, left main and three-vessel coronary artery disease. We found correlation in the site, number and severity of the angiographic lesions and in myocardial perfusion defects.
