A new set of fiducial markers for MRI, CT and SPET alignment. A set of fiducial markers for use in the alignment of MR, CT and SPET images is presented. The marker system consists of individually produced imprints of the external auditory meatus, a pair of plastic spectacle frames and three fiducial markers. The markers are filled with a suitable contrast agent, fixed into the imprints and screwed onto the spectacle frame just before examination. The reproducibility in positioning the marker system on the patient was evaluated by repeated MRI examinations of a volunteer. The fiducial markers could be repositioned with an accuracy of less than +/- 1.6 mm in the left-right and anterio-posterior directions and +/- 1.9 mm in the cranio-caudal direction (95% confidence interval). The marker system is inexpensive and easy to produce, taking less than 20 min to produce on the ward. Only a few minutes are required to fix the system prior to examination. It is comfortable for the patient, even during long examinations. In cases lacking visible intrinsic structures and external contours, fiducial markers provide a good means of alignment for image fusion. The marker system described here for the alignment of SPET, CT and MR images can be used on a routine basis without the invasive fixation of fiducial markers.
