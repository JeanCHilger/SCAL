Brain plasticity in poststroke aphasia: what is the contribution of the right hemisphere? The brain may use two strategies to recover from poststroke aphasia: the structural repair of primarily speech-relevant regions or the activation of compensatory areas. We studied the cortical metabolic recovery in aphasic stroke patients with positron emission tomography (PET) at rest and during word repetition. The left supplementary motor area (SMA) showed the most prominent compensatory activation in the subacute state of stroke. The restitution of the left superior temporal cortex determined the long-term prognosis of aphasia. The brain recruited right-hemispheric regions for speech processing, when the left-hemispheric centers were permanently impaired. This strategy, however, was significantly less effective than the repair of the original speech-relevant network.
