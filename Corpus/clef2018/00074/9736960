Neurological assessment of learning disorders. The neurological concept of learning is approached from a cybernetic point of view, taking into account that a child should recognize a fact, learn it semantically and decided whether it is worth storing the dynamic aspect of memory is the true motor of the ability to learn and all this is modulated by the attention factor.The neurological evaluation of learning disorders is based on clinical examination which includes the so-called minor signs of the noetic functions, specifically language, the praxes, gnosias, perceptive-motor function, laterality and the lexical, graphic and calculation functions together with the modulating element, mentioned above, of the level of attention with or without hyperactivity. These semiological elements are grouped into three major categories of syndromes: motor syndrome, dyslexic-dysgraphic-dyscalculation syndrome and the hyperkinetic syndrome or attention deficit with hyperactivity. We also note the differential diagnosis. We review the neurophysiological biological markers (EEG and brain mapping, cerebral evoked potentials, neurometry) and those based on neuroimaging techniques (cerebral CT, MR, SPECT and PET).The contribution of neurological assessment is considered as part of the functions of a multi-disciplinary team which should deal with the diagnosis and treatment of children with learning disorders.
