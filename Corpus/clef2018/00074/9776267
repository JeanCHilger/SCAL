Impaired regional fatty acid uptake and systolic dysfunction in hypertrophied right ventricle. Little information is available regarding the determinants of systolic contractile function of the hypertrophied right ventricle (RV). The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between myocardial metabolism and contractile function in the hypertrophied RV due to pulmonary hypertension (PH).Iodine-123-labeled 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) and 99mTc-sestamibi (MIBI) SPECT were performed to calculate the RV-to-left ventricle (LV) tracer uptake ratio (RV/LV) in 21 patients with PH (6 with primary PH and 15 with chronic thromboembolic PH). The patients also underwent electron-beam CT to assess RV ejection function (RVEF) and percentage systolic wall thickening (%SWT) and right heart catheterization to measure mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP).There were significant positive correlations between mPAP and MIBI-RV/LV (r = 0.89, p < 0.001) and between mPAP and BMIPP-RV/LV (r = 0.86, p < 0.001). However, 8 patients showed lower BMIPP-RV/LV than MIBI-RV/LV, indicating the impairment of myocardial fatty acid uptake in the RV. These patients had lower RVEF and %SWT compared to those with normal myocardial fatty acid uptake (RVEF = 28% +/- 10% compared to 40% +/- 9% and %SWT = 33% +/- 27% compared to 74% +/- 30%, respectively p < 0.05 for both comparisons). Although mPAP did not differ between the groups, the RVEF-mPAP and %SWT-mPAP regression lines drawn from the patients with impaired myocardial fatty acid uptake were located below the lines from the patients with normal myocardial fatty acid uptake, suggesting disproportionately decreased RV myocardial contractility for a given mPAP in patients with impaired myocardial fatty acid uptake. The patients with the impaired fatty acid uptake in the RV had a significantly higher death rate (log-rank test, p < 0.05).The results from this preliminary study suggest that myocardial fatty acid uptake is impaired in the failing hypertrophied RV due to PH.
