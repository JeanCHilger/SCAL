Patch testing with nickel sulfate: comparison between 2 nickel sulfate preparations and 2 different test sites on the back. Among patients routinely undergoing patch testing for suspected allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), nickel is the most frequently sensitizing hapten, with a clear predominance in the female population. However, some patients who report the appearance of dermatitis upon exposure to metal objects show negative patch test results to a nickel sulfate 5% pet. application. In some cases, a positive response to nickel can be observed simply by repeating the patch test. The objective of our study was to assess if, during routine patch testing, positive responses to nickel sulfate are missed owing to contingent problems, referring to application site, patch test execution or variations in skin reactivity. To this end, we applied 2 different patch test materials containing nickel sulfate 5% pet. to 3040 consecutive patients, undergoing patch testing for suspected allergic contact dermatitis, during the same session. The r√¥le of the test site was also investigated by applying the preparation on 2 different sites of the back in 30 patients. Of the whole, 612 patients (20%) showed positive patch test responses. The 2 nickel materials were almost equivalent: 78% of nickel-sensitive patients had positive reactions to both, whereas 11% showed a positive response to 1 preparation alone. No variations in patch test responses in relation to application site were observed. Our data show that false-negative patch test responses to nickel are frequent. The use of 2 different preparations during the same patch test session increases the response rate by 10%.
