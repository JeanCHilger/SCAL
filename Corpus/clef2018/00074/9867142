Carbon-11-NNC 112: a radioligand for PET examination of striatal and neocortical D1-dopamine receptors. The aim of this work was to explore the potential of a selective D1-dopamine receptor antagonist as a new radioligand for PET examination of striatal and neocortical D1-dopamine receptors.The active (+)- and inactive (-)-enantiomers of [11C]NNC 112 were radiolabeled using the N-methylation approach and were examined by PET in cynomolgus monkeys and healthy men. Metabolite levels in plasma were measured by gradient high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).N-methylation of the corresponding desmethyl precursors with [11C]methyl triflate gave high total radiochemical yield (50%-60%) and specific radioactivity (110 GBq/micromol). (+)-[11C]NNC 112 binding in cynomolgus monkeys was 5.77+/-0.31 and 2.36+/-0.14 times higher in the striatum and neocortex, respectively, than in the cerebellum at a transient equilibrium that appeared 40-50 min after injection. The binding of (+)-[11C]NNC 112 is stereoselective, because the brain distribution of the inactive (-)-enantiomer was on an equally low level for all brain regions. Displacement and pretreatment experiments using unlabeled SCH 23390 and ketanserin confirms that (+)-[11C]NNC 112 binds specifically and reversibly to D1-dopamine receptors. The radioactivity ratios of the striatum, frontal cortex and nucleus accumbens to the cerebellum were 3.8-4.0, 1.7-2.0 and 2.8-3.1, respectively, at a transient equilibrium that appeared 40-50 min after injection in four healthy human subjects. Linear graphical analysis gave distribution volume ratios of 3.9 and 1.5 in the putamen and frontal cortex, respectively. The fraction of the total radioactivity in human plasma representing unchanged (+)-[11C]NNC 112 was 85% at 5 min and 25% at 75 min after injection.(+)-[11C]NNC 112 should be a useful PET radioligand for quantitative examination of not only striatal but neocortical D1-dopamine receptors in man.
