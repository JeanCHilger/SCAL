Tumor, normal tissue, and plasma pharmacokinetic studies of fluorouracil biomodulation with N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate, folinic acid, and interferon alfa. To evaluate the effect of N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), folinic acid (FA), and interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) biomodulation on plasma fluorouracil (5FU) pharmacokinetics and tumor and liver radioactivity uptake and retention after [18F]-fluorouracil (5-[18F]-FU) administration.Twenty-one paired pharmacokinetic studies were completed on patients with colorectal, gastric, and hepatocellular cancer, utilizing positron emission tomography (PET), which allowed the acquisition of tumor, normal tissue, and plasma pharmacokinetic data and tumor blood flow (TBF) measurements. The first PET study was completed when the patient was biomodulator-naive and was repeated on day 8 after the patient had been treated with either PALA, FA, or IFN-alpha in recognized schedules.TBF was an important determinant of tumor radioactivity uptake (r = .90 P < .001) and retention (r = .96The administration of PALA and IFN-alpha produced measurable changes in plasma, tumor, and liver pharmacokinetics after 5-[18F]-FU administration. No changes were observed after FA administration. In vivo effects may negate the anticipated therapeutic advantage of 5FU biomodulation with some agents.
