Cobalt-55 positron emission tomography in recurrent ischaemic stroke. The present study investigates if Cobalt-55 (55Co) positron emission tomography (PET) allows us to distinguish and detect recent, recurrent strokes in patients who had already suffered a previous infarct in the same vascular territory. Fourteen patients with recurrent strokes underwent a 55Co PET scan of the brain. Recently infarcted areas, less than 2 months old, had a high 55Co uptake ratio, whereas infarcts of 6 months to 1 year had an uptake ratio comparable to normal brain tissue. In infarcts older than 2 years the 55Co uptake ratio was decreased compared to the control values. The evolution in 55Co uptake ratios with time can be explained by the dynamics of the inflammatory response within the infarct core. 55Co PET allows to demonstrate stroke recurrence and suggests that single photon emission tomography, using 57Co as the tracer, could be a more easy alternative to be used in routine neurological practice.
