Manufacture of strontium-82/rubidium-82 generators and quality control of rubidium-82 chloride for myocardial perfusion imaging in patients using positron emission tomography. We describe a protocol to manufacture 82Sr/82Rb generators and 82RbCl for myocardial imaging with PET. The generators are manufactured in 3 stages: (1) preparation of a tin oxide column, (2) leak test of the generator column and (3) loading of the generator with 82Sr. The generators produced sterile and non-pyrogenic 82RbCl for i.v. injection. No significant 82Sr/85Sr breakthroughs were observed after elution with 20 1 of saline. The automated system delivered human doses of 82RbCl accurately.
