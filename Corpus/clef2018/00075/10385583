Cortical activation during perception of a rotating wide-field acoustic stimulus. We describe sound stimuli that produce the perception of complete rotation around the head. Such stimuli are analogous to wide-field motion stimuli used in visual research, though auditory stimuli, unlike visual stimuli, can be perceived at any point around the head they are the only cues for spatial perception behind the subject. Using PET on six subjects, we have compared regional brain activity during the perception of such motion stimuli, with the perception of a control stimulus producing equivalent amplitude changes without rotation. Rotation produced activation of the premotor cortex bilaterally and the right superior parietal cortex. The premotor activation involved the frontal eye fields and ventral premotor areas. The bifrontal and right parietal activation is consistent with previous demonstrations of activation within a frontoparietal network of areas during perception of a linear motion stimulus. The inferior premotor activation in this experiment may reflect preparation for head turning in response to auditory targets that cannot be tracked visually.
