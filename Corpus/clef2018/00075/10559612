Staging of pelvic lymph nodes in neoplasms of the bladder and prostate by positron emission tomography with 2-[(18)F]-2-deoxy-D-glucose. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether pelvic lymph node metastases in patients with neoplasms of the bladder or prostate can be detected applying positron emission tomography with 2-[(18)F]-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET).Eight patients with bladder cancer and 17 patients with prostate cancer were examined with FDG-PET before pelvic lymph node dissection. Results of PET were then compared to histology of pelvic lymph nodes obtained at surgery.Lymph node metastases were detected by histopathological examination in 3 patients with bladder cancer and in 6 patients with prostate cancer. At the sites with histologically proven metastases, increased FDG uptake suspicious of metastatic disease was found in 2/3 and 4/6 patients, respectively. The smallest detected metastasis was a micrometastasis with a diameter of 0.9 cm. In 3 additional patients who all had histopathologically proven micrometastases ( </=0.5 cm), FDG uptake was within the normal range. No false-positive results were obtained.These results suggest that FDG-PET may be a valuable diagnostic tool in the staging of pelvic lymph nodes in bladder and prostate cancer.
