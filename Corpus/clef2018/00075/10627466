Enhanced endothelialization and microvessel formation in polyester grafts seeded with CD34(+) bone marrow cells. The authors have shown accelerated endothelialization on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) grafts preclotted with autologous bone marrow. Bone marrow cells have a subset of early progenitor cells that express the CD34 antigen on their surfaces. A recent in vitro study has shown that CD34(+) cells can differentiate into endothelial cells. The current study was designed to determine whether CD34(+) progenitor cells would enhance vascular graft healing in a canine model. The authors used composite grafts implanted in the dog's descending thoracic aorta (DTA) for 4 weeks. The 8-mm x 12-cm composite grafts had a 4-cm PET graft in the center and 4-cm standard ePTFE grafts at each end. The entire composite was coated with silicone rubber to make it impervious thus, the PET segment was shielded from perigraft and pannus ingrowth. There were 5 study grafts and 5 control grafts. On the day before surgery, 120 mL bone marrow was aspirated, and CD34(+) cells were enriched using an immunomagnetic bead technique, yielding an average of 11.4 +/- 5. 3 x 10(6). During surgery, these cells were mixed with venous blood and seeded onto the PET segment of composite study grafts
