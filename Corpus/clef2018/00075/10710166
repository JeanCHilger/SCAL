Is there a relationship between delta sleep at night and afternoon cerebral blood flow, assessed by HMPAO-SPECT in depressed patients and normal control subjects? Preliminary data. We wished to explore the relationships between waking HMPAO uptake and visually scored polysomnography. We hypothesized that HMPAO activity would correlate positively with slow wave sleep measures the same night. Eight unmedicated unipolar patients with current DSM-IV major depression (17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score 21.5+/-2.9) and seven control subjects received polysomnography on 2 consecutive nights. On the afternoon following the adaptation night, subjects received cerebral SPECT, with 15 mCi Tc-99m-HMPAO injected while subjects performed the Continuous Performance Task. Patients and control subjects did not significantly differ on demographic, polysomnographic, and SPECT variables. Slow wave sleep measures correlated positively (Spearman's) with global and regional tracer activity for depressed (n = 8), control (n = 7) and combined groups (n = 15) in other words, the greater the global or regional afternoon HMPAO uptake, the greater the slow wave sleep measures were the same night. In addition, the greater the waking afternoon global or regional HMPAO activity, the faster subjects fell asleep and the less Stage 2% they had. In patients, global and regional HMPAO activity correlated positively with REM density. Positive correlations between waking tracer activity and subsequent slow wave measures are consistent with previous hypotheses linking slow wave sleep with brain energy conservation and restoration. Further study is needed to determine whether these functional relationships differ in depression.
