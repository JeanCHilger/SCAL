Descriptive study of animal attacks and bites in the municipality of San Juan, Puerto Rico, 1996-1998. The present study described the frequency of animal bites and attacks in the municipality of San Juan, Puerto Rico between the fiscal years 1996 through 1998. A total of 275 cases were reported to the San Juan Local Office of Environmental Health. The distribution of cases by gender was equal, and persons aged 18 years or older had the highest frequency of animal bites and attacks (52.9%). The animal species reported to be involved in the majority of animal bites was the dog (81.1%). Upper extremities were involved in 43% of these injuries. Animal bites caused by dogs were more often reported among male victims (87.4%) (p = 0.031). Approximately 41% of dog bites and attacks and 75% of bites and attacks caused by other animal species were documented as provoked (p = 0.002). More than 75% of the injuries in the head, face or neck involved children < 13 years whereas 65.9% of the injuries in the upper extremities involved adults (> 18 years) (p = 0.001). Animal bites and attacks in the upper extremities were more prominent among injuries caused by an animal species different to the dog (71%) (p < 0.001). We conclude that animal bites and attacks is a public health concern in light of the increasing pet population. Therefore, educational strategies towards the general population must stress careful supervision of the human-animal interaction as well as the general procedures to follow in case of an injury.
