Clinical evaluation of no-carrier-added meta-[123I]iodobenzylguanidine for myocardial scintigraphy. In clinical and research studies, images obtained using carrier-added meta-[123I]iodobenzylguanidine (c.a. [123I]MIBG) have shown quite variable quality, with varying levels of uptake in lung, liver and mediastinum this is a significant problem for quantification of the myocardial uptake by means of region ratios. First experimental and preliminary human data in respect of no-carrier-added (n.c.a.) [123I]MIBG are indicative of improved imaging quality. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical value of myocardial scintigraphy with n.c.a. [123I]MIBG in patients with tachyarrhythmias. The study population comprised 24 patients with tachyarrhythmogenic diseases routinely studied by cardiac single-photon emission tomography (SPET) with [123I]MIBG. Twelve of the 24 patients were studied with c.a. [123I]MIBG (seven females and five males
