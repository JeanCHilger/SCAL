Evaluation of cerebral metabolism by multi-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging in chronic unilateral internal carotid artery occlusion. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy(1H-MRS) has less been used to analyze cerebral metabolism in ischemic lesions compared to single photon emission computed tomography or positron emission computed tomography. Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging apparatus and the related software have made possible obtaining multi-voxel 1H-MRS in a single study. We examined multi-voxel 1H-MRS in patients with unilateral internal carotid artery(ICA) occlusion to study the relationship between cerebral metabolism and cerebral blood flow. Fifteen patients(male 11 female 4, 47-76
