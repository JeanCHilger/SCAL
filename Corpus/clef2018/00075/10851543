Positron emission tomography using [18F]fluorotamoxifen to evaluate therapeutic responses in patients with breast cancer: preliminary study. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to assess the biodistribution and clinical usefulness of [18F]fluorotamoxifen (FTX) in 10 patients with estrogen-receptor(ER)-positive breast tumors. Ten patients with ER-positive breast cancer were prospectively studied, and the consecutive PET imagings (each takes 15 or 20 min) were obtained for 60 or 80 min after the injection of 88.8-392.2 MBq (2.4-10.6 mCi) of [18F]FTX. Twenty three suspected primary or metastatic lesions in 10 patients were evaluated and the tumor uptakes of [18F]FTX in nineteen tumor lesions were correlated to the response of tamoxifen therapy. Three lesions in three patients were considered to be truly negative for breast cancer on the bases of biopsy specimens and/or clinical course. Five (71.4%) of seven patients and 16 (80.0%) of 20 lesions were interpreted to be truly positive for breast cancer. The mean standardized uptake value (SUV) of the radiotracer in tumor was 3.0 on delayed images. There was no significant correlation between the standardized uptake values of [18F]FTX and the ER concentrations in primary lesions. Nineteen tumor lesions in six patients were evaluable to compare the [18F]FTX uptake with responses to tamoxifen therapy after the PET study. Three patients who had a good response to tamoxifen therapy showed positive lesions on PET images, whereas two of three patients who had a poor response showed negative lesions and one showed mixed results. There was no significant difference of [18F]FTX uptake in bone lesions between good and poor responders. However, when bone lesions were excluded, [18F]FTX uptakes in tumors with good responses were significantly higher than those with poor responses (mean and standard deviation of SUV: 2.46 +/- 0.62 vs 1.37 +/- 0.59, P < 0.05). PET imaging using [18F]FTX provides useful information in predicting the effect of tamoxifen therapy in patients with ER-positive breast cancer. Further study is warranted to confirm the clinical utility of PET using [18F]FTX in breast cancer patients.
