Is 99mTc human immunoglobulin G scintigraphy (HIG-scan) useful for the detection of spinal inflammation in ankylosing spondylitis? To determine the effectiveness of technetium-99m labelled polyclonal human immunoglobulin G (HIG-scan) scintigraphy to detect spinal inflammation in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.Six ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients with inflammatory axial pain and 3 spinal osteoarthritis (OA) patients with mechanical axial pain underwent an HMDP scan and an HIG-scan.In both AS and spinal OA patients complaining of axial back pain, mechanical and inflammatory axial pain, bone scintigraphy revealed foci of markedly increased tracer accumulation. An HIG-scan of the region of increased uptake on bone scintigraphy did not reveal increased tracer accumulation in either group of patients.The data suggest that the HIG-scan is not useful in detecting inflammatory spinal lesions in ankylosing spondylitis.
