Hypercapnia can induce arousal from sleep in the absence of altered respiratory mechanoreception. Possible mechanisms of arousal from respiratory stimuli include changes in PO(2), PCO(2), central respiratory drive, or respiratory mechanoreceptor activity. We sought to determine whether hypercapnia alone could induce arousal from sleep in four subjects with high (>/= C3) neurologically complete spinal cord injuries while on constant positive pressure mechanical ventilation (hence, respiratory mechanoreceptor activity remained constant). Subjects were chronically hypocapnic (mean baseline PET(CO(2)) = 21 mm Hg range, 13-30 mm Hg). On the first night, the baseline rate of spontaneous awakenings was determined by polysomnography. On night two, FI(CO(2)) was increased rapidly in stable NREM sleep. Awakenings occurred in 19 of 19 trials within 5 min, with each subject waking and complaining of shortness of breath (mean time to arousal, 115 s
