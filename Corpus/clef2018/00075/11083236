Statistical modeling of positron emission tomography images in wavelet space. A new method is introduced for the analysis of multiple studies measured with emission tomography. Traditional models of statistical analysis (ANOVA, ANCOVA and other linear models) are applied not directly on images but on their correspondent wavelet transforms. Maps of model effects estimated from these models are filtered using a thresholding procedure based on a simple Bonferroni correction and then reconstructed. This procedure inherently represents a complete modeling approach and therefore obtains estimates of the effects of interest (condition effect, difference between conditions, covariate of interest, and so on) under the specified statistical risk. By performing the statistical modeling step in wavelet space. the procedure allows the direct estimation of the error for each wavelet coefficient hence, the local noise characteristics are accounted for in the subsequent filtering. The method was validated by use of a null dataset and then applied to typical examples of neuroimaging studies to highlight conceptual and practical differences from existing statistical parametric mapping approaches.
