Persistent but reversible coronary microvascular dysfunction after bypass grafting. The effect of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) has not been investigated previously. MBF (ml. min(-1). g(-1)) was measured at rest and during hyperemia (0.56 mg/kg iv dipyridamole) using H(2)(15)O and positron emission tomography in eight patients with three-vessel disease before surgery and 1 and 6 mo after full revascularization. Baseline MBF was 0.87 +/- 0.12 preoperatively and 1.04 +/- 0.14 and 0.95 +/- 0.13 at 1 and 6 mo after CABG, respectively (P < 0.05, 6 mo vs. preoperatively). Hyperemic MBF was 1.36 +/- 0.28 preoperatively and increased to 1.98 +/- 0.50 and 2.45 +/- 0.64 at 1 and 6 mo after CABG, respectively (P < 0.01, 6 mo vs. preoperatively). Coronary vasodilator reserve (hyperemic/baseline MBF) increased from 1.59 +/- 0.40 preoperatively to 1.93 +/- 0.13 and 2.57 +/- 0.49 at 1 and 6 mo, respectively (P < 0.05, 6 mo vs. preoperatively). Minimal (dipyridamole) coronary resistance (mmHg. min. g(-1). ml(-1)) fell progressively from 59.37 +/- 14.56 before surgery to a nadir of 35. 76 +/- 10.12 at 6 mo after CABG (P < 0.01 vs. preoperatively). The results of the present study confirm that CABG improves coronary vasodilator reserve progressively as a result of reduction in minimal coronary resistance. These data suggest persistent microvascular dysfunction that recovers slowly after surgery.
