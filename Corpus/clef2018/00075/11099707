Comparison of regional cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism in the normal brain: effect of aging. The regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and metabolic rate for glucose (rCMRGlc) are associated with functional activity of the neural cells. The present work reports a comparison study between rCBF and rCMRGlc in a normal population as a function of age. 10 young (25.9+/-5.6 years) and 10 old (65.4+/-6.1 years) volunteers were similarly studied at rest. In each subject, rCBF and rCMRGlc were measured in sequence, during the same session. Both rCBF and rCMRGlc values were found to decrease from young (mean rCBF=43.7 ml/100 g per min mean rCMRGlc=40.6 micromol/100 g per min) to old age (mean rCBF=37.3 ml/100 g per min
