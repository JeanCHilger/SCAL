Effect of donepezil on brain acetylcholinesterase activity in patients with AD measured by PET. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities in the brain of three patients with AD were measured once before and once during donepezil treatment (5 mg/d in two patients, 3 mg/d in one patient) using PET and N-[11C]methylpiperidin-4-yl acetate. Donepezil reduced k(3) values, an index of AChE activity, in the cerebral cortex by 39 +/- 5%. All patients showed some degree of symptomatic improvement, and it was concluded that this improvement was likely caused by improved cholinergic activity by inhibition of AChE in the brain.
