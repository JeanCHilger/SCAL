SPECT mapping of cerebral activity changes induced by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in depressed patients. A pilot study. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is being investigated as an alternative treatment for depression. However, little is known about the clinical role and the neurophysiological mechanisms of the action of rTMS in these patients. In this study, 99mTc-HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was used to map the effects of left dorsolateral prefrontal rTMS on prefrontal activity in seven patients who met DSM-IV criteria for major depression resistant to pharmacological treatment. rTMS consisted of 30 trains of 2-s duration stimuli (20 Hz, 90% of motor threshold), separated by 30-s pauses. Each patient underwent three SPECTs: at baseline during the first rTMS
