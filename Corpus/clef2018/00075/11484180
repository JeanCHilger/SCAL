Cell behavior on laser surface-modified polyethylene terephthalate in vitro. This work has been undertaken to study the cell behavior of L929 fibroblasts on the laser irradiated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) surface. To modify the surface properties of the PET, CO2 pulsed laser at the wavelength of 9.25 microm and KrF excimer laser at 248 nm with various number of pulses were used. Laser irradiation caused some changes in the chemical and physical properties of the laser-treated film surfaces, which were evaluated using different techniques. These changes may affect the cell adhesion and growth on the laser-treated PET. Therefore, cell attachment and spreading were investigated on the laser-treated PET in vitro. The data from in vitro assays showed the fibroblast cells were attached and proliferated extensively on the CO2 and KrF laser-treated films in comparison with the unmodified PET. The results obtained from the cell behavior studies revealed that surface morphology and wettability affected cell adhesion and spreading on the laser-treated PET.
