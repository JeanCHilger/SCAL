Local haemodynamic changes associated with neural activity in auditory cortex. We used an optical technique to study haemodynamic changes associated with acoustically driven activity in auditory cortex of the chinchilla. Such changes are first detectable c. 0.5 s after stimulation, peak at 2-3 s, and decay within a further 3-6 s. This intrinsic signal imaging reveals activity in separate cortical areas, including primary auditory cortex (AI), secondary auditory cortex (AII) and an anterior auditory field (AAF). We have measured the timing of haemodynamics associated with each area, and find that AI has a different time course from AII and AAF its haemodynamic change recovers more rapidly. We also show that within AI and AII, place specific activity related to acoustic stimulus frequency can be resolved by this optical imaging method. Our results show the close association between blood flow change and the local metabolic demands of neural activity. The data provide information about the potential of other functional imaging methods (e.g. PET, fMRI) which rely on activity related haemodynamic events.
