Multimodality image-guided epilepsy surgery. Co-registration of imaging modalities in the diagnosis of epilepsy is now commonly used in major epilepsy centres. However, the incorporation of these registrations into an image-guided system has only recently been developed. Using techniques of segmentation, surface matching and/or voxel-based matching, we have been able to co-register FLAIR MRI, SPECT, PET, and subdural grids into the 3-D space of the volumetric MRI and use these images on the StealthStation Image-Guided System to resect these foci. This greatly aids the surgeon in performing a more precise tailoring of the cortical resection so as to maximize the excision of the epileptogenic zone while minimizing the impact on eloquent cortex and epileptogenic foci.
