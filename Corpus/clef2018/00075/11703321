Can positron emission tomography with [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose after first-line treatment distinguish Hodgkin's disease patients who need additional therapy from others in whom additional therapy would mean avoidable toxicity? To assess the ability of restaging positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to predict clinical outcome after first-line treatment in patients with Hodgkin's disease, we included 60 patients with histologically proven HD, who underwent whole-body [(18)F]-fluorodeoxygenase ([(18)F]-FDG)-PET studies after first-line treatment and with a follow-up of at least 1 year. Persistence or absence of residual disease on PET was related to progression-free survival (PFS) using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. After treatment, 55 patients showed a normal [(18)F]-FDG-PET scan 50 of 55 remained in complete remission (CR), with a median follow-up of 955 d. Only five patients relapsed (median PFS, 296 d). During follow-up in all five patients, [(18)F]-FDG-PET was the first tool that became positive for relapse. Persistent abnormal [(18)F]-FDG uptake was seen in only five patients
