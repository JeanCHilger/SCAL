Combined 18F-FDG and 11C-methionine PET scans in patients with newly progressive metastatic prostate cancer. Metastatic prostate cancer may respond initially to hormone suppression, with involution of tumor sites, but ultimate tumor progression is inevitable. Our aim was to detect the proportion of bone and soft-tissue lesions that represent metabolically active tumor sites in patients with progressive metastatic prostate cancer.In a prospective study, we compared 18F-FDG and L-methyl-11C-methionine (11C-methionine) PET with conventional imaging modalities (CIM), which included the combination of 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate scintigraphy, CT, or MRI. Twelve patients with prostate cancer, increasing levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and at least 1 site (index lesion) with new or increasing disease on CIM were studied. The total numbers of soft-tissue and bone-tissue lesions, in a site-by-site comparison, were calculated for all imaging modalities.The sensitivities of 18F-FDG PET and 11C-methionine PET were 48% (167/348 lesions) and 72.1% (251/348 lesions), respectively, with CIM being used as the 100% reference (348/348). 11C-Methionine PET identified significantly more lesions than 18F-FDG PET (P < 0.01). All 12 patients with progressive metastatic prostate cancer had at least 1 lesion site of active metabolism for 18F-FDG or 11C-methionine, which could be used as an index lesion to monitor the metabolic response to therapy. A significant proportion of lesions (26%) had no detectable metabolism of 18F-FDG or 11C-methionine. Although technical factors cannot be totally excluded, we believe that metabolically inactive sites may be necrotic or dormant. More than 95% (251/258) of metabolically active sites (72% of the total number of lesions detected by CIM) metabolize 11C-methionine. 18F-FDG uptake is more variable, with 65% of metabolically active sites (48% of the total number of lesions detected by CIM).These findings reflect the different biologic characteristics of the lesions in a heterogeneous tumor such as prostate cancer and suggest that a time-dependent metabolic cascade may occur in advanced prostate cancer, with initial uptake of 11C-methionine in dormant sites followed by increased uptake of 18F-FDG during progression of disease.
