How can we measure substrate, metabolite and neurotransmitter concentrations in the human brain? Cerebral injury and disease is associated with fundamental derangements in metabolism, with changes in the concentration of important substrates (e.g. glucose), metabolites (e.g. lactate) and neurotransmitters (e.g. glutamate and y-aminobutyric acid) in addition to changes in oxygen utilization. The ability to measure these substances in the human brain is increasing our understanding of the pathophysiology of trauma, stroke, epilepsy and tumours. There are several techniques in clinical practice already in use and new methods are under evaluation. Such techniques include the use of cerebral probes (e.g. microdialysis. voltammetry and spectrophotometry) and functional imaging (e.g. positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy). This review describes these techniques in terms of their principles and clinical applications.
