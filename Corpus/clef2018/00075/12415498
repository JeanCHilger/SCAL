Tc-99 HMPAO cerebral SPECT imaging in brain death patients with complex spinal automatism. The aim of this study is to evaluate the value ofTc-99 HMP AO cerebral SPECT imaging to confirm brain death in patients with complex spinal automatism.Fifteen patients (8 female, 7 male) aged between 1,5-48 years showing spinal movements within 24-72 hours after brain death were examined with Tc-99 HMPAO cerebral SPECT.All patients demonstrated empty skull on Tc-99 HMPAO images and no contradictory case was ob- served between standard clinical criteria and SPECT study.Non-invasive brain SPECT study is valuable to diagnose and confirm brain death with spinal automatism in adults and children. Key words: Tc-99 HMPAO SPECT, brain death, spinal automatism
