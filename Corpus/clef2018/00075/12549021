Expression of two truncated enhancin gene from Helicoverpa armigera granulosis virus in E. coli and its preliminary bioassay. The plasmids pET-30a-Ben and pET-30a-Den which included 1.7 kd and 2.2 kb fragments of 5'-terminal of HaGV enhancin gene were obtained by cutting recombinant plasmid pET-30a-En with Bal I and Dra I respectively. Two fragments were expressed in E. coli successfully and the products were named Ben and Den respectively. The enhancement, which Ben and Den enhance the infectivity of HaNPV and Bt in 3rd larvae of Helicoverpa armigera, was studied. The results indicated that there was increase of the mortality of 10.5%-26.5% and the LT50 decrease of 0.9 d causes by adding Ben, while Den could increase the mortality by 10.2%-33.0% and decrease the LT50 by 1.2 d-1.9 d. The preliminary bioassay on Bt against Helicoverpa armigera indicated the recombinant enhancin could increase the mortality of larvae by 20.7%-35.4%, Den by 16.7%-31.5%, Ben by 11.7%-27.4%.
