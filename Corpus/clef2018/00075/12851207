Multimodal optical imaging. The recent resurgence of interest in the use of intravital microscopy in lung research is a manifestation of extraordinary progress in visual imaging and optical microscopy. This review evaluates the tools and instrumentation available for a number of imaging modalities, with particular attention to recent technological advances, and addresses recent progress in use of optical imaging techniques in basic pulmonary research.1 Limitations of existing methods and anticipated future developments are also identified. Although there have also been major advances made in the use of magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and X-ray and computed tomography to image intact lungs and while these technologies have been instrumental in advancing the diagnosis and treatment of patients, the purpose of this review is to outline developing optical methods that can be evaluated for use in basic research in pulmonary biology.
