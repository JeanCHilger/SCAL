Impact of Wiener filter in determining the left ventricular volume and ejection fraction using thallium-201 gated SPECT. Patient morphology, as well as the acquisition and reconstruction parameters, may influence the evaluation of the left ventricular volume (LVV) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) using gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of gender and reconstruction filter on the measurement of LVV and LVEF using 201Tl gated SPECT. Using a static torso phantom, a female shape was created by the addition of two saline solution-filled balloons fixed on the anterior rib cage. The following parameters were similar for all acquisitions: 90 degrees dual-head gamma camera 32 projections
