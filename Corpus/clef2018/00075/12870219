The Child Environment Survey. The German Environmental Survey (GerES) is a representative population study conducted in Germany since the mid-1980s. GerES IV is the first survey for children only it will be conducted in close connection with the Health Survey for Children and Adolescents on a random sample of 1,800 children (3 to 14 years of age) taken from the study population of the Health Survey for Children and Adolescents. Various parameters will be analysed in blood, urine, house dust, indoor air and tap water. They include neurotoxins (PCBs, Pb, Hg), carcinogenic/cocarcinogenic substances (PAHs, benzene, halocarbons, Cd, As), substances that may cause irritation of the respiratory tract, allergies and asthma (VOC, formaldehyde, house dust mite, mould fungi, pet allergens) and substances that may have an effect on metabolism with potentially long-term consequences (such as DEHP). An additional part was devoted to the link between hearing ability, noise and stress. A one-year pilot study on 550 children and adolescents was conducted in 2001 to 2002 to collect information on parameters influencing the response rate and to test the suitability of the different instruments intended to be used for the main study.
