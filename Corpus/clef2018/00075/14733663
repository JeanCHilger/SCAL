Lung cancer: value of various imaging modalities. Bronchogenic carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer death, and the overall prognosis remains poor. Imaging plays a critical role in the initial staging and follow-up of the disease. Bronchogenic carcinoma is typically detected first on chest radiography but computed tomography (CT) scan is the most important imaging technique, providing both staging information and assessment of recurrence. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is most useful as a problem-solving tool. The increasing role of positron emission tomography (PET) scan in the evaluation is reviewed, and imaging guidelines of two national organizations are presented.
