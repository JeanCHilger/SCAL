The use of acetazolamide-enhanced regional cerebral blood flow measurement to predict risk to arteriovenous malformation patients. Regional hemodynamic disturbances may complicate the treatment of certain cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and occasionally produce life-threatening situations. Acetazolamide-enhanced quantitative regional cerebral blood flow studies were performed preoperatively in 35 patients to determine if patterns of vasoreactivity could be identified that might be markers for postoperative morbidity. Ipsilateral and contralateral regions of hypoperfusion were identified on resting studies, and a steal index was calculated by dividing the regional cerebral blood flow in the steal region by the flow in a normal cerebellar region. Flow in these regions of interest was again quantitated after the administration of acetazolamide, a known cerebral vasodilator. A delta value was calculated by subtracting the resting index values from the acetazolamide indices. Abnormally enhanced vasoreactivity (vasodilation) to acetazolamide stimulation was noted in these threatened territories in AVM that had perforating vessel feeding and angiographic steal phenomena, that developed hyperemic disturbances, and that resulted in poor outcomes. These findings call into question traditional theories of AVM-related hemodynamic decompensation and suggest unique smooth muscle derangements in cerebral vasculature in some AVM patients.
