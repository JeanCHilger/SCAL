Role of iodine-131 MIBG scanning in the management of paediatric patients with neuroblastoma. To evaluate the role of iodine-131 metoiodobenzylguanidine (iodine-131 MIBG) scanning in the management of paediatric patients with neuroblastoma.Forty-three iodine-131 MIBG scans were performed on 26 children, 18 male and 8 female, ranging in age from 8 months to 11 years. Bone scan, computed tomography (CT) images and findings of bone marrow biopsy were compared with the iodine-131 MIBG scan findings.Of the 26 patients, 18 (69%) showed abnormal iodine-131 MIBG avidity and were proven to have a neural crest tumour on histology. The remaining 8 (31%) patients had normal iodine-131 MIBG scans, and histology showed a malignancy other than a neural crest tumour. Iodine-131 MIBG scans showed the primary site in 16 of 17 patients while CT showed 14 primary sites. In follow-up studies, the results were as follows: iodine-131 MIBG showed no evidence of disease in 4 compared with 3 on CT, persistent disease in 2 on iodine-131 MIBG and 4 on CT recurrence in 1 on iodine-131 MIBG and 0 on CTThe findings indicate that iodine-131 MIBG scanning is useful for the diagnosis, staging, evaluation of response to therapy and detection of recurrences in patients with neuroblastoma. It exhibited a clear advantage over CT in detecting the primary site and soft issue metastases and was also superior to bone scanning in detecting skeletal metastases. It also reliably demonstrated bone marrow involvement.
