Correlation of clinical, MRI and Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT findings in neuro-Behçet's disease. Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic disorder of unknown cause. In our study, we investigated the utility of Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT and MRI in patients with neuro-Beh,cet's disease (n-BD).Twelve patients (two females, ten males mean age 33 +/- 9.6 yrNeurological examination showed parenchymal brain involvement in 6 of 12 patients (50%). All 6 patients had white matter lesions on MRI, while only 5 of them showed perfusion defects on brain SPECT. Out of 6 patients (50%) without clinical signs of parenchymal brain involvement, 1 patient showed a pathological brain SPECT and 3 patients showed pathological MRI findings. Semiquantitative analysis of brain regions on SPECT study showed statistically significant hypoperfusion of biparietal regions.This study investigates the correlation between clinical, MRI and SPECT findings and it shows discrepancy between these findings in some cases. Brain SPECT may act as a complementary modality to increase the detection rate of affected regions in patients with n-BD.
