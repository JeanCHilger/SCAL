Reduced brain serotonin transporter binding in patients with panic disorder. There is strong evidence for the importance of the serotonin (5-HT) system in the neurobiology of panic disorder (PD) however, the exact role of this system remains unclear. The 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) is a key element in 5-HT neurotransmission. The current study aimed to investigate the binding of 5-HTT in the brain of patients with PD. We used single-photon emission computed tomography with a radioligand that specifically labels the 5-HTT, [(123)I]nor-beta-CIT. Subjects comprised eight patients with current PD, eight patients with PD in remission, and eight healthy control subjects. The patients with current PD showed a significant decrease in 5-HTT binding in the midbrain, in the temporal lobes and in the thalamus in comparison to the controls. The binding of 5-HTT in patients with PD in remission was similar to findings in the control group in the midbrain and in the temporal lobes, but lower in the thalamus. Regional 5-HTT binding significantly and negatively correlated with the severity of panic symptoms. These findings point to a dysregulation of the 5-HT system in PD patients. Altered function of 5-HTT appears to be related to the clinical status of patients. Clinical improvement in the patients in remission is associated with normalization of 5-HTT binding.
