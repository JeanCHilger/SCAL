SPECT in the evaluation of cancer patients: not quo vadis rather, ibi fere summus. In the past 7 years, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has evolved from an interesting nuclear medicine technique rarely performed because of technical difficulties into a valuable clinical tool in the management of cancer cases. The development of stable multidetector instruments with collimators and gantries specifically designed for SPECT and the introduction of new radiopharmaceuticals recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have rapidly moved SPECT from the field of clinical investigation to clinical practice. SPECT is a valuable addition to other tomographic modalities capable of displaying the physiology of disease as well as anatomy. In this work the authors describe the role of SPECT in a cancer center and, in particular, how they use it to solve clinical problems. They also review the published literature, when appropriate. The authors have found SPECT of particular value in evaluation of myocardial ischemia, in differentiating tumor recurrence from posttherapy changes in the lymphomas, in tumor diagnosis and surveillance, and in separating hemangioma from malignant lesions in the liver.
