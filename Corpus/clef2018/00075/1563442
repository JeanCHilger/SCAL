Collimator design for single photon emission tomography. We discuss recent trends in collimator design and technology, with emphasis on theoretical and practical issues of importance for single photon emission tomography (SPET). The well-known imaging performance parameters of parallel-hole collimators are compared with those of fan-beam collimators, which have enjoyed considerable success in recent years, particularly for brain SPET. We review a simplistic approach to the collimator optimization problem, as well as more sophisticated "task-dependent" treatments and important considerations for SPET collimator design. Practical guidance is offered for understanding trade-offs that must be considered for clinical imaging. Finally, selective comparisons among different SPET systems and collimators are presented for illustrative purposes.
