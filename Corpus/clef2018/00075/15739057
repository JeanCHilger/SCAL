Recurrent operations on the adrenal glands. Repeat adrenalectomy may be required due to ipsilateral recurrence of benign or malignant adrenal tumors after previous total or subtotal adrenalectomy. Even for multivisceral resection in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma, complete resection of local recurrent tumor offers results similar to those of primary resection (5-year survival 40-60%). In contrast, since no benefit on long-term survival has been shown so far by tumor debulking, palliative tumor resection should only be performed individually for control of severe endocrine symptoms. The effect of endoscopic adrenalectomy in patients with large tumors (>5 cm) or suspected malignancy has still not been well examined. Further studies are required. In any case, during open or endoscopic approach, tumor spillage must be avoided to prevent local tumor cell implantation. Following subtotal adrenalectomy, the risk of ipsilateral recurrence correlates with disease, follow-up, localization, size of the adrenal remnant, and, in case of familial pheochromocytoma, probably with genotype.
