High cell density fed-batch culture of E.coli expressing rhVEGF121. To investigate the optimal high cell density fermentation conditions of recombinant E.coli BL21/pET- 24a/hVEGF(121) expressing recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor (rhVEGF(121)).The effects of the composition of the fermentation medium, induction time and fed-batch carbon sources on the expression level of rhVEGF(121) and cell output were analyzed.When cultured in modified M9 medium and induced for 4 h in the presence of 0.5 mmol/L IPTG at 37 degrees celsius with glycerol as the carbon sources by continuous fed-batch mode, the recombinant E.coli expressed rhVEGF(121) at the level up to 23% of the total proteins and the yield reached 68 g/L. The optimized fermentation condition for recombinant E.coli enables high expression level of rhVEGF(121).
