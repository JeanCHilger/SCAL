Relation of T-wave inversion in Q-wave acute myocardial infarction to myocardial viability on resting rubidium-82 and 18-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging. T-wave inversion in areas of Q-wave myocardial infarction has been advocated as a predictor of myocardial viability. However, the predictive value of this electrocardiographic finding in distinguishing viable from nonviable muscle is not fully defined. Thus, we correlated electrocardiographic Q waves and a measure of T-wave inversion with the results of rubidium-82 (Rb-82) and 18-fluoro-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging at rest. We analyzed 35 Q-wave myocardial infarct regions in 25 patients. Nineteen of the 35 (54%) were judged viable by Rb-82/FDG-PET. Using the Novacode T-wave score, T-wave inversion was present in 11 of 19 regions (58%) with viability and 5 of 16 regions (31%) without viability. Thus, neither Q waves nor T-wave inversion can accurately predict myocardial viability in patients with Q-wave myocardial infarction.
