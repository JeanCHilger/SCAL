Surgical outcome and prognostic factors of pediatric epilepsy caused by cortical dysplasia. We analyzed 30 patients with cortical dysplasia (CD) and epilepsy to evaluate the clinical characteristics and surgical outcome of both epilepsy control and neurocognition.The mean ages at seizure onset and at the time of the operation were 3.6 years (range, 1 month-12.6 years) and 10.3 years (range, 1.5-18.3 years), respectively. The mean follow-up period was 3.2 years (range, 1-5.3 years). (18)FDG-positron emission tomography was the most sensitive and magnetic resonance imaging was the most specific in localizing the lesion. Developmental/intellectual delay was predominant in the early-onset group (n=18, seizure onset <3 years), with intelligence tending to be normal in the late-onset group (n=12, seizure onset >or=3 years). Mild CD predominated in the late-onset epilepsy group and moderate or severe CD in the early-onset group (p=0.005). The surgical success rate of epilepsy control was 87%. A better outcome was obtained if the lesion was confined to the temporal lobe. School performance was favorable in 43%. The age at seizure onset and preoperative developmental/intellectual delay were the important prognostic factors in school performance as well as the epilepsy control. A total of 77% of patients had relatively good social adaptation. Successful epilepsy control and good school performance were affirmative conditions precedent to social adaptation.Due to the favorable control of epilepsy and its effect on school performance and social adaptation, surgical treatment is strongly recommended for cortical dysplasia and intractable epilepsy.
