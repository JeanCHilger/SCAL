Unresponsive or non-compliant steatorrhea in cystic fibrosis? In 105 pancreatic insufficient CF patients (steatorrhea and low fecal elastase-1 concentrations), the effectiveness of pancreatic enzyme therapy (PET) has been assessed (fecal fat losses and coefficient of fat reabsorption). Eight unresponsive subjects were checked for PET compliance with fecal chymotrypsin assay. Three patients were documented to be non-compliant. Unresponsive patients should undergo evaluation for PET compliance.
