Blood compatibility of surface-engineered poly(ethylene terephthalate) via o-carboxymethylchitosan. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films were treated by argon plasma following by graft copolymerization with acrylic acid (AAc). The obtained PET-surface grafted PAA (PET-g-PAA) was coupled with chitosan (CS) and o-carboxymethylchitosan (OCMCS) molecules, respectively. Their surface physicochemical properties were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), water contact angle and streaming potential measurements. The PET-g-PAA surface containing carboxylic acid, CS immobilized PET surface containing amino and OCMCS immobilized PET surface containing both carboxylic acid and amino groups, make the PET surface exhibited a hydrophilic character. The blood compatibility was evaluated by platelet contacting experiments and protein adsorption experiments in vitro. The results demonstrate that the PET surface coupling OCMCS shows much less platelet adhesive and fibrinogen adsorption compared to the other surface modified PET films. The anticoagulation of PET-OCMCS is ascribed to the suitable balance of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, surface zeta potential and the low adsorption of protein.
