Amyloid load and cerebral atrophy in Alzheimer's disease: an 11C-PIB positron emission tomography study. To determine the relationship between cerebral amyloid plaque load and rates of cerebral atrophy in Alzheimer's disease. (11)C-PIB((11)C-6-OH benzothiazole)PET (positron emission tomography) findings were correlated with volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements in nine subjects with mild to moderate AD. Analysis revealed a positive correlation between rates of whole brain atrophy and whole brain (p = 0.019) and regional (11)C-PIB uptake. This provides support for the central role of amyloid deposition in the pathogenesis of AD.
