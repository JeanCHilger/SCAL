Comparison between (99m)Tc-MIBI myocardial perfusion SPECT and multi-slice computed tomography for identifying and assessing coronary artery disease. Imaging atherosclerotic changes allows us to identify the incidence and to predict the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this study we have examined whether the changes in coronary vessels assessed by multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) reflected those in myocardial perfusion determined by the methyl-iso-butyl isonitryl ((99m)Tc-MIBI) (99m)Tc labeled SPECT study. Seventy-two patients with established CAD underwent the MSCT and the (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT tests. The correlation between coronary artery calcium scoring (CS) and the extent of CAD in coronary angiography was determined. No correlation between total CS and the score of the reversible and non-reversible perfusion defects in (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT was found. Following the analysis for the 3 main coronary arteries separately, and the number of reversible perfusion defects, a significant correlation was observed between LAD and RCA vessels (p<0.008 and p<0.004, respectively). MSCT can identify the patients with CAD, only when CS exceeds 300-400 other diagnostic procedures such as (99m)Tc-MuIotaBetaIota SPECT and coronary angiography are recommended.
