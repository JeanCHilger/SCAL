Kinetic modeling of PET-FDG in the brain without blood sampling. The aim in this work is to report a new method to calculate parametric images from a single scan acquisition with positron emission tomography (PET) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the human brain without blood sampling. It is usually practical for research or clinical purposes to inject the patient in an isolated room and to start the PET acquisition only for some 10-20 min, about 30 min after FDG injection. In order to calculate the cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (CMRG), usually several blood samples are required. The proposed method considers the relation between the uptake of the tracer in the cerebellum as a reference tissue and the population based input curve. Similar results were obtained for CMRG values with the present method in comparison to the usual autoradiographic and the non-linear least squares fitting of regions of interest.
