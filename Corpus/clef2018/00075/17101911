Altered mesolimbocortical and thalamic dopamine in Tourette syndrome. We used [F-18]fallypride PET in six adults with Tourette syndrome and age-matched controls to assess extrastriatal dopamine 2 (D2) receptors. D2 receptor availability was significantly lower in the orbitofrontal cortex, primary motor cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, mediodorsal nucleus of thalamus, and hippocampus, areas important for motivation and reward, sensory gating, movement, and attention. Altered dopaminergic function in mesolimbocortical systems and thalamus may contribute to increased motivational salience of tics.
