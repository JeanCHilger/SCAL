The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (Translocator protein 18kDa) in microglia: from pathology to imaging. Microglia constitute the primary resident immune surveillance cell in the brain and are thought to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and HIV-associated dementia. Measuring microglial activation in vivo in patients suffering from these diseases may help chart progression of neuroinflammation as well as assess efficacy of therapies designed to modulate neuroinflammation. Recent studies suggest that activated microglia in the CNS may be detected in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) utilizing pharmacological ligands of the mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR (recently renamed as Translocator protein (18kDa)). Beginning with the molecular characterization of PBR and regulation in activated microglia, we examine the rationale behind using PBR ligands to image microglia with PET. Current evidence suggests these findings might be applied to the development of clinical assessments of microglial activation in neurological disorders.
