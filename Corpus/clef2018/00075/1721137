Congenital myocardial sympathetic dysinnervation (CMSD)--a structural defect of idiopathic long QT syndrome. Concerning the pathogenetic mechanism of idiopathic long QT syndrome (LQTS), the hypothesis of a specific sympathetic imbalance has gained general acceptance, but its validity has never been proven. To test this hypothesis I-123-MIBG, an analogue of norepinephrine and guanethidine, was used to provide scintigraphic display of the efferent cardiac sympathetic innervation. Twelve members of four LQTS families (mean age 38.2 +/- 17.2 years, eight males) and eight healthy volunteers (mean age 48.2 +/- 13.3 years, five males) were studied by means of I-123-MIBG single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). A quantitative analysis of all scans was performed. All scans of the healthy volunteers show a uniform tracer uptake with sometimes slightly decreased activity in the apex. (1) All patients with QTc greater than 440 msec (n = 5) (2) all, who had suffered from at least one episode of torsade de pointes, ventricular fibrillation (VF) or syncope (n = 5)
