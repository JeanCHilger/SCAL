Clinical utility of 18F-FDG PET for patients with salivary gland malignancies. The clinical utility of 18F-FDG PET in evaluating salivary gland malignancies has not been well defined. We therefore evaluated the utility of 18F-FDG PET in management for patients with salivary gland cancers.Thirty-four patients with newly diagnosed salivary gland cancers underwent CT and 18F-FDG PET before surgical resection with radiotherapy. The diagnostic accuracies of CT and 18F-FDG PET for detecting primary tumors and neck metastases were compared with a histopathologic reference. We determined the relationship between the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of the tumor and clinicopathologic parameters such as sex, age, local tumor invasion, T and N categories, TNM stage, and histologic grade, as well as their associations with disease-free survival (DFS).18F-FDG PET was more sensitive than CT for the detection of primary tumors (91.2% vs. 79.4% P < 0.05), cervical metastases (80.5% vs. 56.1%Our findings indicate that, in patients with salivary gland malignancies, 18F-FDG PET is clinically useful in initial staging, histologic grading, and monitoring after treatment but not in predicting patient survival.
