Medical imaging curriculum development: an interactive simulation system for different modalities. This paper presents the result of our recent development for medical imaging education, an Internet-based interactive medical imaging simulation system. A series of popularly used medical imaging modalities, including X-rays, ultrasound, CT, MRI and PET, are explored through text, relevant graphics and simulations. In this development, we emphasize interactivity by using MATLAB and Shockwave simulations. To develop the online interactive medical imaging tutorial, MATLAB Web Server and Internet technologies such as Director MX, JavaScript and HTML are employed.
