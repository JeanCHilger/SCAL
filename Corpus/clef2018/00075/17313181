A new optical and nuclear dual-labeled imaging agent targeting interleukin 11 receptor alpha-chain. Optical imaging has great potential for studying molecular recognitions both in vivo and in vitro, yet nuclear imaging is the most effective clinical molecular imaging modality. The combination of optical and nuclear imaging modalities may provide complementary information for improving diagnosis and management of diseases. In this study we developed an optical and nuclear dual-labeled imaging agent, 111In-DTPA-Bz-NH-SA-K(IR-783-S-Ph-CO)-c(CGRRAGGSC)NH2, called DLIA-IL11Ralpha. 111In-DTPA-Bz-NH-SA is the radiotracer moiety a near-infrared dye IR-783-S-Ph-COOH serves as the fluorescent emitter
