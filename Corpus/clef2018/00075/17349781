Association between serotonin transporter availability and hostility scores in healthy volunteers - a single photon emission computed tomography study with [(123)I] ADAM. The present study examined the relationship between serotonin transporter (SERT) availability and hostility scores in healthy volunteers. SERT availability was measured by using SPECT with [(123)I] ADAM in 10 healthy participants. Hostility was measured with the Cook-Medley Hostility Scale. Hostile attribution, but not the other subscales of hostility, was negatively correlated with SERT availability. Central serotoninergic activities may play a role in hostility.
