Gender differences in ventricular volumes and left ventricle ejection fraction estimated by myocardial perfusion imaging: comparison of Quantitative Gated SPECT (QGS) and Segami software programs. To test for gender differences in the measurements obtained by Segami and Quantitative Gated SPECT (QGS) software programs.181 asymptomatic individuals without heart disease were submitted to myocardial perfusion imaging. End-diastolic volumes (EDV), end-systolic volumes (ESV) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured by QGS and Segami software programs to evaluate the influence of gender, age, weight, height, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, body mass index and body surface area.The means in the QGS method were: EDV (women= 68 ml men= 95 mlVentricular volumes were significantly lower and LVEF was significantly higher in women, estimated by QGS or Segami software programs.
