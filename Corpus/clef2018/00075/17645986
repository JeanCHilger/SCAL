Radiotracer breast cancer imaging: Beyond FDG and MIBI. Radiotracer imaging with MIBI and FDG have shown the benefit of the functional imaging of breast cancer. Newer radiopharmaceuticals targeted to particular aspects of breast cancer biology will likely play an important role in directing more specific and individualized breast cancer treatment. Future studies will need to test the ability of SPECT and PET imaging to detect breast cancer, but also to assess target expression, identify resistance factors, and measure early response to treatment. This will require protocols designed to test the predictive capability of imaging in the setting of a therapy trial, a new paradigm for breast cancer imaging, for which radiotracer imaging is ideally suited.
