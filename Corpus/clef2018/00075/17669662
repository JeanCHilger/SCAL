Radiolysis of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and the role of reductant stabilisers. 2-[18F]Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is unstable at elevated temperatures, alkaline pH and in highly radioactive concentrated solutions. Radiolysis generates hydrogen peroxide in situ that accelerates the FDG decomposition rate and shortens the shelf life of the radiopharmaceutical. Reductant stabilisers slow down the decomposition rate and improve the shelf life for large-scale FDG manufacture in highly radioactive concentrated solutions.
