Brain death: determination with brain stem evoked potentials and radionuclide isotope studies. Thirty-three patients fulfilling the clinical criteria for brain death were tested by Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials (BAEP) and Radionuclide Cerebral Angiography and Brain Perfusion Studies. There was a significant correlation between the BAEP and radionuclide study outcomes. All patients with absence of BAEP showed no cerebral perfusion. These findings, added to the clinical findings, resulted in a final diagnosis of brain death in all patients. It is concluded that BAEP and Radionuclide Cerebral Perfusion studies are useful adjuncts for proving that brain death has really occurred.
