Alternating bioactivity of multilayer thin films assembled from charged derivatives of chitosan. Charged derivatives of chitosan, N-sulfofurfuryl chitosan (SFC) and N-[(2-hydroxyl-3-trimethylammonium)propyl]chitosan chloride (HTACC) were prepared by reductive alkylation of amino groups of chitosan (CHI) using 5-formyl-2-furansulfonic acid, sodium salt (FFSA) as a reagent and ring opening of glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride (GTMAC) by amino groups of chitosan, respectively. The chemical structures of the charged derivatives were verified by (1)H NMR and FTIR analyses. Multilayer assembly of SFC, HTACC, CHI and the selected oppositely charged polyelectrolytes was monitored by a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). Stratification of the multilayer film fabricated on plasma-treated poly(ethylene terephthalate) (treated PET) substrate was demonstrated by water contact angle data. The coverage of the assembled films was characterized by AFM and ATR-FTIR analyses. The bioactivity of the deposited multilayer film on the treated PET substrate was tested against selected proteins having a distinctive size and charge. This research strongly suggests that both SFC and HTACC are potential candidates for altering the surface bioactivity of materials.
