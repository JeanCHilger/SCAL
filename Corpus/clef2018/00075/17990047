Changes in regional cerebral blood flow demonstrated by 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT in euthymic bipolar patients. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc-HMPAO was used to compare regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with bipolar disorder and in healthy controls. The sample of this study consisted of 16 euthymic bipolar patients who met the DSM-IV criteria and 10 healthy control subjects. The mean regional cerebral blood flow values of the bipolar euthymic patients were significantly lower than those of the controls in the bilateral medial-basal temporal, occipital medial frontal
