Non-rigid surface registration using spherical thin-plate splines. Accurate registration of cortical structures plays a fundamental role in statistical analysis of brain images across population. This paper presents a novel framework for the non-rigid intersubject brain surface registration, using conformal structure and spherical thin-plate splines. By resorting to the conformal structure, complete characteristics regarding the intrinsic cortical geometry can be retained as a mean curvature function and a conformal factor function defined on a canonical, spherical domain. In this transformed space, spherical thin-plate splines are firstly used to explicitly match a few prominent homologous landmarks, and in the meanwhile, interpolate a global deformation field. A post-optimization procedure is then employed to further refine the alignment of minor cortical features based on the geometric parameters preserved on the domain. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework is highly competitive with others for brain surface registration and population-based statistical analysis. We have applied our method in the identification of cortical abnormalities in PET imaging of patients with neurological disorders and accurate results are obtained.
