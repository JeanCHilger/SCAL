Triple energy window scatter correction technique in PET. A practical triple energy window technique (TEW) is proposed, which is based on using the information in two lower energy windows and one single calibration, to estimate the scatter within the photopeak window. The technique is basically a conventional dual-window technique plus a modification factor, which can partially compensate object-distribution dependent scatters. The modification factor is a function of two lower scatter windows of both the calibration phantom and the actual object. In order to evaluate the technique, a Monte Carlo simulation program, which simulates the PENN-PET scanner geometry, was used. Different phantom activity distributions and phantom sizes were tested to simulate brain studies, including uniform and nonuniform distributions. The results indicate that the TEW technique works well for a wide range of activity distributions and object sizes. The comparisons between the TEW and dual window techniques show better quantitative accuracy for the TEW, especially for different phantom sizes. The technique is also applied to experimental data from a PENN-PET scanner to test its practicality.
