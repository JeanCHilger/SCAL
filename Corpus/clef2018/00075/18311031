Comparsion with myocardial perfusion MRI and myocardial perfusion SPECT in the diagnostic performance of coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis. We compared the diagnostic abilities of stress myocardial perfusion MRI (myocardial perfusion MRI) and myocardial perfusion SPECT, using a meta-analysis method. We investigated the diagnostic abilities of MRI and SPECT in similar subject groups in reports written in English or Japanese. The reports to be used for analysis were selected according to a "screening standard," which was established in advance. After consolidating the data from the selected reports, we compared (1) the integrated odds ratio, (2) the point estimation values of sensibility/specificity, and (3) the summary ROC curve. For the analysis, six reports were selected (subjects: 153, coronary-artery target sites: 447). Meta-analysis revealed that the diagnostic ability of myocardial perfusion MRI was superior to that of myocardial perfusion SPECT regarding each of the parameters (1)-(3). This is considered to be supportive evidence of the usefulness of myocardial perfusion MRI.
