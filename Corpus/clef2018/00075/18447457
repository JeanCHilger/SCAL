Ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer in the micelle and the gel phase of a PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymer. Ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from N,N-dimethylaniline (DMA) to coumarin dyes is studied in the micelle and the gel phase of a triblock copolymer, (PEO)(20)-(PPO)(70)-(PEO)(20) (Pluronic P123) by picosecond and femtosecond emission spectroscopies. The rate of PET in a P123 micelle and gel is found to be nonexponential and faster than the slow components of solvation dynamics. In a P123 micelle and gel, PET occurs on multiple time scales ranging from a subpicosecond time scale to a few nanoseconds. In the gel phase, the highest rate constant (9.3 x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1)) of ET for C152 is about two times higher than that (3.8 x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1)) observed in micelle phase. The ultrafast components of electron transfer (ET) exhibits a bell shaped dependence with the free energy change which is similar to the Marcus inversion. Possible reasons for slower PET in P123 micelle compared to other micelles and relative to P123 gel are discussed.
