The contribution of positron emission tomography in pleural disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) has a clear role in oncology, particularly in thoracic disease. In the light of our experience and a revue of the literature we define precisely the role of metabolic imaging in the diagnosis of pleural pathology.In particular PET allows characterisation of malignant pleural disease and provides prognostic information in mesothelioma. Metabolic imaging provides clinical information for the staging of pulmonary cancer, in the search for a primary tumour in metastatic pleurisy and also in the follow up of chronic or recurrent pleural pathology.It is justified, therefore, that PET joins the diagnostic armamentarium of pleural pathology, solid or liquid.
