Dual-phase FDG-PET: delayed acquisition improves hepatic detectability of pathological uptake. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the acquisition of delayed images could improve the detectability of liver pathological uptakes.Ninety-five consecutive patients with suspected liver metastases underwent a dual-phase positron emission tomography (PET) scan. All patients underwent a whole-body PET/computed tomography (CT) scan (PET-1) acquired 1 h post [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) injection, and a liver PET/CT scan [that is, one or two fields of view (FOV) of the upper abdomen PET-2] acquired 2 h postinjection. In all cases, image reconstruction was performed as 3D reconstruction algorithm Fourier rebinning (FORE) iterative, FOV 50 cm, image matrix size 128 x 128. Both studies were evaluated qualitatively and semiquantitatively [background standard uptake values (SUV)mean of the liver, lesion SUVmax and SUVmean and ratio SUVmean lesion/background).Thirty-seven of 95 patients (38.9%) presented liver lesions at both PET-1 and PET-2 exams, whereas there were two (2.2%) only at PET-2. Eighty-one liver lesions were identified at both PET studies, whereas there were nine (11.1%) only at PET-2. Furthermore, at PET-2, we had a statistically significant reduction of SUVmean background values (p < 0.001, Wilcoxon test) and a concomitant increase of SUVmean lesion values (p < 0.001, Wilcoxon test), ratio lesion to background (p < 0.001, Wilcoxon test).Acquisition of delayed images improved the hepatic detection of pathological FDG uptake.
