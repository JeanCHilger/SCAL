Diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease in the elderly. The 159 patients with Parkinson's disease with onset after the age of 50 (mean: 62.3 years) were studied with reference to diagnosis and treatment. The results were as follows: 1. Other than the characteristic features, the symptoms at onset were depression (6% of the patients), lumbago (4%), hemiplegia-like (4%) and dizziness (3%), causing misdiagnoses in some of the patients. Among 159 patients studied, the severity most frequent was Yahr stage 3 (63%) at first examination, indicating the necessity of earlier diagnosis. 2. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the substantia nigra and striatum was investigated using a 1.5 Tesla field and T2-weighted images, which gave no specific results concerning diagnosis and severity. However, it was useful in differential diagnosis between this disease and parkinsonism caused by multiple system atrophy and cerebrovascular diseases. 3. With 123I-IMP SPECT, decrease in blood flow in the frontal and temporal lobes correlated with the severity (Yahr stage) of the disease. Regarding cognitive functions the scores of Hasegawa's Dementia Scale and Mini-Mental State showed a highly significant correlation with the amount of blood flow in frontal and parietal lobes, suggesting that dementia might be caused by dysfunction of these lobes. 4. In 98 patients treated with levodopa mixed with dopa-economizers for more than a year, the maximum improvement was small in severely disabled patients of Yahr stage 5 and 4 because none improved to stage 3A or below (3A is an arbitrary criterion meaning mild involvement in stage 3 with 3P meaning more severe cases).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
