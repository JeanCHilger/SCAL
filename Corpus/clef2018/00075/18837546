Synthesis, in vitro, and in silico evaluation of organometallic technetium and rhenium thymidine complexes with retained substrate activity toward human thymidine kinase type 1. Human cytosolic thymidine kinase (hTK1) has proven to be a suitable target for noninvasive imaging of cancer cell proliferation using radiolabeled substrates such as [ (18)F]fluorothymidine ([ (18)F]FLT). However, a thymidine tracer useful for single photon emission tomography (SPECT) based on the inexpensive radionuclide technetium-99m would be of significant interest. In this work, a series of thymidine derivatives labeled with the organometallic [M(CO) 3] (+) core (M = (99m)Tc, Re) were synthesized. Neutral, cationic, and anionic complexes were readily formed in aqueous media, and all were substrates of recombinant hTK1 when incubated with ATP. The neutral complexes were phosphorylated to a greater extent than the charged complexes. The extent of phosphorylation was further improved by increasing the spacer length separating thymidine and the organometallic core. A molecular dynamics simulation study performed with a modified hTK1 structure supported the experimental findings. In vitro cell internalization experiments performed in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SKNMC) showed low uptake of the charged complexes but significant uptake for the neutral, lipophilic complexes with a log P value >1.
