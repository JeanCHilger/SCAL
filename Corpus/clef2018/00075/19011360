Scavenging reactive oxygen species by rice dehydroascorbate reductase alleviates oxidative stresses in Escherichia coli. Maintaining redox balance is one of the crucial requirements for a cell to endure stress from the outside. Dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR EC 1.8.5.1) plays an important role in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle
