18F-FDG-uptake of hepatocellular carcinoma on PET predicts microvascular tumor invasion in liver transplant patients. Vascular invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major risk factor for poor outcome after liver transplantation (LT). The aim of this retrospective analysis was to assess the value of preoperative positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) in liver transplant candidates with HCC for predicting microvascular tumor invasion (MVI) and posttransplant tumor recurrence. Forty-two patients underwent LT for HCC after PET evaluation. Sixteen patients had an increased (18)F-FDG tumor uptake on preoperative PET scans (PET +), while 26 recipients revealed negative PET findings (PET-) pre-LT. PET- recipients demonstrated a significantly better 3-year recurrence-free survival (93%) than PET + patients (35%, p < 0.001). HCC recurrence rate was 50% in the PET + group, and 3.8% in the PET-population (p < 0.001). PET + status was identified as independent predictor of MVI [hazard ratio: 13.4]. Patients with advanced PET negative tumors and patients with HCC meeting the Milan criteria had a comparable 3-year-recurrence-free survival (80% vs. 94%, p = 0.6). Increased (18)F-FDG uptake on PET is predictive for MVI and tumor recurrence after LT for HCC. Its application may identify eligible liver transplant candidates with tumors beyond the Milan criteria.
