Amnestic mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease: a brain perfusion SPECT study. The purpose of this study was to investigate cortical dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with amnestic deficit (PD-MCI). Perfusion single photon emission computed tomography was performed in 15 PD-MCI patients and compared (statistical parametric mapping [SPM2]) with three groups, i.e., healthy subjects (CTR), cognitively intact PD patients (PD), and common amnestic MCI patients (aMCI). Age, depression, and UPDRS-III scores were considered as confounding variables. PD-MCI group (P < 0.05, false discovery rate-corrected for multiple comparisons) showed relative hypoperfusion in bilateral posterior parietal lobe and in right occipital lobe in comparison to CTR. As compared to aMCI, MCI-PD demonstrated hypoperfusion in bilateral posterior parietal and occipital areas, mainly right cuneus and angular gyrus, and left precuneus and middle occipital gyrus. With a less conservative threshold (uncorrected P < 0.01), MCI-PD showed hypoperfusion in a left parietal region, mainly including precuneus and inferior parietal lobule, and in a right temporal-parietal-occipital region, including middle occipital and superior temporal gyri, and cuneus-precuneus, as compared to PD. aMCI versus PD-MCI showed hypoperfusion in bilateral medial temporal lobe, anterior cingulate, and left orbitofrontal cortex. PD-MCI patients with amnestic deficit showed cortical dysfunction in bilateral posterior parietal and occipital lobes, a pattern that can be especially recognized versus both controls and common aMCI patients, and to a lesser extent versus cognitively intact PD. The relevance of this pattern in predicting dementia should be evaluated in longitudinal studies.
