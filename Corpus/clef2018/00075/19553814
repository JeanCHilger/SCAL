Role of PET in gynecologic malignancy. The purpose of this review is to outline the current state-of-the-art use of PET imaging for patients with gynecologic malignancies.Recent findings with clinical impact when PET is utilized in patients with gynecologic cancer are primarily limited to patients with cancer of the uterine cervix and for patients with ovarian cancer. PET is used in patients with other gynecologic cancers such as endometrial cancer, uterine sarcomas, vulvar cancer, and vaginal carcinoma but with less well defined clinical impact than cervical and ovarian cancers.PET is utilized in patients with cervical cancer for initial staging, guiding therapy, evaluating response to therapy, and for long-term follow-up. The primary uses of PET in patients with ovarian cancer are for the evaluation of adnexal masses and for the diagnosis and evaluation of recurrent disease.
