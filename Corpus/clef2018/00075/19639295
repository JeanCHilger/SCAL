Adenosine receptor ligands and PET imaging of the CNS. Advances in radiotracer chemistry have resulted in the development of novel molecular imaging probes for adenosine receptors (ARs). With the availability of these molecules, the function of ARs in human pathophysiology as well as the safety and efficacy of approaches to the different AR targets can now be determined. Molecular imaging is a rapidly growing field of research that allows the identification of molecular targets and functional processes in vivo. It is therefore gaining increasing interest as a tool in drug development because it permits the process of evaluating promising therapeutic targets to be stratified. Further, molecular imaging has the potential to evolve into a useful diagnostic tool, particularly for neurological and psychiatric disorders. This chapter focuses on currently available AR ligands that are suitable for molecular neuroimaging and describes first applications in healthy subjects and patients using positron emission tomography (PET).
