Central D1- and D2-receptor occupancy during antipsychotic drug treatment. 1. It has been unequivocally shown that antipsychotic compounds reduce dopaminergic transmission. A relationship in vitro between the potency for the antipsychotic effect and the blockade of D2-dopamine receptors has been shown. No such relationships have been demonstrated for any other central receptor population. 2. Positron emission tomography (PET) has made it possible to investigate interactions of psychotropic drugs with central receptors in the living human brain. Using the selective D2 receptor antagonist raclopride labelled with positron emitting isotope 11C, it has been shown that chemically distinct classical neuroleptics in conventional doses occupy a high degree (65-89%) of the D2-receptors in the human brain. The results substantiate the opinion that the antipsychotic effects is mediated by a blockade of D2-dopamine receptors. 3. The degree of binding to D1-receptors using the 11C-labelled D1-antagonist from Schering (SCH 23390) as the ligand was also determined. The D1-receptor occupancy seemed to be dependent on the type of the antipsychotic compound studied. 4. The atypical neuroleptic compound clozapine demonstrated a different binding profile than the classical neuroleptics. Thus, clozapine in conventional doses occupied D2-receptors to a smaller extent (40%, 40%, 65%) than classical neuroleptics. The occupation of D1-receptors was higher (40%, 42%) than that of classical compounds (0-36%). 5. The unique clinical profile of clozapine may be related to its potency on both D1- and D2-receptors. The distribution of D1-receptors varies from that of D2-receptors in the human brain which may be one reason for the importance of blocking both D1- and D2-receptors for a full antipsychotic response.
