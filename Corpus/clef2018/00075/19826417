Vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy with BF2-chelated Tetraaryl-Azadipyrromethene agents: a multi-modality molecular imaging approach to therapeutic assessment. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment modality for a range of diseases including cancer. The BF(2)-chelated tetraaryl-azadipyrromethenes (ADPMs) are an emerging class of non-porphyrin PDT agent, which have previously shown excellent photochemical and photophysical properties for therapeutic application. Herein, in vivo efficacy and mechanism of action studies have been completed for the lead agent, ADMP06.A multi-modality imaging approach was employed to assess efficacy of treatment, as well as probe the mechanism of action of ADPM06-mediated PDT.Tumour ablation in 71% of animals bearing mammary tumours was achieved after delivery of 2 mg kg(-1) of ADPM06 followed immediately by light irradiation with 150 J cm(-2). The inherent fluorescence of ADPM06 was utilised to monitor organ biodistribution patterns, with fluorescence reaching baseline levels in all organs within 24 h. Mechanism of action studies were carried out using dynamic positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging techniques, which, when taken together, indicated a decrease in tumour vascular perfusion and concomitant reduction in tumour metabolism over time after treatment.The encouraging treatment responses in vivo and vascular-targeting mechanism of action continue to indicate therapeutic benefit for this new class of photosensitiser.
