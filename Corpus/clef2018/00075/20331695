Assessment of myocardial perfusion during adenosine stress using real time three-dimensional and two-dimensional myocardial contrast echocardiography: comparison with single-photon emission computed tomography. To evaluate diagnostic accuracy of adenosine two-dimensional and three-dimensional myocardial contrast echocardiography (2D- and 3D-MCE) compared with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for assessing myocardial perfusion.From January through August 2007, patients with known or suspected CAD who were referred for SPECT underwent simultaneous adenosine 2D-MCE and 3D-MCE (live and full volume [FV]). Perfusion and wall motion in 17 segments in the left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary artery territories were analyzed.We studied 30 patients: mean (SD) age, 72.6 (8.2) years 19 (63%) men. Perfusion by SPECT was abnormal in 13 patients (43%). When comparing MCE with SPECT, sensitivity was comparable for 2D-MCE, 92%Myocardial perfusion assessment is feasible by 3D-MCE with the advantage of rapid, facile acquisition and offline image manipulation.
