Approaches to multimodality imaging of angiogenesis. Angiogenesis, defined as the formation of new capillaries by cellular outgrowth from existing microvessels, can be assessed by the evaluation of perfusion, function, and metabolism. However, more recently, novel, noninvasive imaging strategies for the evaluation of molecular events associated with the angiogenic process have been developed.
