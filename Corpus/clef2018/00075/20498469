Image presentation. The nipple-areolar complex: a pictorial review of common and uncommon conditions. The purpose of this presentation is to show the radiologic findings of normal variants and benign and malignant diseases that affect the nipple-areolar complex.We evaluated the imaging findings of nipple-areolar complex lesions, using multiple breast imaging modalities including mammography, sonography, galactography, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography/computed tomography.Radiologic features of nipple-areolar complex lesions, including Montgomery tubercles, nipple inversion, benign calcifications, inflammation, duct dilatations, intraductal papillomas, fibroadenomas, neurofibromatosis, dermatosis of the nipple, and breast malignancy, have been illustrated.A clinical examination is essential and an appropriate imaging evaluation with multiple modalities is often necessary to accurately diagnose an underlying abnormality of the nipple-areolar complex. Given the limitations of conventional mammography, supplemental mammographic views often are needed, and sonography may be performed to further characterize a mammographic or clinical finding. Also, contrast-enhanced MRI may be useful for additional evaluation.
