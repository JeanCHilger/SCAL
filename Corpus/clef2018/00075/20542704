Synthesis of 5-deoxy-beta-D-galactofuranosides as tools for the characterization of beta-D-galactofuranosidases. Derivatives of 5-deoxy-beta-D-galactofuranose (5-deoxy-alpha-L-arabino-hexofuranose) have been synthesized starting from D-galacturonic acid. The synthesis of methyl 5-deoxy-alpha-L-arabino-hexofuranoside (14alpha) was achieved by an efficient strategy previously optimized, involving a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) deoxygenation. Compound 14alpha was converted into per-O-acetyl-5-deoxy-alpha,beta-L-arabino-hexofuranoside (16), an activated precursor for glycosylation reactions. The SnCl4-promoted glycosylation of 16 led to 4-nitrophenyl (19alpha), and 4-methylthiophenyl 5-deoxy-alpha-L-arabino-hexofuranosides (20alpha). The oxygenated analog 4-methylphenyl 1-thio-beta-D-galactofuranoside (23beta) was also prepared. The 5-deoxy galactofuranosides were evaluated as inhibitors or substrates of the exo-beta-D-galactofuranosidase from Penicillium fellutanum, showing that the absence of HO-5 drastically diminishes the affinity for the protein.
