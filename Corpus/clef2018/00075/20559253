Up-to-date methods of tomographic diagnostics for the evaluation of effectiveness of the treatment of laryngeal and laryngopharyngeal cancer. Currently employed methods of tomographic diagnostics for the evaluation of effectiveness of the treatment of laryngeal and laryngopharyngeal cancer are described. The authors underscore that increasingly more attention tends to be given to magnetoresonance imaging (MRI) and especially X-ray computer tomography (CT) due to their wide application and high informative value whereas nuclear medicine techniques, such as single-photon emission CT using thallium-200, 11C-methionine and (18)F-positron emission tomography, are considered to be less important despite their great diagnostic potentialities. It is emphasized that X-ray CT with intravenous administration of contrast material should be regarded as the method of choice for the evaluation of larynx and pharynx conditions following treatment of their tumours. MRI should be reserved for patients in whom X-ray CT with contrast enhancement proves impracticable.
