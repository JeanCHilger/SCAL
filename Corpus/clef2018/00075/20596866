Procedure guidelines for PET/CT tumour imaging  with 68Ga-DOTA-conjugated peptides: 68Ga-DOTA-TOC,  68Ga-DOTA-NOC, 68Ga-DOTA-TATE. The aim of these guidelines is to assist nuclear medicine physicians in recommending, performing, reporting and interpreting the results of somatostatin (SST) receptor PET/CT imaging using 68Ga-DOTA-conjugated peptides, analogues of octreotide, that bind to SST receptors. This imaging modality should not be regarded as the only approach to visualizing tumours expressing SST receptors or as excluding other imaging modalities useful for obtaining comparable results. The corresponding guidelines of 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy imaging have been considered and partially integrated with this text. The same has been done with the relevant and recent literature in this field and the final result has been discussed by distinguished experts.
