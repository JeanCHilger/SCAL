Clinical appraisal of 99m technetium-sestamibi SPECT/CT compared to conventional SPECT in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and concomitant nodular goiter. Although 99m Technetium-sestamibi scintigraphy with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and, recently, hybrid SPECT/computed tomography (CT) have been claimed to be the preoperative methods of choice for parathyroid localization in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and concomitant nodular goiter (NG), they have never been compared in this setting. We aimed at testing the hypothesis that SPECT/CT may be superior to SPECT for parathyroid localization in patients with PHPT and NG.Thirty-three patients with PHPT and NG (one or more nodular lesions based on cervical ultrasound) who underwent open parathyroidectomy during 2004-2009 were reviewed. All patients had preoperative 99m Tc-sestamibi planar scintigraphy and SPECT (18 patients) or SPECT/CT (15 patients) after cervical ultrasound. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) (for both correct neck side and quadrant identification) were calculated for the two procedures through comparison with intraoperative findings. In addition, operative times were assessed if the surgery was only for PHPT and not for the six patients who also had thyroidectomy.The sensitivity of SPECT/CT for correctly identifying the neck side containing an abnormal parathyroid was 93.7% versus 80% for SPECT (p = 0.21, not significant [ns]). The specificity and PPV for this attribute were 92.9% and 93.7%, respectively, for SPECT/CT versus 87.5% and 88.9%, respectively, for SPECT (p = 0.75 and 0.8, ns). SPECT/CT showed higher sensitivity than SPECT (87.5% vs. 55.6% p = 0.0001) and higher PPV (87.5% vs. 62.5%SPECT/CT is superior to SPECT for preoperative imaging of patients with PHPT and NG. We recommend the routine use of SPECT/CT for work-up of all such patients, particularly if minimally invasive parathyroid surgery is planned.
