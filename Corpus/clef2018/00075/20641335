Anti-mouse monoclonal antibody immunoglobulin G conjugated to GRKKRRQRRRPPQGYG-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-[ Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are often directed toward cell-surface molecules and may be radiolabeled for the imaging or treatment of cancer and other ailments (1-3). The radiolabeled mAbs are not readily internalized by the cell except by receptor-mediated endocytosis, which limits the use of these macromolecules either for the imaging or treatment of neoplastic solid tumors (4). However, Hu et al. showed that linking the mAb to the tat peptide (17 amino acid residues in the following sequence: GRKKRRQRRRPPQGYG) derived from the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) transactivator of the transcription (TAT) protein enabled it to be internalized and to be directed to the cellular nucleus (5, 6). Several investigators have used the tat peptide to enable cell penetration by a variety of large molecules including proteins, oligodeoxynucleotides, liposomes, and even nanoparticles (7-9). Conjugation of the tat peptide to mouse immunoglobulins (mIgG) labeled with radioactive iodine (
