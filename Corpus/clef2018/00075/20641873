. The vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptors (VIPR) are believed to be involved in the modulation of many physiological processes such as growth, reproduction, digestion, and respiration, as well as the neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and immune systems, and even cancers (1-4). VIPR have been reported to be expressed by most human carcinomas and hve been detected in more tumors compared with the somatostatin receptors, and the use of these receptors for tumor imaging was suggested (5). The VIP is a hydrophobic peptide (28 amino acids) that was labeled with radioactive iodine (
