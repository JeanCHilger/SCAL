Preliminary study of positron emission tomography/computed tomography and plasma osteopontin levels in patients with asbestos-related pleural disease. The aim of this study was to compare the results of semiquantitative analysis by(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with plasma osteopontin levels in the same asbestos-related pleural disease population.A total of 17 patients with asbestos-related pleural disease were prospectively recruited. They underwent PET/CT, and plasma osteopontin levels were measured. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was determined from the most active pleural lesion in each patient.Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) was histologically proven in 6 patients, and 11 patients had proven benign asbestos-related pleural diseases (7 pleural plaques, 4 asbestos pleurisy). Significant differences in SUVmax were found between patients with MPM and those with asbestos pleurisy (P = 0.031) and between patients with MPM and those with pleural plaques (P = 0.012). A significant difference was found in the plasma osteopontin levels between patients with asbestos pleurisy and patients with pleural plaques (Bonferroni correction, P = 0.024). The SUVmax in patients with benign asbestos-related diseases was statistically positively correlated with plasma osteopontin in the same group (Spearman's r = 0.75, P < 0.05).PET/CT might be more helpful than plasma osteopontin for distinguishing benign asbestos-related pleural diseases from MPM, and the SUVmax in benign asbestos-related pleural diseases may reflect changes in pleural inflammation.
