Current status of sentinel lymph node biopsy in adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, gastric cardia, and proximal stomach. The resection of the adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction should be considered to the extent of the lymphatic drainage. This, on the other hand, depends on the possible lymphatic metastasizing. As an adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction is located along the borderline between two visceral cavities (mediastinal/abdominal), it can, in principle, metastasize in both cavities. There is not, however, an imaging (CT, MRI, PET) that can adequately assure the detection of a beginning lymph node metastasis in particular. The sentinel lymph node biopsy could provide the beginning of a solution in this case. The initial results, with all of the necessary accompanying technical work, have been encouraging. The paper presented here provides an introduction to the challenge of the SLNB and the background of a specialized surgical therapy of the AEG. If a lymph nodal metastasis can be definitely confirmed or ruled out, many patients could be spared an unnecessary lymphadenectomy. This is especially important at the AEG because minimizing the evasiveness of the surgery with adequate radical oncological resection (e.g., without thoracotomy) would mean a substantial reduction of postoperative mortality.
