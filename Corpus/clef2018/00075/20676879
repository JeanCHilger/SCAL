Multimodality therapy for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, gastric cardia, and upper gastric third. There is considerable controversy over the level of recommendations from randomized trials underpinning management decisions for patients presenting with localized adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction. Despite a paucity of Level 1 recommendations compared with other gastrointestinal sites, in particular rectal cancer, there is an emerging consensus in practice to consider multimodal approaches in all cases that present with T3 or node-positive disease. There is also an optimism that new approaches, including response prediction based on sequential 18FDG-PET scanning following induction chemotherapy, and novel drugs targeted at EGF, EGFR, VEGF, and tyrosine kinase inhibition may improve treatment pathways and outcomes. In this review, we assess the level of recommendations from the major published trials and -discuss new trials and approaches.
