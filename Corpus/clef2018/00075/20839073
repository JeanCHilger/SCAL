Image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery for locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma results of first 85 patients. Locally advanced unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma is characterized by poor survival despite chemotherapy and conventional radiation therapy (RT). Recent advances in real-time image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) have made it possible to treat these cancers in two to four fractions followed by systemic chemotherapy.The aims of this study includes the following: (1) obtain local control of the disease (2) improve the survival of these unresectable patientsPancreatic SRS involves delivery of high doses of accurately targeted radiation given non-invasively in two to four fractions. We treated 85 consecutive patients with locally advanced and recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma from February 2004 to November 2009. Age range: 36-88 years, median 66 years sex: 50 males, 35 femalesTumor control: complete, partial, and stable disease were observed in 78 patients for the duration of 3-36 months with median of 8 months. Pain relief was noted in majority of patients lasting for 18-24 weeks. Most of the patients died of distant disease progression while their primary tumor was controlled. Overall median survival from diagnosis was 18.6 months and from SRS it was 8.65 months. For the group of 35 patients with adenocarcinoma without prior surgical resection or RT and no distant metastases, the average and 1-year survival from diagnosis was 15 months and 50%, respectively, and from SRS it was 11.15 months and 30.5%, respectively.A total of 19 (22.37%) patients developed grades III/IV GI toxicity including duodenitis, 12 (14.1%) gastritis, 11 (12.9%)SRS for unresectable pancreatic carcinoma can be delivered in three fractions with minimal morbidity and a local tumor control rate of 91.7%. The survival is comparable or better than the reported results for advanced pancreatic cancer, specifically for the group of previously untreated patients with unresectable tumors. Development of distant metastases remains a significant factor.
