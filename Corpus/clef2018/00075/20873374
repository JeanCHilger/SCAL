Myocardial structural and functional changes in patients with chronic viral hepatitis concurrent with chronic opisthorchiasis. The aim of the investigation was to study the myocardium in patients with chronic viral hepatitis concurrent with chronic opisthorchiasis. Ninety patients with chronic viral hepatitis, including 52 patients with this disease concurrent with chronic opisthorchiasis, were examined. Doppler echocardiography indicated a statistically significant increase in left ventricular mass regardless of the presence of Opisthorchis infestation. Analysis of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction showed its great degree in chronic hepatitis C. Single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-pyrophosphate revealed focal tracer incorporation in the myocardium of most patients with Opisthorchis infestation. A third of patients with chronic viral hepatitis showed moderate diffuse trace accumulation that was significantly more frequently found in chronic hepatitis C. Single photon-emission tomography with labeled leukocytes demonstrated abnormal accumulation in none of the patients troponin T levels were in the normal allowable range. Myocardial lesion was detected in the chronic course of viral hepatitis C concurrent with chronic opisthorchiasis that was unattended by cardiomyocyte necrosis and that was dystrophic.
