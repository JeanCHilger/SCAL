Role of 18F-DOPA PET/CT imaging in congenital hyperinsulinism. Congenital hyperinsulinism is a leading cause of severe hypoglycaemia in the newborn period. There are two (diffuse and focal) histological subtypes of congenital hyperinsulinism. The diffuse form affects the entire pancreas and if medically unresponsive will require a near total (95%-98%) pancreatectomy. The focal form affects only a small region of the pancreas (with the rest of the pancreas being normal in endocrine and exocrine function) and only requires a limited pancreatectomy. This limited section of the focal lesion has the potential for curing the patient. Thus the pre-operative differentiation of these two subgroups is extremely important. Recent advances in Fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography ((18)F-DOPA PET/CT) have radically changed the clinical approach to patient with congenital hyperinsulinism. In most patients this novel imaging technique is able to offer precise pre-operative localisation of the focal lesion, thus guiding the extent of surgical resection.
