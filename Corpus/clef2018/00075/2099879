Leuko-araiosis--regional cerebral hemodynamics. To investigate the cerebral hemodynamics of leuko-araisosis (L-A), we made SPECT measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 31 patients with L-A. Cerebral vascular reactivity to carbon dioxide and blood pressure was studied. Changes in rCBF during sleep were also studied. SPECT measurements of rCBF were made using radioactive tracer I-123-iodoamphetamine and Tc-99m-HMPAO. Regional CBF was reduced in patients with L-A in the white matter and in the frontal and the parietal cortex. Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity was impaired in the white matter but was preserved in the frontal and parietal cortex. Cerebral blood flow autoregulation was impaired in the frontal cortex and in the parietal cortex. During sleep (stage 2-3) rCBF was reduced most markedly in the frontal and in the parietal cortex. Blood pressure was also reduced during sleep suggesting that the reduction of rCBF in L-A was partly due to dys-autoregulation.
