Stereochemically inactive lone pairs in phosphorus(III) compounds: the characterisation of some derivatives with the 2,5-(CF3)2C6H3 (Ar) substituent and their complexation behaviour towards Pt(II) species. Some new phosphorus(III) derivatives Ar(2)PX (X = Br, Cl, F or H), ArPX(2) (X = Br or Cl), Ar(3)P and Ar(t)BuPCl, with the 2,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (Ar) substituent on phosphorus, have been prepared, and characterised by (31)P and (19)F NMR solution-state spectroscopy. The complexing ability of Ar(2)PX, Ar(3)P and Ar(t)BuPCl towards the dimeric platinum(II) complexes [PtY(Î¼-Y)(PEt(3))](2) (Y = Cl or Br, the latter for X = Br only) has also been investigated. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies at low temperature have been carried out for Ar(3)P, Ar(2)PCl and the hydrolysis or oxidation products Ar(2)P(H)OH and Ar(2)P(O)OH. The structures of Ar(3)P and Ar(2)PCl are particularly interesting as in each compound the geometry around P is approximately octahedral. In Ar(3)P there are three short contacts to fluorine as well as the three bonded C atoms for both of the independent molecules in the unit cell. For Ar(2)PCl there are two short P-F contacts, and the octahedron is completed by a weak P-P interaction to a neighbouring molecule. In both instances the lone pair on the P(III) centre appears to be stereochemically inactive, and does not play a significant role in the structure.
