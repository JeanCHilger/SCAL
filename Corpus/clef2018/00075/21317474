Cerebral perfusion abnormalities in cases of Down syndrome. A SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography using Tc-99m HMPAO) study of brain with segmental quantitative analysis was conducted to access the cerebral perfusion in cases of Downs syndrome (DS). Varying level of brain hypo-perfusion was documented, probably explaining the neurophysiologic basis of cognitive and neuropsychological deficits, which are not well understood in DS.
