Quantitation of skeletal muscle necrosis using 99Tcm-pyrophosphate with SPECT in a canine model. Patients with acute arterial occlusion may suffer from significant muscle necrosis. It is important to determine the amount of regional muscle necrosis for prognostic purposes and evaluation of therapy. We have used technetium-99m-pyrophosphate (PPi) with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to quantitate muscle necrosis. A canine gracilis muscle ischaemia model was used. PPi was injected 1.5 h before the muscle preparation was removed from the dog. SPECT was performed on the muscle preparations. An automatic edge detection program using the threshold technique determined the number of pixels with significant PPi activity in each transaxial section. Volume was calculated by summing the number of pixels with significant PPi activity and multiplying by the voxel size. The results were compared with quantitation using computerized planimetry with nitroblue tetrazolium staining (correlation coefficient = 0.93). PPi with SPECT is an accurate method for quantiating muscle necrosis.
