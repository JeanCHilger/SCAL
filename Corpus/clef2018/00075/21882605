Potential of PET in the diagnosis and the assessment of treatment effectiveness in progressive malignant glioma. Examination including MRI (CT), PET with sodium 11C-butyrate (11C-SB) and 18fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) was carried out in 59 patients with continuing growth of malignant glioma. It was established that 11C-SB-PET is characterized by high sensitivity (94.1%) in detecting continuing growth as well as to differentiating it from necrosis. Our data were instrumental in prognosis and assaying metabolic levels in tumor (T/NT ratios) which are regarded as indices of accumulation (IA) of 18F-FDG-PET (FDG-IA) prior to conservative treatment. There were a direct correlation between metabolic activity of neoplasms and an inverse one with FDG-IA (r=-0.24).
