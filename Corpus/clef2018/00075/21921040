EZH2 mutational status predicts poor survival in myelofibrosis. We genotyped 370 subjects with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and 148 with postpolycythemia vera/postessential thrombocythemia (PPV/PET) MF for mutations of EZH2. Mutational status at diagnosis was correlated with hematologic parameters, clinical manifestations, and outcome. A total of 25 different EZH2 mutations were detected in 5.9% of PMF, 1.2% of PPV-MF, and 9.4% of PET-MF patients most were exonic heterozygous missense changes. EZH2 mutation coexisted with JAK2V617F or ASXL1 mutation in 12 of 29 (41.4%) and 6 of 27 (22.2%) evaluated patients
