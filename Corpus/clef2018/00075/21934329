Oral nicorandil for prevention of cardiac death in hemodialysis patients without obstructive coronary artery disease: a propensity-matched patient analysis. We examined the potential of oral administration of nicorandil for protecting against cardiac death in hemodialysis patients without obstructive coronary artery disease.This study was based on a cohort study of 155 hemodialysis patients with angiographic absence of obstructive coronary lesions, with analysis performed in 100 propensity-matched patients (54 men and 46 women, 64 ± 10 years), including 50 who received oral administration of nicorandil (15 mg/day, nicorandil group) and 50 who did not (control). The efficacy of nicorandil in preventing cardiac death was investigated.Over a mean follow-up period of 5.3 ± 1.9 years, we observed 25 cardiac deaths among 100 propensity-matched patients, including 6 due to acute myocardial infarction, 11 due to heart failure, and 8 due to sudden cardiac death. The incidence of cardiac death was lower (p < 0.001) in the nicorandil group (4/50, 8%) than in the control (21/50, 42%). On multivariate Cox hazard analysis, cardiac death was inversely associated with oral nicorandil (hazard ratio, 0.123 p = 0.0002). On Kaplan-Meier analysis, cardiac death-free survival rates at 5 years were higher in the nicorandil group than in the control group (91.4 vs. 66.4%).Oral nicorandil may inhibit cardiac death of hemodialysis patients without obstructive coronary artery disease.
