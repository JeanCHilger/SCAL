Synthesis and in vitro affinity for dopamine D-2 receptor of N-fluorine-substituted analogs of eticlopride. With the aim of developing fluorinated benzamides that may be useful as radioligands for positron emission tomography, fluorine analogs of eticlopride, in which the N-ethyl group was replaced by 2-fluoroethyl, 3-fluoropropyl and p-fluorobenzyl groups, were synthesized. These derivatives were tested for their ability to displace [3H]spiperone from its specific dopamine D-2 receptor. Their potencies were decreased when compared with eticlopride, but the two fluoroalkylated analogs were in the same order of magnitude as that of haloperidol.
