In vivo characterisation of 3-iodo-6-methoxybenzamide 123I in humans. 3-Iodo-6-methoxybenzamide (123I-IBZM), a new Dopamine D2 receptor ligand, was used in conjunction with SME 810 brain tomography to study six subjects (one normal volunteer, four schizophrenics and one DAT patient). Initial Dynamic SPET was followed by multislice SPET. High-resolution images of the D2 receptor distribution in the basal ganglia were obtained. The specific binding in D2 receptors of the basal ganglia is highest from 2-4 h p.i. Patients on anti-psychotic drugs showed significantly lower specific binding. Dopamine D2 brain receptor availability in man may now be studied with SPET. Continuous data acquisition with single slice tomography is particularly important in the study of this type of radiotracers.
