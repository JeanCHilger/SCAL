Indocyanine green fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy in dermato-oncology. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for cutaneous malignancies usually carried out with radioactive nanocolloids (Tc-99m). The SLNE is controversially discussed internationally. This is especially given to the high false-negative rate up to 44 %. An alternative could be the fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG).We investigated the advantage of intraoperative fluorescence detection of lymphatic vessels and SLN with a Near-Infrared (NIR) camera in comparison to conventional methods using preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT in 22 patients with malignant melanoma.A total of 61 SLNs were removed in 22 operative procedures. In 7 SLN (10.3 % 7/68) the histopathological assessment could demonstrate a metasta-tic involvement. 11 additional SLN (19.1 %) in 8 patients were only identified using the fluorescent labeling. Two of these additional SLN (9.1 %The ICG fluorescence-guided SLNB is an innovative imaging technique for dermato-oncology, reliable and providing additional information in the detection of SLN. Therefore SLNB with fluorescence-dye is an attractive option with intraoperative real-time lymphoscintigraphy to improve the detection of SLN in cutaneous malignancies and potential reduction of the false negative rate in SLN.
