Can scintigraphy explain prolonged postoperative neck pain? Anterior cervical fusion procedures are among the most commonly performed     spinal operations. Investigators have reported pseudoarthrosis rates ranging     from 3 to 36% following anterior cervical fusion operations. The diagnosis of     pseudoarthrosis has been based on the triad of pain, radiographic evidence of     instability, and loss of correction or fixation. Scintigraphic imaging may be     involved in pseudoarthrosis investigation by increase of nuclear agent uptake at     the operated level but today it is not used in clinical practice as a routine     imaging modality.Nine cases operated for degenerative     disc disease on single level but suffering postoperative prolonged neck pain     were involved in the study. All cases underwent 99mTc-hydroxymethylene     diphosphonate (HMDP) bone SPECT later than postoperative twelfth month.Results showed a correlation between severity of neck pain and fusion status.Increased and prolonged uptake of nuclear agent should cause a     suspicion on so-called fusion, proven by radiology.
