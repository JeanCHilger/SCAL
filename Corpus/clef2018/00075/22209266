(18)F]FLT: an imaging biomarker of tumour proliferation for assessment of tumour response to treatmen. The paradigm of drug development is shifting towards early use of imaging biomarkers as surrogate end-points in clinical trials. Quantitative Imaging in Cancer: Connecting Cellular Processes (QuIC-ConCePT) is an initiative to qualify complementary imaging biomarkers (IB) of proliferation, cell death and tumour heterogeneity as possible tools in early phase clinical trials to help pharmaceutical developers in 'go, no-go' decisions early in the process of drug development. One of the IBs is [(18)F]3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine with Positron Emission Tomography (FLT-PET). We review results of recent clinical trials using FLT-PET for monitoring tumour response to drug treatment and discuss the potential and the possible pitfalls of using this IB as a surrogate end-point in early phase clinical trials for assessing tumour response to drug treatment. From first human trial results it seems that the degree of FLT accumulation in tumours is governed not only by the tumour proliferation rate but also by other factors. Nevertheless FLT-PET could potentially be used as a negative predictor of tumour response to chemotherapy, and hence evaluation of this IB is granted in multi-centre clinical trials.
