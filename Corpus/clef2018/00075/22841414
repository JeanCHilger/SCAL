Evolution of microglial activation in ischaemic core and peri-infarct regions after stroke: a PET study with the TSPO molecular imaging biomarker [((11))C]vinpocetine. Although there is increasing evidence for microglial activation after an ischaemic stroke in the infarct core and the peri-infarct region, the "evolution" of the process in stroke patients is poorly known. Using PET and [((11))C]vinpocetine, we measured the regional changes of TSPO in the brain of nine ischaemic stroke patients up to 14weeks after the insult. Already a week after stroke there was an increased radioligand uptake, indicating the up-regulation of TSPO and the presence of activated microglia, in both the ischaemic core and the peri-infarct zone. This increased activation showed a steady decrease with post stroke time. The proportion between %SUV values in the peri-infarct zone and the ischaemic core increased with time. There were no time-dependent TSPO activity changes in other regions, not affected directly by the stroke. The present observations demonstrate that increased regional microglia activation, as a consequence of stroke, can be visualised with PET, using the TSPO molecular imaging biomarker [((11))C]vinpocetine. The evolution of this microglial activation shows a time dependent decrease the gradient of which is different between the peri-infarct zone and the ischaemic core. The findings indicate an increased microglial activation in the peri-stroke region for several weeks after the insult.
