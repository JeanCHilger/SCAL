Myocardial viability in QS region after PTCR. Myocardial viability after PTCR in patients with first anterior myocardial infarction was studied one month after the onset of acute myocardial infarction by profile curve of Tl-201 coronal myocardial SPECT images. Patients were devided into two groups according to left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), i.e. group A (EF more than 50% 11 cases , EF
