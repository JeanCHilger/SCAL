Phenotypic modulation of cell types around implanted polyethylene terephthalate fabric in rabbit muscle. Whereas the nature of healing reaction in skeletal muscle following implantation of biomaterial has been extensively studied, the extent of variation in cell phenotypes is poorly known. Here, we studied the phenotypic alteration of cell types following injury in skeletal muscle of rabbits implanted with a commonly used biomaterial, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fabric. Following implantation, histomorphological features were studied after 1, 4, and 12 weeks. Routine objective histomorphological evaluation was supplemented with histochemistry for collagen and immunohistochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), CD34, vimentin, and alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). The extent of reaction was quantified. The foreign body giant cells were found to comprise subpopulations, based on the variation in vimentin detectability or the presence of differentially capable proliferating nuclei (PCNA positive). Many rhabdomyocytes adjacent to the implant were PCNA-positive and some of them showed CD34 positivity. Often, the rhabdomyocytes very near to implanted PET fabric assumed a myofibroblast phenotype as evidenced by vimentin and/or α-SMA positivity at immunohistochemistry. Overall, the results suggested a phenotypic alteration of native cell types following implantation of PET fabric in rabbit skeletal muscle. Quantification of such cell types at the tissue-material interphase in relation to the deposition of collagen may be desirable during safety evaluation of biomaterials by histomorphology.
