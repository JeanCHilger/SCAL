A single-photon emission computed tomography study of hypoperfusion after subarachnoid hemorrhage. We used single-photon emission computed tomography with technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime in 18 studies on 13 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage to determine whether any changes in cerebral blood flow could be correlated with clinical or computed tomographic evidence of delayed ischemia. Among the seven patients without focal neurologic deficits, regional cerebral hypoperfusion was demonstrated in only one who died. Among the 10 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, one died before surgery, and six developed postoperative delayed ischemic deficits, of whom two died. Among the patients with angiographically documented aneurysms, regional hypoperfusion correlated with the presence and severity of delayed neurologic deficits, whereas correlative computed tomographic scans showed either early infarction or no relevant abnormality. This technique facilitates early diagnosis of cerebral tissue hypoperfusion due to vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
