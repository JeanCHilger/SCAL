Single-photon emission-computed tomography of the head using labelled amines in visualizing the cerebral microcirculation. The authors presented clinical material on cerebral hemodynamics in patients with neurological pathology in suspected tumor vascular cerebral diseases and craniocerebral traumas. Investigation of cerebral microcirculation was performed using a multidetector single-photon emission tomograph "Testoscan" (USSR) after iv administration of 99mTc-hexamethylpropilene-amyloxine. This radiopharmaceutical is good for the evaluation of cerebral perfusion and gives a clinician rich information on cerebral microcirculation.
