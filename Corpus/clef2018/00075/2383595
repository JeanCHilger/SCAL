Phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate is mediated principally by phospholipase D in endothelial cells. The mechanism of phosphatidylcholine (PC) degradation stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was investigated in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells prelabeled with [methyl-3H]choline ([3H]choline) or [9,10-3H]myristic acid ([3H]myristic acid). Both labels were selectively incorporated into PC, and addition of PMA stimulated comparable losses of 3H from PC in cells prelabeled with [3H]choline or [3H]myristate. In cells prelabeled with [3H]choline, the loss of 3H from PC correlated with a rapid increase in intracellular free [3H]choline. The increase in intracellular [3H]choline stimulated by PMA was not preceded by an increase in any other 3H-labeled PC degradation product. PMA did not stimulate the formation of PC deacylation products in cells prelabeled with [3H]choline. In permeabilized cells prelabeled with [3H]choline, PMA stimulated the formation of [3H]choline but not [3H]phosphocholine. In intact cells prelabeled with [3H]myristate, the loss of 3H from PC induced by PMA correlated with the formation of [3H]phosphatidic acid ([3H]PA) and [3H]diacylglycerol. In the presence of ethanol, PMA stimulated the formation of [3H]phosphatidylethanol ([3H]PEt) at the expense of [3H]PA. The time-course of [3H]PEt formation was similar to the time-course of intracellular [3H]choline formation in cells stimulated with PMA. These data taken together support the notion that PC degradation in endothelial cells stimulated with PMA is mediated principally by phospholipase D. PC breakdown via phospholipase D was not observed in cells treated with phorbol esters incapable of interacting with protein kinase C. Activation of phospholipase D by phorbol esters was inhibited by long-term pretreatment of cells with PMA to down-regulate protein kinase C and by pretreatment of the cells with staurosporine. These data support the notion that activation of phospholipase D by phorbol esters is dependent upon protein kinase C.
