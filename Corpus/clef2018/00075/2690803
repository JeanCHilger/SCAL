Technetium-99m radiocolloid scintigraphy, planar and SPECT red blood cell imaging and ultrasonography in diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma. Technetium-99m planar sulfur colloid scintigraphy, red blood cell imaging and ultrasonography were performed in eighteen patients of hepatic hemangioma to evaluate their diagnostic utility. Radiocolloid scans detected fourteen hemangiomas in 12 patients as focal hepatic defects but missed 9 lesions smaller than 2.5 cm in the other 6 patients, accounting for a 61% sensitivity. All 23 lesions were avascular or normovascular on radionuclide flow study. Serial planar red blood cell scintigraphy showed characteristic gradually increasing focal isotopic accumulation in the 14 hemangiomas which had identifiable cold areas on the radiocolloid study. One of 6 patients with normal radiocolloid scan also showed the typical increasing blood pool pattern of hemangioma, five had normal planar scans till 1 1/2 hours. SPECT red blood cell imaging in these 5 patients detected an additional seven hemangiomas. All 7 lesions were smaller than 2.5 cm. One 1.5 cm hemangioma was missed on both planar and SPECT red blood cell imaging. Region of interest ratios in SPECT transaxial images confirmed gradually increasing concentration of labeled red blood cells in the lesions. Ultrasonography detected 22 of the 23 hemangiomas. Ten were hyperechoic, average size 2.25 cm. Twelve were of mixed pattern, generally larger, average size 7.2 cm. Sonography is useful in the detection of hepatic hemangiomas as a focal mass lesion, but the variable sonographic appearance precludes a definite pathological diagnosis. Technetium-99m red blood cell imaging appears a sensitive technique in detection of hepatic hemangioma, with SPECT being especially useful in locating smaller lesions. The addition of useful in locating smaller lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
