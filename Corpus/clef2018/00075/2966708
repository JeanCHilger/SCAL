Occupational allergic contact dermatitis in beauticians. We patch tested 13 beauticians with hand dermatitis between 1982 and 1986. They were all young female novice beauticians or those in training. The onset of their allergic dermatitis was noticed within 1 month to 1 year of their starting this occupation. Definite positive reactions to products were seen from hair dyes (as is, open test) (6/12), cold permanent wave primary solutions (as is, open test) (7/13) and a shampoo (1% aq., closed test) (1/13). Positive reactions to allergens were seen with para-phenylenediamine (1% pet) (12/13), ammonium thioglycolate (5% aq., open test) (3/7), para-toluylenediamine (1% pet) (7/9), para-aminophenol (1% pet) (1/4), ortho-aminophenol (1% pet) (1/4), Quinoline yellow SS (0.5% pet) (1/4), nickel sulfate (2.5% pet) (1/12), cobalt sulfate (2.3% pet) (1/12), thimerosal (0.05% pet) (1/12) and procaine hydrochloride (1% pet) (1/12). Study of the prognosis showed that 5 out of 12 cases could continue their occupation, but 4 cases had persistent hand dermatitis despite protecting their hands from hair dyes with gloves, 7 cases quitted their jobs, and in 5 their hands healed while 2 cases continued to have atopic hand dermatitis. A personal or family history of atopy was frequent among the cases, so we recommend that those who have such a history should not become beauticians.
