Isolation of avian paramyxovirus-2 from domestic and wild birds in Costa Rica. A survey for Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in wild birds of Costa Rica was conducted by swabbing wild-caught pet birds, backyard chickens, and wild birds captured in Japanese mist nets in tropical rain forests and agricultural areas. Cloacal swabs were collected from 876 birds of approximately 132 species representing 24 taxonomic families. Hemagglutinating agents were isolated from 18.7% of the birds. Paramyxovirus type 2(PMV-2) (Yucaipa-like), unreported in free-flying passerines in the Americas, was recovered from a finch, wren, and chicken, each from a different location. Pathogenicity trials with infected turkey poults and newly hatched chicks did not result in growth impairment or significant clinical signs of disease. Attempts to isolate NDV were negative.
