Antigenic analysis of household dust samples. Household dust samples from the homes of 106 allergy clinic patients in Baltimore were analyzed for specific allergen content. Dust mite antigen content was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) specific for the major allergens of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, D. farinae, and D. microceras. Cat and dog antigen content were determined by ELISA using antisera for Fel d 1 (formerly cat allergen 1) and dog allergens 3 and 13, respectively. Mold content was assessed by culture with microscopic identification. Dust mite antigen was detected in 99% of homes (D. farinae, 95% D. pteronyssinus, 88%
