Studies on regional cerebral haematocrit and blood flow in patients with cerebral tumours using positron emission tomography. Regional cerebral haematocrit has been measured in seven patients with brain tumours, and in one normal subject, using positron emission tomography (PET). Red cell and plasma volumes of distribution were assessed using 11CO and [methyl-11C]albumin, respectively. Haematocrit values were compared with values of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measured using steady-state inhalation of C15O2. Only two of the seven cerebral tumours studied showed any increase in uptake of [methyl-11C]albumin over 45 min. Values of r, the regional ratio of cerebral small-to-large vessel haematocrit, varied from 0.52 to 0.84 for the seven tumours studied. No correlation between r and tumour blood flow was observed. The normal subject yielded an r value of 0.69 for the mean whole brain small-to-large vessel haematocrit ratio. No significant difference between gray and white matter r values was found. The contralateral hemispheres of the seven tumour patients studied yielded an overall mean r value of 0.71 +/- 0.05. We conclude that it is reasonable to assume an r value of 0.7 in tomographic calculations of regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) from red cell or plasma volumes of distribution in normal brain. Such an assumption for tumours, however, may lead to errors of 35% in estimated rCBV.
