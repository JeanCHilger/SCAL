Three-dimensional display of data obtained by single photon emission computed tomography. Three-dimensional display of radioactive distributions has been achieved using data generated by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Computer techniques for constructing images are presented and the special problems associated with manipulating SPECT data are reviewed. The potential role of three-dimensional imaging in nuclear medicine is discussed and SPECT studies from several illustrative cases are presented.
