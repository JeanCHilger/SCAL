Quantitative analysis of left-ventricular function using gated single photon emission tomography. We describe a quantitative method that measures segmental motion of the left ventricle, using tomographic slices obtained by gated single photon emission tomography (GSPECT). These slices contain the major axis of the left ventricle and are presumed to show wall motion directed towards a center of contraction. Values of parameters describing segmental wall motion in GSPECT were obtained from 61 patients, who received a left cardiac catheterization 1 hr later. These values were compared with results of similar calculations applied to data from contrast ventriculography. We conclude that GSPECT allows a detailed and quantitative, noninvasive study of wall motion of all left ventricular segments, with high inter- and intraobserver reproducibility.
