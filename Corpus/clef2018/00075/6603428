Radiofluorination with xenon difluoride: a new high yield synthesis of [18F]2-fluro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. The reaction between [18F]xenon difluoride, 3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-D-glucal and boron trifluoride in ether gives exclusively [18F )3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosyl fluoride, which is hydrolysed with 1 N HCl to [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. The overall chemical yield is 75% the radiochemical yield is 20%. The procedure takes 45 min.
