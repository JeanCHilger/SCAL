Neural correlates of mental transformations of the body-in-space. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured with positron emission tomography in human subjects during the performance of a task requiring mental rotation of their hand and a perceptually equivalent control task that did not require such a process. Comparison of the distribution of cerebral activity between these conditions demonstrated significant blood flow increases in the superior parietal cortex, the intraparietal sulcus, and the adjacent rostralmost part of the inferior parietal lobule. These findings demonstrated that, in the human brain, there is a specific system of parietal areas that are involved in mental transformations of the body-in-space.
