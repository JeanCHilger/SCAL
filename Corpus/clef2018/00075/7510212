Radioimmunodetection of prostatic cancer: in vivo 131I-gamma-seminoprotein for diagnosis of prostatic cancer by nuclear imaging. 69 patients with prostatic cancer were subjected to radioimmunodetection (RAID) with 131I-labeled antibody against gamma-seminoprotein (gamma-Sm), the images of malignant tumor sites was obtained by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with dual radionuclide and computer processing. Of the 69 patients 66 were confirmed by RAID. The ratio of tumor tissue to normal tissue (T/N) 6.9 and the best time for incaging was 96 hours after injection of anti-gamma-Sm. The diameter of the minimum tumor in RAID was 0.5 cm. metastatic prostatic cancer in the pelvis or bone location as well as the origin tumors were also detected in 13 cases. Anti-gamma-SmRAID can differentiate benign from malignant prostatic neoplasms. In 37 cases of benign prostate hyperplasia, only two were positive. The positive detective rate of B-ultrasound and CT was 70.8% and 73.1% respectively.
