Inhibition of CYP2E1 activity does not abolish pulsatile urine alcohol concentrations during chronic alcohol infusions. Continuous, long-term intragastric infusions of ethanol leads to a two-step induction of hepatic cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) that is correlated with blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) and urine alcohol concentrations (UECs). In addition, long-term and continuous ethanol infusion does not produce a steady-state BEC, but results in pulsatile BECs and UECs having peak-peak duration of approximately 6 days and ethanol concentrations ranging from near zero to over 500 mg/dl. In the present study, rats were treated with ethanol (levels reaching 13 g.kg-1.day-1) for 38 days in the presence of compounds reported to block CYP2E1 activity or expression, to study the possible involvement of CYP2E1 in the pulsatile BECs. The inhibitors used were chlormethiazole (CMZ) diallysulfide (DAS)
