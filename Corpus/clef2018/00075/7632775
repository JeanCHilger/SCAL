Tissue blood flow estimation with copper(II)-pyruvaldehyde bis (N-4-methylthiosemicarbazone) and PET. Copper (II)-pyruvaldehyde bis (N-4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (Cu-PTSM) labelled with 62Cu or 64Cu is currently under investigation as a radiotracer for imaging the distribution of blood flow with positron emission tomography (PET). The application of a simple trapped tracer model in conjunction with tissue uptake and continuous arterial sampling to estimate blood flow has been compared with the 57Co-microsphere method in the rat. After intraventricular injection the cumulative arterial function for 64Cu increased progressively due to the presence of circulating non lipophilic complexes. The cumulative function for lipophilic 64Cu-PTSM extracted in n-octanol plateaued at levels corresponding to those reached by 57Co-microspheres. No consistent disagreement was found between cardiac output and blood flow estimated by 64Cu-PTSM and 57Co-microspheres in low to moderate flow tissues: muscle (0.08, 0.07 mL/min/g 64Cu mean, 57Co mean), brain (0.52, 0.43 mL/min/g) and kidney (2.29, 2.45 mL/min/g). However, 64Cu-PTSM underestimated blood flow measured by 57Co-microspheres in myocardium (4.09, 6.55 mL/min/g). A simple tissue trapping model may therefore be suitable for the derivation of blood flow estimates in low to moderate flow tissues using 62,64Cu-PTSM, PET imaging and continuous arterial sampling with n-octanol extraction.
