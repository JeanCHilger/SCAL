Myocardial glucose uptake evaluated by positron emission tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose during hyperglycemic clamp in IDDM patients. Role of free fatty acid and insulin levels. Myocardial and whole-body glucose metabolism was assessed in 19 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients. A hyperglycemic clamp was performed 1) in the absence of insulin at free fatty acid (FFA) levels of 1.0 mmol/l (test 1) 2) in the absence of insulin at low FFA levels (0.1 mmol/l) by means of a lipid-lowering drug, acipimox (test 2)
