Risk of feline infectious peritonitis in cats naturally infected with feline coronavirus. A longitudinal survey of 820 cats in 73 households was conducted over a period of 6 years to establish the fate of pet cats that were seropositive after natural exposure to feline coronavirus (FCoV). In particular, their risk of developing feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) was determined. The seropositive cats were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: cats from households in which FIP had recently been diagnosed cats from households in which FIP had not been diagnosed, but from which kittens had been relocated and subsequently died of FIP
