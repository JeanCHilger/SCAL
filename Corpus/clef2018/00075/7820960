Effects of CDP-choline on dynamic changes in LCBF and cognitive function in demented subjects--an H2 15O-PET study. We studied correlations of serial changes in local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) after single intravenous (i.v.) injection of cytidine diphosphate choline (CDP-choline) to changes in cognitive function in demented subjects after its daily administration for one week. The study group consisted of 7 patients with dementia of vascular origin (VD group mean age 65.0 years) and 3 patients with dementia of non-vascular origin (non-VD group
