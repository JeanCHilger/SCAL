Incorporation and clinical results of large allografts of the extremities and pelvis. The results of implantation of 37 large deep-frozen allografts with 29 osteoarticular grafts of the extremities and pelvis following the resection of malignant or aggressive benign bone tumors were evaluated at followup (mean, 6 years range, 2.5-20 years). The patients had excellent or good results in 62% of all cases according to the Mankin-Waber functional rating score, and a corresponding rating of 81% in the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Score. Benign versus malignant disease rated 83% and 76%, respectively, in the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Score, and 67% and 46%, respectively, in the Mankin-Waber score. Radiological and nuclear medicine (single-photon emission computed tomography) studies and histological biopsies indicated that the incorporation, perfusion, and replacement with new bone was only partial and of a low degree. Late degenerative cartilage and sclerotic changes occurred in 20 of 29 cases with osteoarticular grafts. The best functional results were achieved with knee osteoarticular allografts (81%-88%) compared with modest results in the proximal humerus (69%) and hemipelvis (57%) according to the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Score rating. Chemotherapy did not influence the union or infection rate of the allografts. In the 4 cases (11%) with infection, all grafts could be salvaged, but the functional results were only 63% in the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Score. The overall complication rate was high (57%)
