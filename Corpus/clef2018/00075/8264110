Characteristics of 201Tl myocardial SPECT and left ventriculography in patients with acute diagonal branch myocardial infarction. Characteristics of 201Tl myocardial SPECT and ventriculography were studied in 13 patients with acute diagonal branch myocardial infarction. Rest 201Tl myocardial SPECT and left ventriculography were underwent in chronic phase. In 5 patients ECG changes in acute phase were not definite. In 6 patients it was difficult to identify the obstructed coronary artery with coronary angiography in acute phase. Mean value of maximum CPK was 854 (458-1,774) U/l. It seemed to be difficult to diagnose acute diagonal branch myocardial infarction with ECG and/or coronary angiography. In all patients defects were noted on 201Tl SPECT. Defects were small and noted in the central anterior wall and not in the septum. In 2 patients defects were noted at apex. In left ventriculography dyskinetic motion was noted in 10 patients one patient showed apical aneurysm and 3 patients showed anterior wall aneurysm. In 3 patients anterior wall showed akinesis. It was concluded that 201Tl myocardial SPECT were useful for detecting diagonal branch lesion. In case of diagonal branch myocardial infarction size of defects were small and defects were not noted in the septum, however aneurysmal motion was frequently noted.
