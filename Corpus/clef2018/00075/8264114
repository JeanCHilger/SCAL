Usefulness of myocardial imaging by 123I-MIBG in assessment of diabetic neuropathy. In diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy, it is suggested that there is a reduced uptake of 123I-MIBG in the heart. We compared the difference of myocardial 123I-MIBG accumulation between 4 diabetic patients with triopathy and 6 patients without it. In all 10 patients, coronary angiography and 201Tl imaging (rest and 4 hours later) were performed. 123I-MIBG (111 MBq) was administered intravenously and its imaging was recorded on 15 minutes and 4 hours after injection. In all 4 cases with triopathy, 123I-MIBG imaging showed defect in apical and inferior region. In 2 out of 6 cases without triopathy, rapid clearance was noticed in apical and inferior region. There was no significant stenosis in right coronary artery and no defect in initial and delayed 201Tl images in all cases. We concluded that diabetic autonomic neuropathy in the heart was prominent in apical and inferior region and 123I-MIBG imaging might be useful for the evaluation of degrees in diabetic neuropathy.
