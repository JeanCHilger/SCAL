A preliminary study of cortical S2 serotonin receptors and cognitive performance following stroke. Cortical serotonin receptor binding was measured with positron-emission tomography (PET) in uninjured regions of cortex in 26 stroke patients. Cognitive function was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and a neuropsychological test battery. Left frontal cortex serotonin binding was correlated positively with MMSE total score (r = 0.50, P = 0.01) and with the MMSE concentration, writing, and copying tasks (r = 0.42, 0.56, 0.53, respectively P < 0.05). Tests of orientation and repetition of difficult phrases were significantly correlated with serotonin binding (r = 0.53 and 0.52, respectively
