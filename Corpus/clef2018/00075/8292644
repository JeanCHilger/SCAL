Increased single-photon emission computed tomography image processing speed achieved in personal computers with memory-intensive algorithms. Recent dramatic reductions in the cost of computer random access memory (RAM) and the ability of newer microprocessors and associated personal computer operating systems to address large amounts of memory make novel strategies for high-speed image processing possible. We developed image processing algorithms that use this newly available memory to achieve increases in effective processing speed. These algorithms rely on the use of precomputed lookup tables to avoid repeated use of relatively expensive machine instructions, such as multiplications and divisions. Programs using this strategy to perform single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) analysis were written in C and assembly language and tested on a Macintosh Quadra 950 (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA) having 64 megabytes of RAM. The measured processing times are competitive with most dedicated nuclear medicine computers. A general implementation of such programs will allow personal computers to compete with dedicated imaging systems, at a substantial reduction in cost.
