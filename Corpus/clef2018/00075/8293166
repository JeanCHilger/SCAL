Improving imaging contributions to trauma and tumor management. The assessment of patients with injuries and tumors is a major proportion of a neuroradiologist's workload. Reviewing advances in these important topics together in such a short space is a challenge--perhaps even inappropriate. Exciting data emerging from Doppler and xenon computed tomography on head injury, and magnetic resonance gives new insights into spinal trauma, with significant implications for management. Magnetic resonance protagonists pursue their goal of proving greater specificity and sensitivity of diagnosis than computed tomography, with some justification in the case of benign extra-axial tumors. In malignant tumors, data from positron emission tomography emphasize the difficulties of defining tumor extent and hence assessing, let alone achieving, cure.
