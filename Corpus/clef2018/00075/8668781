Prospective localization of epileptogenic foci: comparison of PET and SPECT with site of surgery and clinical outcome. To correlate prospective imaging findings in patients with intractable partial epilepsy with site of surgery and clinical outcome.Thirty-five patients (25 male, 10 female) underwent positron emission tomography (PET n=25), interictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECTSensitivity was 60%, 61%, and 52% positive predictive value was 83%, 71%, and 55%Postictal SPECT has low sensitivity and a high incorrect localization rate and should not be performed in these patients. Interictal SPECT with 6-8-mm full-width at half-maximum is an alternative to PET. However, the trend toward higher false-localization rates must be taken into consideration.
