Parameters influencing volume and activity quantitation in SPECT. Several factors influence the accuracy to which information on the in vivo activity concentration can be obtained from SPECT images. The accuracy in image contrast and the quantitation of volume and activity has here been examined for a SPECT system aimed for absorbed dose determinations in systemic radiation therapy. The influence of source dimensions, object contrast, noise level, energy window width and the reconstruction filter was examined. All the investigated parameters affected the recoveries. Volumes of above 20 cm3 could be quantified to within +/- 20%, for object contrasts of above 96%, and within +/- 40% for object contrasts above 81%, providing limited levels of noise. Both the image contrast and the volume quantification is expected to be improved in situations with low object contrasts, if accurate correction for scattered photons can be developed. Obtained limitations in the quantitation of activity with the present method should be reduced by development of a more accurate background subtraction technique.
