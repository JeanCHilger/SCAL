Safety and effectiveness of exercise training in patients with silent myocardial ischemia. The effectiveness of exercise training in patients with silent myocardial ischemia was examined. Forty patients with coronary heart disease (mean age 55 +/- 8 years) were recruited for a 12-week exercise training program. All patients underwent treadmill exercise stress testing, exercise thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography and left heart catheterization. They were divided into three groups based on the symptoms and the results of exercise thallium scintigraphy, i.e., painful myocardial ischemia (PMI group), silent myocardial ischemia (SMI group), and non-myocardial ischemia (NMI group). Normalized treadmill time was longer in the SMI group (108 +/- 24%) than in the PMI group (86 +/- 14%, p < 0.05). All 40 patients, 14 from the PMI group, 16 from the SMI group and 10 from the NMI group, completed the whole exercise training program. A significant prolongation of treadmill time was attained in all three groups after exercise training [PMI group: from 494 +/- 105 to 632 +/- 78 sec (p < 0.05), SMI group: from 609 +/- 147 to 746 +/- 137 sec (p < 0.05), NMI group: from 572 +/- 112 to 739 +/- 13 sec (p < 0.05)]. The improvement of myocardial ischemia following exercise training was similar in the SMI and PMI groups. No adverse effects were detected throughout the program. The exercise training program adopted in this study proved safe and effective in patients with silent myocardial ischemia.
