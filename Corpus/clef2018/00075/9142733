Use of iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial imaging to predict the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. It is crucial to predict drug effectiveness in chronic disease, such as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), in which the left ventricular (LV) function might be improved by beta-blocker therapy. As the functional improvement effected by beta-blocker therapy takes more than 2 months, we investigated whether iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) imaging could be used to predict drug effectiveness. We studied 13 patients (11 men and two women mean age, 43+/-13 years) with DCM and seven normal subjects (six men and one woman
