Coronary vasomotion in patients with syndrome X: evaluation with positron emission tomography and parametric myocardial perfusion imaging. The aim of this study was to elucidate further the causative mechanism of abnormal coronary vasomotion in patients with syndrome X. In patients with syndrome X, defined as angina pectoris and documented myocardial ischaemia during stress testing with normal findings at coronary angiography, abnormal coronary vasomotion of either the micro- or the macrocirculation has been suggested as the causative mechanism. Accordingly, we evaluated endothelial function, vasodilator reserve, and perfusion heterogeneity in these patients. Twenty-five patients with syndrome X (definitely normal coronary arteriogram, group A), 15 patients with minimal coronary artery disease (group B) and 21 healthy volunteers underwent [13N]ammonia positron emission tomography at rest, during cold pressor stimulation (endothelial function) and during dipyridamole stress testing (vasodilator reserve). Heterogeneity of myocardial perfusion was analysed by parametric polar mapping using a 480-segment model. In both patient groups, resting perfusion was increased compared to the normal subjects: group A, 127+/-31 ml.min-1.100 g-1 group B, 124+/-30 ml.min-1.100 g-1 normal subjects, 105+/-21 ml.min-1.100 g-1 (groups A and B vs normals, P<0.05). These differences were abolished after correction for rate-pressure product. During cold pressor stimulation, the perfusion responses (ratio of cold pressor perfusion to resting perfusion) were similar among the patients and the control subjects (group A, 1.20+/-0.23
