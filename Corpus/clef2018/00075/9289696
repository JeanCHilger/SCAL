Age dependence of cerebral Tc-99m-ECD distribution between preschool and school-age children and adults. This present study deals with the question whether normal distribution of local cerebral blood flow (ICBF) agents in adults can be transferred to the age group of 4 to 15 years old children.23 children (age: 4-15 years, mean 11 +/- 3 y) (group I) and 10 adults (age: 27-56 years, mean 45 +/- 10 y) (group II) without evidence of cerebrovascular disease or other brain diseases underwent Tc-99m-ECD-SPECT imaging. Counts in the cortical ROIs were related to those of cerebellar ROIs (= 100%).In group I, relative cortical activity exceeded that of group II, particularly in parietal (107.6 +/- 9.8 vs. 84.1 +/- 12.4%), frontal (97.7 +/- 6.7 vs. 79.4 +/- 8.9%), left temporal areas (99.7 +/- 7.4 vs. 84.9 +/- 10.1%) and in the singular cortex (112.1 +/- 9.1 vs. 95.9 +/- 10.1%, p < 0.05). Cerebral activity uptake/injected dose/acquisition period was linearly correlated with age in group I (r = -0.78, p < 0.001). There was also a correlation of the relative local count density with age in 5 parietal ROIs (r = -0.42 to -0.57), in 2 frontal ROIs (r = -0.48), in 7 temporal ROIs (r = -0.42 to -0.58) and in 2 occipital ROIs (r = -0.44). In 14 cortical regions relative counts differed when subgroups of children aged 4-10 and 11-15 years were analysed.There are systematic differences between 4 to 15 years old children and adults regarding the normal distribution of ICBF. Diagnostic use of perfusion agents has to consider the respective age-adjusted normal flow maps respective normal ranges should be determined for age groups of 4-10 and of 11-15 years separately.
