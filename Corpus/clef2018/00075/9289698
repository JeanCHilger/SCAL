18Fluoro-FDG SPECT for the demonstration of hibernating myocardium: an interim account. The present investigation demonstrates an intraindividual comparison of FDG-PET and FDG-SPECT.Thirty patients with CHD and planed revascularisation underwent both modalities. Myocardial perfusion was evaluated by 99mTc-MIBI SPECT. The myocardium was divided into 25 segments and the results were compared by two experienced observers.Segmental concordance of FDG-PET and -SPECT was 94.1%. PET indicated a higher percentage of hibernating myocardium (8.9% vs. 5.7%) and a lower rate of matched defects (11.5% vs. 16.0%). In 22 cases the need for revascularisation was assessed identically. In the remaining 8 patients FDG-PET and FDG-SPECT required an intervention in 6 and 2 cases, respectively.The results of FDG-PET and FDG-SPECT showed a high segmental concordance, but the individual assessment of hibernation worthwhile for revascularisation demonstrated important differences in patient management.
