Echocardiography or stress scintigraphy with dipyridamole for the stratification of risk after acute myocardial infarction?. Increased risk of subsequent cardiac events after an acute infarction can be identified through dipyridamole infusion. It remains to be determined whether echocardiographic or scintigraphic imaging modes are equivalent. The aim of our study was to compare the prognostic information obtained early after an acute uncomplicated myocardial infarction through high-dose dipyridamole coupled with echocardiography or scintigraphy via Tc 99m sestamibi SPECT imaging.Fifty-one patients underwent simultaneous dipyridamole stress echocardiography and scintigraphy at a mean +/- SD of 12 +/- 3 days after admission for acute uncomplicated myocardial infarction. A subgroup of 44 patients performed exercise testing according to maximal symptom limited protocol. All patients were followed prospectively for 346 +/- 273 days (range 11-959). Cardiac events occurred in 20 patients (39%), and 1 death, 2 myocardial reinfarctions and 17 cases of unstable angina were recorded. Univariate predictors of cardiac events were: positive dipyridamole echo (p < 0.001), ischemia in the infarct zone or in remote zones by echo (p < 0.001), ejection fraction < 40% (p = 0.042) and positive exercise testing (p = 0.003). Risk was best predicted by multivariate Cox analysis on the basis of 1) ischemia in remote zones by dipyridamole echo (p < 0.001) and 2) ischemia in the infarct zone by dipyridamole echo (p = 0.003), blood pressure at peak exercise < 150 mmHg (p = 0.010) and non-Q wave infarction (p = 0.003).Echocardiographic imaging during dipyridamole infusion is superior to sestamibi scintigraphy for predicting events after uncomplicated myocardial infarction.
