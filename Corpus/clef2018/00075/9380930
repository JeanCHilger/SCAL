Clinical usefulness of positron emission tomography (PET) in the evaluation of myocardial viability. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a radionuclide imaging technique that allows quantitative assessment of regional myocardial function. It is mainly used in clinics to assess viability of dissynergic myocardium, by means of combined images of flow (with ammonia) and metabolism (with fluordeoxyglucose). The mismatch pattern, with an increase in fluordeoxyglucose metabolism in hypoperfused regions, is indicative of viability. The match pattern (a decrease in flow and metabolism in the same areas) is indicative of necrosis. Viability can also be assessed with water or fluordeoxyglucose independently quantified. Other promising methods are based in the study of oxygen consumption with 11C acetate and the study of hypoxia with 18F-misonidazole.
