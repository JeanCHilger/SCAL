Effect of acupuncture on regional cerebral blood flow and cerebral functional activity evaluated with single-photon emission computed tomography. Observation on effect of acupuncture on regional cerebral blood flow (RCBF) and cerebral functional activity was conducted in 11 healthy volanteers and 9 patients with cerebral vascular disease by using single-photon emission computed tomography. Results showed a significant difference in effect of needle retention and electro-acupuncture stimulation on contralateral cerebral hemisphere cortex and thalamus, ipsilateral basal ganglion and bilateral cerebella, the change on cerebral blood flow induced by electroacupuncture was greater than that induced by the former method. It is speculated that the improvement of cerebral blood supply and stimulation of functional activity of brain nerve cells induced by acupuncture on point of extremities depend on the regulatory function of central nerve system. Stimulations were transmitted in mainly through specific and non-specific sensory afferent systems, also the involvement of extrapyramidal system and cerebellum. Patients with cerebral vascular diseases are more sensitive to electro-acupuncture than healthy subjects.
