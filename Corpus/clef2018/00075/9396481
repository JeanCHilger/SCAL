New look to an old symptom: angina pectoris. At the turn of this century, it was proposed that ischemic cardiac pain might be related to distension of the ventricular wall ("mechanical hypothesis"). Three decades later, it was hypothesized that ischemic pain might be elicited by the intramyocardial release of pain-producing substances induced by ischemia ("chemical hypothesis"). Studies carried out in the past 10 years have given strong support to the chemical hypothesis, because they have consistently shown that adenosine is a mediator of ischemic cardiac pain. Adenosine-induced ischemic cardiac pain is mediated primarily by stimulation of A1 receptors located in cardiac nerve endings and is potentiated by substance P. Conversely, the magnitude and rate of left ventricular dilation during ischemia do not predict the severity of angina. It is worth noting, however, that stretching of epicardial coronary arteries appears to potentiate the severity of angina caused by myocardial ischemia. The nervous activity generated by myocardial ischemia is modulated in intrinsic cardiac, mediastinal, and thoracic ganglia. Then it is further modulated in the central nervous system and projects bilaterally to the cortex, as demonstrated in humans by positron emission tomography, where it is decoded as a painful sensation. The causes responsible for the lack of angina during myocardial ischemia are probably different in patients who present both pain-free and painful myocardial ischemia, in patients with predominantly painless ischemia, and in diabetic patients.
