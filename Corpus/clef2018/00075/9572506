Iterative and analytical reconstruction algorithms for varying-focal-length cone-beam projections. In single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), a varying-focal-length cone-beam collimator can be used to reduce the truncation problem and to maintain sensitivity when imaging the organ of interest. The collimator is constructed so that the collimator holes focus to a circular symmetric, spatially varying, focal point function. The focal length increases radially from the shortest focal length at the centre to the longest focal length at the periphery of the collimator. This paper describes a 3D backprojection-filtering (BF) algorithm for this varying-focal-length cone-beam geometry. The proposed algorithm is compared to an iterative ML-EM (maximum likelihood-expectation maximization) algorithm. The 3D Hoffman brain phantom and Defrise phantom are used in computer simulations. Since the maximum tilt angle of the projection rays is small for most realistic imaging geometries, the proposed algorithm provides a good approximation. When a circular orbit is used, the BF algorithm gives an exact reconstruction of the central slice.
