Fast accurate iterative reconstruction for low-statistics positron volume imaging. A fast accurate iterative reconstruction (FAIR) method suitable for low-statistics positron volume imaging has been developed. The method, based on the expectation maximization-maximum likelihood (EM-ML) technique, operates on list-mode data rather than histogrammed projection data and can, in just one pass through the data, generate images with the same characteristics as several ML iterations. Use of list-mode data preserves maximum sampling accuracy and implicitly ignores lines of response (LORs) in which no counts were recorded. The method is particularly suited to systems where sampling accuracy can be lost by histogramming events into coarse LOR bins, and also to sparse data situations such as fast whole-body and dynamic imaging where sampling accuracy may be compromised by storage requirements and where reconstruction time can be wasted by including LORs with no counts. The technique can be accelerated by operating on subsets of list-mode data which also allows scope for simultaneous data acquisition and iterative reconstruction. The method is compared with a standard implementation of the EM-ML technique and is shown to offer improved resolution, contrast and noise properties as a direct result of using improved spatial sampling, limited only by hardware specifications.
