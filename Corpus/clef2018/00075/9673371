A simple and semi-automated system for increasing the recovery of aqueous [18F] fluoride from target. A simple semi-automated apparatus is described for rinsing the transport line from the [18F] fluoride. target to the hot-cell after recovery of aqueous [18F] fluoride. The additional activity thus recovered can then be added to that previously trapped on Dowex 1X8 (CO3=) or, alternatively, diverted to a second vial for other uses such as research, PET-camera calibration or bone investigations by PET. Inclusion of the target chamber in the rinsing procedure increased the additional recovery of activity up to ca. 15%, without a noticeable effect on the isotopic integrity of the recovered [18O]H2O.
