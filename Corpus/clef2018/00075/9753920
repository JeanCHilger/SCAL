Usefulness of 123I-MIBG scintigraphy for prediction of effect of beta-blocker therapy in dilated cardiomyopathy. To determine whether 123I-MIBG (MIBG) scintigraphy is useful for predicting the effect of beta-blocker therapy in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), we studied MIBG scintigraphy in 11 controls and 9 patients with DCM before starting beta-blocker therapy. First, initial and delayed heart-to-mediastinum ratios (H/M ratio) of MIBG activity in patients with DCM were significantly lower than those in 11 controls, respectively (initial H/M 1.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.3, p < 0.02, delayed H/M
