Assessment of enlarged left atrium with 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT and echocardiography. This study was performed to clarify the possibility of visualization and quantification with 99mTc-tetrofosmin (Tf) myocardial scintigraphy in cases with a large atrium demonstrated by trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE). Myocardial SPECT was evaluated in 4 patients with mitral stenosis and 15 patients with mitral regurgitation. Left atrium was identified in 12 out of 19 cases from an antero-posterior projection. The Tf uptake ratio of the left atrium, which was defined as the ratio of ROI count of the left atrium divided by the ROI count of the left ventricle, showed a good correlation with the left atrial area obtained by both trans-thoracic and trans-esophageal echocardiography (r = 0.88 and 0.91, respectively), These data suggest that Tf myocardial SPECT is a useful method of evaluating left atrial enlargement.
