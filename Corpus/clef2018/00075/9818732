Role of the cingulate gyrus during the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test: a single photon emission computed tomography study in normal volunteers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) on frontal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in normal subjects, separating the cingulate gyrus from the prefrontal cortex. Two technetium-99m-hexamethyl-propylene-amine-oxime brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans, at rest and during WCST performance, were performed in randomized order on 13 right-handed normal volunteers. A statistically significant rCBF increase was found in the left inferior cingulate and the left posterior frontal region, although rCBF ratios in the left and right prefrontal cortex, and in the right inferior cingulate, were slightly higher during WCST performance in nine of the 13 subjects studied. No differences in activation scores (activated-resting rCBF ratios) were found between subjects who had the resting SPECT first and subjects who had the resting condition second. These results suggest that the inferior cingulate cortex, a limbic region that has been implicated in attentional mechanisms, plays a significant role in WCST performance. Furthermore, the motor component of the WCST may account for the activation of the left posterior frontal region. In addition, no order effect was found in this study. These findings illustrate the advantage of independently evaluating the cingulate gyrus and the prefrontal cortex in SPECT studies of frontal cognitive function.
