Simultaneous assessment of right ventricular function and hypertrophy by Tc-99m MIBI. Tc-99m MIBI allows the simultaneous performance of cardiac blood pool scintigraphy and myocardial SPECT. The authors performed studies to determine whether right ventricular function and hypertrophy can be evaluated simultaneously using Tc-99m MIBI in patients with right heart disease.Using right heart catheterization, several parameters of pulmonary circulation were measured, including right ventricular ejection fraction, in 23 patients with chronic pulmonary disease and pulmonary vascular disease. Within 1 week, right heart blood pool scintigraphy was performed using the first-pass method using Tc-99m MIBI. The right ventricular ejection fraction calculated from right heart blood pool scintigraphy was compared with that measured using right heart catheterization. Myocardial SPECT was performed 1 hour after right heart blood pool scintigraphy. On the short axis images, which allowed optimal visualization of the right ventricle, the right and left ventricular free walls were established as regions of interest. Myocardial wall counts were determined. The right ventricular uptake: left ventricular uptake ratio was calculated to study the relation of that ratio to mean pulmonary artery pressure and total pulmonary resistance.A significant correlation was observed between the right ventricular ejection fraction calculated on right heart catheterization and that calculated on right heart blood pool scintigraphy. The right ventricular uptake:left ventricular uptake ratio correlated positively with pulmonary artery pressure and total pulmonary resistance.These results suggest that Tc-99m MIBI allows simultaneous noninvasive evaluation of cardiac function and structure, which previously was considered impossible in patients with right heart disease.
