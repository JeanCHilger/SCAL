Use of single photon emission computed tomography in aerosol studies. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has distinct advantages over the conventional planar imaging technique in generating more information about radionuclide distribution within the body.  The general application of SPECT in lung studies has been extensive, but its specific use in aerosol research is still uncommon.  This review focuses on the applications, the advantages and limitations, and the potential of quantification of SPECT in aerosol studies.
