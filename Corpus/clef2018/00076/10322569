Practical aspects of radiation safety for using fluorine-18. The use of positron-emitting nuclides is becoming routine in nuclear medicine departments today. Introducing these nuclides into the nuclear medicine department can be a smooth transition by instituting educational lectures, radiation safety protocols and patient education. The radiation safety concerns of the technical staff, physicians and ancillary personnel are important and must be addressed. Nuclear medicine departments can be optimistic about implementing PET imaging while staying well within ALARA guidelines. After reading this article, the technologist should be able to: (a) describe at least three ways to reduce the radiation dose to the technologist during the performance of PET imaging procedures with 18F (b) discuss the relationships between gamma-ray energy, the amount of activity administered to a patient, exposure time and occupational dose
