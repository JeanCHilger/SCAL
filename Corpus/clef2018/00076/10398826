Radionuclides and radiopharmaceuticals for single-photon emission tomography, positron emission tomography and radiotherapy in Russia. The current status of the manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic and therapeutic application in Russia is discussed, consideration being given to various aspects of the production and distribution of radionuclides, radioisotope generators and kits as well as individual radiopharmaceuticals in different regions of the country. The major focus is on the recent developments in production technologies for therapeutic and single-photon emission tomography radionuclides, technetium chemistry and synthetic approaches for the labelling of compounds with short-lived positron emitters. The status of positron emission tomography and its application are considered. The major factors restricting the expansion of nuclear imaging techniques and radiotherapy in Russia are also discussed.
