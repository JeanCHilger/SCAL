In vitro evaluation of aromatase enzyme in granulosa cells using a [11C]vorozole binding assay. An in vitro method for measuring aromatase cytochrome P450 enzyme (P450AROM) in human granulosa cells (GC) has been developed, based on binding of the 11C-labeled aromatase inhibitor vorozole. GC were obtained following superstimulation during in vitro fertilisation. The method revealed a binding affinity (Kd) of 0.4 nM and a maximum binding (Bmax) at 11 fmol/4000 cells which is equal to 1.6 million binding sites per cell. Linear Scatchard plots indicated a single type of binding site. P450AROM concentrations measured by [11C]vorozole binding correlated positively with aromatisation of [1beta-3H]androst-4-ene-3,17-dione measured as [3H]water release, and a positive association was also found with the ovarian in vivo response to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation expressed as 1000 times the ratio of the number of oocytes recovered from a patient and the total dose of recombinant FSH administered. Frozen cells could be used for P450AROM quantitation, provided the correct freezing procedure was used. Quantitation of P450AROM, based on binding of [11C]vorozole is an accurate and sensitive in vitro method, which might be extended to the measurement of aromatase expression by a noninvasive technique in the intact ovary in vivo using positron emission tomography.
