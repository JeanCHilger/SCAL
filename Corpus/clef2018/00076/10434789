Diagnosis and growth evaluation of vestibular schwannomas by SPECT combined with TL-201 thallium. The value of SPECT scanning in diagnosis and growth potential of vestibular schwannoma (VS) was investigated in a series of 29 patients. SPECT demonstrated all tumours > 0.8 cm3, but had limitations as a diagnostic modality of small intracanalicular tumours, when compared to gadolinium DTPA enhanced MR. SPECT was found to be valuable in determining VS growth potential as it reflects tumour vascularity, which is essential for tumour growth. A high radioactive tracer uptake in the tumour corresponded to high tumour vascularity, indicating a high growth rate and vice versa. It seems that we now have an in vivo functional radiological modality capable of providing data on VS vascularity and determination of growth potential in the individual tumour.
