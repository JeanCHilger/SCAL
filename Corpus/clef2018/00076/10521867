Evaluating the exposure and disease relationship with adjustment for different types of exposure misclassification: a regression approach. Misclassification of exposure can lead to biased results in the epidemiologic research. Available methods accounting for misclassification often require the use of a gold standard or assume non-differential misclassification of exposure. We present a regression approach which can detect and account for different types of misclassification when estimating the exposure and disease relationship. This approach uses two imperfect measures of a dichotomous exposure and does not require a gold standard. Standard statistical packages with a logistic regression module can be used for estimation of parameters through the EM algorithm process. Two examples are used to illustrate the methodology.
