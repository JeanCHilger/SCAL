alpha-adrenergic coronary vasoconstriction and myocardial ischemia in humans. The use of quantitative coronary angiography, combined with Doppler and PET, has recently been directed at the study of alpha-adrenergic coronary vasomotion in humans. Confirming prior animal experiments, there is no evidence of alpha-adrenergic coronary constrictor tone at rest. Again confirming prior experiments, responses to alpha-adrenoceptor activation are augmented in the presence of coronary endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, involving both alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in epicardial conduit arteries and microvessels. Such augmented alpha-adrenergic coronary constriction is observed during exercise and coronary interventions, and it is powerful enough to induce myocardial ischemia and limit myocardial function. Recent studies indicate a genetic determination of alpha(2)-adrenergic coronary constriction.
