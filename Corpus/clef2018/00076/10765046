A single-photon emission computed tomography imaging study of driving impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was used in this study to examine the neurophysiologic basis of driving impairment in 79 subjects with dementia. Driving impairment, as measured by caregiver ratings, was significantly related to regional reduction of right hemisphere cortical perfusion on SPECT, particularly in the temporo-occipital area. With increased severity of driving impairment, frontal cortical perfusion was also reduced. Clock drawing was more significantly related to driving impairment than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Driving impairment in Alzheimer's disease is related to changes in cortical function which vary according to the severity of the disease. Cognitive tests of visuoperceptual and executive functions may be more useful screening tools for identifying those at greatest risk for driving problems than examinations like the MMSE that are weighted toward left-hemisphere-based verbal tasks.
