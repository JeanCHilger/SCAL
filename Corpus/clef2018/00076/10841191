Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of brain tumors. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides metabolic information about brain tumors beyond what can be obtained from anatomic images. In contrast to other metabolism-based imaging techniques such as single photon emission computed tomography and positron-emission tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy yields multiparametric data, does not require radio-labeled tracers or ionizing radiation, and can be performed in conjunction with other magnetic resonance imaging studies. Magnetic resonance spectral patterns have been shown to be distinct for different tumor types and grades. Response to radiation therapy is also reflected by magnetic resonance spectral patterns. Although there are quantitative issues still to be addressed, correlation of in vivo spectral patterns with ex vivo spectral patterns obtained from actual biopsy samples indicates that magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a fundamentally valid tool for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic response in patients with brain tumors.
