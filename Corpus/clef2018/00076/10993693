Tremor is associated with PET measures of nigrostriatal dopamine function in MPTP-lesioned monkeys. Unilateral intracarotid artery (ICA) MPTP infusion, along with sequential systemic doses of MPTP, produces near complete degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway on the side of infusion (ipsilateral) and variable levels of damage in the contralateral hemisphere accompanied by varying levels of parkinsonism (overlesioned hemiparkinsonian model). Positron emission tomography and the dopamine (DA) metabolism tracer [(18)F]6-fluoro-l-m-tyrosine (FMT) were used to evaluate the relationship between DA metabolism and clinical features of parkinsonism in 14 overlesioned hemiparkinsonian monkeys. Monkeys were rated on a parkinsonian scale that included ratings of bradykinesia, fine motor skills (FMS), and rest tremor. Because the monkeys tended to show more severe clinical signs on the side of the body contralateral to ICA MPTP infusion, we calculated asymmetry scores for each of the clinical features as well as for FMT uptake (K(i)) in the caudate and putamen. Tremor asymmetry was associated with FMT uptake asymmetry in the putamen. No such relationship was observed for FMS or bradykinesia. The overall severity of tremor (mild, moderate/severe) was associated with FMT uptake in the caudate and putamen. Postmortem biochemical analysis for a subset of monkeys showed that the monkeys with moderate/severe tremor had significantly lower DA levels in both caudate and putamen than those with mild tremor. In addition, K(i) values were significantly correlated with DA levels in both caudate and putamen. These findings support the idea that nigrostriatal degeneration contributes to rest tremor.
