Effect of estrogen on cerebral glucose metabolism in postmenopausal women. PET was used to evaluate the effect of estrogen use on regional cerebral glucose metabolism in postmenopausal women. Women receiving estrogen replacement therapy (ERT+), women not receiving estrogen (ERT-), and women with AD were studied. The ERT- group showed metabolic ratios that were intermediate to the ERT+ and AD groups, although they did not show any signs of cognitive impairment. These findings show an effect of estrogen depletion on brain metabolic activity.
