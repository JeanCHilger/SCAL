The indications of FDG-PET in neck oncology. FDG-PET imaging in neck oncology has a definite clinical impact in the post-therapy setting, assisting in the management of thyroid cancers and SCC of the neck. Quantitation of FDG uptake in suspicious areas may be helpful but should be regarded cautiously. Overall, wider incorporation of FDG imaging in clinical routine depends also on cost availability issues of FDG and of imaging devices. Dual-coincidence scanners for FDG imaging are much cheaper than dedicated PET scanners and are installed in growing numbers in many centers. These devices have inferior sensitivity however, series published with these scanners produce encouraging results. Easier and more acceptable clinical application will also be facilitated by the systematic use of coregistration with anatomic images. Both prerequisites might be fulfilled by the emergence on the market of a gamma camera-mounted anatomic X-ray tomograph, which in addition to dual-coincidence scintigraphic imaging provides radiographic images of comparable quality to third-generation CT systems. This type of hybrid gamma camera-CT scanner has great potential in a region of complex anatomy, such as the head and neck.
