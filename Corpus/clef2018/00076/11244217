Comparison of brain perfusion in corticobasal degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. To compare brain perfusion between corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), we measured regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) semiquantitatively with single-photon emission computed tomography in 10 patients with CBD and 16 with AD. There was no significant difference in age or illness duration between the patients with CBD and AD. Mini-Mental State Examination scores were significantly lower in the AD patients than in the CBD patients. All CBD patients showed asymmetric akinetic-rigid syndrome and limb apraxia. Four CBD patients were demented, and 1 AD patient had parkinsonism. Compared with 12 age-matched control subjects, the average of the left and right rCBF values for the CBD patients was significantly reduced in the prefrontal, anterior cingulate (AC), medial premotor, sensorimotor (SM), posterior parietal (PP) and superior temporal (ST) cortices as well as in the basal ganglia (BG) and thalamus (Th), while the prefrontal, PP and ST cortices were significantly hypoperfused in the AD patients. In the CBD patients, rCBF was significantly less in the AC and SM cortices, and in the Th and BG, and significantly greater in the PP cortex than in the AD patients. Interhemispheric differences of rCBF in the inferior prefrontal and SM cortices were significantly greater in the CBD patients than the AD patients. It is concluded that rCBF comparison may aid in differentiating CBD from AD.
