Three-dimensional conformal radiation treatment planning and delivery for low- and intermediate-grade gliomas. Three-Dimensional conformal radiation treatment (3D-CRT) planning and delivery is an external beam radiation therapy modality that has the general goal of conforming the shape of a prescribed dose volume to the shape of a 3-dimensional target volume, simultaneously limiting dose to critical normal structures. 3-Dimensional conformal therapy should include at least one volumetric imaging study of the patient. This image should be obtained in the treatment position for visualizing the target and normal anatomic structures that are potentially within the irradiated volume. Most often, computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used however, recently, other imaging modalities such as functional MRI, MR spectroscopy, and positron emission tomography (PET) scans have been used to visualize the clinically relevant volumes. This article will address the clinically relevant issues with regard to low- and intermediate-grade gliomas and the role of 3D-CRT planning. Specific issues that will be addressed will include normal tissue tolerance, target definition, treatment field design in regard to isodose curves and dose-volume histograms, and immobilization.
