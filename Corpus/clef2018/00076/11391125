Double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial of bromocriptine in patients with sleep bruxism. This study was designed to assess the effects of bromocriptine, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, on sleep bruxism. Seven otherwise healthy patients with severe and frequent sleep bruxism participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study used a crossover design that included 2 weeks of active treatment or placebo with a washout period of 1 week. To further evaluate whether bromocriptine influences striatal D2 receptor binding, we used iodine-123-iodobenzamide single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) under both placebo and bromocriptine regimens. Bromocriptine did not reduce the frequency of episodes of bruxism during sleep (mean +/- SEM, 9.0 +/- 1.0 and 9.6 +/- 1.5 bruxism episodes per hour for placebo and bromocriptine, respectively) or the amplitude of masseter muscle contractions (root mean square values, 48.2 +/- 15.5 microV and 46.9 +/- 12.7 microV for placebo and bromocriptine, respectively). SPECT also failed to reveal that either treatment had any influence on striatal D2 binding (values for total binding in counts/pixel, 1.80 [1.72-1.93] and 1.79 [1.56-1.87] for placebo and bromocriptine, respectively). This study shows that a nightly dose of bromocriptine does not exacerbate or reduce sleep bruxism motor activity.
