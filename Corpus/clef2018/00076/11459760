Structure--function spatial covariance in the human visual cortex. The value of sulcal landmarks for predicting functional areas was quantitatively examined. Medial occipital sulci were identified using anatomical magnetic resonance images to create individual cortical-surface models. Functional visual areas were identified using retinotopically organized visual stimuli, and positron emission tomography subtraction imaging with intra-subject averaging. Functional areas were assigned labels by placement along the cortical surface from V1. Structure-function spatial covariances between sulci and functional areas, and spatial covariances among functional areas, were determined by projecting sulcal landmarks and functional areas into a standardized stereotaxic space and computing the 'r' statistics. A functional area was considered to spatially covary with a sulcus or another functional area if their geometric centers correlated significantly (P < 0.05) in two or more axes. Statistically significant spatial covariances were found for some, but not all comparisons. The finding of significant spatial covariances within a standardized stereotaxic space indicates that nine-parameter spatial normalization does not account for all the predictive value of structural or functional locations, and may be improved upon by using selected sulcal and functional landmarks. The present findings quantify for the first time the strength of structure--function spatial covariance and comment directly on developmental theories addressing the etiology of structure--function correspondence.
