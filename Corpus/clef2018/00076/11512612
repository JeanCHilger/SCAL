An automated technique for SPECT marker-based image registration in radionuclide therapy. An automated technique for marker-based image registration in radionuclide therapy is described. This technique is based on localization of the centroids of external markers and on establishing correspondence between the individual markers of the two studies to be registered. Localization of the centroids of markers relies on segmenting the markers using iterative thresholding. Thresholding is locally adaptive in order to account for study-dependent conditions (e.g. crossover between adjacent markers and markers with varying radioactive concentrations). Following marker segmentation, the centroids of the markers are computed based on an intensity-weighted method. Finally, prior to the least-squares fit registration, the markers of the two sets are matched to achieve one-to-one correspondence. The technique was applied to both simulated and patient studies resulting in mean residual three-dimensional registration errors (+/- 1SD) of 1.7 +/- 0.1 mm and 3.5 +/- 0.3 mm respectively. The technique was compared with a semi-automated approach and no significant difference was found between the mean residual three-dimensional registration errors (t = 0.281. p = 0.8). This automated marker-based image registration technique provides robust and accurate registration. Although it was developed as part of a programme to generate three-dimensional dose distributions for radionuclide therapy, it could be useful for other clinical applications.
