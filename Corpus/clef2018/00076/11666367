Monodentate sigma-N and Bidentate sigma-N,sigma-N' Coordination of 1,1-Bis((N-p-tolylimino)diphenylphosphoranyl)ethane, CHCH(3)(PPh(2)=NC(6)H(4)-4-CH(3))(2), to Platinum(II). The new ligand, 1,1-bis((N-p-tolylimino)diphenylphosphoranyl)ethane (1,1-BIPE), 1, has been synthesized by means of a Staudinger reaction of 1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (1,1-dppe) with 2 equiv of p-tolylazide. Bridge-splitting reactions of Pt(2)Cl(4)(PR(3))(2) with 1 readily afforded sigma-N monodentate complexes, [PtCl(2)(PR(3)){1,1-BIPE-sigmaN}] (2a, PR(3) = PEt(3) 2b, PR(3) = PMe(2)Ph). Conversion of 2 into the six-membered platinacycle [PtCl(PR(3)){1,1-BIPE-sigmaN,sigmaN'}](+)[X](-) (3) (X = Cl, PtCl(3)(PR(3)), BF(4)) took place after prolonged stirring, its reaction rate being strongly dependent on the type of phosphine (>5 days for 2ain the presence of NaBF(4), 1 h for 2b) and the metal-to-ligand ratio. The compounds 1, 2, and 3 have been fully characterized by (1)H, (31)P{(1)H}, and (13)C{(1)H} NMR and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, or FAB mass spectroscopy. The molecular structures of CHCH(3)(PPh(2)=NC(6)H(4)-4-CH(3))(2) (1) and [PtCl(PMe(2)Ph){(N(pTol)=PPh(2))(2)CHCH(3)}](+)[Cl](-) (3b) have been determined by X-ray crystallography. Crystal data for 1: space group P2(1)/c with a = 8.9591(5) Å, b = 19.1961(12) Å, c = 21.9740(9) Å, beta = 105.069(4) degrees, V = 3649.1(3) Å(3), and Z = 4. The structure refinement converged to R = 0.080 and R(w) = 0.109. Crystal data for 3b: monoclinic, space group P2(1)/c with a = 12.4021(7) Å, b = 16.9705(11) Å, c = 23.760(2) Å, beta = 109.544(5) degrees, V = 4712.7(5) Å(3), and Z = 4. The structure refinement converged to R1 = 0.057, wR2 = 0.122. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy has revealed that complexes 3 exclusively adopt a twisted boat conformation with the methyl group in equatorial position at low temperature, in agreement with the solid state structure of 3b as determined by X-ray crystallography. Boat-to-boat inversion is assumed to take place at temperatures above 293 K. Furthermore, for 3, hindered rotation of one of the p-tolyl substituents on nitrogen has been established at low temperatures.
