Positron emission tomography with deoxyglucose-F18 imaging of sleep. Positron emission tomography with deoxyglucose-F18 was obtained during nighttime sleep in 36 normal volunteers, 12 studied in rapid eye movement sleep (REM period 2), 12 in nonREM sleep, and 12 while awake with eyes closed. Metabolic rate was higher throughout the cortex in REM than nonREM sleep, with differences most marked in the cingulate and frontal cortex, thalamus, and visual association areas. Whole-brain metabolic rates in the waking condition were intermediate between those in REM and nonREM sleep. Metabolism in the primary visual cortex and parts of the lateral temporal lobe was relatively constant in the REM/nonREM conditions. REM sleep did not differ from either the nonREM or waking conditions in hemispheric lateralization of metabolic activity. Compared with REM sleep, nonREM sleep was associated with significantly lower metabolic rates in the temporal and occipital regions, as well as the thalamus.
