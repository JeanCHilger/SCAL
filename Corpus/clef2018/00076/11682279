Sleep deprivation, EEG, and functional MRI in depression: preliminary results. One night of total or partial sleep deprivation (SD) produces temporary remissions in 40-60% of patients with major depression. Two unmedicated patients with major depression and a matched control received quantitative perfusion MR images at baseline and after one night of partial SD (PSD). A reduction > or =30% in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (omitting sleep and weight loss items) defined antidepressant response. Theory, techniques, strengths and weaknesses of quantitative perfusion MRI are described in detail. At baseline, the responder exhibited elevated perfusion covering ventral anterior cingulate/medial frontal cortex the control's maximal perfusion area was markedly smaller. The nonresponder's perfusion was lowest of all, particularly ventrally. PSD decreased perfusion over much of the responder's hyperperfused area but did not change the nonresponder's scan. These preliminary findings are consistent with previous SD studies using PET and SPECT.
