Relationship between clock drawing test performance and regional cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer's disease: a single photon emission computed tomography study. The clock drawing test (CDT) is a useful tool for screening cognitive impairment. Previous neuropsychological studies have revealed that CDT performance requires several cognitive functions including semantic memory, visuospatial function and executive function. However, the neural substrates involved remain to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to identify the brain regions responsible for CDT performance in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Twenty-six patients satisfying the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disease and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD underwent the CDT and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), together with a N-isopropyl-p-[123I] iodoamphetamine (IMP) single photon emission computed tomography measurements of the resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). The CDT score correlated significantly with the MMSE score (r=0.582 P < 0.05). Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the MMSE score and the left posterior temporal rCBF were major predictors of CDT score. These findings suggest that the CDT score may reflect the severity of dementia, and that it has a close relationship with the left posterior temporal function. Our findings provide the first functional neuroimaging evidence for the neural substrates involved in CDT performance.
