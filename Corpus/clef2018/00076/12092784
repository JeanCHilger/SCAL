Cerebral perfusion deficits in age-associated memory impairment. The role of tobacco smoking. Several studies report a high prevalence of memory complaints in the elderly, non-demented population. Since the pathogenesis and diversity of memory impairment in healthy people is still an unresolved issue, we designed our study to ascertain the occurrence of brain abnormalities in Age-Associated Memory Impairment (AAMI) by measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF).Fifty-three subjects were invited to the case-control study: 26 subjects who fulfilled the AAMI criteria, and 27 controls (age, mean+/-SD 65.8+/-7.3 vs 65.5+/-6.7). rCBF was determined using 99mTC-ECD SPECT by relative measurements made in the cortical and white matter regions and in the thalamus.The AAMI group vs controls had restricted rCBF in the temporal lobe of the left hemisphere (median 85.8 vs 87.8, p=0.04), in the thalamus (medianCompared to controls, AAMI subjects had restricted rCBF, A history of previous smoking could partly contribute to the rCBF differences between these groups. Further studies on failing memory and rCBF in representative cohorts of smoking and non-smoking populations are now needed.
