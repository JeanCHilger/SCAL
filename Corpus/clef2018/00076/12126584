Irritable bowel syndrome as a common precipitant of central sensitization. Animal models of neuropathic pain have significantly advanced our knowledge of abnormalities in central pain processing mechanisms in chronic pain disorders. New neuroimaging techniques using functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography scanning are beginning to provide insight into cortical participation in the processing of pain. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders seen by physicians. Visceral hypersensitivity or decreased pain thresholds to distension of the gut is considered to be a biologic marker for IBS and is present in most patients with this gastrointestinal disorder. Patients with IBS also have many extraintestinal symptoms consistent with a central hyperalgesic state. Recent studies suggest that patients with IBS may also have cutaneous hyperalgesia similar to that seen in other chronic pain disorders such as fibromyalgia. This suggests that abnormalities of central nociceptive processing are present in IBS.
