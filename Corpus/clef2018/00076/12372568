Prevalence and prognostic value of perfusion defects detected by stress technetium-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography in asymptomatic patients with diabetes mellitus and no known coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetics. Early diagnosis of CAD and identification of high-risk subgroups, followed by appropriate therapy, may therefore enhance survival. This study sought to determine the value of stress myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium-99m sestamibi to detect perfusion defects and predict cardiac events in asymptomatic diabetics. One hundred eighty asymptomatic diabetics without known CAD who underwent 2-day stress technetium-99m sestamibi SPECT were followed up for 36 +/- 18 months. End points were defined as hard (myocardial infarction or cardiac death) or total events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, or late revascularization). Logistic regression analysis evaluated clinical variables, type of stress, exercise treadmill test (ETT), and SPECT as predictors of end points. Perfusion defects were found in 26% of patients (15% reversible, 6% mixed, and 5% fixed). Clinical or ETT variables were not associated with perfusion defect type or with hard events. However, male gender predicted total events (chi-square 3.3 p = 0.01). An abnormal SPECT significantly increased the risk of hard events (chi-square 5.4
