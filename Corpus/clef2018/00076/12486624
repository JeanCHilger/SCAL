Relevance of colour-duplex echography for detection and therapy of recurrences in the follow-up of head and neck cancer. Head and neck malignancies have a high rate of recurrences. Since the prognosis is often limited an early detection and therapy onset is essential for survival. This study surveys the relevance of regular colour-duplex echography examinations in the follow-up for detection and therapy of recurrent head and neck carcinomas.In a prospective non-randomized study 43 patients were surveyed over a mean observation period of 28 (8-44) months. In addition to clinical and colour-duplex echography (CDS) examinations, computed tomography (CT) and positron-emission-tomography using 18fluorodeoxyglucose (PET) were performed.A recurrence was detected in 17/43 (39.5 %) patients. The median survival was 42 months. CDS was the most reliable procedure for the diagnosis of regional recurrences with an accuracy of 94.2 %. Sensitivity and specificity of CDS for the diagnosis of all recurrences was found to be 80 % and 78,6 % respectively. CT yielded identical results. In PET sensitivity was 82.4 % and specificity was found to be 88.4 %. In clinical examinations including panendoscopy sensitivity was 64.7 % only. In 7/17 recurrences a therapy was performed with curative intention. In 4 cases an early diagnosis by CDS contributed to a successful therapy.CDS is the imaging procedure of choice for the routine follow-up of head and neck cancer patients. In order to perform a comprehensive assessment of the head and neck region, for re-staging and to exclude second primary tumours additional (pan)endoscopy is necessary. CDS supports due to a high resolution and reliability an early therapy onset and a minimal invasive therapy. Thus, this procedure can significantly contribute to the successful treatment of recurrences in head and neck cancer.
