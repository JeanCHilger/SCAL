Human immunodeficiency virus dementia: evidence of a subcortical process from studies of fine finger movements. HIV-1 associated dementia is the major manifestation of HIV-1 within the central nervous system and a devastating disease which is characterized by cognitive, motor, and emotional deficits. HIV-1 associated minor motor deficits can manifest as psychomotor slowing and predict the later development of HIV-1 associated dementia, AIDS, and death. These minor motor deficits can be described, e.g., by electrophysiological assessment of basal ganglia motor function (frequency of most rapid alternating finger movements, reaction and contraction times of most rapid index finger extensions). Minor motor deficits quantified by contraction times can be subdivided into a more incipient and a more sustained type of deficit. Parallel examination of motor function and positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the basal ganglia, or SPECT helps to point to the basal ganglia as a pivotal point of HIV-1 associated CNS pathology.
