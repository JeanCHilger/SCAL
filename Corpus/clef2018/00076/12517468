Angiogenesis in ischaemic myocardium by intramyocardial autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell implantation. Results of experimental studies have shown that intramyocardial implantation of bone marrow cells induces neovascularisation and improves heart function after myocardial infarction. Our aim was to test this notion in people. We implanted autologous mononuclear bone marrow cells into the ischaemic myocardium of eight patients with severe ischaemic heart disease as guided by electromechanical mapping with a percutaneous catheter procedure. After 3 months of follow-up, there was improvement in symptoms, myocardial perfusion, and function at the ischaemic region on MRI. Future randomised, controlled studies are required to validate this initial encouraging result.
