Positron emission tomography scanning in gynecologic and breast cancers. Positron emission tomography with 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose represents a noninvasive functional imaging modality that is based on metabolic characteristics of malignant tumors. The recent findings of this technique in breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and other gynecologic malignancies are discussed.In breast cancer, positron emission tomography with 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose is more accurate than conventional methods for the staging of distant metastases, enables early assessment of treatment response in patients undergoing primary chemotherapy. The diagnostic accuracy for axillary lymph node staging depends on the tumor load of the lymph nodes. The sensitivity of this technique in detecting primary breast cancer is limited in small breast lesions and invasive lobular cancer. In cervical cancer it is the most accurate noninvasive method for lymph node staging and it can accurately depict recurrent ovarian cancer in patients with elevated CA125 levels. False negative findings in well differentiated adenocarcinoma and borderline lesions as well as false positive findings in benign conditions limit the role of positron emission tomography scanning for the differential diagnosis of adnex tumors.Positron emission tomography with 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose reveals unique information about tumor metabolism in gynecologic malignancies and breast cancer. This technique is complementary to morphological imaging for primary diagnosis, staging and re-staging. It may become the method of choice for the early assessment of treatment response in breast cancer and the detection of recurrent disease in ovarian cancer. This method, however, cannot replace invasive procedures if microscopic disease is of clinical relevance.
