On biologically conformal boost dose optimization. A method is described that allows the inclusion of biological imaging data in the optimization of intensity-modulated radiotherapy to produce dose boosts that conform with target subvolumes of potentially reduced radiosensitivity. The biological image (e.g. PET, fMRI, etc) is transformed into a dose efficiency distribution using a piecewise linear calibration function with a prescribed maximum boost factor. Instead of dose alone, the cost function of the optimization algorithm depends on the product of the physical dose times dose efficiency. An example case of a base-of-tongue tumour which was imaged with the hypoxia tracer fluoro-misonidazole is presented, showing the excellent capability of IMRT to produce dose distributions that conform to spatially variable dose prescriptions.
