Design and development of a common synthetic strategy for a variety of 1-N-iminosugars. [formula: see text] A new synthetic strategy has been developed for a general approach toward the synthesis of a variety of 1-N-iminosugar-type glycosidase inhibitors utilizing precursors developed by the PET-mediated cyclization of alpha-trimethylsilylmethylamine radical cation to a tethered pi-functionality.
