First X-ray characterization and theoretical study of pi-alkyne, alkynyl-hydride, and vinylidene isomers for the same transition metal fragment [Cp*Ru(PEt3)2]+. The reaction of the chloro-complex [CpRuCl(PEt(3))(2)] with acetylene gas in methanol gave the pi-alkyne complex [CpRu(eta(2)-HCtbd1CH)(PEt(3))(2)][BPh(4)] (1), which has been structurally characterized by X-ray analysis. The alkyne complex undergoes spontaneous isomerization even at low temperature, yielding the metastable alkynyl-hydride complex [CpRu(H)(Ctbd1
