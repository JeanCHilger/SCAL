Correlation of lipoprotein(a) levels and myocardial stress thallium scintigraphy pattern in different entities of CHD severity. Higher levels of lipoprotein(a) confer an increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Apo-E genotype (APO-E) also plays a role, the APO-E epsilon 4 allele being associated with CHD. Furthermore, higher Lp(a) concentrations are correlated with APO-E epsilon 4 allele presence. The study was performed to investigate the relationship of Lp(a) and APO-E with the functional status of coronary arteries as evaluated by myocardial scintigraphy.We studied 70 patients (27 F and 43 M mean age: 55 +/- 6 yrs.) consecutively referred for CHD, and 50 normal sex and age-matched controls. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, apo-AI, apo-B, Lp(a) levels (ELISA), Lp(a) isoforms (Immuno Blotting) and APO-E (PCR) were measured in all subjects. Only CHD patients underwent a myocardial tomographic stress thallium scintigraphy (201Tl-SPECT)Lp(a) medians were significantly higher than controls in group 1 (p < 0.05), 2 (p < 0.001) and 3 (p = 0.00). Low molecular weight isoforms (B, S1, S2) were significantly more frequent in all CHD-patients vs. controls (p < 0.05), whereas APO-E genotypes did not differ among controls and patients. Multiple regression analysis showed family history (p < 0.001) to be the only independent predictive variable of CHD severity correlated to the scintigraphic pattern.Among the considered biological parameters in our patients only Lp(a) plasma levels are related to the entity of ischemic cardiac wall damage as evaluated by 201Tl-SPECT.
