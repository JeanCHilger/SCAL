Absorbed dose to very low birth weight infants from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. The radiation absorbed dose to very low birth weight infants from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose was investigated. Ten newborns undergoing clinical positron tomography lung imaging were included in this study. Two consecutive 45-min dynamic scans immediately following intravenous injection of fluorodeoxyglucose were acquired the first was over the head, and the second was over the chest. Time-activity curves were generated for the brain, heart wall, lungs, and, when visible, the kidneys. The cumulated activity measurements obtained were for the entire organ masses
