Short-term pharmacokinetics and brain distribution of mecamylamine as a preliminary to carbon-11 labeling for nicotinic receptor investigation. As a preliminary to development and evaluation of labeled mecamylamine as a potential in vivo imaging ligand for human central nicotinic receptors (nAchRs), this work was intended to determine whether the pharmacokinetic properties of mecamylamine are suitable for experimental studies using (11)C-radiolabeled mecamylamine preliminary to positron emission tomography (PET) in humans. An original gas chromatographic method for rapid and simple determination of mecamylamine in biological samples was developed and validated (within run precision, 3.8-5.2% between assay variation, 5.3-6.9%
