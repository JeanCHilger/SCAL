Low oxygen extraction fraction in tumours measured with the oxygen-15 steady state technique: effect of tissue heterogeneity. Several reports have described decreased oxygen extraction fractions in tumours relative to those in normal tissues as measured with the oxygen-15 steady state technique and positron emission tomography. The present simulation study was carried out to assess the influence of tissue heterogeneity on these measured values. It was found that, within the range analyzed, tissue heterogeneity always resulted in underestimations of mean values of oxygen extraction fraction. It must, therefore, be concluded that the oxygen-15 steady state technique is not an accurate method for the assessment of the oxygen status of tumours. This finding should also apply to other pathological conditions, where a significant degree of tissue heterogeneity can not be excluded. More generally, this study demonstrates the need for detailed analyses of sensitivities of tracer kinetic procedures to tissue heterogeneity.
