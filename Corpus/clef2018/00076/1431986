Increased striatal 18F-dopa uptake and normal glucose metabolism in idiopathic dystonia syndrome. Striatal 18F-Dopa uptake and glucose metabolism were studied by positron emission tomography with 6-L-[18F]fluorodopa and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, respectively, in 8 patients with idiopathic dystonia. Patients with abnormal findings on the brain CT and MRI were excluded from this study. The clinical diagnosis consisted of torsion dystonia in 3 patients, focal dystonia limited in the arm in 3 and cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis) in 2. The 18F-Dopa uptake, corrected by nonspecific retention in the cerebellum, at 120 min post-administration was evaluated, and increased 18F-Dopa uptake in the putamen and in the caudate head was observed in the patients with idiopathic dystonia compared to the normal controls. The striatal glucose metabolism in the patients with idiopathic dystonia showed no difference with the normal controls. These findings suggest that pathogenetic mechanism of idiopathic dystonia involves increased presynaptic activity of the dopaminergic system in the striatum.
