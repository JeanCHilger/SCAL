Encephalopathy associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis: an additional case. A 35-year-old female with a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) presented with episodic dysphasia and a burst of axial jerks with abdominal muscle contraction and asymmetric blepharospasm as manifestations of encephalopathy associated with HT. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed scattered supratentorial white matter hyperintense T2 foci. Brain single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) demonstrated a cortical hypoperfusion in the upper frontal and parietal areas. Corticosteroid therapy induced a rapid improvement of the clinical picture.
