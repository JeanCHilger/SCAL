Insulin-stimulated myocardial glucose uptake and the relation to perfusion and the nitric oxide system. In skeletal muscle, insulin increases glucose uptake through endothelium-derived nitric oxide (EDNO)-dependent vasodilation. Insulin also enhances myocardial glucose uptake, but it is unknown whether vasodilation participates in the underlying mechanism. We studied whether insulin-stimulated myocardial glucose uptake (MGU) is associated with perfusion changes and whether MGU is EDNO dependent. Myocardial perfusion (MBF) and MGU were measured three times with positron emission tomography in 8 healthy volunteers (56 +/- 6 years): (1). During a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (clamp), (2). during clamp and blockage of the nitric oxide synthesis by L-NMMA and (3). during clamp and nitric oxide stimulation with nitroglycerin. We measured MBF at rest before and during clamp utilizing (13)N-ammonia and (18)F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose as perfusion and glucose tracers, respectively. Hemodynamics were affected neither by insulin nor by L-NMMA. Nitroglycerin reduced rate-pressure product. Insulin did not affect MBF. L-NMMA reduced MBF (0.60 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.14 ml/g/min p < 0.05), while MGU was unchanged. Nitroglycerin did not alter MBF, while MGU was reduced (0.44 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.52 +/- 0.13 micromol/g/min
