Mobilization of stem cells by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for the regeneration of myocardial tissue after myocardial infarction. Animal data suggest that mobilized bone marrow cells (BMC) may contribute to tissue regeneration after myocardial infarction (MI). However the safety, feasibility and efficacy of treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to mobilize BMC after acute myocardial infarction in patients is unknown. We analysed cardiac function and perfusion in 5 patients who were treated with G-CSF in addition to standard therapeutical regimen.48 h after successful recanalization and stent implantation in 5 patients with acute MI, the patients received 10 micro g/kg bodyweight/day G-CSF subcutaneously for a mean treatment duration of 7.6+/-0.5 days. Peak value of CD34 (+) cells, a multipotent subfraction of bone marrow cells, was reached after 5.0+/-0.7 days. After 3 months of follow-up global left ventricular ejection fraction (determined by radionuclid-ventriculography) increased significantly from 42.2+/-6.6 % to 51.6+/-8.3 % (P<0.05). The wall motion score and the wall perfusion score (determined by ECG gated SPECT) decreased from 13.5+/-3.6 to 9.9+/-3.5 (P<0.05) and from 9.6+/-2.9 to 7.0+/-4.5 (P<0.05), respectively, indicating a significant improvement of myocardial function and perfusion. No severe side effects of G-CSF treatment could be observed. Malignant arrhythmias were not observed either.In patients with acute MI, treatment with G-CSF to mobilize BMC appears to be well tolerable under clinical conditions. Improved cardiac function and perfusion may be attributed to BMC-associated promotion of myocardial regeneration and neovascularization.
