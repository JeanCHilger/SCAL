Longitudinal changes of solute transport in peritonitis-free peritoneal dialysis patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal changes in peritoneal transport in patients on long-term, peritonitis-free, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) therapy.Results were longitudinally recorded for the standard peritoneal equilibration test (PET) in 76 consecutive, nondiabetic, adult patients from the beginning of CAPD therapy until their first episodes of peritonitis, abdominal surgery, or any cause of drop out. The PET results were evaluated once annually using the dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creati-nine (D/PCr) and the dialysate-to-instilled dextrose ratio (D4/D0) at 4 hours after beginning dialysis.A total of 168 PET results were obtained. A statistically significant tendency toward decreased D/PCr and increased D4/D0 values over time for up to 3 years was found.This study shows a tendency toward progressive decline in small molecular transport over time in nondiabetic patients with uneventful CAPD therapy. Sequential PET follow-up cannot be overlooked in peritonitis-free CAPD patients.
