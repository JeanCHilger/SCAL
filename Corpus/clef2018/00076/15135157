Functional magnetic resonance imaging in schizophrenia: cortical response to motor stimulation. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest that motor system abnormalities are present in schizophrenia. However, these studies have often produced conflicting or ambiguous findings. The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether activation differences could be identified in stable schizophrenic patients on the basis of BOLD measures in two motor regions, the primary motor cortex, Brodmann area 4 (BA4) and the premotor and supplementary motor area, Brodmann area 6 (BA6). Twenty-one schizophrenic patients and 21 healthy control subjects were studied with BOLD fMRI methods during a sequential finger tapping task. Statistical parametric maps were generated for each subject, and anatomic regions were automatically defined using an anatomic atlas. Compared with controls, the schizophrenic patients showed a significant reduction in contralateral activation for both BA4 and BA6 (P<0.001), and in ipsilateral activation in BA4 (P=0.007) and BA6 (P=0.002). In healthy controls, the coactivation in the ipsilateral cortex is reduced in comparison with the contralateral cortex for right and left handed tasks. In BA4, this reduction is significant for right (P=0.007) and left (P=0.003) finger tapping. Similar results were obtained for BA6. Further analyses are necessary to evaluate the activation in other motor system regions.
