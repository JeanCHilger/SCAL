New tools to monitor stress using non-invasive PET imaging. Noninvasive imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) is playing an increasing role in monitoring biochemical changes in vivo in various diseases. For example, many of the neurochemical systems activated by stress can be monitored using this technique. Examples of neurotransmitter interactions with CRH, serotonin, dopamine, and muscarinic cholinergic receptors demonstrate this approach.
