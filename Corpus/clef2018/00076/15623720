Peri-ictal SPECT and surgical treatment for intractable epilepsy related to schizencephaly. The authors evaluated four patients with schizencephaly who underwent subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM) prior to epilepsy surgery. Three patients had a SISCOM alteration that was concordant with the epileptic brain tissue. Two of these patients were rendered seizure-free and one individual experienced a significant reduction in seizures. The patient with an indeterminate SISCOM had an unfavorable outcome. SISCOM is useful in evaluating patients with schizencephaly for epilepsy surgery.
