The role of 18F fluorodeoxyglucose triple-head coincidence imaging in the diagnosis of suspected lung cancer. To evaluate the accuracy of [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) triple-head coincidence imaging in the setting of suspected lung cancer.109 patients with suspected lung cancer were enrolled in the present study. According to the diameter of the lesion (> 1.5 cm, </= 1.5 cm), patients were divided into two groups. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the results were calculated and the results were compared with pathological results.Of the total of 109 patients, 86 cases were confirmed as lung cancer whereas 23 cases were benign by pathological study. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of FDG imaging were 95% (82/86), 74% (17/23) and 91% (99/109), respectively. For the group of lesion diameter > 1.5 cm, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 98% (81/83)), 63% (10/16) and 92% (91/99), respectively. While for the group of lesion diameter </= 1.5 cm, the results were 1/3, 7/7, and 8/10, respectively. The difference between the two groups was significant (P = 0.005).The technique of [18F] FDG imaging is an useful method for routine evaluation of patients with suspected lung cancer. The sensitivity of detection is related to lesion size, if lesions </= 1.5 cm in diameter the results of FDG imaging should be carefully analyzed.
