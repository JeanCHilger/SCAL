Current methods of detection of "viable" myocardium. Assessment of viable dis-synergic myocardium has an important prognostic value. There exists a number of methods of investigation allowing to detect hibernating myocardium and thus to predict improvement of regional and global contractile function of the left ventricle after its revascularization. The review presents comparative characteristics of contemporary methods of detection of viable myocardium as well as algorithm of clinical examination of patients with left ventricular dysfunction.
