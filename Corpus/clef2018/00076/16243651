Gene manipulation to enhance MIBG-targeted radionuclide therapy. The goal of targeted radionuclide therapy is the deposition in malignant cells of sterilizing doses of radiation without damaging normal tissue. The radiopharmaceutical [(131)I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine ([(131)I]MIBG) is an effective single agent for the treatment of neuroblastoma. However, uptake of the drug in malignant sites is insufficient to cure disease. A growing body of experimental evidence indicates exciting possibilities for the integration of gene transfer with [(131)I]MIBG-targeted radiotherapy.
