Comparison of alignment of computer-registered data sets: combined PET/CT versus independent PET and CT of the thorax. To retrospectively determine whether alignment of registered positron emission tomographic (PET) and computed tomographic (CT) data sets obtained independently varies significantly from alignment of data sets acquired from a combined PET/CT scanner.The study was approved by the institution's Human Research Committee with a waiver of informed consent and complied with HIPAA. Whole-body combined PET/CT data sets and separate routinely positioned thoracic CT data sets were obtained from 12 patients (six men, six women mean age, 48.6 yearsQuality of alignment did not significantly differ between fusion group 1 and fusion group 3. Fusion group 1 provided significantly better alignment in two of five anatomic locations (P = .008 for diaphragm and P = .031 for heart) than fusion group 2. Fusion group 3 provided significantly better alignment in two of five anatomic locations (P = .037 for diaphragm and P = .009 for heart) than fusion group 2.Thoracic anatomic alignment does not significantly differ between registered PET and CT data sets acquired on a combined PET/CT scanner or from separate PET and CT scanners obtained on the same day when carefully matched for anatomic positioning and respiration.
