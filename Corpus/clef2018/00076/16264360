99mTc-HL91 is inferior to 201Tl in scintigraphic detection of chronic myocardial ischaemia. 99mTc-HL91 is a new hypoxia agent and can identify acutely ischaemic viable myocardium in a canine model using a standard gamma camera. The purpose of the study was to determine whether this tracer could be used to detect regional ischaemia in chronic ischaemic myocardium in a swine model.Using a porcine model of chronic myocardial ischaemia, five mini-pigs with proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenoses were studied. Injection of 462.5 MBq (12.5 mCi) 99mTc-HL91 was followed by imaging over 2 h. Coronary angiography and dipyridamole stress-re-injection 201Tl single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were performed within 1 day of each other.None of the five pigs demonstrated positive hot 99mTc-HL91 uptake throughout the 2 h imaging, whereas four of the five animals showed significant myocardial ischaemia on 201Tl SPECT. The region of interest analysis of LAD/left circumflex artery count ratios at 1 and 2 h demonstrated similar 99mTc-HL91 uptake and retention in chronic ischaemic as well as non-ischaemic myocardium.99mTc-HL91 is inferior to 201Tl in scintigraphic detection of chronic myocardial ischaemia.
