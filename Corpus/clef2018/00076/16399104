Abdominal positron-emission tomography lesions with increased standardized uptake values correlate with intraoperative findings. The reporting of standardized uptake value (SUV) on fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) in colorectal cancer is becoming common practice, but its clinical utility remains to be determined. This study was designed to compare FDG-PET uptake as measured by SUV with operative findings.A colorectal cancer database was queried to identify patients who underwent FDG-PET scans with reported SUVs followed by exploratory laparotomy within 3 months and compare these results to determine FDG-PET sensitivity.Of 46 patients, 16 (34.8%) were found to be have increased extent of disease intraoperatively than seen on FDG-PET scan. This patient population had a statistically significant decreased mean maximal SUV than the patients whose FDG-PET scan equaled intraoperative findings (P < .025).This initial study indicates patients with potentially resectable disease by PET scan but decreased FDG uptake should undergo laparoscopic evaluation before performing laparotomy.
