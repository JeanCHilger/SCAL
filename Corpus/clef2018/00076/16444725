Use of nonpenetrating vascular closure staples in feline renal transplantation. Renal transplantation is a potential treatment for irreversible renal failure in pet cats. Our aim is to reduce warm ischemic time by using nonpenetrating vascular closure staples (VCS), thereby improving graft survival. Experimental cats were divided into the VCS group (n = 4 autotransplantation) or suture group (n = 6
