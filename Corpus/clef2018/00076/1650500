Radionuclide methods to evaluate percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Radionuclide angiocardiography and myocardial perfusion imaging with exercise are valuable methods to assess patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Successful angioplasty results in improvement in ventricular systolic and diastolic function and regional perfusion. Complications of angioplasty, such as periprocedural infarction and side branch occlusion, can be documented noninvasively. Radionuclide methods have also been demonstrated to be of prognostic value in predicting coronary artery restenosis and recurrent cardiac symptoms. However, to avoid underestimating the success of coronary revascularization, studies must be scheduled long enough following angioplasty to allow transient abnormalities associated with artery dilation to resolve.
