Determination of ventricular volumes in coronary artery disease: comparison of two gated SPECT analysis tools with MRI. Comparison of two gated SPECT analysis tools -- gated SPECT quantification (GSQ) and emory cardiac toolbox (ECT) -- in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and severely impaired left ventricular function (preoperative: EF <35% by cardiac catheter).A total of 56 gated SPECT examinations (one-day hybrid-protocol with (201)Tl-chloride for rest and (99m)Tc-sestamibi for stress applied during low-dose dobutamine stress MR-examination temporal resolutionThe total volumetric assessment by both analysis algorithms (n = 56) showed good intraclass correlation coefficients preoperatively (n = 31), but even better postoperatively (n = 25). The mean reconstruction time was approximately 3 minutes ( +/- 2 SD) for GSQ and 15 minutes ( +/- 5 SD) for ECT. In comparison to MRI the results of both analysis tools also correlated well, but the agreement decreased in the presence of scared tissue. The mean LV-EF (MRI) preoperatively was 30.4%, in 6/36 patients above the values calculated from cardiac catheter, postoperatively 34.6%.Both gated SPECT analysis tools showed reliable volumetric assessments in high-risk patients with CAD and severely reduced LV-EF in comparison to MRI, with advantages for GSQ in terms of postprocessing time. However, for the calculation of LV-EF a markedly lower concordance with MR-results was observed for both methods depending on the presence of myocardial scars.
