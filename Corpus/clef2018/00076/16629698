The Belgrade childhood diabetes study - comparison of children with type 1 diabetes with their siblings. A case-control study was conducted in Belgrade (about 320,000 inhabitants 0-16 years old) during the period 1994-97, comprising 68 diabetic children (cases) and 68 controls chosen from the siblings of the cases. Analysis using multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated the following independent risk factors for Type 1 diabetes: higher birth order, infections during the 6 months preceding the onset of the disease and stressful events. Out of individual stressful and psychological factors, 'other' stressful events (severe accident or hospitalisation or death of a close friend, conflict with a teacher, death of a pet, failure in competition, quarrel between parents, punishment, physical attack, war in republics of former Yugoslavia and near drowning in the pool) and learning problems were independent risk factor for Type 1 diabetes. The results obtained in this study of siblings supports the hypothesis that environmental factors play a role in the development of Type 1 diabetes.
