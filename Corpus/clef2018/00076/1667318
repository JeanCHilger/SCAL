Reusable gels for germanium-68 sources. Two water-soluble gels, gelatin and Carbowax, were mixed with radioactive 68Ge solutions and evaluated for their use as long-lived (half-life, 280 days) radioactive sources. These gels melt at 40-50 degrees C and solidify at room temperature. The amount of 68Ge mixed with them can be increased or decreased as needed, eliminating waste of 68Ge. These gel sources also may replace short-lived 68Ga (half-life 68 min) as attenuation correction sources in positron emission tomography (PET) and reduce frequency of source preparation, thus reducing exposure of PET operators to radiation.
