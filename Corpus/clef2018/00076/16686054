Validation of PET imaging by alignment to histology slices. The aim of this project is to verify the accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) in identifying the tumour boundary and eventually to enable PET-guided resection with removal of significantly smaller margins. We present a novel use of an image-guided surgery system to enable alignment of preoperative PET images to postoperative histology. The oral cancer patients must have a high resolution CT scan as well as undergoing PET imaging. Registration of these images to the patient during surgery is achieved using a device that attaches to the patient's upper or lower teeth. During the procedure markers are placed around the lesion within tissue that is to be resected. These are marked along with any convenient anatomical landmarks using the image guidance system, providing the location of the points in the preoperative images. After the sample has been resected, slices through at least 3 of these points are made and photographed. Registration should be possible using these landmarks, but the accuracy of alignment is much improved by marking the bone surface in the histology image and registering to preoperative CT.
