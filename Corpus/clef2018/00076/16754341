Hyperthermia and gene therapy: potential use of microPET imaging. In recent years, both hyperthermia and gene-therapy have been evaluated as approaches to improve cancer radiotherapy. In addition, potential exists to combine these approaches to increase the overall therapeutic efficacy. For example, it has been reported that adenovirus-mediated heat-inducible gene expression may reduce the normal tissue toxicity associated with constitutively controlled expression of therapeutic genes. In our laboratory, we have shown that adenovirus-mediated, heat-activated antisense Ku70 expression radiosensitizes tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a novel approach to use heat-activated gene-radiotherapy to radiosensitize human tumors.However, to optimize the application of heat-activated gene-radiotherapy in the clinic, we need to develop techniques to improve the delivery of the therapeutic adenovirus and to verify/monitor the delivery non-invasively. In an ongoing study we test the effect of mild hyperthermia in improving adenovirus-medicated vector delivery in a mouse tumor model. In addition, we evaluate the use of non-invasive microPET imaging to monitor the spread of the adenoviral vector. Our preliminary results show that (1) microPET imaging can be used to monitor non-invasively the viral vector delivery and dissemination, and (2) mild heat shock leads to significantly improved viral vector distribution, in other words, a wider spatial spread, in vivo.Here, we will present a short review on the current status of hyperthermia and heat-activated gene-radiotherapy, and the potential use of PET imaging in gene therapy.
