Myocardial scars determined by delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography are not common in right ventricles with systemic function in long-term follow up. To test the hypothesis that myocardial scars are common in patients with systemic right ventricles.27 consecutive patients with systemic right ventricle were studied with delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. Of the 27 patients, 18 had had an atrial switch operation a mean of 21.8 (SD 4.5) years previously and were 23.4 (SD 5.3) years old. Nine patients without previous heart surgery had congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries and were 35.3 (SD 15.6) years old.Only one patient had a subendocardial scar identified by delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging. Positron emission tomography identified no myocardial scars.This study shows that the hypothesis that myocardial scars are common in patients with systemic right ventricles is not correct.
