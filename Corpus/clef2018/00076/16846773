Role of radionuclide imaging in the orthopedic patient. Since its introduction more than 40 years ago, nuclear medicine has played an important role in the diagnosis and detection of soft tissue and skeletal disorders. Skeletal scintigraphy or bone scanning is a diagnostic study used to evaluate the distribution of osteoblastic activity or active bone formation within the body. Because no single imaging technique is ideal in all clinical situations, selecting an appropriate imaging test depends on understanding the pathophysiology of the suspected condition and limitations of each technique. This article provides a brief overview of bone scintigraphy, infection imaging, and positron emission tomography in the context of current, adult orthopedic practice.
