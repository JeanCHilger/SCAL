Hybrid scatter correction applied to quantitative holmium-166 SPECT. Ho-166 is a combined beta-gamma emitter of which the betas can be used therapeutically. From the 81 keV gammas of Ho-166, SPECT images can be obtained, which give opportunities to guide Ho-166 therapy. Accurate reconstruction of Ho-166 images is currently hampered by photopeak-scatter in the patient, down-scatter in the detector, collimator and patient caused by the 1.4 MeV photons and by bremsstrahlung. We developed and validated a method for quantitative SPECT of Ho-166 that involves correction for both types of scatter plus non-uniform attenuation correction using attenuation maps. Photopeak-scatter (S) is compensated for by a rapid 3D Monte Carlo (MC) method that is incorporated in ordered subset (OS) reconstruction of the emission data, together with simultaneous correction for attenuation (A) and detector response (D) this method is referred to as OS-ADS. Additionally, for correction of down-scatter, we use a 14 keV wide energy window centred at 118 keV (OS-ADSS). Due to a limited number of available energy windows, the same 118 keV energy window was used for down-scatter correction of the simultaneously acquired Gd-153 transmission data. Validations were performed using physical phantom experiments carried out on a dual-head SPECT system
