Optimal CT breathing protocol for combined thoracic PET/CT. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal breathing protocol for combined PET/CT scans of the thorax.Eighty combined PET/CT scans were obtained in 64 patients (30 women, 34 men mean age, 57 yearsAlignment of the PET and CT data sets was excellent with three breathing protocols: expiration, mid suspended breath-hold, and quiet breathing, with no statistical differences. Significant misalignment occurred at the diaphragm (p < 0.0001) and heart (p < 0.0001) with the small breath-in and regular breath-in techniques.Excellent image fusion of combined PET/CT data sets in the thorax, especially at the diaphragm and heart, can be achieved with expiration, mid suspended breath-hold, or quiet breathing. Quiet breathing is recommended for optimal patient comfort during acquisition of attenuation-correction CT data sets.
