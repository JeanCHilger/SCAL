This article discusses the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) scanning techniques used for the detection and staging of renal cell carcinoma and their pitfalls. Comparison between the Robson and recent modifications to the TNM classifications is also addressed. The accuracy of CT and MR in the staging of renal cell carcinoma and the role of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is outlined and finally the surveillance of patients who have had curative treatment of renal cell carcinoma is briefly addressed.
