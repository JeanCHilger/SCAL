Investigating the existence of quantum metabolic values in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography. To investigate the existence of quantum metabolic values in various subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).Fifty-eight patients with newly diagnosed NHL and positron emission tomography (PET) performed within three months of biopsy were included. The standardized uptake value (SUV) from PET over the area of biopsy and serum glucose [Glc] were recorded. The group glucose sensitivity(G) for indolent and aggressive NHL was obtained by linear regression with ln(SUV) = G x ln[Glc] + C, where C is a constant for the group. Finally, the individual's glucose sensitivity (g) was obtained by g = {ln(SUV)-C}/ln[Glc], along with their means in various subtypes of NHL. To further investigate the influence of extreme [Glc] conditions, the SUVs corrected by the individually calculated g at various glucose levels, [Glc'] using SUV' =SUV x {[Glc']/[Glc]}(g), were compared to the original SUVs for both indolent and aggressive NHL.The averaged g (=G) for aggressive was significant different from that for indolent NHL (-0.94 +/- 0.51 vs. +0.13 +/- 0.10, respectively, p < 0.00005). There were significant differences in SUV for [Glc] < 80 or >110 mg/dl for both types of NHL. Unlike overlap among SUVs between NHL subtypes, the g value clearly categorized them into two distinct groups with positive (near-zero) and negative g values (around -1) for the indolent and aggressive NHLs, respectively.Distinct quantum metabolic values of -1 and 0 were noted in NHL. Aggressive NHL has a more negative value (or higher glucose sensitivity) than that of indolent and, thus, is more susceptible to extreme glucose variation.
