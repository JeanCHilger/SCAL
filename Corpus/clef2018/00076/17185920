Positron emission tomography in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality which is becoming increasingly esential in oncology, especially in the management of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). The most common uses of the PET are listed in this thematic study: initial staging, cervical lymph node metastases from an unknown primary tumor and post-therapeutic follow-up. The advantages and drawbacks of this imaging tool are exposed here according to both our experience and data from the literature. Decision schemes are suggested for each use so as to optimize the use of this imaging modality in the management of these SCC. Other fields of application for the PET are mentioned, such as the in-progress evaluation of response to chemotherapy, the interest of this imaging tool in radiotherapy as well as current biochemical developments concerning new tracers.
