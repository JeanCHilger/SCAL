Tonsillar colonization is unlikely to play important role in Helicobacter pylori infection in children. To determine (i) seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection in children undergoing tonsillectomy, (ii) possible HP colonization on tonsils of children and its importance in HP transmission, and (iii) if four examined socio-economic factors are the risk factors for HP transmission and HP colonization on tonsils in children.Rapid urease test (RUT) of tonsils, and serologic blood tests for HP were performed in 77 children (aged 4-14 years) in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B-H), undergoing tonsillectomy. RUT positive tonsils were cultured for HP. RUT positive children were tested using (13)Carbon-urea breath test ((13)C-UBT). Information about socio-economic potential risk factors was obtained from the parents.Out of 139 pharyngeal and palatine tonsils, 17 palatine tonsils in 14 children were RUT positive and had negative HP culture. Eight children had positive both RUT and (13)C-UBT. There was no significant difference between children with hypertrophy and those with recurrent tonsillitis comparing their serologic tests results. There was no significant difference between seronegative (n=61) and seropositive (n=16) children comparing their age, sex, parental education level, owning a family courtyard, attending a children's collective, and owning a pet cat.The results in this prospective study do not support the notion that tonsils are an important reservoir for HP transmission in children in B-H. The examined socio-economic factors did not enhance HP seropositivity rate in children.
