Renal and adrenal tumours in children. The differential diagnosis of renal and supra-renal masses firstly depends on the age of the child. Neuroblastoma (NBL) may be seen antenatally or in the newborn period this tumour has a good prognosis unlike NBL seen in older children (particularly NBL in those aged 2-4 years).

Adrenal adenomas and carcinomas also occur in childhood
