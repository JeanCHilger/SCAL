Cloning of a xylanase gene from Aspergillus usamii and its expression in Escherichia coli. The complete gene xyn// that encodes endo-1,4-beta-xylanase secreted by Aspergillus usamii E001 was cloned and sequenced. The coding region of the gene is separated by only one intron. It encodes 184 amino acid residues of a protein with a calculated molecular weight of 19.8kDa plus a signal peptide of 27 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of the xyn// gene has higher similarity with those of family 11 of glycosyl hydrolases reported from other microorganisms. The mature peptide encoding cDNA was subcloned into pET-28a(+) expression vector. The recombinant plasmid was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL, and xylanase activity was measured. The expressed fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and a new specific band with molecular weight of about 20kDa was found when induced by IPTG. Enzyme activity assay verified the recombinant protein as a xylanase. A maximum activity of 49.6Umg(-1) was obtained from cellular extract of E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL harboring pET-28a-xyn//. The xylanase had optimal activity at pH 4.6 and 50 degrees C. This is the first report on the cloning of a xylanase gene from A. usamii.
