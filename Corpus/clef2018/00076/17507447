Cortical cholinergic denervation is associated with depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease and parkinsonian dementia. To investigate the relationship between ratings of depressive symptoms and in vivo cortical acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) and parkinsonian dementia (PDem).Subjects (with PD, n = 18, including subjects with PDem, n = 6, and normal controls, n = 10) underwent [11C]methyl-4-piperidinyl propionate AChE positron emission tomography imaging and clinical assessment including the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD).Subjects with PD and PDem had higher scores on the CSDD compared with normal controls: 7.3 (5.4) and 2.8 (2.6), respectively (F = 6.9, p = 0.01). Pooled analysis demonstrated a significant inverse correlation between cortical AChE activity and CSDD scores: R = -0.5, p = 0.007. This correlation remained significant after controlling for Mini-Mental State Examination scores.Depressive symptomatology is associated with cortical cholinergic denervation in PD that tends to be more prominent when dementia is present.
