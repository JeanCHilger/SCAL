Purification of [18F]-fluoro-L-thymidine ([18F]-FLT) for positron emission tomography imaging. 3'-Deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine ([18F]-FLT) has recently been described as a positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical for visualizing cellular proliferation in vivo. All published radiosyntheses of [18F]-FLT provide crude products that must be purified before injection to human. This study describes a reliable purification procedure for [18F]-FLT. It is based on HPLC. In 17.9+/-0.5 min, pure [18F]-FLT is obtained that could be injected to human after a passage through a sterile 0.22 microm filter.
