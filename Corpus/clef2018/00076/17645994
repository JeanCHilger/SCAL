Analysis of a novel offset cone-beam computed mammotomography system geometry for accomodating various breast sizes. We evaluate a newly developed dedicated cone-beam transmission computed mammotomography (CmT) system configuration using an optimized quasi-monochromatic cone beam technique for attenuation correction of SPECT in a planned dual-modality emission and transmission system for pendant, uncompressed breasts. In this study, we perform initial CmT acquisitions using various sized breast phantoms to evaluate an offset cone-beam geometry. This offset geometry provides conjugate projections through a full 360 degree gantry rotation, and thus yields a greatly increased effective field of view, allowing a much wider range of breast sizes to be imaged without truncation in reconstructed images. Using a tungsten X-ray tube and digital flat-panel X-ray detector in a compact geometry, we obtained initial CmT scans without shift and with the offset geometry, using geometrical frequency/resolution phantoms and two different sizes of breast phantoms. Acquired data were reconstructed using an ordered subsets transmission iterative algorithm. Projection images indicate that the larger, 20 cm wide, breast requires use of a half-cone-beam offset scan to eliminate truncation artifacts. Reconstructed image results illustrate elimination of truncation artifacts, and that the novel quasi-monochromatic beam yields reduced beam hardening. The offset geometry CmT system can indeed potentially be used for structural imaging and accurate attenuation correction for the functional dedicated breast SPECT system.
