99mTc(V)-DMSA SPECT for the assessment of disease activity in Graves' ophthalmopathy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of 99mTc(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc(V)-DMSA) scintigraphy for the assessment of disease activity in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) and compare their clinical parameters.The study involved 20 patients who were clinically inactive and eight patients who were clinically active, a total 28 GO patients (18 female, 10 male mean age: 39.2+/-13.4 years) and 12 control subjects (six female, six maleNo significant correlation was detected between clinical activity and classification (P=0.192). However, clinical activity and 99mTc(V)-DMSA uptake were significantly correlated (P=0.0001). There was no correlation between the clinical classification and scintigraphic grading. Bilateral orbital index of the active group was significantly higher than that of the inactive group (P=0.0001).99mTc(V)-DMSA imaging discriminates the active from inactive GO as well as showing an ongoing subclinical inflammation in the orbits of the patients with GO, regardless of the disease activity clinically. Our results revealed that 99mTc(V)-DMSA is a promising agent for the diagnosis of active Graves' ophthalmopathy.
