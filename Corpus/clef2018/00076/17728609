Analysis of blood flow and glucose metabolism in mammary carcinomas and normal breast: a H2(15)O PET and 18F-FDG PET study. To determine parameters of perfusion, distribution coefficient, and glucose metabolism as part of the tumour-specific micromilieu of breast cancer and compare them with corresponding values in normal breast tissue.H2(15)O PET and 18F-FDG PET were performed on 10 patients with advanced invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast. Perfusion, distribution coefficient, and glucose metabolism and standardized uptake were quantified and analysed.Mean values based on the regions of interest were 59.2+/-43.9 ml x min(-1) x 100 g(-1) (perfusion), 0.58+/-0.26 ml x g(-1) (distribution coefficient), 7.76+/-6.10 (standardized uptake), and 5.4+/-2.5 mg x min(-1) x 100 g(-1) (glucose metabolism). The corresponding values for normal breast tissue were 22.1+/-13.2 ml x min x 100 g(-1) (perfusion), 0.16+/-0.05 ml x g(-1) (distribution coefficient), 0.33+/-0.07 (standardized uptake), and 0.18+/-0.08 mg x min x 100 g(-1) (glucose metabolism). For each tumour-normal tissue parameter pair, the mean values were significantly higher in tumours than normal breast tissue. Region-of-interest and pixel-wise correlation analysis revealed a positive association between glucose metabolism and distribution coefficient and glucose metabolism and perfusion for 7/10 tumours investigated.H2(15)O PET and 18F-FDG PET were able to differentiate breast cancer and normal breast tissue. The pixel-wise analysis revealed information about the heterogeneity of tumour fine structure in perfusion, distribution coefficient, and glucose metabolism, which may provide important guidelines for improving individual treatment.
