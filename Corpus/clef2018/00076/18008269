Pseudomigraine with cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis or syndrome of headache, temporary neurological deficit and cerebrospinal fluid. A historical review. The pseudomigraine syndrome with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and pleocytosis (PMP) or headache with neurologic deficits and CSF lymphocytosis (HaNDL) is an entity that they have been realized multiple contributions to their etiophysiopathology in the 25 years of their discovery.The PMP is described in 1980 by Swanson, Bartleson and Whisnant, and parallelly for Marti-Masso, and from then on there have been contributions of new cases, ones some atypical for mild headache, prolonged recurrence, symptomatic intracranial hypertension or infections for citomegalovirus that simulates PMP. They have carried out several approaches diagnoses along the years being established at the moment in the year 2004 by the International Classification of Headache Disorders. They have carried out contributions to their knowledge thanks to the realization of electroencephalograms, single photon emission computed tomography brain imaging, transcranial Doppler, evoked potentials, brain magnetic resonance imaging diffusion... giving place to the existence of numerous theories like the infectious-autoimmune, dysfunction of the blood brain barrier, spread cortical depression, trigeminous-vascular activation.The PMP or HaNDL is a benign entity with even unknown etiophysiopathology and where it is important the differential diagnosis with other entities potentially more dangerous.
