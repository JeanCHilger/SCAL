Cardiac sympathetic activity pre and post resynchronization therapy evaluated by 123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy. Imaging with (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is used for the assessment of cardiac sympathetic activity (CSA). We analyzed CSA before and after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), and correlated these data with CRT response.Thirty patients with chronic heart failure and classic indications for CRT were prospectively studied before and at least 3 months after CRT. The variables analyzed were: QRS width, left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left-ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), heart/mediastinum MIBG uptake ratio (H/M), and washout rate (WR). After CRT, patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (21 patients), responders improving to functional class (FC) I or II and group 2 (9 patients), nonresponders remaining in FC III or IV. After CRT, only group 1 showed favorable changes in QRS width (P =.003), LVEF (P =.01), LVEDD (P =.04), and H/M ratio (P =.003). The H/M ratio and WR were associated with CRT response (P =.005 and P =.04, respectively). The H/M ratio was the only independent predictor of CRT response (P =.01). Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the optimal H/M ratio cutoff point was 1.36 (sensitivity, 75%Improvement in CSA correlated with a positive CRT response. Lower MIBG uptake before therapy was associated with CRT nonresponse. The H/M ratio could be helpful in selecting patients for CRT.
