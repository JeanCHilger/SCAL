Soft level set coupling for LV segmentation in gated perfusion SPECT. We present a new segmentation approach for the myocardium in gated and non-gated perfusion SPECT images. To this end, we represent the epi- and endocardium by separate signed distance functions and couple them by a soft constraint to give explicit control over the wall thickness. By an explicit modeling of the basal plane, the volume of the blood pool as well as the myocardium are determinable. Furthermore, prior shape information is incorporated by applying a kernel density estimation on a number of expert segmentations in a low-dimensional PCA subspace. Thereby, information along the time axis is fully taken into account by employing 4-dimensional embedding functions.
