Laparoscopic splenectomy for splenic masses. This study aimed to evaluate the perioperative outcomes and pathology of patients undergoing laparoscopic splenectomy for splenic masses.The records for 174 patients who underwent laparoscopic splenectomy from May 1994 to August 2006 were reviewed. Patient demographics, preoperative imaging, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, body mass index (BMI), estimated blood loss (EBL), operative time, spleen size, complications, hospital length of stay (LOS), pathology, and mortality were extracted from the records. Data are expressed as means +/- standard deviation. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined using a two-tailed t-test and Fisher's exact test.A splenic mass was diagnosed preoperatively for 18 patients (10.3%) (7 males and 11 females). The mean patient age was 51.4 +/- 13.7 years. The mean ASA was 2.3 +/- 0.8, and the mean BMI was 27.3 +/- 5.8 kg/m(2). Computed tomography scans demonstrated splenic masses in all the patients. The mean mass size was 4.3 +/- 3.3 cm (range, 1.0-11.0 cm), and the mean spleen length was 14.6 +/- 7.5 cm (range, 5.5-40.2 cm). Total laparoscopic splenectomy was completed for 15 patients, and hand-assisted splenectomy was performed for 3 patients (2 converted). The mean operative time was 128.3 +/- 38.5 min, and the mean EBL was 110 +/- 137.5 ml. There were no intraoperative complications or 30-day mortalities. The postoperative complication rate was 11.1%, and the mean LOS was 1.9 +/- 1.0 days. The pathology for six patients (33.3%) was malignant (5 lymphomas and 1 adenocarcinoma). There were three false-positive positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Compared with 73 patients undergoing laparoscopic splenectomy for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, there was no significant difference in mean EBL, operative time, conversion rate, complication rate, LOS, or 30-day mortality rate (p > 0.05).Laparoscopic splenectomy is appropriate for patients whose indication for surgery is splenic mass. Suspicious splenic masses should be removed due to the relatively high incidence of malignant pathology, most commonly lymphoma.
