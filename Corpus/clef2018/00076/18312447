Normal limits for left ventricular ejection fraction and volumes determined by gated single photon emission computed tomography--a comparison between two quantification methods. To compare gender-related normal limits for left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (EDV and ESV), obtained using two myocardial perfusion-gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) quantification methods. A total of 185 patients were retrospectively selected from a consecutive series of patients examined for coronary artery disease (CAD) or for management of known CAD. Patients were included in the study group if they had normal or probably normal results with stress and rest perfusion imaging and if the combined interpretation of perfusion studies and gated rest studies showed no signs or suspicion of myocardial infarction. The gated SPECT studies were performed using a 2-day stress/gated rest Tc-99m sestamibi protocol. All patient studies were processed using CAFU and quantitative-gated SPECT (QGS), the two software packages for quantification of gated SPECT images. The lower normal limits for EF were higher for CAFU compared with QGS for both women (59% versus 53%) and men (54% versus 47%). The upper normal limits for EDV were also higher for CAFU compared with QGS for both women (133 versus 107 ml) and men (182 versus 161 ml). The differences between the software packages were small for ESV (women 44 versus 44 ml men 69 versus 74 ml). Gender-specific normal limits need to be applied for LV EF and volumes determined by gated SPECT. Separate criteria for abnormal LV EF and EDV need to be used for women and men depending on the software package used.
