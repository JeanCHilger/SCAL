Large-animal handling at the Colorado State University College of Veterinary Medicine. Colleges of veterinary medicine face many challenges in teaching the handling of large animals. It is imperative that students be taught how to manage large animals, however, not only for their safety but for that of their clients and of the animals themselves. Confident, safe, and efficient handling can improve job satisfaction and may encourage students to enter large-animal practice. There is wide variation in the large-animal-handling components of US veterinary curricula.
