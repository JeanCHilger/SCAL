Population characteristics and prognostic factors in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: a Fox Chase Cancer Center retrospective. With the increasing use of magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography for staging non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the demographics, performance status (PS), and distribution of metastases at diagnosis in this patient population are changing. We therefore reassessed the prognostic implications of baseline clinical variables in the modern era.We retrospectively evaluated the charts of 172 consecutive, unselected patients aged 41-89 years (median, 62 years) with stage IV NSCLC monitored at the Fox Chase Cancer Center, a tertiary referral center, between October 2000 and August 2003. Cox proportional models were used to conduct univariate and multivariate analyses of baseline prognostic factors.Median age was 62 years 79% of patients were PS 0/1 at first presentation. Fifty-six percent had single organ metastasisThe most important prognostic determinants were PS, baseline albumin, and number of metastatic sites. Incidence of brain metastases at presentation in this population was higher than usually described. Survival rates in this cohort equal or exceed contemporary figures observed in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group advanced NSCLC trials.
