Thallium redistribution does not predict perioperative cardiac complications following vascular surgery. Utility of preoperative stress thallium scintigraphy (STS) was determined in 59 patients, thought to be at increased risk, prior to major vascular surgery from July 1987 to February 1990. Forty-seven had oral dipyridamole and 12 underwent exercise STS. Thallium redistribution (TR) was present in 61% (n = 36) fixed defects were present in 59% (n = 35)
