The geometric response function for convergent slit-slat collimators. We have derived an analytic geometric transfer function (GTF) for a convergent slit-slat collimator that treats the parallel slit-slat collimator as a special case. The effective point spread function (EPSF) is then derived from the GTF through the Fourier transform. The results of these derivations give an accurate description of the complete geometric response for a slit-slat collimator that includes the effects of the shape and orientation of the slit and slats. We have also derived exact and approximate sensitivity formulae and spatial resolution formulae using the EPSF.
