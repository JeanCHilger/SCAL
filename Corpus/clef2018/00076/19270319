Urinary protein:creatinine ratio in rabbits in relation to their serological status to Encephalitozoon cuniculi. The concentrations of protein and creatinine were measured in urine samples from 74 healthy domestic pet rabbits, 54 of them seronegative to Encephalitozoon cuniculi and 20 seropositive. The calculated reference range for the urinary protein:creatinine ratio (UPC) of E cuniculi-seronegative rabbits was 0.11 to 0.40. There was no significant variation in the UPC due to the bodyweight, breed, sex, neutered status or husbandry of the rabbits. Seroconversion to E cuniculi was not found to be associated with clinical renal disease because none of the seropositive rabbits had azotaemia or proteinuria.
