18F-FDOPA PET and PET/CT accurately localize pheochromocytomas. Successful treatment of pheochromocytoma requires accurate diagnosis and localization of tumors. Herein, we investigated the accuracy of PET using 3,4-dihydroxy-6-(18)F-fluoro-phenylalanine ((18)F-FDOPA), an amino acid transporter substrate, as an independent marker for detection of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas.The study comprised 25 consecutive patients (9 men, 16 women) whose median age was 51 y (range, 25-68 y), with known or suspected pheochromocytoma. Eleven patients underwent standardized (18)F-FDOPA PET and 14 patients underwent (18)F-FDOPA PET/CT studies, with a median of 511 MBq of (18)F-FDOPA (range, 206-625 MBq). Two readers, unaware of the reports of other imaging studies and clinical data, analyzed all scans visually and quantitatively (maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax] and maximum transverse diameter). Histology and long-term clinical follow-up served as the gold standard. Correlation between SUVmax of tumors and biochemical markers was evaluated. SUVmax of the benign and malignant tumors was compared.Seventeen patients underwent surgery. Histology confirmed pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma in 11 cases (8 adrenal, including 2 malignant tumors, and 3 extraadrenal, including 1 malignant tumor). The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was established by follow-up in 2 additional patients (1 adrenal and 1 unknown location) and ruled out in 6 patients. Visual analysis detected and localized pheochromocytoma in 11 of 13 patients without false-positive results (sensitivity, 84.6% specificity, 100%(18)F-FDOPA PET and PET/CT are highly sensitive and specific tools that can provide additional independent information for diagnosis and localization of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas.
