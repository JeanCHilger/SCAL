Prognostic significance of SUV on PET/CT in patients with esophageal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Esophageal cancer is the third most common gastrointestinal malignancy with a poor long-term survival and high mortality. Surgical resection provides the only chance of cure. The tumor-node metastasis stage classification system is a strong prognostic parameter predicting the prognosis. We performed the present meta-analysis to comprehensively review the evidence for use of standardized uptake value (SUV) measured on tumor to predict prognosis of esophageal cancer.We searched for articles published in English or Chinese limited to esophageal cancerWithout the study dealt by the pretreatment SUV measured on metastasis sites, there were seven studies dealt by the prognostic value of SUV measured on FDG-PET for overall survival. The combined HR was 1.86, meaning that high SUV indicated worse survival prognosis and there were three studies dealt with the prognostic value of SUV measured on FDG-PET for disease-free survival. The combined HR was 2.52, indicating that high SUV was associated with more significantly higher risk for recurrence than low SUV.SUV measured in patients with esophageal cancer, reflecting the metabolic activity of tumor and malignancy, could serve as a prognostic factor. Considering that the FDG-PET can add important information of metabolism in detection and staging to conventional imaging modality, we anticipate that SUV could be used in patients with esophageal carcinoma.
