A supramolecular approach for preparation of size-controlled nanoparticles. A supramolecular approach has been developed for the preparation of supramolecular nanoparticles (SNPs) with variable sizes (30-450 nm) from three different molecular building blocks using a cyclodextrin/adamantane recognition system. Positron emission tomography (PET) was employed to study the biodistribution and lymph node drainage of the SNPs in mice. The sizes of the SNPs affect their in vivo characteristics (see picture).
