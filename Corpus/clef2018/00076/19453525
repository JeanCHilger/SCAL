Imaging in bronchopulmonary sequestration. Bronchopulmonary sequestration is an uncommon pulmonary disorder characterized by an area of non-functioning abnormal lung tissue, which receives its blood supply from a systemic artery and characteristically has no connection with the tracheobronchial tree. The abnormal lung tissue is located within the visceral pleura of a pulmonary lobe in the intralobar variety, whereas the extralobar form has its own visceral pleura. The venous drainage of the extralobar type is usually into the systemic veins, whereas the intralobar type drains into the pulmonary veins. Radiological imaging plays a vital role in establishing the diagnosis, and even more importantly, in providing to the clinician a vascular roadmap essential for surgical planning. We present here a review of bronchopulmonary sequestration and also discuss the role of various imaging methods in the early diagnosis and management of these cases.
