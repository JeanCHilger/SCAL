Does hippocampal FDG-PET asymmetry predict verbal memory dysfunction after left temporal lobectomy? The primary aim of this study was to determine whether hippocampal asymmetries in fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on preoperative PET scans would predict post-temporal lobectomy verbal memory (VM) decline in patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy. A quantitative asymmetry index (AI) of uptake values within a hippocampal region of interest (ROI) was defined by an automated technique. No statistically significant effect of the hippocampal AI on the outcome measure, the pre- to postsurgical change in Logical Memory Percent Retention, was evident. Post hoc analyses revealed that AIs of the superior and inferior temporal gyri approached significance, however, with relatively greater left-sided preoperative metabolism predicting better VM outcomes. This finding suggests reorganization of function and/or retained function of remaining tissue. Although hippocampal FDG-PET asymmetries did not significantly predict changes in VM, the predictive value of neocortical AIs should be further explored. Automated ROI parcellation provides a feasible tool for use in such investigations.
