Cardiac sympathetic imaging with mIBG in heart failure. Cardiac sympathetic imaging with meta-iodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) is a noninvasive tool to risk stratify patients with heart failure (HF). In patients with ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy, cardiac mIBG activity is a very powerful predictor of survival. Cardiac sympathetic imaging can help in understanding how sympathetic overactivity exerts its deleterious actions, which may result in better therapy and outcome for patients with HF.
