 Extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion molecules consist of a complex network of fibronectins, collagens, chondroitins, laminins, glycoproteins, heparin sulfate, tenascins, and proteoglycans surrounding connective tissue cells, and they are mainly secreted by fibroblasts, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts (1). Cell substrate adhesion molecules are considered essential regulators of cell migration, differentiation, and tissue integrity and remodeling. These molecules play a role in inflammation, but they also participate in the process of invasion and metastasis of malignant cells in the host tissue (2). Invasive tumor cells adhere to the ECM components, which provide a matrix environment for their permeation through the basal lamina and underlying interstitial stroma of the connective tissue by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade the basement membrane and ECM (3). Gelatinase family is a subgroup of MMPs consisting of gelatinase A (MMP-2) and B (MMP-9) (4). Gelatinase expression in normal cells, such as trophoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils and macrophages, is highly regulated. Elevated level of gelatinases has been found in tumors associated with a poor prognosis in cancer patients (5). A cyclic decapeptide, cCTTHWGFTLC (CTT), was found to be a potent and selective inhibitor of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (6). The HWGF motif is important for the inhibitory activity. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid was conjugated to an amino group of the N-terminal cysteine of the CTT peptide for radiolabeling with
