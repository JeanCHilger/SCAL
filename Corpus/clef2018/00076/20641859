Radioiodinated anti-CD105 MAEND3 monoclonal antibody Radioiodinated-Anti-CD105 MAEND3 monoclonal antibody (Radiodinated-MAEND3 MAb), which is formed by the radioiodination of an intact MAEND3 MAb against the antigen endoglin (cluster of differentiation 105 (CD105)), an accessory component of the receptor complex of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), has been developed for gamma imaging of tumor neovasculature (1).
