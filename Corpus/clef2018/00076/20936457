Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer implementing molecular imaging with 18F-choline PET-CT to define a simultaneous integrated boost. To report the own experience with 66 patients who received 18F-choline PET-CT (positron emission tomography-computed tomography) for treatment planning.Image acquisition followed 1 h after injection of 178-355 MBq (18)F-choline. An intraprostatic lesion (GTV(PET) [gross tumor volume]) was defined by a tumor-to-background SUV (standard uptake value) ratio > 2. A dose of 76 Gy was prescribed to the prostate in 2-Gy fractions, with a simultaneous integrated boost up to 80 Gy.A boost volume could not be defined for a single patient. One, two and three or more lesions were found for 36 (55%), 22 (33%) and seven patients (11%). The lobe(s) with a positive biopsy correlated with a GTV(PET) in the same lobe in 63 cases (97%). GTV(PET) was additionally defined in 33 of 41 prostate lobes (80%) with only negative biopsies. GTV(PET), SUV(mean) and SUV(max) were found to be dependent on well-known prognostic risk factors, particularly T-stage and Gleason Score. In multivariate analysis, Gleason Score > 7 resulted as an independent factor for GTV(PET) > 8 cm(3) (hazard ratio 5.5 p = 0.02) and SUV(max) > 5 (hazard ratio 4.4Treatment planning with (18)F-choline PET-CT allows the definition of an integrated boost in nearly all prostate cancer patients - including patients after NHT - without considerably affecting EUDs for the organs at risk. GTV(PET) and SUV levels were found to be dependent on prognostic risk factors, particularly Gleason Score.
