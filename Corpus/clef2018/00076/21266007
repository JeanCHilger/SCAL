Central post stroke pain: clinical, MRI, and SPECT correlation. The objective of this study was to report clinical spectrum of central post stroke pain (CPSP) and correlate these with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) findings.The study was designed as a prospective study.The study was set in a tertiary care teaching hospital.Twenty-three consecutive CPSP patients were included and their severity of pain, sensory threshold, allodynia, hyperalgesia, and temporal summation were assessed by quantitative sensory testing (QST). Cranial MRI and (99)Tc ethylene cystine dimmer SPECT findings correlated with QST.The duration of CPSP was 5 months (0.25-108). Allodynia was present in 12 patients, punctuate hyperalgesia in 11, and temporal summation in 12. SPECT was abnormal on visual analysis in 17 patients hypoperfusion in corresponding thalamus in nine, and parietal cortex in 11 patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed hyperperfusion of thalamus in four and parietal cortex in five patients. MRI revealed infarction in 14 and hematoma in nine patients. The QST findings were similar in thalamic and extrathalamic CPSP. The MRI and SPECT findings were also not different in CPSP patients with and without allodynia.The QST findings in patients with CPSP were similar in patients with thalami and extrathalamic lesions. SPECT and MRI findings were also not different in CPSP patients with and without allodynia.
