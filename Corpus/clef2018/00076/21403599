Investigating spectrum of biological activity of 4- and 5-chloro-2-hydroxy-N-[2-(arylamino)-1-alkyl-2-oxoethyl]benzamides. In this study, a series of twenty-two 5-chloro-2-hydroxy-N-[2-(arylamino)-1-alkyl-2-oxoethyl]benzamides and ten 4-chloro-2-hydroxy-N-[2-(arylamino)-1-alkyl-2-oxoethyl]benzamides is described. The compounds were analyzed using RP-HPLC to determine lipophilicity. Primary in vitro screening of the synthesized compounds was performed against mycobacterial, bacterial and fungal strains. They were also evaluated for their activity related to the inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport (PET) in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) chloroplasts. The compounds showed biological activity comparable with or higher than the standards isoniazid, fluconazole, penicillin G or ciprofloxacin. For all the compounds, the relationships between the lipophilicity and the chemical structure of the studied compounds as well as their structure-activity relationships are discussed.
