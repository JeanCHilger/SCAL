Novel handheld PET probes provide intraoperative localization of PET-avid lymph nodes. The accurate intraoperative localization of malignant nodes can pose a challenge to the surgical oncologist. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning has significantly increased our ability to detect suspicious lesions. We investigated the ability of a novel, handheld tool to evaluate suspicious nodes intraoperatively and to correlate its findings with those seen on preoperative PET scan.Ten nude rats were inoculated with a lymphogenic mesothelioma tumor line and followed weekly with PET scan studies. When suspicious lymph nodes were found, animals were dissected and the intraoperative amount of tissue radiation was analyzed as "tumor-to-background ratio" (TBR) using the PET probes.The intraoperative probe was used to guide dissections and select high-risk nodes based on their specific radiotracer uptake. A total of 52 nodes were harvested eight of these were suspicious on preoperative PET scan studies. Using a TBR of 2.5, the intraoperative probes were able to localize all suspicious nodes previously seen on PET scan. Both gamma (sensitivity: 100%This novel tool may be used synergistically with the PET scan examination to maximize intraoperative nodal selection and sampling.
