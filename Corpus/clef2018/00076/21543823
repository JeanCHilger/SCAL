Effects of lowered serotonin transmission on cocaine-induced striatal dopamine response: PET [¹¹C]raclopride study in humans. Low serotonin transmission is thought to increase susceptibility to a wide range of substance use disorders and impulsive traits.To investigate the effects of lowered serotonin on cocaine-induced (1.0 mg/kg cocaine, self-administered intranasally) dopamine responses and drug craving.In non-dependent cocaine users, serotonin transmission was reduced using the acute tryptophan depletion method. Striatal dopamine responses were measured using positron emission tomography with [(11)C]raclopride.Acute tryptophan depletion increased drug craving and striatal dopamine responses to cocaine. These acute tryptophan depletion-induced increases did not occur in the absence of cocaine.The results suggest that low serotonin transmission can increase dopaminergic and appetitive responses to cocaine. These findings might identify a mechanism by which individuals with low serotonin are at elevated risk for both substance use disorders and comorbid conditions.
