Gamma distribution model describes maturational curves for delta wave amplitude, cortical metabolic rate and synaptic density. We analyzed the available ontogenetic data (birth to 30 years of age) for: amplitude of delta EEG (DA) waves during sleep cortical metabolic rate (CMR) measured with positron emission tomography
