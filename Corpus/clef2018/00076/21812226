The risk assessment of lungs' apices injury in patients after radioactive iodine therapy due to hyperthyroidism. In the light of recent research data hypothesis on radioactive iodine therapy leading to inflammatory reaction in lungs' apices has lately gained wider acceptance among pulmonologists. The study published of late showed that in one female patient previously treated with radioiodine due to toxic multinodular goiter 99mTc-Tectreotide uptake was found in the lung apex. The aim of study was evaluation of the risk assessment of inflammatory reaction in lungs' apices among patients treated with radioactive iodine due to hyperthyroidism. The study was carried out in 15 female patients (mean age 75 years +/-10 years) with large toxic multinodular goiter and fine needle aspiration biopsy negative for malignancy and who did not qualify for thyreoidectomy. Mean radioactive iodine therapeutic dose used in the study was 940 MBq. Chest SPECT scan (99mTc-Tectreotide) was performed one year after radioiodine therapy. Trace uptake in lung apex has been noted only in one patient. In 14 out of 15 patients in the study tectreotide uptake has not been found in any lungs' apices. All of 15 patients became euthyroid six months after radioactive iodine therapy and had their thyroid gland shrinked. No significant correlation between inflammatory reaction in lung apices and radioiodine therapy in patients with hyperthyroidism and large multinodular goiter was found in conducted study.
