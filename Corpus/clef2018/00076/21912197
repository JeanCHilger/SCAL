Molecular imaging of cell therapy for gastroenterologic applications. Stem cell therapy has appeared as a possible therapeutic alternative for numerous diseases. Furthermore, cancer stem cells are a focus of significant interest as they may allow for a better understanding of the genesis of different malignancies. The ultimate goal of stem cell therapeutics is to ensure the viability and functionality of the transplanted cells. Similarly, the ultimate goal of understanding cancer stem cells is to understand how they behave in the living subject. Until recently, the efficacy of stem cell therapies has been assessed by overall organ function recovery. Understanding the behavior and biology of stem cells directly in the living subject can also lead to therapy optimization. Thus, there is a critical need for reliable and accurate methods to understand stem cell biology in vivo. Recent advances in both imaging and molecular biology have enabled transplanted stem cells to be successfully monitored in the living subject. The use of molecular imaging modalities has the capability to answer these questions and may one day be translated to patients. In this review, we will discuss the potential imaging strategies and how they can be utilized, depending on the questions that need to be answered.
