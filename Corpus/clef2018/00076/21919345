Evaluation of applied biosystems MicroSEQ real-time PCR system for detection of Salmonella spp. in food. Real-time PCR methods for detecting foodborne pathogens offer the advantages of simplicity and quick time-to-results compared to traditional culture methods. In this study, the MicroSEQ real-time PCR system was evaluated for detection of Salmonella spp. in 10 different food matrixes following the AOAC Research Institute's Performance Tested Method validation program. In addition, the performance of the MicroSEQ system was evaluated for the detection of Salmonella in peanut butter as a part of the Emergency Response Validation Program sponsored by the AOAC Research Institute. The system was compared to the ISO 6579 reference method using a paired-study design for detecting Salmonella spp. in raw ground beef, raw chicken, raw shrimp, Brie cheese, shell eggs, cantaloupe, chocolate, black pepper, dry infant formula, and dry pet food. For the peanut butter study, the system was compared to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Bacteriological Analytical Manual procedures using an unpaired-study design. No significant difference in performance was observed between the MicroSEQ Salmonella spp. detection system and the corresponding reference methods for all 11 food matrixes. The MicroSEQ system detected all Salmonella strains tested, while showing good discrimination against detection of an exclusivity panel of 30 strains, with high accuracy.
