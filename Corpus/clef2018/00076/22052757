How does endorectal MRI, PET-CT and transrectal ultrasound contribute to diagnosis and management of localized prostate cancer. We analyze the main imaging techniques (transrectal ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Position Emission Tomography) that are currently used in the diagnosis and management of localised prostate cancer patients. We analyze the results that may be obtained with transrectal US and describe the latest advances in this technique (Doppler, power doppler and contrast media). With Magnetic Resonance Imaging, we describe the underlying principles, results and indications as well as some new applications (diffusion, perfusion, spectroscopy and the use of lymphotrophic nanoparticles). Finally we will describe the current state of positron emission tomography in diagnosis, follow up and recurrence detection using the different radiomarkers that are available.
