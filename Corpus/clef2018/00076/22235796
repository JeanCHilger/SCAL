Serum neopterin, sialic acid and nitric oxide levels in dogs with malignant mammary tumours. Mammary cancer is one of the leading causes of death in pet population. Early diagnosis and malignancy detection is important for prognosis. The levels of neopterin, sialic acid and nitric oxide in serum of dogs with malignant mammary tumours were evaluated to investigate the importance of these biochemical parameters for malign mammary tumour. Twelve healthy dogs and twenty dogs with malignant mammary tumours were used as research materials. Blood samples were collected from both groups for neopterin analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas nitric oxide and sialic acid were measured by modified nitrate reductase method and spectrophotometry, respectively. Tissue specimens were evaluated and defined as malignant tumours. Serum nitric oxide and sialic acid levels in dogs with mammary tumours were significantly higher than those in the healthy dogs. Serum neopterin levels were not found significantly different in dogs with mammary tumours compared to healthy dogs. Malignancy of canine mammary tumours are accompained by an elevation of nitric oxide and sialic acid levels.
