Myocardial perfusion by CT versus hybrid imaging. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) is a reliable diagnostic test for the anatomic diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Although coronary CTA shows high sensitivity and negative predictive value for detecting stenosis greater than or equal to 50% diameter, it is limited in its ability to diagnose myocardial ischemia. Advances in computed tomography (CT) technology alone and technology that hybridizes CT with single-photon emission CT and positron emission tomography allow for the combined anatomic and physiologic diagnosis of CAD. This article summarizes these combined technologies, emphasizing the merits and limitations of each technology and their clinical implications.
