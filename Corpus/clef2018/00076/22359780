5-[ The gradual development and worsening of dementia is a characteristic feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and currently no cure is available for this ailment. Medications available to treat AD can only modify or delay the onset of this disease, and there are many ongoing preclinical and clinical studies to develop a suitable therapy to treat this condition (1). It is hypothesized (known as the amyloid cascade hypothesis) that accumulation of an amyloid precursor protein derivative, the β-amyloid protein (Aβ), in the brain is responsible for bringing about changes in the biochemical and cellular functions of the brain and leads to the progression and manifestation of AD (2). Therefore, the Aβ is believed to be a good biomarker for the detection of AD. Most earlier studies performed to investigate this disease used human post-mortem brains, and little is known about the early events that promote the development of AD or about how the formation and deposition of the Aβ contributes to the disease process (2). More recently, many noninvasive imaging probes that can be used with the various imaging modalities, have been developed and evaluated for the detection of early stage Aβ plaques however, due to inadequate permeation across the blood–brain barrier and/or low binding to the Aβ aggregates, these agents were considered unsuitable for visualization of the Aβ plaques in the human brain (2). In an effort to develop imaging compounds that can be used for the visualization of Aβ plaques, investigators have produced and evaluated radiolabeled compounds that can be used with positron emission tomography (PET) (3). Among these, the
