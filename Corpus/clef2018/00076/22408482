Optimization of TiO(2) and PMAPTAC Concentrations of a Chemical Humidity Sensing Mechanism. This work aims to achieve an optimization of the TiO(2) and PMAPTAC concentrations in a chemical resistive-type humidity sensing mechanism (RHSM). Our idea is based primarily on the modeling of the sensing mechanism. This model takes into account the parameters of non-linearity, hysteresis, temperature, frequency, substrate type. Furthermore, we investigated the TiO(2) and PMAPTAC effects concentrations on the humidity sensing properties in our model. Secondly, we used the Matlab environment to create a database for an ideal model for the sensing mechanism, where the response of this ideal model is linear for any value of the above parameters. We have done the training to create an analytical model for the sensing mechanism (SM) and the ideal model (IM). After that, the SM and IM models are established on PSPICE simulator, where the output of the first is identical to the output of the RHSM used and the output of the last is the ideal response. Finally a "DIF bloc" was realized to make the difference between the SM output and the IM output, where this difference represents the linearity error, we take the minimum error, to identify the optimal TiO(2) and PMAPTAC concentrations. However, a compromise between concentrations, humidity and temperature must be performed. The simulation results show that in low humidity and at temperature more than 25 Â°C, sample 1 is the best (in alumina substrate). However, the sample 9 represents the best sensor (in PET substrate) predominately for the lowest humidity and temperature.
