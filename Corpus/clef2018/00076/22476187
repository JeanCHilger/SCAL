Pediatric genitourinary tumors. We will review the 2010/2011 literature on pediatric genitourinary tumors and highlight the most significant publications.New techniques such as gene expression profiling, PET, and nephron-sparing surgery are being incorporated into contemporary treatments for pediatric patients with genitourinary tumors. Biologic markers are increasingly being used to help with risk stratification of patients and to identify new targets for therapy. WT1 mutation and 11p15 loss of heterozygosity have been associated with relapse in very low-risk Wilms tumors treated with surgery alone and may help reduce the use of chemotherapy in some children. Meta-analysis of data on the use of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue in patients with relapsed Wilms tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma suggests that some patients may benefit more from conventional salvage chemotherapy. New agents are needed for patients with high-risk and relapsed disease to improve outcomes.In general, the prognosis for patients with pediatric genitourinary tumors is favorable. Further understanding of the biology in these tumors is helping to determine risk stratification, treatment strategies, and candidates for new drug development.
