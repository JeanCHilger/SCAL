Ex vivo and in vivo evaluation of the norepinephrine transporter ligand [11C]MRB for brown adipose tissue imaging. It has been suggested that brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans may play a role in energy balance and obesity. We conducted ex vivo and in vivo evaluation using [(11)C]MRB, a highly selective NET (norepinephrine transporter) ligand for BAT imaging at room temperature, which is not achievable with [(18)F]FDG.PET images of male Sprague-Dawley rats with [(18)F]FDG and [(11)C]MRB were compared. Relative [(18)F]FDG or [(11)C]MRB retention at 20, 40 and 60 min post-injection was quantified on awake rats after exposing to cold (4Â°C for 4h) or remaining at room temperature. Rats pretreated with unlabeled MRB or nisoxetine 30 min before [(11)C]MRB injection were also assessed. The [(11)C]MRB metabolite profile in BAT was evaluated.PET imaging demonstrated intense [(11)C]MRB uptake (SUV of 2.9 to 3.3) in the interscapular BAT of both room temperature and cold-exposed rats and this uptake was significantly diminished by pretreatment with unlabeled MRB in contrast, [(18)F]FDG in BAT was only detected in rats treated with cold. Ex vivo results were concordant with the imaging findingsOur study demonstrates that BAT could be specifically labeled with [(11)C]MRB at room temperature and under cold conditions, supporting a NET-PET strategy for imaging BAT in humans under basal conditions.
