Human and animal rabies prevention and control cost in Bhutan, 2001-2008: the cost-benefit of dog rabies elimination. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost of various interventions and to quantify the economic impacts of rabies in Bhutan. Cost-benefit of dog rabies elimination versus human post exposure treatment cost was also assessed. The average direct medical cost of human post-exposure treatment (using rabies vaccine only) was estimated to be Nu. 1615 (US$ 35.65) per 5-dose Essen regimen per patient. The cost would increase to Nu. 2497 (US$ 55.13) and Nu. 19,633 (US$ 433.41) per patient when one dose of either equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG) or human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) is administered, respectively. The societal cost (direct medical and indirect patient expenses) per patient was estimated to be Nu. 2019 (US$ 45), Nu. 2901 (US$ 64) and Nu. 20,037 (US$ 442) using vaccine only, vaccine with ERIG and vaccine with HRIG, respectively. The average cost per dog vaccination and sterilization were estimated to be Nu. 75 (US$ 1.66) and Nu. 288 (US$ 6.36), respectively. The total direct cost of rabies and various interventions between 2001 and 2008 was estimated to be Nu. 46.95 million (US$ 1.03 million). The direct cost for intensified human PET was estimated to be Nu. 5.85 million (US$ 0.11 million) per year with a cumulated estimated costs of Nu. 35.10 million (US$ 0.70 million) while the cost of mass dog vaccination with at least 70% coverage is estimated to be approximately Nu. 10.31 million (US$ 0.21 million) at the end of 6 years. The combined cost of mass dog vaccination and human PET was estimated to be greater than the cost of human PET alone during the first 2 years of the campaign, and then would be lower than human PET cost alone after the 5th year of the campaign. The total cumulated cost of the combined strategy was estimated to be Nu. 34.14 million (US$ 0.73 million) and would be lower than the cumulated cost of human PET alone (Nu. 35.10 million, US$ 0.77 million) at the end of 6 years. Rabies represents a substantial economic impact to the Bhutanese society. Well-planned and implemented mass dog vaccination would result in elimination of rabies reservoirs in the domestic dog population and would eliminate human rabies cases. It would also reduce the recurrent expenditure on human post-exposure treatment.
