Cu-64-labeled lactam bridge-cyclized α-MSH peptides for PET imaging of melanoma. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the melanoma targeting and imaging properties of (64)Cu-NOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex) {(64)Cu-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid-Gly-Gly-Nle-c[Asp-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Lys]-CONH2} and (64)Cu-DOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex) {(64)Cu-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclononane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid-GGNle-CycMSH(hex)}. Two lactam bridge-cyclized peptides, NOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex) and DOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex), were synthesized using fluorenylmethyloxy carbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry. The melanocortin-1 (MC1) receptor binding affinity of NOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex) was determined in B16/F1 melanoma cells and compared with DOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex). The melanoma targeting and imaging properties of (64)Cu-NOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex) and (64)Cu-DOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex) were determined in B16/F1 melanoma-bearing C57 mice. NOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex) and DOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex) displayed comparable MC1 receptor binding affinities (1.6 vs 2.1 nM). The substitution of DOTA with NOTA dramatically increased the melanoma uptake and decreased the renal and liver uptake of (64)Cu-NOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex). The tumor uptake of (64)Cu-NOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex) was between 12.39 ± 1.61 and 12.71 ± 2.68% ID/g at 0.5, 2, and 4 h postinjection. The accumulation of (64)Cu-NOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex) activity in normal organs was lower than 1.02% ID/g except for the kidneys 2, 4, and 24 h postinjection. The tumor/liver uptake ratios of (64)Cu-NOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex were 17.96, 16.95, and 8.02, whereas the tumor/kidney uptake ratios of (64)Cu-NOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex) were 2.52, 3.60, and 5.74 at 2, 4, and 24 h postinjection, respectively. Greater than 91% of the injected radioactivity cleared through the urinary system by 2 h postinjection. The substitution of DOTA with NOTA resulted in a dramatic increase in melanoma uptake and decrease in renal and liver uptake of (64)Cu-NOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex) as compared to (64)Cu-DOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex). High melanoma uptake coupled with low accumulation in nontarget organs suggested (64)Cu-NOTA-GGNle-CycMSH(hex) as a lead radiolabeled peptide for melanoma imaging and therapy.
