Assessment of central disorders of the statoacusticus nerve using high resolution imaging procedures (PET and MRI). Disorders of the auditory and vestibular central nervous system can be diagnosed more precisely by high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). MRI is mostly used for small intrameatal acoustic neuromas up to 10 mm, intracranial cholesteatomas, and multiple sclerosis. Positron emission tomography has advantages after acoustic or electric stimulation in the auditory cortex. PET is not yet a routine procedure in clinical diagnosis.
