Characteristics of stress Tl-201 myocardial SPECT images in patients with coronary artery lesion of just proximal portion of left anterior descending artery or high lateral branch. Noninvasive detection of coronary artery lesion of just proximal portion of left anterior descending artery (LAD) is important because of its high morbidity. It is angiographically difficult to distinguish LAD and high lateral branch (HL). Utility of stress Tl-201 myocardial SPECT images for this purpose characteristics of ischemic region induced by coronary artery lesion of just proximal portion of LAD or HL were studied in 15 patients with localized stenosis more than 75% at just proximal portion of LAD and 5 patients with localized stenosis more than 75% at HL. Width of ischemic region at basal plane of SPECT images was determined by circumferential maximum count profile analysis of stress Tl-201 myocardial images. Width of ischemic region induced by coronary artery lesion of just proximal portion of LAD was 168 +/- 34 degrees. Right margin of ischemic region was 20 +/- 6 degrees and in 10 of 15 patients right margin lay between 20 degrees and 60 degrees. Left margin was -146 +/- 40 degrees and 7 patients with left margin more than -150 degrees showed left dominant coronary artery. Width of ischemic region induced by coronary lesion of HL was 64 +/- 10 degrees. Right margin of ischemic region was 78 +/- 10 degrees and left margin was 14 +/- 10 degrees. These results showed the possibility of detecting coronary artery lesion of just proximal portion of LAD and lesion of HL by stress Tl-201 myocardial SPECT images.
