99Tcm-HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography in partial epilepsy: a preliminary report. In the pre-operative assessment of patients being considered for temporal lobe surgery, accurate lateralization and localization of the epileptic focus is mandatory. Surface electroencephalography (EEG) can be misleading and confirmatory evidence, preferably non-invasive, of the site of the epileptic focus is valuable. Sixteen patients with partial epilepsy, six of whom were considered to be good surgical candidates, had technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99Tcm-HMPAO) scanning. In those patients with poor epileptic control and a well localized EEG focus, there was a correlation between EEG and HMPAO scan abnormalities, whilst in all patients where no correlation existed, the HMPAO scan was normal. We conclude that 99Tcm-HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography may be a useful non-invasive, adjunctive investigation in the preoperative assessment of patients with partial epilepsy.
