Image reconstruction algorithm for single-photon-emission computed tomography with uniform attenuation. A new method is presented for obtaining an analytical solution to the image-reconstruction problem in single-photon-emission computed tomography. The rigorous solution is introduced by applying an analytical continuation process to the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the image, which is derived from the one-dimensional Fourier transforms of projection functions. The calculations can be carried out in a short computation time without involving unstable procedures. Numerical simulations were made to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
