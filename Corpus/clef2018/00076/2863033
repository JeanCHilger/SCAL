Limbic seizures, kindling, and psychosis: a link between neurobiology and clinical psychiatry. This interplay between basic neurobiology and clinical psychiatry helps shape clinical thinking about behavioral disorders. At a basic science level, the potential exists for elucidating the functional anatomy and physiology of CNS regions involved in kindling. These studies should aid in understanding the basic mechanisms involved in this process, thus clarifying the processes involved in the associated behavioral changes. At a clinical level, improved techniques of CNS imaging such as provided by positron emission tomography should allow better elucidation of the functional anatomy related to specific psychiatric symptoms. By combining basic science and clinical research with careful clinical diagnosis and observation, we eventually should be able to understand many aspects of human psychopathology. Such understanding will lead to improved therapeutic strategies.
