Contact dermatitis from chlorhexidine. 52 (5.4%) of 1063 eczema patients showed a positive reaction to chlorhexidine gluconate 1% aq. and/or 1% pet. on patch testing. At retesting, 21/29 (72%) were still positive and the results of use-test, anamnesis and supplementary testing indicated allergic sensitization in about 50% of these patients. Patients with leg eczema/leg ulcer seem to be particularly at risk.
