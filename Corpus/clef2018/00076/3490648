Imaging of inflammatory and infectious lesions after injection of radioiodinated monoclonal anti-granulocytes antibodies. Successful detection of inflammatory lesions by planar scintigraphy and SPECT after injection of iodine-123 labelled monoclonal antibodies directed against human granulocytes (123I-Mabgc) is demonstrated. This new tracer has been compared with indium-111 labelled white blood cells (111In-WBC) in selected patients with proven infectious lesions. Scans were equally positive in all cases, but the methodical advantages of the new marker were obvious, namely, there is no need for cell separation and the images of inflammatory lesions were better defined. In addition, SPECT could be performed with 123I-Mabgc and allowed a better anatomic localization and a three-dimensional description of the lesions. No adverse reactions have been seen. It is concluded, therefore, that 123I-Mabgc is a promising agent for the detection of acute focal inflammatory lesions which may, with advantages, replace 111In-WBC.
