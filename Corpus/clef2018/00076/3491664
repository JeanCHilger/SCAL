Alzheimer's disease: metabolic uncoupling of associative brain regions. Evidence indicates that Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes functional disconnection of neocortical association areas. In midly demented AD patients without measurable neocortically-mediated cognitive abnormalities, positron emission tomography demonstrates reduced parietal lobe glucose metabolism and left/right metabolic asymmetries in neocortical association areas. Similar metabolic abnormalities occur in moderately demented patients, but are accompanied by appropriate language and visuospatial discrepancies. Left/right metabolic asymmetries correspond with reduced numbers of partial correlations between metabolic rates in homologous right and left regions, and in the frontal and parietal cortices, indicating metabolic uncoupling among these regions. The affected association regions are those which demonstrate Alzheimer-type neuropathology post-mortem.
