Relation between geometric dimensions of coronary artery stenoses and myocardial perfusion reserve in man. To determine the relation between stenosis anatomy and perfusion in man, 31 patients had quantitative coronary arteriography and positron imaging (PET) with Rb-82 or N-13 ammonia at rest and after dipyridamole-handgrip stress. 10 patients were also studied after angioplasty (total stenoses = 41). Percent narrowing and absolute cross-sectional luminal area were related through a quadratic function to myocardial perfusion reserve determined with PET. Arteriographically determined coronary flow reserve was linearly related to relative myocardial perfusion reserve as expected, based on the derivation of equations for stenosis flow reserve. All of the correlations had considerable scatter, indicating that no single measurement derived by coronary arteriography was a good indicator of perfusion reserve by PET in individual patients. This study provides the relation between all anatomic dimensions of coronary artery stenoses and myocardial perfusion reserve in man, and suggests that PET indicates the functional significance of coronary artery stenoses for clinical purposes.
