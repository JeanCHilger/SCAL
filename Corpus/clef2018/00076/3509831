Comparison of two-dimensional echocardiography with 201T1-single photon emission computed tomography for evaluating the myocardial infarct zone. The reliability of measuring the myocardial infarct zone by two-dimensional echocardiography (2 DE) was compared with that by regional myocardial blood flow as evaluated by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 47 patients with old myocardial infarction, with ventricular aneurysm (An group n = 15), and without ventricular aneurysm (Non-An group
