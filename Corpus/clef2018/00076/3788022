Canine toxocariasis and the associated environmental contamination of urban areas in eastern Nigeria. The prevalence of canine toxocariasis in pet dogs in two urban towns in eastern Nigeria and the associated environmental contamination were studied through examination of 262 faecal and 400 soil samples. Infection rates in dogs varied from 6.67% to 42.35%, the prevalence rate being inversely related to the age of dogs. Sex and breed of dogs had no significant influence (P greater than 0.05) on the prevalence of infection. There was no evidence of widespread contamination of public places, as Toxocara ova were recovered only from some private premises, namely, those of a dog owner and the kennel of a veterinary hospital.
