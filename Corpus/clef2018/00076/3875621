Standardized mean regional method for calculating global positron emission tomographic measurements. A new "mean regional" method for calculating global hemispheric values of blood flow, blood volume, and metabolism with positron emission tomography is presented. It is based on a standardized set of regions defined according to coordinates in a stereotactic atlas of the brain. Region locations in each individual scan were determined by a localization technique that is independent of the appearance of the physiological images. Measurements obtained with this mean regional method minimize contributions from nonbrain structures such as ventricles or venous sinuses and provide the necessary basis for comparisons among different subjects and laboratories.
