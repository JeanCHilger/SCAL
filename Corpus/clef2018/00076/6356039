Positron computed tomography: a new method for quantitative determination of cardiac metabolism, blood circulation and function. I. Technical and experimental bases. Positron computed tomography represents a new method which permits qualitative and quantitative assessment of physiologic processes in different organs on a molecular basis. Thus this 'physiologic imaging device' enables noninvasive detection of regional myocardial metabolism, perfusion and global as well as regional myocardial function. The unique capability of simultaneous measurement of the interdependent parameters perfusion, metabolism and function will provide new insights in physiologic and pathophysiologic processes of the heart and, hence, in the understanding of heart disease. Since a great number of cardiac disorders is related to disturbances at the cellular and metabolic level, this new method may contribute to the early detection and eventually to an early treatment of heart disease. With improvements in instrumentation as well as the development of new physiologic indicators and small generator-like cyclotrons, positron computed tomography will become clinically more widespread in various medical centers.
