Visual cortex activation recorded by dynamic emission computed tomography of inhaled xenon 133. Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was studied tomographically with 133Xe administered by inhalation over a 1-min period at a concentration of 10 mCi/l. A fast rotating ("dynamic') single-photon emission computed tomograph with four detector heads was used, an instrument that has been found to be well suited for detecting focal ischemia. In the present study its ability to detect focal hyperemia was investigated in 13 normal subjects studied during rest and during visual stimulation. A flickering light "seen' with eyes open and closed, increased blood flow in the visual cortex by 35% and 22% respectively. Looking at different pictures displayed on a screen raised regional CBF by 26%. The most complex task, reading and copying a text, increased blood flow by 45%. Averaging the different tasks resulted in a mean regional CBF increase in the visual cortex of 35%. The result is comparable with that obtained by positron emission tomography. Both forms of isotope tomography offer unique possibilities of the study of brain function in health and disease, possibilities not matched by X-ray tomography. The low cost and ready availability of appropriate single-photon radionuclides (133Xe and 127Xe) are mentioned.
