Use of a PET in medical data logging. As a mass produced device which can be programmed according to application, the microprocessor is an obvious choice of component in hospital instrumentation for a wide range of activities from routine surveillance and process control to individual research projects. Until recently the development of an instrument from the naked processor has often proved to be labour intensive with control over both cost and timescale from design to completion difficult to maintain. Difficulties are frequently experienced in the areas of providing suitable communication channels for both data collection and immediate information for the operator and mass data storage. In our view, the arrival of the PET on the scene, as an example of a microprocessor based package including keyboard, video display, flexible I/0 ports, simple tape recorder and high level programming language has opened up new opportunities for those wishing to use microprocessors without tears. This paper describes how the authors have confirmed this view by successfully using the PET in particular data logging application. Design philosophy is discussed and gives an estimation of the limitations imposed on an approach using PET.
