The standard peritoneal permeability analysis: a tool for the assessment of peritoneal permeability characteristics in CAPD patients. Peritoneal transport characteristics in CAPD patients are often assessed by the peritoneal equilibration test (PET), which uses a four hour dwell with glucose 2.27% dialysate. From the test, the dialysate/plasma ratio of creatinine (D/PCr), the dialysate/initial dialysate ratio of glucose (D/Do) and net ultrafiltration (NUF, drained minus instilled volume) are calculated. The standard peritoneal permeability analysis (SPA) is a modification and extension of the PET: glucose 1.36% dialysate is used, to which dextran 70 (1 g/liter) is added for the calculation of fluid kinetics. Mass transfer area coefficients (MTAC's) of low molecular weight solutes, clearances of proteins and the change in intraperitoneal volume (delta IPV) can be assessed. In this study the SPA was analyzed, and a comparison with the PET was made. A total number of 138 SPA's was analyzed in 86 different clinically stable patients. Normal values were calculated for both SPA and PET parameters in the same tests. Median (ranges) of comparable transport parameters from SPA and PET were: MTACCr, 10.4 ml/min (5.7 to 19.3) glucose absorption, 61% (35 to 87)
