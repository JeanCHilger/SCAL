Enhanced tumour uptake and in vitro radiotoxicity of no-carrier-added [131I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine: implications for the targeted radiotherapy of neuroblastoma. In vitro and in vivo neuroblastoma models were used to determine whether improvements in tumour targeting in vivo and therapeutic efficacy in vitro could result from the use of no-carrier-added (n.c.a.) [131I]MIBG. Results were compared with use of the conventional therapy MIBG preparation (ex. [131I]MIBG) of lower specific activity which is produced by iodide exchange reaction. The efficacy of n.c.a. [131I]MIBG was compared with that of [131I]MIBG over a range of specific activities by the assessment of neuroblastoma spheroid growth delay. Whereas n.c.a. [131I]MIBG at a radioactivity concentration of 2 MBq/ml prevented the regrowth of 84% of spheroids, toxicity was significantly reduced by the addition of non-radiolabelled MIBG to the incubation medium. The time-dependent biodistribution of n.c.a. [131I]MIBG in nude mice bearing human neuroblastoma xenografts was compared with that of the conventional therapy radiopharmaceutical. The n.c.a. agent gave improved tumour uptake but also significantly greater accumulation in normal tissues known to accumulate MIBG such as heart, adrenal and skin. However, uptake and retention in the blood was unaltered. For all tissues examined, the 3-day calculations were undertaken to predict organ to tumour dose ratios which would result in human neuroblastoma patients with each of the [131I]MIBG preparations. These results suggest that significant therapeutic gain may be achieved by the use of n.c.a. [131I]MIBG as a treatment agent in neuroblastoma. neuroblastoma.
