First line targeted radiotherapy, a new concept in the treatment of advanced stage neuroblastoma. 33 previously untreated advanced stage neuroblastoma patients were treated with [131I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG). The number of treatments varied between 2 and 7 per patient (mean 3). Toxicity was seldom severe. Only thrombocytopenia WHO-grade 4 was noticed. Response was documented before surgery for the primary tumour was performed. There was one complete response (CR), 18 partial responses (PR), 11 had stable disease (SD) and 3 had progressive disease (PD). After MIBG therapy and surgery, 12 of 33 patients achieved a CR. This approach is feasible, comparable to multidrug chemotherapy in efficacy and less toxic. Long term results are not known yet.
