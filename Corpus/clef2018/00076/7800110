Assessment of cerebrovascular risk profiles in healthy persons: definition of research goals and the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study (ASPS). The advent of new laboratory methods and noninvasive imaging modalities has extended the diagnostic possibilities in normal individuals. This article elaborates the new options for the assessment of stroke risk offered by these techniques. In this context we present the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study, which is the first prospective long-term investigation of normals that includes Doppler sonography, magnetic resonance imaging and single photon emission computed tomography. The design, utility and limitations of this study are discussed.
