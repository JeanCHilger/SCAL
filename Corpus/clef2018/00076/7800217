99mTc-DMSA imaging with tomography in renal transplant recipients with abnormal lower urinary tracts. This study examined whether renal parenchymal imaging using 99mTc DMSA scintigraphy with tomography is a sensitive measure of renal scarring in renal transplant recipients with an abnormal lower urinary tract and whether such scars correlate with impairment of renal function. Three groups of patients were compared: group 1, patients with an abnormal lower urinary tract and deteriorating renal function (n = 9) group 2, abnormal lower urinary tract and stable renal function (n = 5)
