Positron emission tomography in tumor diagnosis and treatment follow-up. The technique of positron emission tomography (PET) is described. PET is an in vivo imaging and quantitative technique which allows the visualization of various functional and biochemical parameters. PET is a tracer technique in which bioactive tracer substances are labelled with short-lived positron emitting radionuclides. The most important of these are 15O, 13N, 11C and 18F with decay times ranging from 2 min to 2 h. The radiolabelled substance is injected intravenously and the distribution, uptake and binding are registered externally with the PET camera using of the order of 4,000 small detectors. The camera produces simultaneously 15 tomographic slices in which the absolute concentration of the tracer substance can be measured. Using a dynamic imaging sequence starting after the injection of the tracer, the dynamics of the tracer uptake is recorded and can be used to deduce functional parameters, such as perfusion flow, tracer distribution, binding to receptor or enzyme systems, etc. depending on the choice of tracer substance. The great versatility of PET and its potential of direct noninvasive study of tumor function will make it a very important clinical and research tool in oncology. With the choice of substances selective for a certain aspect of a tumor's biochemistry the potential opens for a better diagnosis, improved differential diagnosis and, especially with the use of metabolic tracers, an improved possibility to evaluate the response to treatment.
