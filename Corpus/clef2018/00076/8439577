The use of computer-assisted diagnosis in cardiac perfusion nuclear medicine studies: a review (Part 2). Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAID) is commonly used to evaluate cardiac nuclear medicine studies such as thallium perfusion scans. Part I of this series (Journal of Digital Imaging, Vol 5, No 4, pp 209-222) reviewed the basic theory underlying CAID in nuclear medicine and its use in planar thallium imaging. This review discusses the application of CAID to SPECT perfusion studies.
