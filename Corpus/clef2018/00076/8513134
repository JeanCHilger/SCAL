In vivo visualization of acetylcholinesterase with positron emission tomography. The cerebral distribution of [11C]physostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, was studied with autoradiography in rats and positron emission tomography in primates. In rat brain [11C]physostigmine radioactivity was exactly superimposable to acetylcholinesterase activity, being highest in the basal ganglia, moderate in the cortex and hippocampus, and low in the cerebellum. In primate brain, the early blood-flow dependent distribution of [11C]physostigmine was followed by a rapid redistribution to acetylcholinesterase-rich regions such as the striatum. The cerebral uptake of [11C]physostigmine was significantly reduced by competition with an excess of unlabeled physostigmine. These results suggest that [11C]physostigmine is a promising new ligand for in vivo imaging of acetylcholinesterase activity with PET.
