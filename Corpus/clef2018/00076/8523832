Assessment of myocardial fatty acid metabolism in patients with vasospastic angina using 123I-BMIPP myocardial SPECT. Myocardial perfusion and fatty acid metabolism may be unpaired in the patients of vasospastic angina (VSA), because abnormal regional wall motion of left ventricle has been shown in some cases of VSA without apparent history of myocardial infarction. To study the clinical utility of 123I-BMIPP scintigraphy in diagnosis of myocardial ischemia in VSA, both 123I-BMIPP (rest) and 201T1 (exercise) SPECT were performed in the 20 patients of VSA diagnosed by coronary angiography. Defect scores were calculated visually from the 17 segments of myocardial images and were compared with patient's anginal history, period from last attack, numbers of attack, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and severity of regional LV wall motion abnormality. 123I-BMIPP SPECT images showed decreased tracer uptake in 14 cases of 20 (70%) VSA patients. Exercise 201T1 SPECT images showed decreased tracer uptake in 3 cases of 20 (15%) of patients. Severity of regional LV wall motion abnormality was correlated with defect score of BMIPP. Though total defect score of BMIPP did not correlate with patient's anginal history, number of symptoms and LV ejection fraction, correlated inversely with period from last attack. It was suggested that 123I-BMIPP myocardial SPECT images in VSA patients showed "memories" of myocardial ischemic damages induced by vasospasm. In summary, 123I-BMIPP myocardial SPECT images could be a useful test for diagnosis and evaluation of VSA.
