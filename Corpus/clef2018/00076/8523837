Clinical application of 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT--a multicenter trial. We performed a multicenter trial of 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT for the assessment of acute thrombolysis, pre and post elective PTCA and myocardial viability in comparison with 201Tl myocardial SPECT. The participants consisted of 212 patients at 44 institutions and the study lasted for 10 months. In assessing acute thrombolysis, the perfusion defect from the acute to subacute phase was reduced by 25% and that from the subacute to chronic phase by 10%. The mean perfusion defect score at subacute and chronic phase was correlated well with regional wall motion. The mean defect score during the subacute phase could predict future wall motion abnormalities. In assessing pre and post PTCA, 99mTc-tetrofosmin stress/rest myocardial SPECT could identify the changes of perfusion as in the case with successful PTCA and/or restenosis. In assessing the myocardial viability, 99mTc-tetrofosmin rest myocardial SPECT was superior to 201Tl redistribution, and equal to 201Tl reinjection method. In summary, we concluded that 99mTc-tetrofosmin is a powerful tool, with which to diagnose and manage patients with coronary artery diseases.
