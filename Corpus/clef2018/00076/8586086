Does dyspnoea during dipyridamole cardiac stress testing indicate bronchospasm and is the pretest clinical history predictive of this side-effect? This study investigates the acute effects of intravenous dipyridamole (0.7mg/kg) on pulmonary airflow in relation to clinical parameters suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in order to assess predictive and causative factors of dyspnoea during cardiac stress testing. Mild pulmonary airflow obstruction was noted in all patients, but reached statistical significance only in small airways (FEF75-85%: -7% P=0.034). The changes in pulmonary function parameters were independent of the clinical history. Dyspnoea under dipyridamole stress testing occurred in parallel with angina, yet was not associated with ischaemic or non-ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction. These data do not support the use of dipyridamole stress testing in asthmatics, but show that (1) the acute effects of a diagnostic dose of dipyridamole on pulmonary airflow are mild even in patients with a history suggestive of COPD and (2) dyspnoea during dipyridamole testing is not necessarily indicative of bronchospasm.
