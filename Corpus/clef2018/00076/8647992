Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in cutaneous malignant lymphomas. Lymphoid cells may express somatostatin receptors (SS-Rs) on their cell surface. Therefore radiolabeled somatostatin analogues may be used to visualize SS-R-positive lymphoid neoplasms in vivo. Exact staging is the basis for treatment decisions in cutaneous malignant lymphoma. We considered the possibility that SS-R scintigraphy might offer a clinically useful method of diagnostic imaging in patients with cutaneous malignant lymphoma.We evaluated SS-R scintigraphy in comparison with conventional staging methods in the staging of cutaneous malignant lymphoma.We conducted a prospective study in 14 consecutive patients with histologically proven cutaneous malignant lymphoma. SS-R scintigraphy was compared with physical, radiologic, and bone marrow examinations. Lymph node excisions were performed in patients with palpable lymph nodes.SS-R scintigraphy was positive in the lymph nodes in all four patients with malignant lymph node infiltration and negative in the three patients with dermatopathic lymphadenopathy. In two patients, previously unsuspected lymphoma localizations were visualized by SS-R scintigraphy. In only three patients all skin lesions were visualized by SS-R scintigraphy these three patients had not been treated with topical corticosteroids. SS-R scintigraphy failed to detect an adrenal mass in one patient and bone marrow infiltration in two patients.SS-R scintigraphy may help distinguish dermatopathic lymphadenopathy from malignant lymph node infiltration in patients with cutaneous malignant lymphoma.
