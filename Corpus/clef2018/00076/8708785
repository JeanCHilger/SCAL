Evaluation of human transferrin radiolabeled with N-succinimidyl 4-[fluorine-18](fluoromethyl) benzoate. Iron metabolism plays a key role in cell proliferation and survival in rapidly growing cancer cells. Uptake is mediated by the carrier protein transferrin. The increased need for iron has been used as a method to target tumors and there is well-documented evidence that certain tumors can be imaged with tracers such as 67Ga, that mimic transferrin-mediated iron uptake. To obtain a tracer that would be better able to quantitate transferrin kinetics and indirectly evaluate iron metabolism, we have labeled human transferrin with the positron emitter, 18F, with a one-step high-specific activity method developed in our laboratory.We measured the binding affinities of [18F]diferric (holo-) and iron-free (apo-) transferrin on two human cell lines. We also compared cellular uptake of [18F]holo-transferrin and [67Ga]citrate in various conditions, and washout of label incorporated into cells.The binding affinity of [18F]holo-transferrin was found to be the same as that reported for [125I]holo-transferrin. In our hands there was no significant difference in binding affinity between diferric holo-transferrin and iron-free apo-transferrin. [18F]holo-transferrin uptake rapidly reaches a steady-state equilibrium between the intracellular and extracellular environment, while gallium accumulation linearly increases with time. [18F]holo-transferrin is rapidly recycled out of the cell with similar kinetics to those reported for [125I]holo-transferrin.[18F]holo-transferrin displays the properties of native transferrin and appears suitable for quantitative evaluation of transferrin kinetics in vivo.
