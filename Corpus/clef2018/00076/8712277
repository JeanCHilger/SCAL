Mass human exposure to rabies in New Hampshire: exposures, treatment, and cost. This study assessed the rabies exposure and treatment that at least 665 persons in Concord, NH, received as a result of one proven rabid pet-store kitten in October 1994.All treatment recipients were interviewed by person or phone.The median age of the treatment recipients was 14 years 58% were female. The most common exposures were low risk (e.g., picking up, petting, nuzzling, or being scratched by a potentially rabid kitten). Local reactions to vaccine or immune globulin were reported by 76.5% of recipients, while 48.8% reported at least one systemic reaction. Cost for the biologicals was estimated at more than $1.1 million.Because of the inadequacy of pet store records, the inconsistent application of treatment guidelines, and other factors, many people received postexposure treatment as a result of contacts that were unlikely to transmit rabies. The rates of local and systemic adverse reactions experienced were consistent with previous reports.
