The clinical role of immunoscintigraphy for the detection of ocular melanoma. The value of immunoscintigraphy in the diagnosis of choroidal melanoma is discussed and compared with other diagnostic procedures with isotopes and diagnostic modalities like fluorescein angiography, standardized ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Consecutive studies with immunoscintigraphy in choroidal melanoma show a sensitivity of 41 to 49%, which can be improved by use of single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). Another technique which has improved the results of radio-immunoscintigraphy is the use of a three-step labelling procedure with biotinylated anti-tumor antibodies and avidin. The specificity of the 225.28S antibody is discussed with regard to the expression of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG)--to which the 225.28S antibody is directed--in normal tissue and in other malignant tumours.
