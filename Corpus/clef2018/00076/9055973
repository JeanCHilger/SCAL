Effect of amount and type of dietary fiber on food intake in energy-restricted dogs. To evaluate the effect of adding different amounts of insoluble (IF) or soluble (SF) dietary fiber to a commercial diet formulated for weight reduction on satiety and perception of hunger in dogs.6 adult dogs.Test diets included 2 low-fiber control diets (CL1 and CL2), 2 diets with increased amount of IF (IF1 and IF2), and 2 diets with increased amount of SF (SF1 and SF2). Each test diet was fed for 12 days to 6 dogs in a Latin square design, and in amounts that correspond to the food allowance recommended for weight reduction. Behavioral characteristics of dogs were recorded for 30-minute periods after introduction of test diets. On 2 occasions during each test period, exactly 3 hours after feeding of the test diet, dogs were given a challenge meal consisting of a standard commercial canned dog food ad libitum. At the end of each 12-day feeding period, all dogs entered a 6-day washout period in which they were offered a standard commercial canned dog food ad libitum.Diet had no significant effect on intake of the challenge meal, intake of food during the subsequent washout period, or perception of hunger, as represented by behavioral characteristics during the 30-minute period after presentation of test diets. In addition, diet had no significant effect on percentage of weight loss.Inclusion of high amounts of IF or SF in a commercial low-energy diet has no apparent beneficial effects on satiety when fed to dogs on an energy intake regimen corresponding to allowances for weight reduction.
