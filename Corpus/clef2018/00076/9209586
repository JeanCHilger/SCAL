Oral 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose for primate PET studies without behavioral restraint: demonstration of principle. We describe a method of orally administering 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) for positron emission tomography (PET) scans to determine local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (LCMRGlc), normalized to that of whole brain, in fully conscious, non-restrained primates. Oral FDG-PET studies were performed in both non-restrained and chaired monkeys, and in one human where results could be compared with traditional intravenous FDG administration. The oral route of FDG administration gave images and whole brain-normalized PET LCMRGlc results comparable to those obtained by the intravenous route. This oral FDG-PET method may provide a useful means by which to obtain measures of LCMRGlcs for brain structures, relative to each other, in non-restrained, non-drugged primates in field and laboratory studies. This method might also have clinical applications for PET studies of children.
