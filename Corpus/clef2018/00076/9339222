Brain involvement in organophosphate poisoning. Organophosphate poisonings cause substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide however, the neurological effects have not been clearly established. We have studied cerebral perfusion to investigate neurotoxic effects. Clinical effects, plasma cholinesterase activity, and brain single photon emission computerization tomography (SPECT) data were investigated in 16 patients with organophosphate poisonings. The subjects were from an adult intensive care unit in a university hospital. Cholinesterase activity in plasma was determined upon admission and then every day in the morning. Brain SPECT studies were performed during the first week, at the end of therapy, and 3 months after discharge. Patients were classified into 3 groups using a modified Namba classification: latent poisoning (Group A)
