Activation of association auditory cortex demonstrated with functional MRI. Activations in the temporal lobes previously observed using positron emission tomography and auditory stimuli were partially reproduced with functional MRI and echo-planar imaging at 1.5 T in six volunteers performing tone and phoneme monitoring tasks. Verbal processing compared to a tone recognition task significantly activated a cortical area located in the left anterior temporal region (P < 0.02).
