PET evidence for an amodal verbal working memory system. Current models of verbal working memory assume that modality-specific representations are translated into phonological representations before entering the working memory system. We report an experiment that tests this assumption. Positron emission tomography measures were taken while subjects performed a verbal working memory task. Stimuli were presented either visually or aurally, and a visual or auditory search tasks, respectively, was used as a control. Results revealed an almost complete overlap between the active memory areas regardless of input modality. These areas included dorsolateral frontal, Broca's area, SMA, and premotor cortex in the left hemisphere bilateral superior and posterior parietal cortices and anterior cingulate
