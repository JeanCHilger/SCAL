Regional cerebral blood flow during the Wisconsin Card Sort Test in schizotypal personality disorder. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by single photon emission computed tomography in 10 patients with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) and nine age- and sex-matched normal volunteers. Subjects performed both the Wisconsin Card Sort Test (WCST) and a control task, the Symbol Matching Test (SMT). Four-way analyses of variance were performed to assess relative rCBF of the prefrontal cortex and of the medial temporal region. Normal volunteers showed more marked activation in the precentral gyrus, while SPD patients showed greater activation in the middle frontal gyrus. Relative flow in the left prefrontal cortex was correlated with better WCST performance in normal volunteers. SPD patients, however, showed no such correlations in the left prefrontal cortex, but demonstrated correlations of good and bad performance with CBF in the right middle and inferior frontal gyrus, respectively. Thus, at least some SPD patients demonstrate abnormal patterns of prefrontal activation, perhaps as a compensation for dysfunction in other regions.
