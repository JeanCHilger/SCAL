Benzodiazepine receptors in chronic cerebrovascular disease: comparison with blood flow and metabolism. The brain benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor distribution in patients with chronic cerebrovascular disease was assessed with 123I-iomazenil (IMZ) SPECT, and the findings were compared with the data for the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolism.We examined nine patients with chronic cerebrovascular diseases, six patients with cerebral infarction and three with moyamoya disease. Iodine-123-IMZ SPECT images were obtained for 15 min, 3 hr after the administration of 167 or 222 MBq 123I-IMZ. In seven patients, the CBF and oxygen metabolism were measured by the 50 steady-state method. In two patients, the CBF and glucose metabolism were measured by 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT and 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET, respectively. The brain was initially classified into 18 regions, and abnormalities in the BZD receptor distribution, CBF and cerebral metabolism were visually evaluated. The count ratio of lesion-to-contralateral normal region (L-to-C ratio) was then used for comparison.In the core of the infarct, the 123I-IMZ uptake decreased (L-to-C ratios of the blood flow 0.42 +/- 0.26 metabolism 0.45 +/- 0.24The BZD receptor distribution, as measured by 123I-IMZ SPECT, is not considered to reflect neuronal function, but it may reflect neuronal cell viability. Iodine-123-IMZ SPECT may, therefore, hold promise as a potential probe for neuronal damage.
