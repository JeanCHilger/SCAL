Myocardial technetium 99m-labeled sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging in the detection of coronary artery disease: comparison between early (15 minutes) and delayed (60 minutes) imaging. Previous studies have demonstrated that there is a "partial" myocardial redistribution of 99mTc-labeled sestamibi (MIBI) between 1 and 3 hours after intravenous injection at stress. The purpose of this prospective study was to compare MIBI single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging performed 15 and 60 minutes after the injection at stress in the detection of coronary artery disease.Thirty-five patients with coronary artery disease (26 underwent coronary angiography and 23 had a positive 201Tl study result) were included in this study. SPECT imaging started 15 minutes after the injection of 25 to 30 mCi MIBI at peak stress (180-degree arc, 32 angles, 25 sec/view, and high-resolution collimator). Patients underwent reimaging at 60 minutes according to the same protocol and with the same gamma camera. A rest study was obtained 75 minutes after the injection of MIBI (25 to 30 mCi) at rest, 48 hours later. Images (divided for a total of 19 segments per patient) were interpreted by two blinded observers for patient diagnosis and segmental comparison. The patient diagnosis was the same for the two protocols: normal = 3, ischemia = 27, and scar = 5. The segmental agreement (kappa = 0.90) was 632/665 (95.0%). The imaging performed at 15 minutes detected normal, ischemia, and scar in 413, 189, and 63 segments, respectively, whereas the imaging performed at 60 minutes detected 422, 180, and 63 segments, respectively (difference not significant). The early and delayed images were placed side by side for subjective comparison of the extent of the defect. Early imaging showed slightly larger defects in six patients, equal defects in 24 patients, and slightly smaller defects in five patients. Ischemic/normal wall ratios were 0.67 +/- 0.16 at 15 minutes and 0.68 +/- 0.15 at 60 minutes.There is no clinically significant difference between SPECT imaging performed at 15 minutes or 60 minutes after the injection of MIBI at stress. Furthermore, this study showed that it is feasible to obtain good-quality MIBI images even 15 minutes after the injection at stress.
