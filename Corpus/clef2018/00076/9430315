Positron emission tomography in children with neurofibromatosis-1. Neurofibromatosis-1 is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder commonly associated with neuropsychological complications. Focal areas of high signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans occur commonly but have shown inconsistent correlation with neuropsychological problems. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans utilizing [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and MRI studies were performed on 10 children with neurofibromatosis-1 and multiple focal areas of high signal intensity to evaluate the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose of these lesions and other central nervous system structures. Co-registered PET and MRI studies confirmed reduced glucose metabolism of large focal areas of high signal intensity. Visual inspection and semiquantitative analysis of PET images demonstrated thalamic hypometabolism and varying degrees of cortical inhomogeneity in all cases of neurofibromatosis-1 compared to normal controls. Although a primary defect of the thalamus or cerebral cortex has not been defined, the metabolic abnormalities of this study suggest a potential relationship between these structures and the neuropsychological dysfunctions noted in neurofibromatosis-1.
