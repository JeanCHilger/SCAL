Functional brain imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. High-resolution single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with brain-retained technetium-99m (99mTc)-labeled tracers may be used for 3-dimensional measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). This article summarizes important findings in SPECT studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are three distinct potential applications of SPECT in diagnosing AD: (a) as a diagnostic adjunct in patients with mild cognitive or behavioral symptoms, suggesting a possible dementia disorder (b) as a diagnostic adjunct for demented patients in whom the history, physical examination, and laboratory studies are in agreement with a diagnosis of probable AD
