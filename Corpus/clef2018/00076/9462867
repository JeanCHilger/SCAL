Functional brain imaging of episodic and semantic memory with positron emission tomography. Human memory is composed of several independent but interacting systems. These include a system for remembering general knowledge, semantic memory, and a system for recollection of personal events, episodic memory. The results of positron emission tomography (PET) studies of regional cerebral blood flow indicate that networks of distributed brain regions subserve episodic and semantic memory. Some networks seem to be generally engaged in memory processes whereas the involvement of others is specific to factors such as the type of information to be remembered or the level of retrieval success. The PET findings help to understand memory dysfunction (a) by showing that multiple brain regions are involved in different memory processes and (b) by sharpening the interpretation of the functional role of different brain regions.
