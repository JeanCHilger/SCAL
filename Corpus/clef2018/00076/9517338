Clinical comparison of magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear emission imaging in cervical-facial trauma patients. This retrospective study examined 20 consecutively treated trauma patients who reported a chief complaint of earache or trauma preauricular pain. These individuals were examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), emission study using single photon emission, computerized tomography, and joints auscultation using Doppler sound magnification. There are no statistically significant correlations between clinical findings and imaging studies in trauma patients with complaints of earaches and preauricular pain.
