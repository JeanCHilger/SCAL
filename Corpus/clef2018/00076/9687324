Diagnostic evaluation of the neck. Modern imaging for neck node metastases has increased our ability to predict the presence of palpably occult metastases and predict the resectability of large metastases. The accuracy of CT scans, MR imaging, but especially US-FNAC, has increased to such an extent that clinical consequences are being attached to negative radiologic findings in a clinically N0 neck. As not all palpably occult metastases can be detected, especially when they are micrometers, follow-up should be strict, with use of US-FNAC in the neck observed instead of treated electively.
