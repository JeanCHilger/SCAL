Improved coronary vasodilator capacity by drug lipid lowering therapy in patients in the early stage of coronary atherosclerosis with reduced coronary reserves and moderate LDL hypercholesteremia. An abnormal coronary flow reserve represents an early marker of impaired blood flow regulation in the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis under the impact of risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia. Our clinical investigation was aimed at assessing noninvasively the integrative coronary flow response to dipyridamole stress in 18 consecutive patients with microvascular angina, only moderately elevated LDL-cholesterol levels (168 +/- 33 mg/dl), and reduced vasodilator capacity despite normal (n = 9) or slightly abnormal (n = 9) coronary arteriograms (minimal disease with luminal irregularities and/or diameter reduction < or = 30%) before and after 6-month lipid-lowering therapy (simvastatin).Regional and averaged myocardial blood flow were measured at rest and after dipyridamole induced vasodilation (0.56 mg/kg) using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and N-13 ammonia as flow tracer related to a 3-compartment kinetic model. Baseline data (mean +/- SD): 13 males, 5 females mean age: 56 +/- 8 yearsAn improvement of the non-invasively determined integrative dipyridamole induced coronary vasodilator capacity may be achieved after 6 months by intensive lipid lowering at a very early stage of coronary atherosclerosis. Consequently, aggressive cholesterol-lowering therapy represents an antiischemic and antianginal approach suggesting, at least in part, functional reversal and probably prevention of further disease progression.
