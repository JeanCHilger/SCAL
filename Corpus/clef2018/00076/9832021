Geometrical response of multihole collimators. A complete theory of camera multihole collimators is presented. The geometrical system response is determined in closed form in frequency space. This closed form accounts for the known efficiency and resolution formulae for parallel beam, fan beam, cone beam and astigmatic collimators as well as for the most frequent hole array patterns and hole shapes. The point spread function in the space domain for a certain collimator and source position can be calculated via a discrete fast Fourier transform. Beside the complete theoretical definition of the response of multihole collimators, this theory allows the definition of accurate models of the geometrical response for SPECT reconstruction and it is suitable for designing new collimators.
