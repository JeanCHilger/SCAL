Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging of parotid mass lesions. Using X-ray CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) studies were performed in 28 patients with parotid lesions. All lesions except two showed higher accumulation of FDG than normal parotid gland. High accumulation was found in all of 5 carcinomas, all of 6 Warthin's tumors, and 8 of 12 pleomorphic adenomas, with standardized uptake values (SUVs) over 3.0. The mean SUVs of carcinomas, Warthin's tumors, and pleomorphic adenomas were 5.92 +/- 2.05, 7.03 +/- 2.49, and 4.07 +/- 1.55, respectively. On the other hand, all 5 inflammatory lesions demonstrated low accumulation, with mean SUVs of 1.66 +/- 0.89. It is thus difficult to differentiate malignant from benign parotid lesions by SUV on FDG-PET.
