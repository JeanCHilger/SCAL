Cardiac sympathetic nervous system in early essential hypertension assessed by 123I-MIBG. Sympathetic overactivity has been noted in various clinical stages of essential hypertension. The purpose of this study is to investigate 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake and washout in patients with borderline and mild hypertension.To assess cardiac sympathetic function in essential hypertension, we performed 123I-MIBG cardiac imaging and echocardiography in 25 normotensive, 25 borderline hypertensive and 24 mildly hypertensive men. Age and body mass index were similar in the three groups.Regarding the echocardiographic variables, the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was significantly higher in the mildly hypertensive group (125.6+/-28.6 g/m2) than in the normotensive (99.9+/-20.7 g/m2) and the borderline hypertensive (110.0+/-24.4 g/m2) groups (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Regarding the scintigraphic variables, the heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratio was significantly lower in the mildly hypertensive group (1.8+/-0.3) than in the normotensive (2.1+/-0.3) and the borderline hypertensive (2.1+/-0.2) groups. In contrast, the washout rate was significantly higher in the mildly hypertensive group (17.6%+/-10.8%) than in the normotensive (7.0%+/-4.9%) and the borderline (11.9%+/-8.9%) hypertensive groups (P< 0.001 and P< 0.02, respectively). In addition, the borderline hypertensive group had a significantly higher washout rate than the normotensive group (P < 0.05). MIBG washout rate had a strong positive correlation with LVMI (r = 0.77, P < 0.0001). In contrast, the H/M ratio had a weak negative correlation with LVMI (r = -0.40, P < 0.0006).During the course of establishment of essential hypertension, the washout rate becomes higher with the advance of hypertension and with the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, we suggest a strong relationship between cardiac sympathetic activity and the advance of hypertension at its early stages.
