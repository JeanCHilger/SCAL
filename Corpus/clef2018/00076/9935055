99mTc-MIBI scintimammography using a dedicated nuclear mammograph. This study reports on a prototype single-photon emission mammograph (SPEM) dedicated to 99mTc-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutile isonitrile (MIBI) scintimammography. Main technical features are reported together with physical performance. Preliminary patient data are also reported.The SPEM detector head is composed of a CsI(T1) scintillating array coupled to a Hamamatsu R3292 position-sensitive photomultiplier tube with crossed-wire anode. The high-resolution collimator is 35-mm thick with a 1.7-mm hole diameter and a 0.2-mm septal thickness. The electronic acquisition system is composed of five integrated cards with computation based on high-speed programmable microprocessors. The readout electronics include correction maps for on-line energy correction and spatial uniformity. The small size of the detector head allows the use of mechanical breast compression to minimize detection distance and tissue scatter. After physical SPEM performance evaluation in vivo scintimammography was performed in 29 patients and was compared with a state-of-the-art Anger camera.The SPEM showed an intrinsic spatial resolution of 2 mm, an energy resolution of 23% FWHM at 122 keV and spatial uniformities of 18% (integral) and 13.5% (differential). The SPEM imaged one 0.4-cm carcinoma missed by the Anger camera and resolved as separate lumps an irregular focal uptake on the Anger camera image. The remaining cases yielded concordant results.The SPEM prototype presented in this study shows adequate physical characteristics for 99mTc-MIBI scintimammography.
