Quantitative SPECT uptake of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid by the kidneys in children. The normal range of values for quantitative SPECT of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake by the kidneys in children was studied.Renal functioning volume, percentage of injected dose per cubic centimeter of renal tissue (%ID/ cm3) and individual kidney uptake of 270 kidneys performed on 135 children, aged 2 wk-15 y, provided the basic data for this study. The accrual was part of the work-up of children with urinary tract infection where no structural or functional abnormalities of the renal tract could be established. Children were grouped according to age intervals, and a distribution chart was obtained with 2 SD above and below the mean of the values obtained for volume (%ID/cm3) and kidney uptake in each age group.A significant correlation was found between age and functional volume (r = 0.90 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-0.92It seems that the normal maturational changes in renal function observed in infants and newborns do not affect the kidney uptake of 99mTC-DMSA. Thus, quantitation of 99mTc-DMSA uptake by the kidneys can be used to assess changes in the individual renal function over time in this age group.
