Assessment of myocardial perfusion using multisection first-pass MRI and color-coded parameter maps: a comparison to 99mTc Sesta MIBI SPECT and systolic myocardial wall thickening analysis. The most recently reported magnetic resonance first-pass myocardial perfusion studies were restricted to single slice imaging or a data analysis based on interactively placed regions of interest. This study was designed to investigate a new saturation recovery TurboFLASH sequence for multisection myocardial perfusion imaging and to develop a pixel-based software tool to calculate qualitative perfusion parameters. The findings of perfusion imaging were compared to percent systolic myocardial wall thickening analysis and 99mTc Sesta MIBI SPECT. Six healthy volunteers and twelve patients with proven coronary artery disease (CAD) or chronic myocardial infarction were examined. Diagnostic images were acquired for all volunteers and patients with the multisection saturation recovery TurboFLASH sequence. Perfusion defects could be visualized on parameter maps for signal intensity increase over baseline and signal intensity upslope. Sensitivity and specificity were 76.9% and 97.1% for first-pass perfusion MRI, and respectively 84.6% and 94.3% for CINE imaging. All perfusion defects determined with 99mTc Sesta MIBI SPECT were identified by the combined analysis of myocardial perfusion and wall thickening. The presented software demonstrated a pixel-based analysis of first-pass perfusion studies and simplified image interpretation in a clinical setting. The combination of perfusion and wall motion imaging provided complementary information for the treatment of patients suffering from CAD.
