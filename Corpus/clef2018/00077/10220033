Synthesis of a fluorine-18 labeled derivative of epibatidine for in vivo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor PET imaging. Epibatidine (exo-2-(2'-chloro-5'-pyridyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane), a natural compound isolated from the skin of the Ecuadorian poison frog Epipedobates tricolor, is the most potent nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist reported to date. In order to visualize and quantify in vivo these receptors in human brain using Positron Emission Tomography (PET), [18F]norchlorofluoroepibatidine (exo-2-(2'-[18F]fluoro-5'-pyridyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane), a fluorine-18 (t(1/2): 110 min) radiolabeled derivative of epibatidine has been designed. The corresponding 2'-bromo-, 2'-iodo- and 2'-nitro exo-2-(5'-pyridyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane analogues as labeling precursors, as well as norchlorofluoroepibatidine as a reference compound have been synthesized by reductive, stereoselective, palladium-catalyzed Heck-type coupling between an N-Boc protected azanorbornene and the corresponding halopyridine. [18F]Norchlorofluoroepibatidine has been radiolabeled with fluorine-18 by nucleophilic aromatic substitution from the corresponding Boc-protected halo- and nitro precursors using [18F]FK-K222 complex in DMSO by conventional heating (at 150-180 degrees C for 10 min) or microwave activations (at 100 Watt, for 1 to 2.5 min), followed by TFA-removal of the protective group. Typically, using the microwave activation procedure, 60-80 mCi (2.22-2.96 GBq) of pure [18F]norchlorofluoroepibatidine could be obtained in less than 2 h (110-115 min) from the bromo labeling precursor, with specific radioactivities of 1.5-2.5 Ci/micromol (55.5-92.5 GBq/micromol) calculated for End of Bombardment. The preliminary PET experiments in baboon (Papio papio) with [18F]norchlorofluoroepibatidine show a high uptake and a rapid accumulation of the radiotracer into the brain within 30 min. In the thalamus, a nAChR rich area, uptake of radioactivity reached a maximum at 40 min (10% I.D./100 mL tissue). The ratio of radioactivity thalamus/cerebellum (the latter being a nAChR poor area) was 2 at 40 min and increased with time, up to 4.3 at 160 min. Its specific regiodistribution and its high ratio of specific-to-nonspecific binding confirm the ideal profile of [18F]norchlorofluoroepibatidine as a suitable radioligand for PET imaging of nAChRs in the brain.
