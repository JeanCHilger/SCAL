Visualization of the motor activation area using SPECT in neurosurgical patients with lesions near the central sulcus. The purpose of this study was to visualize the motor area related to finger movement and a fist-making task using SPECT in patients with lesions near the central sulcus.Eleven patients (9 with a brain tumor, 1 with cerebral infarction, and 1 with an arteriovenous malformation) were investigated. The first intravenous injection of 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) for the motor activation SPECT images was administered 2 min after completion of the fist-making task with the hand contralateral to the brain lesion. The movement was stopped 2 min after injection, and activation SPECT was performed. After the scan, the second dose of 99mTc-ECD was injected into resting patients, and a second set of SPECT images was acquired. The first set of images was subtracted from the second set to obtain control images. Regions of interest were set bilaterally on the sensorimotor hand area the supplementary motor areaVisual assessment of activation images was positive in 9 patients for the sensorimotor hand area and 7 patients for the supplementary motor area. The regional percentage change between activation and resting images for the high-count areas was 19.7% for the sensorimotor hand area and 18.2% for the supplementary motor area. Both values were significantly higher than those for other areas (P<0.05).Motor activation SPECT using a 99mTc-ECD split-dose method is easy to perform and may be helpful for presurgical visualization and identification of the sensorimotor hand area or the supplementary motor area.
