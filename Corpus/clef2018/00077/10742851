Myocardial ischemia detection with adenosine administration and SPECT. Initial experience in Mexico. Myocardial perfusion SPECT has a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. Adenosine has been recently used to induce myocardial ischemia in the United States and Europe. At the present time there is not published experience using adenosine in Mexico.We studied 22 patients with suspected myocardial ischemia. Coronary angiography was performed in 17 patients. We used a 8 mCi rest Tc-99m sestamibi followed by a 6 minute infusion of adenosine at a dose of 140 ug/kg/min 24 mCi of Tc-99m were injected after the third minute of adenosine infusion. Patients returned 2 or 3 days later for a new stress study using physical stress or dipiridamole and the images were read using a 20 segments analysis and each segment was scored using a 5 points scale (0 = normal to 4 = absent uptake). The results were then compared with the adenosine images.The segmental score agreement between adenosine and physical or dipyridamole stress were good with 90% exact correlation. The side effects experienced by patients who received dipyridamole and adenosine were similar.Adenosine is a good alternative to induce myocardial ischemia. It showed a good correlation with physical or dipyridamole stress test.
