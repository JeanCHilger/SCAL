Usefulness of spect with 99mTc-tetrofosmin and stimulus with dipyridamole in patients with left bundle branch block of His. In patients with left bundle branch block, the 201Tl scintigraphic studies show high sensitivity, but with low specificity, in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.[corrected] To assess the value of 99mTc-tetrofosmin Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and dipyridamole administration in patients with left bundle branch block.22 patients with angina and left bundle branch block were retrospectively studied by cardiac catheterization and Tc-Tf after dipyridamole administration (0,142 mg/kg/min. i.v.) and at rest.The mean number of territories with perfusion defects was 1.5+/-1.0, and the average number of diseased vessels in the coronariographic study was 1.6+/-1.3 (r = 0.77, p<0.001). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, total predictive value and Kappa index in the diagnosis of multivessel disease were 92%, 90%, 92%, 90%, 91% and 0.82, respectively. In the diagnosis of anterior descending artery disease, these values were 83%, 70%, 77%, 78%, 77%, and 0.54, respectively.In patients with angina and left bundle branch block, SPECT with Tc-Tf-dipyridamole is of great value in the study of coronary artery disease extension. Sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of anterior descending artery disease were similar to that shown in series with thallium-dipyridamole.
