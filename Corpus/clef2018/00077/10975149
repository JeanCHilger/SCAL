Imaging of blocks in the spine with bone scintigraphy (SPECT). One of the most important tasks of manual therapists is the treatment of hypomobile intervertebral joints. Such conditions of the spine are treated with various manipulations or mobilisation. The pathophysiological basis of hypomobility is still under discussion. Objective criteria for the diagnosis of impaired spinal mobility are not available. Nor is any substrate detectable by X-ray, computed tomography or NMR.To find evidence of a biomechanical alteration of hypomobile intervertebral joints with the aid of SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography).13 outpatients with back pain but otherwise healthy attending the Orthopaedic University Hospital in Marburg were examined by manual medical means, and were found to have hypomobility of an intervertebral joint. In addition, the spines of these patients were examined with SPECT (bone scanning).Comparison of the results of physical examination and bone scanning revealed that in 75% of all the cases the location (spinal segment) of the hypomobility identified by each of the two methods was identical. In 83%, they were in agreement on which of the sides (facet joint) was affected.
