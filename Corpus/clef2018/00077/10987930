Stereocontrolled syntheses of deoxyribonucleosides via photoinduced electron-transfer deoxygenation of benzoyl-protected ribo- and arabinonucleosides. The stereocontrolled, de novo syntheses of beta-2'-deoxy-, alpha-2'-deoxy-, beta-3'-deoxy-, and beta-2', 3'-dideoxyribonucleosides are described. Strategically protected ribose, arabinose, and xylose glycosylation precursors were synthesized bearing C2-esters capable of directing Vorbr√ºggen glycosylation. The key step is the regioselective deoxygenation of the desired hydroxyl group as either the benzoyl- or 3-(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl derivative. This deoxygenation is accomplished via a photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) mechanism using carbazole derivatives as the photosensitizer. The syntheses of the desired deoxynucleoside generally proceed in three steps from a common, readily available precursor.
