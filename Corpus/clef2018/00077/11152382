Brain net unidirectional uptake of alpha-[14c]methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-MTrp) and its correlation with regional serotonin synthesis, tryptophan incorporation into proteins, and permeability surface area products of tryptophan and alpha-MTrp. The uptake and trapping constants for labeled tryptophan (Trp) via the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT) metabolic pathway and for the incorporation of Trp into proteins, and alpha-[14C]methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-MTrp) were measured. Measurements were done in rats treated with either saline or probenecid (200 mg/kg). In addition, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability surface area products for Trp (PS(T)) and alpha-MTrp (PSalpha) were measured in normal rats. The results suggest that, in both groups of rats, there is a highly significant correlation (p < 0.05
