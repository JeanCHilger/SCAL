Guidelines for post-exposure treatment not likely soon. Post Exposure Treatment (PET) guidelines are being developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but a clear-cut consensus among experts who gathered to develop these guidelines has not been reached. At issue is whether or not PET is effective in cases of rape, unprotected sex, condom leakage, or shared needles. The therapy consists of a 30-day regimen of antiretroviral drugs that must be taken at precise intervals. The drugs are often accompanied by severe side effects. Data on the efficacy of PET is sparse. PET critics claim that studies of the treatment efficacy among health care workers cannot be applied to those having unprotected sex or sharing needles. AIDS advocates are wary of supporting PET because they might encourage some people in high-risk groups to engage in risk-taking behavior.
