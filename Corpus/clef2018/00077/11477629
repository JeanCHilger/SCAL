Effect of graded hypo- and hypercapnia on fMRI contrast in visual cortex: quantification of T(*)(2) changes by multiecho EPI. The sensitivity of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in visual cortex to graded hypo- and hypercapnia was quantified in 10 normal subjects using single-shot multiecho echo-planar imaging (Turbo-PEPSI) with eight equidistant echo times (TEs) between 12 and 140 ms. Visual stimulation was combined with controlled hyperventilation and carbon dioxide inhalation to perform fMRI at six levels of end-expiratory pCO(2) (PETCO(2)) between 20 and 70 mm Hg. T(*)(2) in visual cortex during baseline conditions (light off) increased nonlinearly from 20 to 70 mm Hg, from 61.1 +/- 4.2 ms to 72.0 +/- 4.6 ms. Changes in T(*)(2) due to visual stimulation increased 2.1-fold, from 1.2 +/- 0.6 ms at 20 mm Hg to 2.5 +/- 0.7 ms at 50 mm Hg. An almost complete loss of functional contrast was measured at 70 mm Hg. The model of MR signal dephasing by Yablonskiy and Haacke (Mag Reson Med 199432:749-763) was used to predict changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF), which were found to be consistent with results from previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies. This study further emphasizes that global CBF changes (due to PETCO(2) changes even in the physiological range) strongly influence fMRI contrast and need to be controlled for.
