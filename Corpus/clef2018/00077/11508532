Intractable epilepsy associated with brain tumors in children: surgical modality and outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of surgical modality in children with brain tumors and intractable epilepsy.Twenty-three patients who were treated for brain tumors and intractable epilepsy between January 1985 and March 1998 were retrospectively reviewed. The most common tumors were dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (n=9), oligodendrogliomas (n=6), and gangliogliomas (n=5). Six patients exhibited cortical dysplasia. The mean duration of follow-up was 43.4 months (range 12 to 125 months). Seizure outcome was more favorable (Engel's classes I and II) in patients with a complete resection of tumor (14/14 vs 6/9 for incomplete resection P<0.05). There was no significant difference in seizure outcome between lesionectomy (n=13) and epilepsy surgery (n=10). The likelihood of requiring postoperative antiepileptic drugs was not influenced by the extent of resection or type of surgery.On the basis of this study, we conclude that the complete resection of these tumors can be an appropriate initial treatment for children with brain tumors who experience intractable epilepsy.
