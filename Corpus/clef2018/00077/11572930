Brain images of pain. Combined magneto- and encephalography proves the sequential involvement of multiple cortical structures in pain processing. Bilateral activity in secondary somatosensory cortices reflects the sensory-discriminative component and is reduced in states of unconsciousness. Later activity in the posterior cingulum reflects the emotional-aversive component, which is blocked by narcoanalgesics.
