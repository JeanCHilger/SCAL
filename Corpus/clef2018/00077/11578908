Synthesis of S-([18F]fluoromethyl)-(+)-McN5652 as a potential PET radioligand for the serotonin transporter. The present study describes the synthesis of the [18F]fluoromethyl analogue of (+)-McN5652 ([18F]FMe-McN) as a new potential tracer for the serotonin transporter. In vitro binding studies have shown that FMe-McN displays only slightly lower affinity for the serotonin transporter (K(i) = 2.3 +/- 0.1 nM) than (+)-McN5652 (K(i) = 0.72 +/- 0.2 nM). The radiofluorinated tracer [18F]FMe-McN was prepared by reaction of normethyl (+)-McN5652 with the fluoromethylation agent [18F]bromofluoromethane in an overall radiochemical yield of 5 +/- 1% (decay-corrected, related to [18F]fluoride) and with high specific radioactivity (200-2,000 GBq/micromol at the end of synthesis).
