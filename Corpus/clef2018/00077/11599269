Correction of coronary insufficiency by dihydropiridine antagonists of calcium in patients with coronary artery bypass. To study antiischemic and antianginal efficiency of adalat and its prolonged form adalat SL, dihydropiridin antagonists of calcium, in patients 1-3 years after surgical correction of stenosing coronary atherosclerosis.The drugs were tried in 40 patients with angina of effort (functional class II-III) with a satisfactory inotropic function of the left ventricle 1 to 3 years after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS). Myocardial circulation was measured with one-photon emission computed tomography using 99m-Tc-MIBI (CT).A 3-week therapy with adalat reduced the number of anginal attacks, nitroglycerin requirement, enhanced exercise tolerance. CT showed that myocardial blood flow significantly improved.Adalat proved to be effective in patients after CABS. Its prolonged form adalat SL is preferable.
