Comparative left ventricular functional and neurohumoral effects of chronic treatment with carvedilol versus metoprolol in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. The efficacy of treating dilated cardiomyopathy with metoprolol was compared with that of carvedilol. Metoprolol was administered to 29 patients, and carvedilol to 62. Patients who could not be dosed with up to 40 mg daily of metoprolol or 20 mg daily of carvedilol were defined as intolerant. As well as the tolerability of these beta-blockers, the effects on left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVDd), fractional shortening (FS), plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentrations, the delayed heart and mediastinum (H/M) ratio determined from metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging were compared. Drug intolerance occurred in 24% of patients in the metoprolol group and 19% in the carvedilol group. Among the drug-tolerant patients, LVDd, FS and plasma BNP concentration improved in both groups and to the same degree. Only 25% of drug-tolerant patients in the metoprolol group had a delayed H/M ratio below 1.9 compared with 57% in the carvedilol group. Both metoprolol and carvedilol, when tolerated, improve cardiac function and neurohumoral factors to the same degree. However, carvedilol is preferable to metoprolol for patients with a low delayed H/M ratio.
