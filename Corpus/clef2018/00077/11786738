Ga-67 scintigraphy in patients with breast lymphoma. The authors studied the utility of Ga-67 citrate scintigraphy in patients with breast lymphoma.Seven patients with histologically proved breast lymphoma were examined. In three patients, both breasts were involved, and all patients had rapidly growing breast masses. Planar and SPECT images were obtained 72 hours after injection of Ga-67.Ga-67 scintigraphy showed intense accumulation in all lymphomas. SPECT images provided better contrast than did planar images. In one of the seven patients, the axilla and mediastinum were also involved. In six of the seven patients, Ga-67 scintigraphy was also performed after treatment and showed the disappearance of Ga-67 accumulation. In one patient with local recurrence and lung involvement, abnormal accumulation was depicted on follow-up Ga-67 scintigraphy.Ga-67 scintigraphy was helpful to confirm the diagnosis and the systemic extent of lymphoma and to evaluate the therapeutic effect during follow-up in patients with breast lymphoma.
