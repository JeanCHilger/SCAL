Built to order: molecular tinkertoys from the [Re(6)(mu(3)-Se)(8)](2+) clusters. Ligand substitution of [Re(6)(mu(3)-Se)(8)(PEt(3))(5)(CH(3)CN)](SbF(6))(2) (1) with pyridyl-based ligands, 2,4,6-tri-4-pyridyl-1,3,5-triazine (L1) and 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-pyridyl)-21H,23H-porphine (L2), produced respectively the star-shaped tricluster (T1) and tetracluster (T2) arrays, wherein three (T1) and four (T2) units of the [Re(6)(mu(3)-Se)(8)](2+) core-containing clusters are interconnected by the corresponding bridging ligands. These novel supramolecular assemblies were characterized by a combination of NMR ((1)H and (31)P) spectroscopy, ESI-MS, and microanalysis. The molecular and solid-state structures of T1 have also been established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.
