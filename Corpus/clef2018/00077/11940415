Pilot study with the monoclonal antibody IOR-C5 as a potential agent of radioimmunoscintigraphy in colorectal cancer. IOR C-5 is a G1 immunoglobulin type intact murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) that was developed in the Center of Molecular Immunology in Havana City, Cuba. In immunohistochemical studies, this demonstrated a significant affinity for the epithelial tissues so that it was used in a pilot clinical study to perform a radioimmunoscintigraphy of the colorectal primary tumors and their locoregional recurrences. It was labeled with 99mTc using the Schwarz method, with a > 95% performance. Planar images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were performed at 10 minutes, 4-6 hours and 18-24 hours post-injection in the anterior and posterior projections and the SPECT was performed 4-6 hours and 18-24 hours post-injection of 1.85 GBq 99mTC. This study has aimed to verify in vivo the capacity of ior-C5 MAb to accumulate in the malignant colorectal lesions. ior-C5 accumulated in 5 out of the 7 patients who were studied and who were suffering from colorectal cancer or in whom there was suspicion of recurrence. There was a negative case of primary tumors, which was an adenocarcinoma in situ in a tubular-papillary adenoma. The second case with a negative radioimmunoscintigraphy was a true negative case.It can be concluded that even though the number of patients is quite low, ior-C5 fulfilled the expectations of recognizing the epitope expressed in colorectal tumors in an in vivo human environment.
