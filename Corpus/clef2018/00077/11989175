The working brain--how does it look like?. Numerous brain functions, such as awareness of surroundings, control of movements, thoughts, and memory have always been a kind of mystery, which has provoked human curiosity and thus inspired research in many areas. The present paper gives an overview on imaging research of the human brain's functions. The historical progress is briefly reviewed with the emphasis on major Danish contributions. The major methods of mapping brain functions and their biological basis are mentioned. These methods are positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). They are highly technological and generate enormous amounts of data. Thus, data analysis will per se be a research area in brain imaging. Finally, several examples of the authors' results on functional activation are dealt with. These examples aim to illustrate the research area and its contribution to our increased knowledge of the working brain.
