Comparison of real-time coherent contrast imaging to dipyridamole thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography for assessment of myocardial perfusion and left ventricular wall motion. Real-time coherent contrast imaging (CCI) echocardiography has the ability to evaluate wall motion and myocardial perfusion simultaneously, but its clinical applicability in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) remains to be determined. This study examines the level of agreement between real-time CCI echocardiography and thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) following stress vasodilation. Forty-two patients with known or suspected CAD underwent real-time CCI using octafluoropropane-filled microspheres infusion before and after dipyridamole and thallium-201 injections. The apical 4- and 2-chamber views were each divided into 6 segments to assess wall motion and perfusion. Real-time CCI and SPECT were interpreted independently. Thirty-eight patients successfully completed tests, and 4 had suboptimal contrast images. Each vascular territory was classified as normal or abnormal by CCI perfusion, wall motion, and SPECT at baseline and at stress. Of the 114 territories (3 in each of the 38 patients), 3 (3.5%) were not analyzed however, all territories corresponding to the left anterior descending artery were suitable for analysis. Concordance between CCI echocardiography and thallium-201 SPECT perfusion for left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary artery territories were 91%, 86%, and 69%, respectively
