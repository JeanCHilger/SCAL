Pre-operative staging of invasive breast cancer with MR mammography and/or PET: boon or bunk? This study compared pre-operative staging with MR mammography (MRM) and positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with clinically suspected breast cancer according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, category 5. A total of 43 patients with breast cancer were examined. MRM included both T(2) weighted turbo spin echo sequences and T(1) weighted gradient echo sequences (three-dimensional fast low angle shot) before and after application of gadolinium-DPTA. All patients then underwent examination with a modern full-ring PET scanner following injection of fluorodeoxyglucose. We evaluated the efficacy of these methods in the diagnosis of primary tumour, contralateral carcinomas, bifocal, trifocal or multifocal disease, as well as non-invasive cancer portions and tumour size. Determination of patients' N-status was only attempted using PET. All findings were validated by histological examination. MRM was slightly superior to PET in several areas, such as in the respective methods' sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivities for MRM and PET were: 100% vs 93.0% in diagnosis of the primary tumour 100% vs 100% in diagnosis of contralateral carcinomas
