Impact of localization studies on feasibility of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy in an endemic goiter region. A localized single-gland disease is the basis for minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). (99m)Tc sestamibi scanning (MIBI) and high-resolution Doppler ultrasonography (US) are well-established techniques used to localize enlarged parathyroid glands. Additionally, US enables physicians to diagnose subclinical thyroid abnormalities. The aim of this study was to optimize localization results, applying a combined interpretation of MIBI and US, and to analyze the influence of these results on the feasibility of MIP (endoscopic/video-assisted and open) in an endemic goiter region.One hundred fifty consecutive patients with sporadic PHPT were prospectively subjected to MIBI and US to localize parathyroid lesions and to review the morphology of the thyroid gland. Bilateral cervical exploration was performed in all patients. The feasibility of MIP was calculated retrospectively on the basis of surgical findings and biochemical outcomes at least 12 months postoperatively (normocalcemia in 148 of 150 patients [99%]).Forty-five percent of patients (67 of 148) would have been suitable for minimally invasive endoscopic or video-assisted parathyroid exploration. These procedures would have succeeded in 38% of patients (56 of 148). Sixty-four percent (94 of 148) would have been suitable for minimally invasive open parathyroidectomy, which would have succeeded in 55% (82 of 148 patients).Not all patients are suitable for MIP. A combined interpretation of MIBI and US results is helpful in planning targeted exploration. In an endemic goiter region minimally invasive open parathyroidectomy is applicable in significantly more patients than is endoscopic and video-assisted MIP.
