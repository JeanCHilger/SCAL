Expression, purification, and characterization of human enteropeptidase catalytic subunit in Escherichia coli. Enteropeptidase (synonym:enterokinase, EC 3.4.21.9) is a heterodimeric serine protease of the intestinal brush border that activates trypsinogen by highly specific cleavage of the trypsinogen activation peptide following the sequence (Asp)(4)-Lys. The DNA sequence encoding the light chain (catalytic subunit) of human enteropeptidase (GenBank Accession No. U09860) was synthesized from 26 oligonucleotides by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into plasmid pET-32a downstream to the gene of fusion partner thioredoxin immediately after the DNA sequence encoding enteropeptidase recognition site. The fusion protein thioredoxin/human enteropeptidase light chain was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain in both soluble and insoluble forms. The soluble recombinant fusion protein failed to undergo autocatalytic cleavage and activation however, autocatalytic cleavage and activation of recombinant human enteropeptidase light chain (L-HEP) were achieved by solubilization and renaturation of the fusion protein from inclusion bodies and the active L-HEP was purified on agarose-linked soybean trypsin inhibitor. The purified L-HEP cleaved the synthetic peptide substrate Gly-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-beta-naphthylamide with kinetic parameters K(m)=0.16 mM and k(cat)=115 s(-1) and small ester Z-Lys-SBzl with K(m)=140 microM, k(cat)=133 s(-1). L-HEP associated with soybean trypsin inhibitor slowly and small ester Z-Lys-SBzl cleavage was inhibited with K(i)(*)=2.3 nM. L-HEP digested thioredoxin/human epidermal growth factor fusion protein five times faster than equal activity units of bovine recombinant light chain (EKMax, Invitrogen) at the same conditions.
