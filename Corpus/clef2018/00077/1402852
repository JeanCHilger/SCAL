On the influence of spatial resolution and of the size and form of regions of interest on the measurement of regional cerebral metabolic rates by positron emission tomography. Factors that affect the accuracy of the positron emission tomographic (PET) quantification of cerebral metabolic rates include the spatial resolution of the employed imaging device and the method used for extraction of regional metabolic values from the PET data set. The present article reviews (i) how and to what extent these two factors are presumed to influence the measurement of absolute values of cerebral metabolic rates and their ratios, and (ii) whether and how these factors may affect comparisons of regional metabolic rates between groups of subjects.
