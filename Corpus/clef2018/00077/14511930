Whole-body positron emission tomography in patients with HIV-1 infection. Positron emission tomography with fluorine-18-deoxyglucose (FDG-PET) detects active lymphoid tissues during HIV-1 infection in man. We used FDG-PET to study anatomical correlates of HIV-1 infection in man. Whole-body FDG-PET images from 15 patients with HIV-1 showed distinct lymphoid tissue activation in the head and neck during acute disease, a generalised pattern of peripheral lymph-node activation at mid-stages, and involvement of abdominal lymph nodes during late disease. Unexpectedly, HIV-1 progression was evident by distinct anatomical correlates, suggesting that lymphoid tissues are engaged in a predictable sequence. Understanding the anatomy of HIV-1 infection could encourage use of surgical or radiological interventions to supplement chemotherapy.
