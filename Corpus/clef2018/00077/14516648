Electronic Generators for the Production of Positron-Emitter Labeled Radiopharmaceuticals. Where Would PET Be Without Them? The emergence of clinical positron emission tomography (PET) has enabled a routine and noninvasive assessment of cancer, neurological disorders, and coronary artery disease in humans. Vital to a sustained growth and widespread utilization of this novel methodology, in a clinical environment, is the ready and convenient availability of positron-emitter labeled radiopharmaceuticals. This requirement is aptly met by integrated radiopharmaceutical production systems or electronic radiopharmaceutical generators that comprise of: (1) a low energy, self-shielded negative ion cyclotron (2) small volume targets for the production of positron emitting precursors
