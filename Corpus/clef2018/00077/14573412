Sacral fractures: a potential pitfall of FDG positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) with FDG is useful for tumor imaging, but false-positive results can occur. The purpose of this study is to describe three oncology patients with sacral fractures in whom FDG uptake in the sacrum increased on PET.Sacral fractures can show increased uptake of FDG on PET. Therefore, correlative cross-sectional imaging is necessary to avoid the erroneous diagnosis of sacral metastases on PET and prevent inappropriate treatment of patients.
