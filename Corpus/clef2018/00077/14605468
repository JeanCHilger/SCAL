Importance of F18-fluorodeoxy-D-2-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for staging and therapy control of Hodgkin's lymphoma in childhood and adolescence - consequences for the GPOH-HD 2003 protocol. The prognosis for children and adolescents with Hodgkin's lymphoma is excellent. However, many patients will show secondary malignancies 15-30 years after the initial diagnosis, which appears to be connected with the intensity of treatment during primary disease. In the GPOH-HD 95 trial, the indication for radiotherapy was limited to patients who did not show a complete remission after chemotherapy, as determined radiographically. In the future protocol, the indication for radiotherapy in patients with early-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma should be further refined by using FDG-PET for evaluating the response to chemotherapy. Furthermore, in patients at an advanced stage of the disease, it should be determined if sequential FDG-PET research during chemotherapy can separate patients into subgroups with an excellent or a poor prognosis. This article gives a review of the current literature on FDG-PET in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma and outlines the consequences for future protocols.
