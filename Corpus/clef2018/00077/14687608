Evaluation of three quinoline-carboxamide derivatives as potential radioligands for the in vivo pet imaging of neurodegeneration. The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) are only minimally expressed in normal brain parenchyma, where they are primarily localized in glial cells. Their basal expression rises in different neurodegenerative disorders, due to the presence of infiltrating inflammatory cells and activated microglia. [11C]PK11195, a selective PBR antagonist, has been used for the in vivo PET monitoring of neurodegeneration in clinical observations. We recently developed and labeled with carbon-11 three new carboxamide derivatives: [11C]VC193M, [11C]VC195 and [11C]VC198M. Aim of this study was to evaluate these ligands for the in vivo measuring of PBRs expression in neurodegenerations and compare their kinetic behavior with that of the reference tracer [11C]PK11195. Radioligands were evaluated in a preclinical model of Huntington's disease consisting in the monolateral striatal injection of quinolinic acid (QA). Activated microglia and astrocytic gliosis was present only within the affected striatum. A concomitant increase in radioactivity accumulation was observed for all the tracers examined (P<0.01). Among the new compounds, [11C]VC195 showed higher levels of lesioned/unlesioned striatum ratios (3.28+/-0.44), in comparison with [11C]VC193M and [11C]VC198M (2.69+/-0.53 and 1.52+/-0.36, respectively), but slightly inferior to that observed for [11C]PK11195 (3.76+/-1.41).In conclusion, the results of the study indicate that [11C]VC195 is a promising candidate for in vivo PET monitoring of neurodegenerative processes but its in vivo behavior overlap that of [11C]PK11195.
