Modern pharmacotherapy of Hodgkin disease. High cure rates have been achieved in the treatment for patients with Hodgkin's disease in the past 30 years. Depending on stage at diagnosis and further risk factors up to 95% of patients with Hodgkin's disease can be cured with first-line treatment. Modern therapeutic strategies aim at both reducing therapy-induced late toxicities while maintaining effective tumor control. Patients with early stage Hodgkin's disease are now treated with a short course of chemotherapy for control of occult disease and involved field (IF) irradiation. For patients with early unfavourable stages, effectiveness of treatment shall be optimised by introducing the escalated BEACOPP schedule which has been established in the treatment of advanced stages. Questions to be answered in the treatment of advanced stages concern the optimal number of cycles of an effective chemotherapy regimen and the necessity of additional radiation therapy. The role of erythropoetin and PET-imaging is currently being evaluated in ongoing trials. In the future, new therapeutic approaches with biological agents will be of interest.
