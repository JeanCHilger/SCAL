Monkey brain areas underlying remote-controlled operation. We can control distant tools effectively by manipulating other objects as controllers in various remote-operated ways, even when the two mechanics are altered. To master the remote operation, we may rely on internal representation to organize individual moves of the controller and tool into a set of sequences by mapping the motor space among hand, controller and tool as a continuum. The present study confirmed that monkeys could also organize a sequence by mapping such a motor space or reorganize by remapping even after alteration. In addition, to investigate the neural substrates underlying such mapping/remapping, we measured the regional cerebral blood flow of two monkeys during joystick-controlled operation with alterable function of mechanics using positron emission tomography with. The monkeys were scanned during three different tasks produced by altering the directional gains of the x or y axis of the joystick - the two mechanics are congruent (standard task) and not congruent (reversed in the X or Y axis, X reverse or Y reverse task, respectively). Compared with random movement of the joystick as the control task, increased activities were detected in the prefrontal cortex, higher-ordered motor cortex, posterior parietal cortex and cerebellum during the standard task. Common brain areas during performance of the X reverse and Y reverse task were identified as showing almost the same pattern as during the standard task. These shared areas may not simply be associated with organization of individual motor imagery, but also with context-dependent processing of reorganization based on current functions by means of internal representation.
