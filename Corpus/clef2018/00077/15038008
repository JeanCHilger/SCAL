Passive perception of odors and semantic circuits. The sense of smell has been traditionally assumed to be different from other sensory modalities in that odors are encoded perceptually, without a semantic component. Recent findings of improved odor memory upon encoding with verbal cues question this view. Furthermore, familiar odors are easier to remember and discriminate than are unfamiliar ones, and odor familiarity is reported to predict odor naming. To investigate whether familiar odors are processed by different cerebral structures than those that process unfamiliar odors, (15)O H(2)O-positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of cerebral blood flow were carried out in 14 healthy men. The task was passive, birhinal, smelling of familiar odors (FAM), unfamiliar odors (uFAM), and odorless air (AIR). Significant activations (P < 0.05) were calculated using the contrasts FAM-AIR, uFAM-AIR, and FAM-uFAM, and deactivations running these contrasts in the opposite direction. In relation to AIR, both FAM and uFAM activated amygdala, piriform cortex, and parts of anterior cingulate cortex. FAM activated, in addition, left frontal cortex (Brodmann's areas 44,45,47), left parietal cortex incorporating precuneus, and right parahippocampus. Clusters covering parahippocampus and precuneus were observed also in FAM-uFAM. The activation of left frontal cortex and right parahippocampus was positively correlated with familiarity ratings. Smelling of familiar but not unfamiliar odorants seems to engage cerebral circuits mediating memory and language functions, in addition to the engagement of olfactory cortex. Already the most elemental form of odor processing, passive perception thus seems to engage semantic circuits. This is achieved by the ability of odorants to immediately elicit associations and judgments of odor characteristics.
