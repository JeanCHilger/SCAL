Relationship between lung-to-heart uptake ratio of technetium-99m-tetrofosmin during exercise myocardial single photon emission computed tomographic imaging and the number of diseased coronary arteries in patients with effort angina pectoris without myocardial infarction. Increased lung uptake of thallium-201 in exercise myocardial perfusion imaging is a reliable marker of multivessel disease in patients with ischemic heart disease. This study investigated whether the lung-to-heart uptake ratio with techenetium-99m(99mTc)-tetrofosmin also provides valuable information to detect patients with multivessel disease.Fifty-three consecutive patients (35 men, 18 women, mean age 66 +/- 11 years single-vessel disease: 29, double-vessel disease: 16, triple-vessel disease: 8) with stable effort angina pectoris without prior myocardial infarction and 17 control subjects (12 men, 5 women, mean age 62 +/- 9 years) underwent exercise myocardial perfusion imaging with 99mTc-tetrofosmin and coronary angiography in January 2000 to December 2002. The lung-to-heart uptake ratio was calculated on an anterior projection before reconstruction of the exercise single photon emission computed tomographic images.The mean lung-to-heart uptake ratio was 0.34 +/- 0.04, 0.38 +/- 0.07, 0.41 +/- 0.05, and 0.46 +/- 0.09, in patients with normal coronary, single-vessel disease, double-vessel disease, and triple-vessel disease, respectively. Significantly higher lung-to-heart uptake ratio was associated with more diseased vessels (p < 0.05). Multivessel disease could be detected with a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 74% if the cut-off point of the lung-to-heart uptake ratio was set as 0.4. Combining lung-to-heart uptake ratio with conventional myocardial perfusion imaging improved the sensitivity to detect multivessel disease to 83% and the specificity to 74%.Lung-to-heart uptake ratio measured by exercise myocardial scintigraphy with 99mTc-tetrofosmin can provide clinically useful information to detect multivessel disease in patients with ischemic heart disease.
