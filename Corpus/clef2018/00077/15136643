The diagnostic and prognostic value of ECG-gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging. Since the development of gated SPECT imaging approximately 10 y ago, this technique is now almost universally used as an adjunct for radionuclide perfusion imaging, enabling the assessment of perfusion along with determination of regional and global left ventricular function in the same examination. The gated SPECT determination of the left ventricular ejection fraction and volumes has been extensively validated. Additionally, this method allows for the improved identification of soft-tissue artifacts and enhances the detection of multivessel coronary artery disease. Furthermore, gated SPECT provides powerful information for the risk assessment of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease and aids in the assessment of myocardial viability. Gated SPECT imaging has clearly become an integral part of radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging.
