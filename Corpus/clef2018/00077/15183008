Introduction to PET imaging with emphasis on biomedical research. Medical imaging is migrating from anatomic imaging to functional imaging and fused anatomic/functional imaging. The technology is being adapted for biomedical research using both clinical and small animal scanners. The ability to externally image real-time physiologic processes in both normal and deranged conditions, including various models to image gene expression, apoptosis, or drug biodistribution, has powerful impact on the exploration of biomedical and fundamental biological research. Positron emission tomography (PET) has a unique ability to not only provide such images but also to do so with high resolution (typically 1-2mm resolution for small animal scanners) and to provide both relative and absolute quantitation. This technology is revolutionizing biomedical and biological research. This article reviews the underlying principles involved in this technology, gives a brief history of its development, and then introduces the interested researcher to some of the important techniques that could be of use.
