Using genetic technologies for promoting canine health and temperament. The entire canine genome is scheduled to be sequenced by researchers at the Whitehead Institute/MIH Center for Genome Research by the end of 2004. Thus, new genetic technologies are likely to be developed that can soon predict certain aspects of health and temperament in dogs. The C. familiaris is similar in size to that of humans and other mammals, with an estimated 2.8 billion base pairs. Although, the boxer was chosen as the first breed to sequence, it will have application for all dog breeds. Once the entire genome is sequenced, genetic markers for specific diseases and temperaments may be developed, which can guide breeders to make informed decisions concerning breeding management. Such a technology may be useful for guide and service dog organizations that have breeding colonies. It is important that the human-animal bond be preserved for as long as possible, both for pet owners and also for those disabled individuals who depend upon a dog for independence and mobility. Because genetic diseases may not manifest in carriers, and some genetic diseases do not manifest until after a dog is older and has already produced other animals with the same defect, genetic markers to identify some of the over 400 genetic diseases could be very useful in promoting canine health.
