New approaches to the treatment of ischemic heart disease: therapeutic angiogenesis in combination with surgical revascularization of the myocardium. To evaluate the results of surgical treatment of patients with ischemic heart disease in combination with intraoperative intramyocardial introduction of the human gene VEGF165 (angiostimulin).Twenty four patients enrolled in the study were examined using 12-lead ECG, echocardiography, treadmill exercise test, single-photon emission computed tomography of the myocardium with Tc-99m-tetrophosmine, fluorodesoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography of the myocardium, selective coronarography. Out of 24 patients, 10 patients have been reexamined so far. The effect of the treatment was assessed by the data obtained at the treadmill test, transthoracic echocardiography, myocardial scintigraphy and FDG.All the patients demonstrated a clinical response. The class of effort angina improved, the dose of the prescribed nitric drugs was decreased, exercise tolerance and total stress time rose, quality of life improved. Myocardial scintigraphy registered reduction of the total area and better accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical under load and at rest 3 and 6 months after the operation including myocardial areas which had not been revacularised at coronary artery bypass grafting but had been treated with the preparation of the human gene VEGF165.The results of the study suggest that therapeutic angiogenesis may be an alternative impact on those myocardial areas which are supplied by the affected but ineligible for bypass grafting coronary arteries.
