A [17F]-fluoromethane PET/TMS study of effective connectivity. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in combination with positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the effective connectivity of four cortical regions within the same study. By employing [17F]-[CH3F] ([17F]-fluoromethane) as a radiotracer of blood-flow, we were able to obtain increased sensitivity compared to [15O]-H2O for both cortical and subcortical structures. The brain areas investigated were left primary motor cortex, right primary visual cortex, and left and right prefrontal areas. We found that each site of stimulation yielded a different pattern of activation/deactivation consistent with its anatomical connectivity. Moreover, we found that TMS of prefrontal and motor cortical areas gave rise to trans-synaptic activation of subcortical circuits.
