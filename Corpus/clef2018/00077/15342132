Effect of sensory stimulus on striatal dopamine release in humans and cats: a [(11)C]raclopride PET study. Sensory stimulation of the forelimb extremities constitutes a well-established experimental model that has consistently shown to activate dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in the mammals' forebrain.To visualize in vivo this modification of striatal DA release in healthy human volunteers using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and [(11)C]raclopride. Experiments in humans were paralleled by experiments in anesthetized cats. Changes in endogenous DA release were assessed through its competition with [(11)C]raclopride binding (BP(raclo)), a radioligand probing DA D2-receptors.In humans no significant difference of BP(raclo) in caudate (with sensory stimulation: 2.0 +/- 0.3 versus without sensory stimulation: 2.2 +/- 0.3 P = 0.3) or putamen (2.6 +/- 0.3 versus 2.6 +/- 0.2This suggests that the DA release induced by sensory stimulus is mostly extrasynaptic whereas the synaptic DA release is probably small, which fits well with the absence of [(11)C]raclopride displacement. The mechanism of this extrasynaptic DA release could be related to a local action of glutamate on dopaminergic terminals via a thalamo-cortico-striatal loop. Present results also underline homology between cat and human responses to sensory stimuli and validate the use of cat brain to find physiological concepts in humans.
