Prevalence and angiographic significance of normal myocardial perfusion SPECT with positive exercise electrocardiogram. In a consecutive series of 7350 myocardial perfusion SPECT studies, 66 (0.9%) nonrevascularized patients with a normal resting ECG had normal scintigraphic findings with a positive ECG in the exercise test. We retrospectively analyzed 33 patients with coronary angiography, 26 of whom were women (P< .000). Twenty one of the 26 women (81%) and 1 of the 7 men (14%) had normal coronary angiographic findings (P= .004). Seven out of 11 patients with coronary heart disease had left main coronary artery or multivessel disease. We conclude that the "normal SPET with positive ECG" pattern is infrequent, and is observed predominantly in women with normal coronary angiographic findings. However, severe coronary artery disease cannot be ruled out in these patients, and this pattern should be considered a possible indication for coronary angiography.
