Imaging of central nAChReceptors with 2-[18F]F-A85380: optimized synthesis and in vitro evaluation in Alzheimer's disease. In vivo labeling of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) could be a useful tool for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. 2-[18F]F-A85380 (2-[18F]Fluoro-3-[2(S)-2-azetidinylmethoxy]pyridine), a ligand with high affinity to the beta2 subunit of the nAChRs, has been shown to label neurons in the nAChR-rich thalamus, cortex and striatum in baboons. We report an optimized synthesis resulting in an uncorrected yield of 58% in 45 min (precursor 2), enabling efficient production intended for clinical use. Incubation of normal rat brain sections with 2-[18F]F-A85380 with subsequent autoradiographic analyses showed the expected distribution in nAChR areas. In human brain sections of Alzheimer's disease (AD) a decrease of 2-[18F]F-A85380 uptake to 36% of the control group was measured in the thalamus and also in the occipital cortex. These findings suggest that 2-[18F]F-A85380 is a promising PET-ligand in the diagnosis of AD.
