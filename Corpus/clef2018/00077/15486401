Depreotide scanning in sarcoidosis: a pilot study. To determine whether sarcoidosis results in uptake on (99m)Tc-labeled depreotide (DP) scintigraphy and to generate preliminary data to guide the development of future trials exploring this imaging modality in sarcoidosis patients.Prospective cohort trial among a convenience sample of patients with sarcoidosis.Tertiary care medical center pulmonary clinic.Subjects in whom sarcoidosis has been diagnosed based on a biopsy revealing nonnecrotizing granulomas.Two hours after IV administration of (99m)Tc-DP, all patients underwent whole-body anterior and posterior planar imaging, followed by thoracic single-photon emission CT scanning. Images were interpreted by two nuclear medicine physicians who were blinded to the patient's clinical status.The study cohort included 22 subjects (mean [+/- SD] age, 41.3 +/- 9.3 years 40% female). Approximately half of the cohort had stage I disease determined by chest radiographs (CXRs). The results of (99m)Tc-DP scintigraphy were positive for sarcoidosis in 18 individuals (81.8%The results of (99m)Tc-DP imaging are often positive in sarcoidosis patients, and correlate with disease stage determined by CXR and pulmonary function. (99m)Tc-DP scintigraphy does not preclude the need for biopsy if this is indicated to confirm the diagnosis of sarcoidosis or to exclude the possibility of malignancy. (99m)Tc-DP scintigraphy merits further study in the evaluation and management of sarcoidosis.
