Lung scintigraphy with technetium 99m depreotide in the assessment of solitary pulmonary nodules. A solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is defined as a parenchymal lesion measuring less than 3 cm in diameter that is not associated with other lesions. Ninety percent of SPNs are discovered incidentally and most are benign. The management of radiographically indeterminate SPNs has not been established and invasive procedures must be undertaken in order to understand the nature of the nodule. We review our experience with the use of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy with technetium Tc99m depreotide in 10 patients with suspected malignant SPN. We discuss the limitations and applications of this technique in the evaluation of whether SPNs are benign or malignant for the purpose of identifying patients for biopsy. For this application, this technique can be considered an alternative to positron emission tomography using fluorine-18 fluordeoxyglucose.
