A novel fluorescent sensor for triplex DNA. A triplex DNA fluorescent sensor based on PET is described. The sensor takes 4-aminonaphthalimide as a reporting group and a triplex-select intercalator as a recognizing group. The results show that it is a selective sensor for T.AT triplex DNA in compared with duplex and ssDNA by fluorescence enhancement in PIPES 20 buffer.
