Markers of myocardial reperfusion as predictors of left ventricular function recovery in acute myocardial infarction treated with primary angioplasty. Myocardial blush grade (MBG), corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC), and ST-segment reduction are indices of myocardial reperfusion.We evaluated their predictive value for left ventricular (LV) function recovery by gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).In 40 patients with AMI, gated SPECT was performed at admission and repeated 7 and 30 days after PCI. Left ventricular function recovery was defined as an increase > or = 10 points in SPECT LV ejection fraction from baseline to 1 month. The MBG, cTFC, and ST-segment elevation index 1 h after PCI were determined to evaluate reperfusion.Twenty-four patients (Group 1) had LV function recovery and 16 (Group 2) did not. A significant correlation was found between LV function recovery and MBG (r = 0.66 p = 0.0001), and ST-segment elevation index at 1 h (r = -0.55Myocardial blush grade was the best parameter for prediction of LV function recovery: MBG > or = 2 and ST-segment elevation index reduction showed good accuracy in predicting LV function recovery. The cTFC failed to be a significant predictor.
