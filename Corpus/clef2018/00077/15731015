X-ray imaging physics for nuclear medicine technologists. Part 2: X-ray interactions and image formation. The purpose is to review in a 4-part series: (i) the basic principles of x-ray production, (ii) x-ray interactions and data capture/conversion, (iii) acquisition/creation of the CT image, and (iv) operational details of a modern multislice CT scanner integrated with a PET scanner. In part 1, the production and characteristics of x-rays were reviewed. In this article, the principles of x-ray interactions and image formation are discussed, in preparation for a general review of CT (part 3) and a more detailed investigation of PET/CT scanners in part 4.
