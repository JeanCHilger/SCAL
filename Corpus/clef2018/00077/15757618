Left ventricular function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study showed that the mean left ventricular ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and muscle mass are comparable in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus to gender-matched patients who do not have diabetes mellitus, but abnormal ejection fraction is more common in men, although not in women, with diabetes mellitus than without. The ejection fraction was higher and the volumes and muscle mass were lower in women than men in the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus.
