Sestamibi scans are not all created equally. The sensitivity of sestamibi scanning techniques used for preoperative localization in primary hyperparathyroidism is a function of the parameters of image acquisition and processing.Criterion standard vs optimized technique.Tertiary referral center.One hundred forty-eight consecutive patients with primary hyperthyroidism were analyzed. Under the initial protocol, 97 patients underwent a preexisting standard sestamibi--single-photon emission computed tomographic scan and surgical exploration. The scanning technique was modified and in the revised protocol, 51 patients underwent imaging and surgical exploration.Image acquisition and processing revisions as follows: patient positioning standardized, collimator resolution adjusted, radioactive tracer delay extended, visualization field broadened, data extraction refined, and image processing filter modified.concordance among the scan and operative localization, lateralization, and cure rate.Initial protocol: 97 patients underwent surgery for primary hyperthyroidism with the initial sestamibi design. Eighty-one patients (83%) had a positive result, that is, at least 1 gland was identified 77 patients (79%) had correct lateralizationSestamibi optimization in primary hyperparathyroidism can improve scan sensitivity. This may permit a focused minimally invasive operation.
