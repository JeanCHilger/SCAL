Functional neuroimaging in motor recovery after stroke. Neuroimaging techniques provide information on the neural substrates underlying functional recovery after stroke, the number one cause of long-term disability. Despite the methodological difficulties, they promise to offer insight into the mechanisms by which therapeutic interventions can modulate human cortical plasticity. This information should lead to the development of new, targeted interventions to maximize recovery.
