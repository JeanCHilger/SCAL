Scintigraphic molecular imaging. Modern medicine is currently focusing its basic and clinical research towards "molecular medicine". This trend, together with the decoding of the human genome and the resulting design and use of transgenic mouse models of human diseases, demands that innovative imaging approaches are developed for man and mice. Non-invasive imaging modalities capable of quantifying molecular processes in vivo (collectively defined as "molecular imaging" techniques) are extremely interesting in this respect. This review focuses on the clinical and experimental scintigraphic molecular-imaging modalities SPECT and PET, and summarizes their actual and future impact in medicine.
