Results of FDG-PET scanning in the pre-operative staging of broncho-pulmonary tumors. Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has recently established itself as an important imaging strategy in the management of respectable non-small cell bronchial carcinoma (NSCLC). In this study we report our experience of the impact of FDG-PET in the pre-operative assessment of NSCLC.In a single centre retrospective study between 01 January 2000 and 31 Dec 2002, 108 FDGPET scans were performed during the preoperative assessment of histologically proven or strongly suspected NSCLC.The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of FDG-PET for the characterization of a parenchymatous opacity were 96%, 71% and 92% respectively (4 false negatives, 5 false positives). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for mediastinal node involvement were 62%, 94% and 84% respectively (10 false negatives and 4 false positives). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the characterization of adrenal nodules were 88%, 100% and 97% (1 false negative) and for satellite pulmonary nodules 50%, 75% and 64% (2 false negatives and 3 false positives).FDG-PET is a useful imaging modality in the pre-operative management of NSCLC but is limited particularly in the characterization of lesions less than 10 mm in diameter and in the evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes.
