Relationship between antisocial behavior and regional cerebral blood flow in frontotemporal dementia. To examine the relationship between antisocial behaviors and reduction of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD).Brain perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed in 22 patients with FTD and 76 age-matched healthy volunteers. The statistical analysis was conducted using the SPM99 software. The antisocial behavioral symptoms were assessed independently by three geriatric psychiatrists, who had not been given the information of the SPECT images.Compared with normal controls, FTD patients showed significant reduction of rCBF in the widespread frontal cortical areas. The correlation analysis showed that antisocial behavioral symptoms are associated with reduction of rCBF in the orbitofrontal cortex.The functional decline of orbitofrontal cortex is related to antisocial behavioral symptoms in patients with FTD.
