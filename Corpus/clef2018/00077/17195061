Nuclear medical diagnostics for liver tumors. Standard nuclear medical procedures, such as functional, blood-pool and colloid scintigraphy, play a minor role in the routine workup of liver tumors. However, these techniques are capable of assessing specific organ functions and frequently allow the diagnosis of unclear liver lesions. The sensitivity of scintigraphic procedures can be increased using tomographic imaging (SPECT), the specificity with the introduction of hybrid scanners such as SPECT/CT. Whole body positron emission tomography with 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) in combination with CT scanning (PET/CT) represents one of the most sensitive imaging modalities for the detection of hepatic metastases and extrahepatic tumor manifestations. For the staging and follow-up of colorectal cancer, FDG-PET/CT represents a standard imaging modality. Metastases from neuroendocrine tumors can be detected using PET and specific tracers such as [68Ga]DOTATOC and [18F]DOPA. Molecular imaging with PET allows the quantification of metabolic processes which can be used for the assessment of an early response to treatment.
