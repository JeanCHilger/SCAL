Limitations of the HMPAO SPECT appearances of occipital lobe perfusion in the differential diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies. To assess the utility of the appearances of occipital lobe perfusion on HMPAO SPECT in the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) using the 123I-FP-CIT findings as the diagnostic 'gold standard'.Eighty-four consecutive patients underwent both HMPAO SPECT and 123I-FP-CIT as part of their routine investigations for suspected DLB.Thirty-nine of the 84 FP-CIT scans were abnormal indicating a prevalence of 44% of patients with DLB in this series. In those patients classified as DLB, 28% of HMPAO SPECT scans demonstrated occipital hypoperfusion. In those patients with a dementia other than DLB 31% of patients demonstrated occipital hypoperfusion (P=0.8).Occipital lobe hypoperfusion as demonstrated by HMPAO SPECT in patients with suspected Lewy body dementia does not appear to be able to either rule in, or rule out, the diagnosis of DLB.
