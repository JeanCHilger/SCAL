Synthesis and evaluation of fluorine-18-labeled SA4503 as a selective sigma1 receptor ligand for positron emission tomography. The [(18)F]fluoromethyl analog of the sigma(1) selective ligand 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine dihydrochloride (SA4503) ([(18)F]FM-SA4503) was prepared and its potential evaluated for the in vivo measurement of sigma(1) receptors with positron emission tomography (PET). FM-SA4503 had selective affinity for the sigma(1) receptor (K(i) for sigma(1) receptor, 6.4 nM K(i) for sigma(2) receptor, 250 nM) that was compatible with the affinity of SA4503 (K(i) for sigma(1) receptor, 4.4 nM
