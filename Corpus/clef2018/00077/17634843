Effectiveness of treatment with donepezil hydrochloride and changes in regional cerebral blood flow in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study was to elucidate the relationship between the effects of donepezil hydrochloride (donepezil) and cerebral blood flow, and to evaluate the usefulness of cerebral blood flow imaging in assessing and predicting treatment effectiveness.The subjects were 29 outpatients (12 men and 17 women age 50-82 yearsOn the basis of ADAS-cog score improvement, 22 of the 29 patients were responders (7 men and 15 women age 50-82 yearsIn cognitive function testing, the group that exhibited a complete response showed improvement primarily in parameters reflecting frontal lobe function. Complete responders also showed significantly greater blood flow increases in the basal ganglion and thalamus early during the treatment period. This indicates that the drug responsiveness of the basal ganglion and thalamus affects frontal lobe function and distinguishes complete responders from patients who do not exhibit such a response.
