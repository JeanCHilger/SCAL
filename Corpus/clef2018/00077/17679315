Vagus nerve stimulation for severe depression. Treatment-resistant depression is a serious problem with significant costs in terms of health care dollars and patients' well-being. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is one novel, device-based therapy that may be effective in this population. In this article, we review the evidence to date on the use of VNS in major depression and describe the process of VNS treatment initiation, device implantation, and dosage adjustment and monitoring. It is important for psychiatric nurses to understand the evidence base for and how VNS is used in treatment so they may enhance care of patients with treatment-resistant depression.
