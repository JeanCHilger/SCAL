The single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography: a new procedure to perform the sentinel node biopsy in patients with head and neck melanoma. The aim of this study was to define and validate a new technique to detect the sentinel node (SN) in patients treated for head and neck melanoma. In a small series of 23 head and neck melanoma patients, lymphatic mapping was followed by SN biopsy, using in 12 patients a new diagnostic imaging technique, single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography. The procedure is described and the major problems encountered are discussed. The preliminary data show that identification of SN using single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography never failed in 12 patients, and biopsies performed, compared with those in a standard group, took significantly less time (Mann-Whitney test P=0.006). In conclusion, the authors underline the possibility of a wide use for this technique.
