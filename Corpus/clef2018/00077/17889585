Image-guided radiotherapy. Recent advances in radiation oncology are based on improvement in dose distribution thanks to IMRT and improvement in target definition through new diagnostic imaging such as spectroscopic or functional MRI or PET. However, anatomic variations may occur during treatment decreasing the benefit of such optimization. Image-guided radiotherapy reduces geometric uncertainties occurring during treatment and therefore should reduce dose delivered to healthy tissues and enable dose escalation to enhance tumour control. However, IGRT experience is still limited, while a wide panel of IGRT modalities is available. A strong quality control is required for safety and proper evaluation of the clinical benefit of IGRT combined or not with IMRT.
