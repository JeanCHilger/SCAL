Functional imaging in temporal lobe epilepsy. This article highlights the importance of functional imaging methods in the diagnosis and preoperative planning in temporal lobe epilepsy TLE). It starts with a discussion of the role of ictal and interictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and interictal positron emission tomography (PET) in lateralizing TLE. The next section discusses the role of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and perfusion MRI, particularly for lateralization of language and memory in TLE patients. The final section explores the relatively new role that the emerging technique of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is playing in the evaluation of TLE.
