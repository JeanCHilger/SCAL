Assessment of left ventricular dyssynchrony during development of heart failure by a novel program using ECG-gated myocardial perfusion SPECT. A novel program, "cardioGRAF", has been developed to analyze regional left ventricular (LV) systolic/diastolic function and dyssynchrony, so the present study aimed to use it confirm the presence of LV dyssynchrony, and to correlate LV function and dyssynchrony with plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels during the early to advanced stages of heart failure (HF).Fourteen control subjects (G-C) and 50 patients (New York Heart Association functional class I: G-1, 21 patients class II: G-2, 15 patientsDiastolic dyssynchrony was demonstrated even in the early stage of HF, but, although not correlated with the plasma BNP level, systolic dyssynchrony might affect it.
