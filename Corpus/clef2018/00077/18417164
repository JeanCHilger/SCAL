Ictal single photon computed tomography and SISCOM: methods and utility. Ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) reflects epileptic activity through hyperperfusion associated with ictal discharge. It provides valuable spatial information on ictal activity, but its temporal resolution is limited. Therefore, information provided by SPECT is not restricted to the epileptogenic zone, but demonstrates a larger epileptogenic network, related to the spatiotemporal dynamics of ictal processes. This review includes a description of the technique, followed by a description of the different parameters likely to influence the ictal perfusion images. SPECT gives contributes original diagnostic data to the decision-making process which will complete, the other evaluation parameters.
