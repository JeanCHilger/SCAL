Effect of intramyocardial bone marrow cell injection on diastolic function in patients with chronic myocardial ischemia. To evaluate the effect of intramyocardial bone marrow cell injection on diastolic function in patients with chronic myocardial ischemia.In 24 patients (19 male 65 +/- 9 years) with refractory angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society [CCS] class III-IV) 84.6 +/- 28.7 x 10(6) bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells were injected intramyocardially (using the NOGA system) in regions with ischemia on Tc-99m tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Diastolic function was evaluated at baseline and at three months using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI).MRI revealed an increased early (E) peak filling rate (374 +/- 121 mL/second vs. 412 +/- 102 mL/second P = 0.04), whereas the atrial (A) peak filling rate remained unchanged (340 +/- 81 mL/second vs. 334 +/- 93 mL/secondIntramyocardial bone marrow cell injection in patients with chronic myocardial ischemia improved MRI and TDI-derived parameters of diastolic function.
