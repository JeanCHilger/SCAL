Epilepsy due to malformations of cortical development--correlation of clinical, MRI and Tc-99mECD SPECT findings. Malformations of cortical development (MCD) have been increasingly recognized as an important cause of intractable epilepsy. The aim of our study was to define epileptogenicity of MCDs by correlating MRI, EEG and semiology of epileptic attacks, and to determine the effect of MCD on drug resistant epilepsy. We also intended to reveal the utility of interictal single photo emission computed tomography (SPECT) in verification of MCD lesions and relative prevalence of different MCDs. Based on interictal EEG finding, semiology of the epileptic attacks and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) "electroclinical epileptogenicity" of MCD was defined. Brain MRI revealed cortical dysplasia (CD) in nine patients, polymicrogyria in four patients, lissencephaly and schizencephaly in one patient each. Three patients had a combination of malformations. The localization of SPECT hypoperfusion corresponded to MCD lesion in ten (66.67%) patients. Electroclinically confirmed epileptogenicity of MCD overlapped with MR and interictal SPECT findings in fourteen (93.3%) and nine (60.0%) patients, respectively. Our study results demonstrated the MCD lesions to be highly epileptogenic and a frequent cause of intractability.
