Role of PET-CT in the follow-up of treated tumors of the head and neck. F-18 FDG PET-CT is a well established medical imaging technique used routinely for the follow-up of treated head and neck tumors. Currently, PET-CT is performed 4 months after the end of therapy to assess its efficacy. More recently it has been suggested that this delay could be reduced to one month with major therapeutic implications. During follow-up, PET-CT could improve sensitivity and specificity compared to other imaging techniques. Moreover, since PET-CT is a "whole body technique", it allows restaging in a single procedure.
