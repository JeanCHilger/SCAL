A comparison between CT and SPECT in detecting mandibular invasion by lower gingival squamous cell carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to compare the value of CT and SPECT in diagnosis of lower gingival carcinoma invading the mandible.From February 2002 to October 2006, twenty-one patients with lower gingival squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled.The data of CT and SPECT were studied,and compared with histopathological findings.Among the 21 patients,the sensitivity, accuracy, negative predictive value and Youden's index of SPECT were 100.00%, 95.24%, 100.00% and 1.00,respectively. While the sensitivity, accuracy, negative predictive value and Youden's index of CT were 80.00%, 80.95%, 20.00% and 0.80, respectively. There were four false negatives assessments of bone invasion(80.00%) by CT scan, while no false negatives by SPECT.SPECT is superior to CT, and can be used as a routine screening method to assess lower gingival carcinoma invading the mandible.
