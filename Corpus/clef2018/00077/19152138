Imaging diabetes mellitus with coronary computed tomography angiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance, and positron emission tomography. The prevalence and medical expense associated with diabetes mellitus continue to increase. Using the diagnostic imaging techniques of coronary computed tomography angiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance, and positron emission tomography, it may be possible to make earlier, non-invasive diagnoses of the type and extent of disease, thereby preventing or delaying some morbidity and mortality.
