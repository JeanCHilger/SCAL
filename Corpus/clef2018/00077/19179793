Localized cerebral blood flow changes in response to ADL-related vitality in elderly patients with dementia using single photon emission computed tomography. To clarify the area in the brain related to responsible for vitality and volition.We studied 123 outpatients (39 men, 84 women, 77.7+/-6.7 years old) who visited the Center for comprehensive care on memory disorders in Kyorin University Hospital. No patients were prescribed with anti-depressants, anti-anxiety agents, psychomimetics, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, Chinese herbal medicines or cerebrovascular circulation modifying drugs. Patients with frontotemporal dementia or depression were excluded. ADL-related vitality and volition was measured by a vitality index. Cerebral brain blood flow was measured by single photon emission computed tomography (99mTc-ECD SPECT). Relative blood flow changes were calculated by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). Absolute blood flow changes were calculated by a three-dimensional stereotaxic ROI template on anatomically standardised 99mTc-ECD SPECT (3D SRT). Statistically significant correlations between semi-quantitatively measured scores of vitality index and blood flow changes in SPM and 3D-SRT were tested and displayed on a brain map.Analysis of relative and absolute blood flow showed that the common responsible area in the brain related to vitality was the frontal lobe, fronto-cingulate gyrus, temporal lobe, basal ganglia (caudate nucleus) and thalamus. Blood flow changes in the orbital gyrus were strongly correlated with vitality index specially in the frontal lobe.ADL-related vitality is affected mainly by the blood flow in the frontal-subcortical circuit. However, deep white matter was also important to determine vitality and volition.
