Benign ovarian and endometrial uptake on FDG PET-CT: patterns and pitfalls. Increased ovarian or endometrial uptake may cause a dilemma in the interpretation of whole body F18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging or even misdiagnosis of malignant disease. Knowledge of benign FDG uptake of the ovaries and uterus is important for daily practice of nuclear medicine radiologists. Increased uptake in the ovaries or uterus indicates a pathologic or neoplastic process in postmenopausal patients. In premenopausal women, increased ovarian or endometrial uptake can be functional or malignant. Benign functional uptake of premenopausal ovaries or uterus is related to the menstrual cycle therefore, information about the patient's menstrual status is crucial for interpretation. In addition, correlation with computed tomography (CT), especially diagnostic CT acquired at the same time of PET/CT is very useful in clarifying the location of the uptake and the existence or disappearance of the discrete lesion. Increased ovarian uptake may also be identified in histologically different benign tumor entities. Nonmenstrual-related endometrial uptake may be present in many benign diseases as well.
