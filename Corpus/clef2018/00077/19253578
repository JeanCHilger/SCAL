Development of a print quality inspection system for biochips. An automatic inspection system for biochip's print quality is presented in this paper. It consists of an automatic mechanical control, a CCD sensor for getting the image of PET boart, and the special computer software for image processing and recognition. Experimental results indicate that this system is capable of providing a precise and effective realtime inspection for biochips' print quality.
