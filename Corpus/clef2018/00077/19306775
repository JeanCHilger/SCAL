Role of nuclear imaging in regenerative cardiology. Advances in noninvasive imaging techniques may aid in the understanding of cardiac stem cell therapy. Nuclear imaging enables in vivo evaluation of myocardial perfusion, metabolism, and function, in addition to the stem cell fate. This article summarizes recent clinical and experimental nuclear imaging studies in cardiac stem cell therapy.
