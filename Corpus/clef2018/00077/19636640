Surface feature-guided mapping of cerebral metabolic changes in cognitively normal and mildly impaired elderly. The aim of this study was to investigate the longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET) metabolic changes in the elderly.Nineteen nondemented subjects (mean Mini-Mental Status Examination 29.4 +/- 0.7 SD) underwent two detailed neuropsychological evaluations and resting 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D: -glucose (FDG)-PET scan (interval 21.7 +/- 3.7 months), baseline structural 3T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and apolipoprotein E4 genotyping. Cortical PET metabolic changes were analyzed in 3-D using the cortical pattern matching technique.Baseline vs. follow-up whole-group comparison revealed significant metabolic decline bilaterally in the posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes and the left lateral frontal cortex. The declining group demonstrated 10-15% decline in bilateral posterior cingulate/precuneus, posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices. The cognitively stable group showed 2.5-5% similarly distributed decline. ApoE4-positive individuals underwent 5-15% metabolic decline in the posterior association cortices.Using 3-D surface-based MR-guided FDG-PET mapping, significant metabolic changes were seen in five posterior and the left lateral frontal regions. The changes were more pronounced for the declining relative to the cognitively stable group.
