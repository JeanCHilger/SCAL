Evaluation of disease activity using F-18 FDG PET-CT in patients with Takayasu arteritis. To evaluate the usefulness of F-18 fluoro-fluorodeoxygulose positron emission tomography computed tomography (F-18 FDG PET-CT) in detecting clinically defined active disease in patients with Takayasu arteritis.F-18 FDG PET-CT was performed in 32 patients with Takayasu arteritis. Disease activity was assessed clinically by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria. In 10 of the 32 patients, F-18 FDG PET-CT was performed while the patients were taking immunosuppressive drugs. Two nuclear physicians visually assessed the degree of F-18 FDG uptake in the walls of the aorta, its major branches and the pulmonary artery using a 4-point scale from grade 0 to III. F-18 FDG uptake greater than grade I in the thoracic aorta or greater than grade 0 in other areas were interpreted as active vasculitic lesions.Ten patients had active lesions on F-18 FDG PET-CT. According to the NIH criteria, 9 patients had active disease and 23 had inactive disease. Compared with disease activity assessed by the NIH criteria, F-18 FDG PET-CT had a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 87%. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and CRP levels were significantly higher in F-18 FDG PET-CT-positive than in F-18 FDG PET-CT-negative patients. There was no significant difference in the proportion of positive PET scans according to the use of glucocorticoids.The sensitivity of F-18 FDG PET-CT for detecting active disease was higher in patients with higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate values. Although the specificity of F-18 FDG PET-CT was high, owing to the low sensitivity of the NIH criteria in detecting active disease, further studies are needed.
