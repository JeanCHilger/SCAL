Multimodality imaging of carotid artery plaques: 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. This study's objective was to compare (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET), CT, and MRI of carotid plaque assessment.Fifty patients with symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT and MRI. Correlations and agreement between imaging findings were assessed by Spearman and Pearson rank correlation tests, t tests, and Bland-Altman plots.Spearman rho between plaque (18)F-FDG standard uptake values and CT/MRI findings varied from -0.088 to 0.385. Maximum standard uptake value was significantly larger in plaques with intraplaque hemorrhage (1.56 vs 1.47 P=0.032). Standard uptake values did not significantly differ between plaques with an intact and thick fibrous cap and plaques with a thin or ruptured fibrous cap on MRI. (1.21 vs 1.23Overall, correlations between (18)F-FDG PET and CT/MRI findings are weak. Correlations between CT and MRI measurements are moderate to strong, but there is considerable variation in absolute differences.
