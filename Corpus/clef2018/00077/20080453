Nodal staging. Lymph node metastases are a poor prognostic indicator in many tumours and therefore accurate identification during staging is important prior to commencing treatment. The presence of lymph node metastases can significantly alter patient management and therefore accurate diagnosis of the presence and extent of nodal disease can help optimise patient management. In this review, the radiologic features that aid in the differentiation of malignant and benign lymph nodes are discussed. The keys to successful interpretation on cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging of nodal metastases are highlighted. The clinical role of positron emission tomography-CT imaging for nodal staging is discussed and emerging imaging techniques that may further improve nodal staging accuracy are surveyed.
