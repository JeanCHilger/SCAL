Contribution of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors to amygdala activity in human. Several animal studies have demonstrated functional roles of dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors in amygdala activity. However, the contribution of DA D1 and D2 receptors to amygdala response induced by affective stimuli in human is unknown. To investigate the contribution of DA receptor subtypes to amygdala reactivity in human, we conducted a multimodal in vivo neuroimaging study in which DA D1 and D2 receptor bindings in the amygdala were measured with positron emission tomography (PET), and amygdala response induced by fearful faces was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy volunteers. We used multimodality voxelwise correlation analysis between fMRI signal and DA receptor binding measured by PET. DA D1 binding in the amygdala was positively correlated with amygdala signal change in response to fearful faces, but DA D2 binding in the amygdala was not related to amygdala signal change. DA D1 receptors might play a major role in enhancing amygdala response when sensory inputs are affective.
