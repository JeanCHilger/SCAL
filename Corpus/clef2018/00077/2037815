Exponential fit of QT interval-heart rate relation during exercise used to diagnose stress-induced myocardial ischemia. The aim of this study was to analyze the dynamic changes of QT interval--heart rate relation during exercise, fitting their reciprocal variations to an exponential formula (QT = A - B.exp(-k.RR], in order to see whether diagnostic contributions might so be derived. The authors studied 139 patients who underwent a simultaneous assessment of regional myocardial perfusion and ventricular function by means of two injections of 99mTc-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile at rest and at peak of a submaximal exercise test, using first pass radionuclide angiography with multielement gamma-camera and single photon emission computerized tomography, in order to detect and localize the presence of stress-induced myocardial ischemia. According to radionuclide results, patients were divided into three groups: group A, 7 individuals with no sign of stress-induced myocardial ischemia group B, 79 patients with evidence of ischemia in 1 (16.5%), 2 (65.5%), or 3 (17.7%) main coronary territories
