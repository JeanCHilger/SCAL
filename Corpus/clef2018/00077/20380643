Peptides for in vivo target-specific cancer imaging. Molecular imaging comprises non-invasive monitoring of functional and spatiotemporal processes at molecular and cellular levels in living systems. Advanced imaging techniques can monitor such processes. Peptide receptors over-expressed in tumours can be targeted by peptides conjugated to radionuclides, near-infrared fluorochromes, metallic nanoparticles or quantum dots for target-specific cancer imaging.
