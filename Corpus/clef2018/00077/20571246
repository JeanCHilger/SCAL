Prognostic value of post-ischemic stunning as assessed by gated myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography: a subanalysis of the J-ACCESS study . To determine the prognostic value of post-ischemic stunning, the Japanese assessment of cardiac event and survival study by quantitative gated myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (J-ACCESS) study was reevaluated.Of the 4,031 patients of the J-ACCESS, the present study evaluated 1,089 who completed gated SPECT both after stress and at rest. To assess post-ischemic stunning, the following measurements (left ventricular volumes after stress minus volumes at rest) were made: Deltaend-systolic volume (DeltaESV), Deltaenddiastolic volume (DeltaEDV) and Deltaejection fraction (DeltaEF). Myocardial stunning defined either as DeltaESV >or=5 ml, DeltaEDV >or=5 ml or DeltaEF <or=5% was observed in 21%, 22%, or 26%, respectively. During a 3-year follow-up, 101 cardiac events occurred. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation indicated worse event-free survival rates in patients with dilated ESV, dilated EDV, LVEF <or=45%, DeltaESV >or=5 ml or DeltaEDV >or=5 ml than in those without, whereas DeltaEF <or=5% did not predict events. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that LVEF <or=45% was the independent predictor for cardiac events. Nevertheless, DeltaEDV >or=5 ml was also an independent parameter, in addition to LVEF <or=45%, to predict the combined endpoint of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization, but excluding heart failure.These results indicate that post-ischemic stunning, as assessed by gated SPECT, is a marker for poor prognosis, particularly for ischemic cardiac events.
