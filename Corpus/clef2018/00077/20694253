Differences between the macroscopic and tracer level chemistry of rhenium and technetium: contrasting cage isomerisation behaviour of Re(I) and Tc(I) carborane complexes. Carboranes form stable complexes with the [M(CO)(3)](+) (M = (99m)Tc, Re) core and are viable ligands for the development of targeted radiopharmaceuticals. (99m)Tc-carborane complexes were found to exhibit substantially different 1,2-->1,7 cage isomerisation behaviour than their Re counterparts, challenging the validity of the routine use of rhenium as a surrogate for the development of technetium-99m based molecular imaging agents.
