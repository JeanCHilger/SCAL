Left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony by phase analysis of gated single photon emission computed tomography in end-stage renal disease. The presence and degree of left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has not been well studied. We hypothesized that these patients would be more likely to have mechanical dyssynchrony than a control cohort. The indexes of LV mechanical dyssynchrony were measured by automated analysis of gated single photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging in 290 patients with ESRD and 109 control patients. Only patients with normal myocardial perfusion imaging findings and a narrow QRS duration were included. The following variables were derived: LV ejection fraction (EF), volume, mass, and 2 indexes of dyssynchrony, the standard deviation and bandwidth. The standard deviation and bandwidth were significantly greater in those with ESRD (23° ± 13° vs 15° ± 6° and 65° ± 40° vs 42° ± 14°, respectively, p <0.001 for each). The LV volumes and LV mass were significantly lower and LVEF significantly greater in the control group than in the patients with ESRD (p <0.001 for each). The subgroup of 217 patients with ESRD and normal LVEF also had a significantly greater standard deviation and bandwidth than did the control group (21° ± 12° and 57° ± 35°, p <0.001 for each). However, their values were lower than those of the 73 patients with ESRD and a LVEF <50% (30° ± 13° and 90° ± 45°, p <0.001 for each). Finally, 25 patients (9%) with ESRD and none of the control group had a standard deviation >43° (p = 0.01). In conclusion, patients with ESRD had significantly more mechanical dyssynchrony than did the control group, even in absence of electrical dyssynchrony and abnormal LV perfusion or function.
