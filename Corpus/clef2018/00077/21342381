Positron emission tomography in non-medullary thyroid cancer. While iodine scanning is the mainstay of functional imaging in differentiated thyroid cancer, there is now a significant body of literature regarding positron emission tomography with 2-fluoro-2-deoxy glucose in thyroid cancer. This clinical review will examine the evidence supporting the use of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy glucose-positron emission tomography throughout the diagnosis and management of thyroid cancer, and provide suggestions for its clinical use and potential future roles.
