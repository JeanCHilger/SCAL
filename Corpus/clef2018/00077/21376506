Brain SPECT in Lewy body dementia. Dementia of Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second cause of degenerative dementia. There is many clinical presentation of the disease. Brain single photon computed tomography (SPECT) is a simple way to investigate routinely the cerebral blood flow. On cerebral perfusion SPECT, DLB is accompanied by diffuse cortical hypoperfusion predominantly at the posterior cortex and may affect the associative and primary visual areas in relation to neuronal loss or dysfunction. DLB patients have striatal hypofixation on cerebral neurotranmission SPECT-DaTSCAN(Â®), related with dopaminergic loss. Brain SPECT is useful in the differential diagnosis between DLB and other dementia.
