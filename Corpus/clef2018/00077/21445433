Generator-based PET radiopharmaceuticals for molecular imaging of tumours: on the way to THERANOSTICS. Generator-derived radionuclides for PET/CT imaging are promising for optimizing targeted radiotherapy by an individual patient-based approach, applying pre-therapeutic evaluation, as well as dosimetric calculations, and for measuring treatment response after radionuclide therapy.
