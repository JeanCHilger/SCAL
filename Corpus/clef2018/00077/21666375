Study of collimator broad correction in myocardial perfusion imaging. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of myocardial perfusion imaging that is reconstructed using the ordered subsets-expectation maximization (OS-EM) method with collimator broad correction.A cardiac phantom and clinical data (with ten normal patients) were used. These projection data were reconstructed using OS-EM with collimator broad correction (OS-EM(+)), without collimator broad correction (OS-EM(-)), and with filtered back projection (FBP). We analyzed the reconstructed images using the following: FWHM of reoriented short-axis data, volume calculated using QGS software, and a polar map calculated using QPS software.On the important point of spatial resolution, OS-EM(+) was excellent compared with FBP. However, a difference in % uptake was seen in one segment. Therefore, when a quantitative myocardial SPECT evaluation is done, the treatment of the numerical value needs to be noted.
