Clinical impact of combined transplantation of autologous skeletal myoblasts and bone marrow mononuclear cells in patients with severely deteriorated ischemic cardiomyopathy. Simultaneous injection of autologous bone marrow cells and skeletal myoblasts has been demonstrated to improve cardiac function in animal models. We evaluated the potential application of this combination cell therapy in patients with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy who required left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation.Four patients (age range, 43-69 years) who required LVAD implantation due to severe ischemic cardiomyopathy were studied. Skeletal myoblasts were obtained from the thigh, while bone marrow mononuclear cells were collected and purified at the time of the operation. These cells were directly injected in a serial manner into the damaged myocardium.No fatal arrhythmias or major complications were observed. The number of injected skeletal myoblasts ranged from 2.7 × 10(7) to 3.0 × 10(8), and their purity ranged from 25% to 96%. Two patients showed decreased brain natriuretic peptide levels and echocardiographic improvements in the transplanted areas, as well as increased perfusion revealed by H(2) (15)O positron emission tomography, of whom one was successfully weaned from LVAD. Histological findings at autopsy of the other patient showed a small amount of skeletal muscle in the injected area. Only marginal improvements were observed in the other two patients.Combined cell transplantation is feasible for patients with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, and functional recovery is anticipated in selected patients.
