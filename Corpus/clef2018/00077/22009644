Progress in diagnosis and treatment of cervical postoperative infection. Postoperative infection is the commonest complication that causes failure of spinal surgery. Although the rate of infection after cervical surgery is lower than that after lumbar surgery, the absolute number of cases is increasing. In recent years, new techniques, such as serum amyloid A and fludeoxyglucose ((18) F) positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET), have emerged and gradually been employed in the diagnosis of postoperative infection, updating the ability to identify the presence of infection. Most patients with cervical postoperative infection require re-operation. There are three principles for such surgery: thorough debridement, adequate drainage and ensuring stability of the spine. Some severe cases even need emergency surgery. This article aims to discuss the controversial issues in diagnosis and treatment of cervical postoperative infection, as well as progress in related studies.
