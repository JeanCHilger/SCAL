Would scan, but which scan? A cost-utility analysis to optimize preoperative imaging for primary hyperparathyroidism. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism depends on accurate preoperative localization. This study examines the cost-utility of sestamibi in combination with single photon emission computed tomography (sestamibi-SPECT) ultrasoundA decision tree was constructed for patients undergoing initial parathyroidectomy. Patients were randomized to 1 of 5 preoperative localization protocols: (1) ultrasound (2) sestamibi-SPECTIn the base-case, ultrasound was least expensive, with a cost of $6666, compared to $6773 (4-D CT) $7214 (sestamibi-SPECT and ultrasound ± 4D-CT)In our model, sestamibi-SPECT and ultrasound ± 4D-CT were the most cost-effective methods, followed by 4D-CT and ultrasound. Sestamibi-SPECT alone was least cost-effective. Cost-utilities were dependent on the sensitivities of ultrasound and 4D-CT and may vary by institution.
