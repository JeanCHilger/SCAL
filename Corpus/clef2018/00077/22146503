Dipyridamole stress and rest transmural myocardial perfusion ratio evaluation by 64 detector-row computed tomography. Myocardial stress CT perfusion (CTP) can detect myocardial ischemia.We evaluated the transmural perfusion ratio (TPR) of dipyridamole stress CTP to detect significant coronary stenosis (>70%) defined by quantitative invasive coronary angiography (ICA).Twenty-six patients (61.6 ± 8.0 years old 14 males), without prior myocardial infarction, with positive single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECTAll 26 patients completed the CT protocol with no adverse events. Rest TPR was measured in all patients with a mean of 1.06 ± 0.11, and abnormal TPR was considered <0.85. For 6 patients with normal coronary arteries by ICA, the mean TPR of territories with a previous positive perfusion defect in SPECT was 1.02 ± 0.18 (95% CI, 0.86-1.18 n = 6), and mean TPR of territories without perfusion defect in SPECT was 1.03 ± 0.09 (95% CI, -0.95 to 1.11TPR has a good correlation with SPECT and ICA to detect significant coronary stenosis.
