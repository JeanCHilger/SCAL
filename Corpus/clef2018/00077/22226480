Imaging apoptosis with positron emission tomography: 'bench to bedside' development of the caspase-3/7 specific radiotracer [(18)F]ICMT-11. The capacity to evade apoptosis has been defined as one of the hallmarks of cancer and, thus, effective anti-cancer therapy often induces apoptosis. A biomarker for imaging apoptosis could assist in monitoring the efficacy of a wide range of current and future therapeutics. Despite the potential, there are limited clinical examples of the use of positron emission tomography for imaging of apoptosis. [(18)F]ICMT-11 is a novel reagent designed to non-invasively image caspase-3 activation and, hence, drug-induced apoptosis. Radiochemistry development of [(18)F]ICMT-11 has been undertaken to improve specific radioactivity, reduce content of stable impurities, reduce synthesis time and enable automation for manufacture of multi-patient dose. Due to the promising mechanistic and safety profile of [(18)F]ICMT-11, the radiotracer is transitioning to clinical development and has been selected as a candidate radiotracer by the QuIC-ConCePT consortium for further evaluation in preclinical models and humans. A successful outcome will allow use of the radiotracer as qualified method for evaluating the pharmaceutical industry's next generation therapeutics.
