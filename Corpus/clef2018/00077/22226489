What predicts cognitive decline in de novo Parkinson's disease? Subtle cognitive impairment can be detected in early Parkinson's disease (PD). In a consecutive series of de novo, drug-naive PD patients, we applied stepwise regression analysis to assess which clinical, neuropsychological, and functional neuroimaging (dopamine transporter [DAT] and perfusion single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]) characteristics at baseline was predictive of cognitive decline during an average follow-up time of about 4 years. Decline both in executive (R(2) = 0.54 p = 0.0001) and visuospatial (R(2) = 0.56
