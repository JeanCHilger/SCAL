Pilot data on telmisartan short-term effects on glucose metabolism in the olfactory tract in Alzheimer's disease. The possible effect of antihypertensive therapy on Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been studied, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been suggested to exert an effect on cognitive decline. The purpose of this study is to clarify the functional effects of telmisartan, a long-acting ARB, on AD brain using prospective longitudinal (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) studies. For this purpose, brain glucose metabolism of four hypertensive patients with AD was examined with FDG-PET before and after administration of telmisartan. Studied subjects underwent three FDG-PET studies at intervals of 12 weeks. Antihypertensive treatment except for telmisartan was started after the first FDG-PET and continued for 24 weeks. Then 40-80 mg of telmisartan was added after the second FDG-PET and continued for 12 weeks.Glucose metabolism was significantly decreased during the first 12 weeks without telmisartan use at an area (-10, 21, -22, x, y, z Z = 3.56) caudal to the left rectal gyrus and the olfactory sulcus corresponding to the left olfactory tract. In contrast, the introduction of telmisartan during the following 12 weeks preserved glucose metabolism at areas (5, 19, -20, x, y, z
