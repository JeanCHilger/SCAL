Autoimmune epilepsy: clinical characteristics and response to immunotherapy. To describe clinical characteristics and immunotherapy responses in patients with autoimmune epilepsy.Observational, retrospective case series.Mayo Clinic Health System.Thirty-two patients with an exclusive (n=11) or predominant (n=21) seizure presentation in whom an autoimmune etiology was suspected (on the basis of neural autoantibody [91%], inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid [31%], or magnetic resonance imaging suggesting inflammation [63%]) were studied. All had partial seizures: 81% had failed treatment with 2 or more antiepileptic drugs and had daily seizures and 38% had seizure semiologies that were multifocal or changed with time. Head magnetic resonance imaging was normal in 15 (47%) at onset. Electroencephalogram abnormalities included interictal epileptiform discharges in 20 electrographic seizures in 15Immunotherapy with intravenous methylprednisolone intravenous immune globulinSeizure frequency.After a median interval of 17 months (range, 3-72 months), 22 of 27 (81%) reported improvement postimmunotherapy 18 were seizure free. The median time from seizure onset to initiating immunotherapy was 4 months for responders and 22 months for nonresponders (P<.05). All voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibody-positive patients reported initial or lasting benefit (P<.05). One voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibody-positive patient was seizure free after thyroid cancer resectionWhen clinical and serological clues suggest an autoimmune basis for medically intractable epilepsy, early-initiated immunotherapy may improve seizure outcome.
