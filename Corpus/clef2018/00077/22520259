Identification of ETP-46321, a potent and orally bioavailable PI3K α, δ inhibitor. Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) is an important target for cancer therapeutics due to the deregulation of this signaling pathway in a wide variety of human cancers. Herein, we describe the optimization of imidazo [1,2-a] pyrazines, which allow us to identify compound 14 (ETP-46321), with potent biochemical and cellular activity and good pharmacokinetic properties (PK) after oral dosing. ETP-46321 PK/PD studies showed time dependent downregulation of AKT(Ser473) phosphorylation, which correlates with compound levels in tumor tissue and demonstrating to be efficacious in a GEMM mouse tumor model driven by a K-Ras(G12V) oncogenic mutation. Treatment with ETP-46321 resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition.
