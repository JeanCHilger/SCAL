Coronary CT angiography versus myocardial perfusion imaging for near-term quality of life, cost and radiation exposure: a prospective multicenter randomized pilot trial. Clinical outcomes and resource utilization after coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) versus myocardial perfusion single-photon emission CT (MPS) in patients with stable angina and suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been examined.We determined the near-term clinical effect and resource utilization after cardiac CTA compared with MPS.We randomly assigned 180 patients (age, 57.3 ± 9.8 years 50.6% men) presenting with stable chest pain and suspected CAD at 2 sites to initial diagnostic evaluation by coronary CTA (n = 91) or MPS (n = 89). The primary outcome was near-term angina-specific health statusNo patients experienced myocardial infarction or death with 98.3% follow-up at 55 ± 34 days. Both arms experienced comparable improvements in angina-specific health status. Patients who received coronary CTA had increased incident aspirin (22% vs 8% P = 0.04) and statin (7% vs -3.5%In a pilot randomized controlled trial, patients with stable CAD undergoing coronary CTA and MPS experience comparable improvements in near-term angina-related quality of life. Compared with MPS, coronary CTA evaluation is associated with more aggressive medical therapy, increased coronary revascularization, lower total costs, and lower effective radiation dose.
