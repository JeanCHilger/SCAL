MR/PET: a new challenge in hybrid imaging. This article provides a short overview of hybrid imaging and the potential advantages of combined MR/PET. We will address some of the challenges that had to be met before MR/PET could become clinically available as well as further scientific work that has to be done to increase the potential benefit of this emerging hybrid modality.Hybrid imaging, the combination of two imaging modalities into one, promises the compensation of specific deficits of the modalities involved. PET/CT has gained wide acceptance for oncologic imaging in recent years however, MRI has certain advantages that could make combined MR/PET more tempting in various clinical applications. The development of new clinical whole-body MR/PET systems offers new insights in metabolic and functional processes in oncology as well as cardiovascular and neurologic diseases.
