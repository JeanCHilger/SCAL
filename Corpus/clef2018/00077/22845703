Efficient method for site-specific 18F-labeling of biomolecules using the rapid condensation reaction between 2-cyanobenzothiazole and cysteine. An efficient method based on a rapid condensation reaction between 2-cyanobenzothiazole (CBT) and cysteine has been developed for (18)F-labeling of N-terminal cysteine-bearing peptides and proteins. An (18)F-labeled dimeric cRGD ([(18)F]CBTRGD(2)) has been synthesized with an excellent radiochemical yield (92% based on radio-HPLC conversion, 80% decay-corrected, and isolated yield) and radiochemical purity (>99%) under mild conditions using (18)F-CBT, and shown good in vivo tumor targeting efficiency for PET imaging. The labeling strategy was also applied to the site-specific (18)F-labeling of a protein, Renilla lucifierase (RLuc8) with a cysteine residue at its N-terminus. The protein labeling was achieved with 12% of decay-corrected radiochemical yield and more than 99% radiochemical purity. This strategy should provide a general approach for efficient and site-specific (18)F-labeling of various peptides and proteins for in vivo molecular imaging applications.
