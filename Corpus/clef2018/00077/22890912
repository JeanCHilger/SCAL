Diagnostic value of fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography for the detection of metastases in non-small-cell lung cancer patients. In the recent years, fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) has emerged as a new modality for staging non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the diagnostic value of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in detecting metastatic lesions in NSCLC patients. Meta-analysis methods were used to pool sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likehood ratios, diagnostic odd ratios and to construct a summary receiver-operating characteristic curve. Data from included studies were pooled to compare the diagnostic accuracy between PET/CT and PET or CT alone in nodal staging. Totally, 56 studies involving 8,699 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivities and specificities of (18)F-FDG PET/CT were 0.72 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65-0.78] and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86-0.94) in determining mediastinal nodal staging 0.71 (95% CI: 0.60-0.80) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.77-0.88) in intrathoracic staging
