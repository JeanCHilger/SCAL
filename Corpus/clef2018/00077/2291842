Positron emission tomography as a technique for studying the chronic effects of alcohol on the human brain. Positron emission tomography is a neuroradiographic imaging technique that is beginning to be used to study cerebral pathophysiology in detoxified alcoholics. Localized cerebral glucose utilization in alcoholics at rest is not dramatically affected in comparison to the relatively large alterations in anatomic structure, cognition, and brain electrical activity. It is anticipated that future research studies will include cognitive challenges and utilization of PET ligands being developed to bind to specific receptors in the brain.
