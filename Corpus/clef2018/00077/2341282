Routine production of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose by direct nucleophilic exchange on a quaternary 4-aminopyridinium resin. Resin-supported [18F]fluoride ion has been prepared and applied to a rapid, convenient synthesis of [18F]FDG. "No-carrier-added" [18F]fluoride ion is collected on a quaternary 4-(N,N-dialkylamino)-pyridinium functionalized polystyrene anion exchange resin directly from a [18O]water target, dried by rinsing with acetonitrile, and then reacted with 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-2-O-trifluoromethanesulfonyl-beta-D-mann opyrannose. Acidic hydrolysis yields [18F]FDG in a synthesis time of 40 min with overall yields presently averaging above 50%.
