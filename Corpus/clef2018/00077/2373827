In vivo delineation of myocardial hypoxia during coronary occlusion using fluorine-18 fluoromisonidazole and positron emission tomography: a potential approach for identification of jeopardized myocardium. Previous studies have demonstrated that the positron-emitting fluorine-18 (18F)-labeled fluoromisonidazole is a specific tracer of myocardial hypoxia. Its fractional extraction is enhanced in ischemic or hypoxic myocardium but returns to baseline levels on reperfusion and recovery of normal function. Thus, this agent might be useful in delineating acutely hypoxic but potentially salvageable myocardium. Accordingly, to delineate the relation between the myocardial extraction of 18F-fluoromisonidazole after intravenous administration and the time of antecedent ischemia in vivo, uptake of tracer was measured with positron emission tomography and direct postmortem tissue analysis in 14 dogs in which tracer was administered within 3 h of coronary occlusion (a time associated with marked potential for salvage on reperfusion) in 4 dogs after 6 h of coronary occlusion (a time associated with minimal salvage of myocardium on reperfusion)
