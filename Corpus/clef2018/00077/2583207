Sensitivity and cross calibration. In Positron Emission Tomography it is possible to obtain quantitative information on the distribution of positron emitting radiopharmaceuticals. The different components influencing the sensitivity and the cross calibration of PET systems are discussed especially with respect to the quantitative nature of the PET technique.
