Utility of the SPECT Tc-99m labeled RBC blood pool scan in the detection of hepatic hemangiomas. The sensitivity of SPECT imaging of hepatic blood pool activity using Tc-99m labeled RBCs was contrasted with magnetic resonance and CT imaging in 22 cases. SPECT is a noninvasive technique with a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of hepatic hemangiomas. It is helpful for clarifying equivocal magnetic resonance imaging results.
