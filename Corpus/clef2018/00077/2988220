Fluoride content of selected human food, pet food and related materials. A survey was made of the fluoride content of selected human foods, some animal feeds, and related materials, with the purpose of a better characterization of products whose fluoride may contribute to the intake of fluoride by man as well as by some kinds of animals. Uptake of fluoride, especially from food with or without a foregoing food chain, was found to be more widely spread than has been documented previously. The major source of fluoride is represented by marine organisms, regardless of the ways by which man or animals are exposed to fluoride. As a consequence of the detailed analytical data given, recommendations would extend towards i) a more wide-spread analytical control of foods and feeds for fluoride, ii) an intensified assessment of fluoride bioavailabilities from foods and feeds, and iii) the consideration of such data in the evaluation of fluoride supplementations for optimized intakes, as recommended.
