Molecular pharmacology of the catecholamine transporter of chromaffin granules from the bovine adrenal medulla. Tetrabenazine (TBZ) and reserpine are two inhibitors of the catecholamine uptake system of the chromaffin granule membrane. They are structural analogs of the substrates dopamine and serotonin and they inhibit the monoamine transporter, which catalyzes a H+/neutral amine antiport. [3H]Dihydrotetrabenazine ([3H]TBZOH) is bound by chromaffin granule membranes on one class of site (T sites, KD = 3 nM) [3H]reserpine is bound on T sites and a second class of site (R1 sites, KD = 0.7 nM). The two sites are involved in monoamine translocation. The substrates displace the ligands with different efficiency: noradrenaline (Km = 10 microM) displaces reserpine efficiently (EC50 = 30 microM), but TBZOH poorly (EC50 = 2000 microM)
