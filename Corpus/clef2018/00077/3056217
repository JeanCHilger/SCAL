Radionuclide studies in surgical oncology. Over the last forty years radionuclides have come to play a useful role in diagnosis and treatment of tumours. Radionuclide scintigraphy provides information on morphology and function of tumours functional studies have become more relevant with advances in instrumentation such as digitised gamma-cameras, single-photon emission tomography (SPECT), position-emission tomography (PET), and with advances in radiopharmaceuticals. A significant contribution in recent years has been the use of radiolabelled antibodies in immunoscintigraphy and immunotherapy
