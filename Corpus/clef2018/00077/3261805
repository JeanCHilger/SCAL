Myocardial positron tomography with N-13 ammonia in assessment of aortocoronary bypass surgery. A total of 20 patients were examined at rest and during stress with N-13-ammonia myocardial positron emission tomography (PET) before and after aortocoronary bypass surgery in an attempt to evaluate the effect of surgery on myocardial perfusion and to predict the graft status. The PET images were divided into anterior, septal, apical, lateral and posteroinferior segments for analysis and were evaluated as "normal" (no perfusion defects during stress and at rest), "ischemia" (stress-induced defects) and "fibrosis" (persistent defects both at rest and during stress). Approximately 90% of the segments which were ischemic before surgery became normal after surgery. Thus, ischemic changes are highly reversible, and the vessels perfusing these ischemic areas are most suitable for bypass surgery. However, most of the persistent defects failed to respond to revascularization surgery and, hence, represented irreversibly damaged myocardium. In predicting graft status, graft patency could be demonstrated by normal perfusion in postoperative images (p less than 0.01) or by improved perfusion when pre- and postoperative images were compared (p less than 0.01). However, graft occlusion could not be predicted reliably. This study demonstrated that PET with N-13 ammonia was useful in the assessment of the effects of aortocoronary bypass surgery. However, this technique was not significantly superior to thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography for only qualitative analysis.
