Dynamic SPECT with iodine-123 IMP in meningiomas. Dynamic studies of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were performed with intravenous administration of N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine ([123I]IMP) in 12 patients with meningiomas. Their vascularities were also assessed by angiography. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed over the lesion and the contralateral presumed normal area, the symmetrical one if possible. Time-activity curves (TACs) were then constructed and the counting-rate ratio for the lesion to the contralateral presumed normal area (L/N ratio) was calculated in the first image of the dynamic SPECT. TACs were classified into three types: type I, an initial high uptake and rapid washout type, type II, an initial high uptake and slow washout one, and type III, an initial low uptake one. L/N ratios of angioblastic meningiomas were over 300%, while those of many fibroblastic ones were under 100%, at most 105%. We compared L/N ratios with angiographic vascularities and histologic types and conclude that dynamic SPECT with [123I]IMP is the examination of choice for evaluating the vascularity of lesions.
