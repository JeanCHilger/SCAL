In vivo measurement of carbon-11 thymidine uptake in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma using positron emission tomography. Carbon-11 thymidine (TdR) uptake using positron emission tomography (PET) has been measured in ten patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The rate of TdR uptake (mean +/- s.d.) was of 0.009 +/- 0.006 mumol.100 cc-1.min-1 in low-grade NHL. This rate was 0.063 +/- 0.049 mumol.100 cc-1.min-1 in intermediate-grade NHL and 0.159 mumol.100 cc-1.min-1 in a patient with high-grade NHL. Lymphoma radioactivity reached a plateau at 0.42 +/- 0.22%. 100 cc-1 of the injected dose from 10 min after injection. The highest 11C uptakes were observed in the kidneys and in the liver (3.30 +/- 1.30 and 2.10 +/- 0.05%. 100 cc-1 of the injected dose, respectively). The lymphoma-to-muscle ratio was of 11.8 +/- 1.7, whereas the lymphoma-to-intestine ratio was of 1.5 +/- 0.7. Accordingly, the measurement of [11C]TdR uptake in the abdomen may need other imaging methods for adequate interpretation. The results suggest that [11C]TdR uptake using PET might be a method for noninvasively measuring cell proliferation in vivo.
