Spect-studies of the brain with stimulation of the auditory cortex. The radiopharmaceutical N-isopropyl-p-J-Amphetamin (IMP) permits a new approach in the study of cerebral perfusion and function. We advanced the hypothesis for an increased IMP-uptake on auditory cortex during stimulation by white noise. Auditory stimulation activates the auditory cortex. This is marked by an increased IMP-uptake. IMP-uptake by the auditory region on the left side during stimulation on the right ear is another evidence of the crossing of central auditory pathways to the contralateral side.
