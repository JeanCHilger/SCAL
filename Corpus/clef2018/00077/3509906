Assessment of myocardial circulation and metabolism using positron CT. Positron CT measurement can provide valuable information of myocardial circulation and metabolism. Our institute has participated in the development and use of this measurement since April 1983. At present, we can assess the circulation and metabolism of myocardium using a position CT device (HEADTOME-III) and some radiopharmaceuticals labeled with positron emitters. In this paper, we introduced our method about its measuring device, radiopharmaceuticals and theoretical model, and also indicated the clinical usefulness of the measurement.
