The preparation of carbon-11 labelled proline for positron emission tomography. Preliminary distribution studies in rats with Walker 256 carcinosarcoma. DL-[1-11C]Proline has been synthesized by carboxylation of alpha-lithiopyrrolidyl-N-tert-butyl-formamidine with a radiochemical yield of up to 18% without correction for decay. The total synthesis time is 45 min. Accumulation of DL-[1-11C]proline has been shown in Walker 256 carcinosarcoma transplanted in rats. A tumor/non-tumor ratio of 5.9 was found at 45 min after i.v. injection.
