Comparison of data-processing techniques for the improvement of contrast in SPECT liver tomograms. Techniques for improving image contrast in liver single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are discussed. It is shown that by suitable choice of reconstruction method combined with subsequent image processing, image contrast can be improved without the generation of artefactual mottle. The use of this technique is illustrated with clinical data from a rotating gamma camera.
