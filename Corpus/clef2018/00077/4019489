Adenovirus-dependent increase in cell membrane permeability. When KB cells were labeled with either 51Cr (1 microCi/ml) or [35S]methionine (5 microCi/ml) and treated with 10 micrograms/ml of adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) at pH 6.0 for 60 min at 37 degrees C, about 25% of the cell-associated 51Cr and 5% of the [35S]methionine were released into the medium. The 51Cr was mainly associated with molecules of 1500 Da or less. When KB cells were labeled with either [3H] choline, alpha-[3H]aminobutyric acid, or [3H]deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose and exposed to Ad2, these molecules were released in amounts much higher than 51Cr. The Ad2-dependent release of choline was found to be dependent on Ad2 concentration, with maximum release (nearly 60%) at 10 micrograms/ml of Ad2, on the length of the incubation with Ad2, with maximum release at about 90 min, and on the medium pH with maximum activity at pH 6.0 to 6.5. Greater than 95% of the choline released was water-soluble and identified as choline phosphate. Less than 5% of the choline released was associated with lipids, and none was released as a phospholipid vesicle or micelle. The ability of Ad2 to release choline was abolished by incubating Ad2 for 10 min at 45 degrees C, whereas the binding of Ad2 to the cells was not affected. Fetal calf serum also blocked Ad2-dependent choline release.
