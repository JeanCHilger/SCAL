Central type benzodiazepine binding sites: a positron emission tomography study in the baboon's brain. An in vivo characterization of specific central type benzodiazepine (BZD) binding sites, labelled with [11C]Ro 15-1788 was performed, using positron emission tomography. After i.v. injection of 10 mCi [11C]Ro 15-1788 (corresponding to 1 nmol/kg), sequential quantitative tomographic slices of the brain were obtained during 80 min. In some experiments various doses of different cold drugs (BZD agonist or antagonist) were injected i.v. subsequently in order to explore the specificity of the binding of the radioligand in brain structures. The main criteria usually utilized in vitro to demonstrate a specific binding to receptors, such as regional distribution, stereospecificity and saturability of the binding and pharmacological effect linked to the receptor's occupancy, were demonstrated in the brain of a living baboon.
