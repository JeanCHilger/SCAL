Molecular weight characterization of virgin and explanted polyester arterial prostheses. The macromolecular properties of 17 virgin commercial arterial prostheses and a series of explanted prostheses, both manufactured from poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) yarns, have been studied by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Only small differences were found between the average molecular weights and the degree of crystallinity of the unused reference grafts. A broadening of the DSC curves was observed for the prostheses containing texturized yarns compared with those made solely from flat, untexturized yarns. This broadening may be due to greater heterogeneity of the crystal sizes caused by the texturizing process and to the use of two or more different yarns with dissimilar thermal histories in the same prosthesis. Average molecular weights of the explant series were significantly lower than those of the corresponding reference grafts but almost time independent. The polydispersity index and the degree of crystallinity of the explants remained constant as a function of time. These results are discussed in regard to others available in the literature.
