Targeting of liver metastases of colorectal cancer with IgG, F(ab')2, and Fab' anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibodies labeled with 99mTc: the role of metabolism and kinetics. The aim of this study was to investigate targeting of the liver metastases by directly 99mTc-labeled complete (IgG) and fragmented antibodies [F(ab')2 and Fab'] in relation to their kinetics and metabolic fate. A total of 127 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were examined [IgG1, BW 431/26 (Behringwerke, Marburg, Germany) n = 50 F(ab')2, F023C5 (Sorin Biomedica, Saluggia, Italy) n = 58
