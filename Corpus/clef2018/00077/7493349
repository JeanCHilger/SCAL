Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in patients with carcinoid tumors: comparison between radioligand uptake and tumor markers. We have performed 100 scintigraphic investigations using [111In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-D-Phe1]octreotide (111In-octreotide) single photon emission tomography (SPECT) in patients with carcinoid tumors. One or several lesions could be detected in 77 cases, and true negative results were obtained in 11 cases. There were false-negative results in 12 cases compared with results from conventional radiological methods. The ratio between the SPECT signals from the area with the highest uptake and normal lung was used as a tumor:background ratio. An attenuation correction was made in all investigations. We found that lesions in untreated patients had lower tumor:background ratios compared with those in patients treated with somatostatin analogues (medians, 10 and 40, respectively P < 0.001) or IFN (median, 23
