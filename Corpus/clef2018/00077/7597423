Endocrinological applications in nuclear medicine. Diagnosis and treatment of thyroid diseases have played a major role in Central European Nuclear Medicine. Since 1950, endocrinological nuclear medicine has been one of the strengths of this medical discipline. Not only diagnosis but also conservative treatment with thyroid depressants or hormones is performed by the nuclear medicine specialists. Nuclear medicine also takes part in the diagnosis of other endocrine diseases. The respective procedures include imaging of the adrenal gland (cortex and medulla) as well as of the parathyroid glands. Especially in the latter diseases, imaging was improved through Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy. Beyond that, the measurement of bone mineral content contributes to the full spectrum of endocrinological nuclear medicine. The development of In-111 octreotide now plays a limited role in the diagnosis of diseases of the pituitary gland.
