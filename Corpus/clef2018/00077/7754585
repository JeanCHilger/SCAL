Positron emission tomography. Introduction of a new procedure in diagnosis of urologic tumors and initial clinical results. Correct preoperative staging of malignant tumors is a prerequisite for an adequate therapy. This is not always possible with the imaging techniques available. Often, only an exploratory laparotomy can give the final diagnosis. Therefore, the search is on for a non-invasive technique for staging. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a new method in nuclear medicine it is used for the diagnosis of primary tumors, for staging, and for follow-up after therapy. With PET, biochemical pathways and physiological functions are studied, in contrast to CT and MRI, with which anatomy and morphology are examined. In our department PET was used in 26 patients with invasive bladder cancer, in 11 patients with renal cell carcinoma and in 1 patient for follow-up after testicular cancer. The primary bladder tumor was found in 85% of cases
