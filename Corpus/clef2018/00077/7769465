Designing a molecular probe for muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) imaging. Radiolabeled molecular probes have demonstrated the potential for in vivo quantification of cell surface receptor concentration as a function of disease. Molecular biology has been instrumental in the design of these probes for in vivo studies, as exemplified by a molecular probe for muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptor imaging. On a technical level, molecular biology has led to a better understanding of the selectivity of a radiolabeled probe in vitro. On a physiologic level, a combination of molecular biology and nuclear medicine provides an opportunity to validate in vivo what has been learned about receptors in vitro.
