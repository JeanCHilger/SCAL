Assessment of disease severity in parkinsonism with fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and PET. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and PET have been used to identify an abnormal regional metabolic covariance pattern in Parkinson's disease (PD). To examine the potential use of this covariance pattern as a metabolic imaging marker for PD, we describe the Topographic Profile Rating (TPR), which is a method for calculating subject scores for this pattern in individual PD patients. We then assess the relationship between these metabolic measures and objective independent disease severity ratings.Two independent groups of PD patients were studied with FDG-PET. Group A consisted of 23 patients (mean age 60.2 +/- 12.2 mean Hoehn and Yahr stages 2.4 +/- 1.3) and Group B had 14 patients (mean age 49.0 +/- 12.1In both PD patient groups, subject scores correlated with Hoehn and Yahr disease severity ratings (Group A: r = 0.59, p < 0.004 Group B: 0.57, p < 0.04), quantitative ratings for bradykinesia (Group A: r = 0.63, p < 0.002These findings indicate that regional metabolic covariance patterns are robust imaging markers of disease severity. FDG-PET may be useful clinically in assessing parkinsonian disability and disease progression.
