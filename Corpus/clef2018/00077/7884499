Regional analysis of D2 dopamine receptors in Parkinson's disease using SPECT and iodine-123-iodobenzamide. The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between D2 dopamine receptor density and levodopa dosage, disease duration and dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease (PD).Iodine-123-iodobenzamide SPECT scans were obtained from 14 PD patients and 12 age-matched controls using a three-headed camera in conjunction with MRI and a fiducial-based image registration system to define regions of interest. Basal ganglia/cerebellum counts/voxel ratios in dorsal and ventral head of caudate and anterior and posterior putamen were measured at 30, 60, 120 and 180 min postinjection. As in 11C-raclopride studies, ratios obtained at that time when they asymptomatically approach a maximum value (180 min) were accepted as the best measure of receptor density.Among PD patients, a trend towards an inverse correlation between regional basal ganglia/cerebellum ratios and levodopa dosage achieved significance in ventral caudate (F = 6.244, p = 0.037) similarly, an inverse correlation between these ratios and disease duration achieved significance in anterior putamen (F = 13.144, p = 0.007). Ratios were significantly lower in anterior putamen in patients with dyskinesia (t = 3.068, p = 0.042).In PD, the previously observed inverse correlation between levodopa dosage and D2-receptor density appears to be most prominent in the least dopamine-depleted region, ventral caudate. There may be a genuine effect of disease duration on receptor density in putamen and reduced receptor density in anterior putamen may be associated with dyskinesia.
