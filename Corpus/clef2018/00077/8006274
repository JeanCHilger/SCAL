Transdermal nitroglycerin patch therapy reduces the extent of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia: results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using quantitative thallium-201 tomography. This study prospectively evaluated whether transdermal nitroglycerin patches could limit the extent of exercise-induced left ventricular ischemia as assessed by quantitative thallium-201 tomography.Although antianginal medications are effective at reducing chest pain symptoms in patients with coronary artery disease, there is limited evidence that these agents can also reduce myocardial ischemia.This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial evaluating nitroglycerin patch therapy in patients in stable condition with angiographic coronary artery disease and no previous myocardial infarction. All patients were weaned from antianginal agents and had a baseline symptom-limited treadmill test followed by thallium-201 tomography. Forty patients with perfusion defects involving > or = 5% of the left ventricle were randomized to receive either intermittent (12 h on/off) active nitroglycerin patch therapy (0.4 mg/h) or placebo. Exercise tomography was repeated a mean (+/- SD) of 6.1 +/- 1.8 days after randomization.Patients randomized to receive active patch therapy had a significant reduction in their total perfusion defect size (-8.9 +/- 11.1%) compared with placebo-treated patients (-1.8 +/- 6.1%, p = 0.04), which was most apparent in those with the largest (> or = 20%) baseline perfusion defects (-11.4 +/- 13.4% vs. 1.0 +/- 3.6%, respectively, p < 0.02). Furthermore, 7 (33%) of 21 patients receiving active therapy had a > or = 10% decrease in their perfusion defects compared with only 1 (5%) of 19 patients randomized to receive placebo (p = 0.002). Nitrate therapy did not significantly reduce heart rate, blood pressure or double product, indicating benefit through enhancement of coronary blood flow.Short-term, intermittent nitroglycerin patch therapy significantly reduces myocardial ischemia, particularly in patients with large ischemic perfusion defects. Thallium-201 tomography can be used to assess sequential changes in the extent of exercise-induced left ventricular ischemia.
