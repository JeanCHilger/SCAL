A study of obese cats on a calorie-controlled weight reduction programme. Twenty-two domestic cats were fed a commercial low calorie diet for the management of obesity for up to 18 weeks and showed an average weight loss of 13.5 per cent of their body-weight. There was no indication that a steady weight loss over the study period had any adverse effect on the hepatic function or general health of the cats. There was an increase in the cats' total serum cholesterol concentration in association with the loss of weight.
