Reproducibility of fluorine-18-6-fluorodopa positron emission tomography in normal human subjects. Fluorine-18-6-fluorodopa (FD) positron emission tomography (PET) is established for measuring nigrostriatal dopaminergic function. This is despite the absence of data on the reproducibility of results.With an ECAT 953B/31 tomograph, we performed two or three repeated FD PET scans in 10 normal subjects to measure the scan-to-scan variation in the total striatal uptake rate constant (Ki).We found a scan-to-scan standard deviation (s.d.) of 8.7% of the mean. The between-subject s.d. was 26% of the mean, resulting in a reliability coefficient of 90%. Analysis of the variation in the components contributing to Ki showed a reliability varying from 77% to 86% (depending on the different time points analyzed) for emission data measured by the PET camera. The reliability of the blood radioactivity time course, as reflected by the stretch time, varied from 43% to 81%. The overall reliability for the correction of the blood time course for metabolites of FD was 71%. Variation in the blood radioactivity contributed to the variability of Ki by 50% more than the metabolite correction and by 200% more than the emission data.The striatal Ki is a reliable measurement it has a 95% chance of lying within +/- 18% of its value for an individual normal subject.
