Bromine-76-metabromobenzylguanidine: a PET radiotracer for mapping sympathetic nerves of the heart. Iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is used to qualitatively assess heart innervation with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). This approach is clinically useful in the prognostic evaluation of congestive heart failure. To improve quantification of uptake of the tracer using positron emission tomography (PET), we studied the characteristics of the bromoanalog of MIBG. Bromine-76-metabromobenzylguanidine (76Br-MBBG) was prepared from a heteroisotopic exchange between radioactive bromine atoms (noncarrier-added (76Br) BrNH4) and the cold iodine atoms of the precursor metaiodobenzylguanidine. Biodistribution was studied in rats and PET cardiac imaging performed in dogs. Myocardial uptake was high and prolonged in both species (mean half-life in dogs: 580 min). In rats, myocardial uptake was inhibited by desipramine by 64%, whereas after pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine uptake was reduced by 84%. In dogs pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine or with desipramine, a steep washout of the tracer occurred (mean half-life: 136 min and 118 min, respectively). The non-specific uptake plus the passive neuronal diffusion of the tracer could be estimated at about 25%-30% of the total fixation. In dogs, analysis of unchanged 76Br-MBBG in plasma showed that radiotracer metabolism was slow: 60 min after injection, 80% of the radioactivity was related to unchanged 76Br-MBBG. These preliminary findings suggest that 76Br-MBBG could be used to quantitatively assess adrenergic innervation in heart disease using PET. When combined with use of 11C-CGP 12177, cardiac adrenergic neurotransmission can be assessed.
