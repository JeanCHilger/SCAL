Structural and functional cerebral changes in patients with schizophrenia. During the past decades the possibility of measuring regional brain structure and function by computed tomography, magnetic resonance, single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography has brought the biological research on schizophrenia into focus. Structural changes with enlargement of the lateral and third ventricle and broader sulci on the brain surface compared to those of healthy volunteers have been reproducible findings. Functionally, the reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex especially during activation tests has been the most reliable finding. However, the etiology and specific meaning of the brain changes remains unsolved. Furthermore, in all the studies performed there is a considerable overlap in the measurements in the schizophrenic patients and in the controls.
