Effect of dopaminergic drugs on the in vivo binding of [3H]WIN 35,428 to central dopamine transporters. [11C]WIN 35,428 (also designated [11C]CFT) is now being used in several positron emission tomography (PET) centers to image dopamine (DA) transporter sites in the mammalian brain. Whether and to what extent in vivo WIN 35,428 binding is influenced by intra- and extrasynaptic dopamine levels are largely unknown. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of various drugs, known to affect DA levels and release, on the binding of [3H]WIN 35,428 to central DA transporters in the mouse brain. D-Amphetamine, which releases DA from neurons and blocks the DA transporter directly, inhibited striatal [3H]WIN 35,428 binding in dose-dependent manner. Similarly, alpha-methyl-DL-p-tyrosine, an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, blocked [3H]WIN 35,428 binding, possibly via competitive inhibition by the metabolite p-hydroxyamphetamine. Specific binding of [3H]WIN 35,428 was insensitive to changes in synaptic DA levels caused by pretreatment of the animals with high doses of D2 receptor agonists (apomorphine, bromocriptine), antagonists (haloperidol) or the inhibitor of dopaminergic neuron firing gamma-butyrolactone (GBL). High doses (> 50 mg/kg) of L-DOPA (in combination with benserazide), however, reduced [3H]WIN 35,428 binding significantly, yet for a relatively short time (approximately 2.5 h). Chronic treatment with L-deprenyl elicited no changes in in vivo [3H]WIN 35,428 accumulation in the striatum. Neurotoxic damage of DA neurons caused by administration of high doses of amphetamine was detected in the striatum by a significant reduction in [3H]WIN 35,428 binding 7 days after cessation of amphetamine treatment. Thus, [3H]WIN 35,428 binding was only affected by neurotoxic loss of neurons, by administration of uptake inhibitors, or by some treatments which significantly elevate DA levels. Compounds which inhibit DA release or deplete DA acutely do not increase [3H]WIN 35,428 binding, suggesting that normal or "resting" levels of DA are not sufficient to alter [3H]WIN 35,428 binding in vivo. These findings are important for our understanding of the function and regulation of the DA transporter, as well as the in vivo binding of the radioligand [3H/11 C]WIN 35,428. Moreover, they will be important for the interpretation of PET studies in which [11C]WIN 35,428 is used to assess the integrity of dopaminergic neurons.
