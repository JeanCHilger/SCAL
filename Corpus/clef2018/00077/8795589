Pretargeted immunoscintigraphy in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma. To evaluate the use of pretargeted immunoscintigraphy (ISG) in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), we studied 25 patients with histologically proven disease ISG was repeated after surgery in two patients. The antibody, either an anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or an antichromogranin A (CgA) biotinylated monoclonal antibody (MAb) or a cocktail of the two biotinylated MAbs was first injected. After 24 h, avidin was administrated i.v., followed by 111In-labelled biotin 24 h later. Fifty-two lesions were visualised. Six primary tumours, diagnosed by increased calcitonin levels, were all correctly diagnosed
