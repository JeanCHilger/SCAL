Striatal dopamine D1 receptors in narcolepsy: a PET study with [11C]NNC 756. We investigated dopamine D1 receptors in the putamen and caudate nucleus with positron emission tomography in six patients with narcolepsy and five healthy controls using [11C]NNC 756 as ligand. The caudate-to-cerebellum and putamen-to-cerebellum ratios of [11C]NNC 756 were within normal limits in patients with narcolepsy. No evidence of increased D1 receptor binding in narcolepsy was found.
