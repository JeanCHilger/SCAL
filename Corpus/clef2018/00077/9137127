Decreased anterior cingulate gyrus metabolic rate in schizophrenia. This study examined glucose metabolism in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex in schizophrenia.Fifty unmedicated male schizophrenic patients and 24 normal men were studied with positron emission tomography.Compared with the normal men, the schizophrenic patients had lower relative metabolic rates in the anterior cingulate and higher rates in the posterior cingulate.The findings suggest hypofunction in the anterior cingulate cortex in schizophrenia.
