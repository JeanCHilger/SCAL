In vivo studies on striatal dopamine D1 and D2 site binding in L-dopa-treated Parkinson's disease patients with and without dyskinesias. Dyskinesias are usually seen in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients after several years of L-dopa therapy. Their presence has been attributed to supersensitivity of striatal D1 and D2 receptors. We have used PET to assess striatal D2 receptor binding in untreated PD patients and striatal D1 and D2 binding in L-dopa-treated PD patients. Untreated patients showed a 14% increase in mean D2 receptor binding in the putamen contralateral to the more affected limbs (p < 0.02). Treated patients were segregated into subgroups according to the presence or absence of dyskinesias. There were no differences in mean caudate and putamen D1 and D2 binding between dyskinetic and nondyskinetic patients, matched for duration of clinical disease. Both dyskinetic and nondyskinetic PD subgroups showed a similar 16% reduction of mean caudate D2 binding (p < 0.01) with normal D2 binding in putamen. Mean caudate and putamen D1 binding potentials of both subgroups were reduced by 10% compared with those of controls, though this trend did not reach significance. Putamen D1 binding, however, showed a negative correlation with duration and L-dopa treatment (p < 0.03). These findings suggest that, while exposure of PD patients to L-dopa may be associated with reductions in caudate D2 and caudate and putamen D1 receptor, dyskinesias are unlikely to result from alterations in striatal dopamine receptor binding.
