Scatter correction with an off-peak triple energy window method in thallium-201 imaging. For scatter correction using the triple energy window (TEW) acquisition in 201Tl imaging, we propose an off-peak TEW (OFPTEW) method. This OFPTEW method employs a wide main energy window of 34 keV centered at 73 keV and two 5.1 keV sub-energy windows and uses the scatter correction factor of 0.55. To assess scatter correction using the OFPTEW method in 201Tl imaging, phantom studies for planar and SPECT imaging were performed and the data with the OFPTEW method were compared with those by the conventional TEW method using the trapezoidal formula with the 20% main energy window centered at 70 keV and two 4.9 keV sub-energy windows. The planar images corrected by both methods were visually similar. The OFPTEW method, however, estimated the true primary counts and the contrast value in the cold lesion accurately, while the conventional TEW method underestimated the primary counts by 30% and gave wrong contrast values. For the myocardial SPECT imaging, the short-axis images by both methods were very similar, but the images by the OFPTEW method had 1.46 times more counts than those corrected by the conventional TEW method. In conclusion, the OFPTEW method can correct scatter in 201Tl imaging accurately and increase the primary counts effectively compared with the conventional TEW method.
