Interference between two concurrent tasks is associated with activation of overlapping fields in the cortex. Interference between two concurrent tasks can be measured as an increased reaction time during simultaneous performance compared to when each task is performed alone. We tested the hypothesis that two tasks interfere because they require activation of overlapping areas of the cerebral cortex. With positron emission tomography we measured cortical activation as fields with significant increase in regional cerebral blood flow during single task performance of an auditory and a visual go/no-go task and an auditory and a visual short-term memory (STM) task. In a separate experiment we measured the degree of interference between the two go/no-go tasks and between the two STM tasks during dual task performance. Both the two go/no-go tasks and the two STM tasks activated overlapping parts of the cortex and interfered significantly during dual task performance. The two STM tasks had a larger volume of overlap and also significantly larger increase in reaction time during dual task performance, compared to the go/no-go tasks. The results thus indicate that two concurrent tasks interfere, with a resulting increase in reaction time, if they require activation of overlapping parts of the cortex.
