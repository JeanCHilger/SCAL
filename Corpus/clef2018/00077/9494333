Preoperative evaluation of the limitation of hepatic resection using 99mTc-GSA (galactosyl human serum albumin) scintigraphy. Preoperative evaluation of the operative indication of hepatic resection using the parameters obtained by 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy has been done. In particular, the accurate evaluation of the postoperative hepatic functional reserve essentially depends on these parameters. In the present study, a preoperative evaluation of postoperative hepatic functional reserve using 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy was performed in our operated cases retrospectively.Thirty-eight patients who underwent hepatic resection were studied on 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy before and after operation. These patients were divided into two groups. Group A had no postoperative complications (n = 31). Group BThere were statistically significant differences in the distribution of Res between A and B groups (p = 0.002, Mann-Whitney test). The values of Res, of which half of patients have complication, were 1.10 (Res (HH15)) and 16.4 (Res (LU15)).The resectability indices using 99mTc-GSA liver scintigraphy are useful for the preoperative evaluation of the limitation of hepatic resection.
