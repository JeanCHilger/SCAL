Neural networks for generation and suppression of alpha rhythm: a PET study. To study neuronal activities that influence the generation of the alpha rhythm, we used positron emission tomography and simultaneous recording of the electroencephalogram (EEG) in normal volunteers and under passive conditions. A negative correlation between regional cerebral blood flow and alpha power was found in the occipital cortex, consistent with the visual modality-specific reactivity of the alpha rhythm. A positive correlation was found in the pons, midbrain, hypothalamus, amygdala, the basal prefrontal cortex, insula and the right dorsal premotor cortex. Neuronal activities of the brain stem and limbic system that are positively correlated with alpha power may provide an anatomical basis for studies of the relationship between emotional state and brain rhythm in health and disease.
