Microsurgical transoral decompression in diseases of and injuries to the cranio-cervical junction. Besides the microsurgical ventral decompression for treatment of cervical disc prolapses, combined with an intercorporal fusion using an autologous bone graft from the iliac crest and a plate osteosynthesis, the microsurgical, transoral approach to the craniocervical junction has proven to be an effective procedure for adequate indications. Even for surgical treatment of diseases and injuries of the craniocervical junction ventral, anterolateral, lateral and dorsal approaches are applicable alone or in combination. The special anatomic and functional conditions of this region, however, obviously require that the indicational criteria for the various approaches differ from those selected for the other cervical segments. The postoperative complication risk requires that particulary critical consideration be given to the question of isolated transoral interventions. The same holds true for the question as the necessity for additional ventral stabilisation in combined dorsoventral interventions. This report is about 20 patients who underwent transoral decompression, about the indications and the procedure typical problems.
