Combined FDG and [F-18]fluoride whole-body PET: a feasible two-in-one approach to cancer imaging? To evaluate the diagnostic usefulness of the combined application of 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG for the evaluation of soft tissue) and [F-18]fluoride (for the evaluation of the skeleton) in positron emission tomography (PET) of cancer.Sixty consecutive patients (23 women, 37 men mean age +/- SD, 51 years +/- 14All 30 combined FDG and fluoride studies yielded high-quality whole-body images. PET findings correlated with other imaging findings in 54 (78%) of 69 lesions in the control group and with 64 (88%) of 73 lesions in the combined group. Interobserver agreement in the control group was 0.74 it was 0.95 in the combined group.Combined FDG and fluoride PET is an advanced metabolic imaging approach for the evaluation of cancer.
