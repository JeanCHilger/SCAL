Coregistration of FDG PET and MRI of the head and neck using normal distribution of FDG. For better localization of head and neck structures by PET with 2-(18)F-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), direct incorporation of anatomical information from MRI by the coregistration of FDG PET and MRI without external markers is proposed.Seventeen patients with neoplasms and 16 normal subjects who had both FDG PET and MRI were studied. First, the three-dimensional normal distribution of FDG was evaluated, and then the structures of the head and neck regions with normal distribution patterns of FDG were used as internal markers for the coregistration of PET and MRI. The effectiveness of the coregistration was evaluated using focal neoplasms that were identified by both PET and MRI as fiducial internal markers.The normal structures selected as internal landmarks for coregistration were the tonsils, salivary glands, mucosal layers of the oral cavity and pharynx, spinal cord, inferior portion of the frontal lobe, cerebellum and nasal turbinates. These structures were more easily observed in sagittal or coronal sections than in transaxial sections. All primary neoplasms were delineated by PET, whereas 4 were missed by MRI. Thirteen primary tumors and 7 cervical lymph node metastases coregistered well, with a center-of-mass distance of <2 mm, whereas 10 lymph node metastases were slightly misregistered, with a center-of-mass distance of 7.8+/-6.5 mm (mean+/-s.d.), probably due to differences in neck positions.Normal distribution of FDG uptake in the head and neck regions delineated by multidirectional sections is important for effective coregistration of FDG PET with MRI.
