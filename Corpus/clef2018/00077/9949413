The use of image registration in the analysis of bone scans for the assessment of temporomandibular joint uptake. Bone scanning is a commonly used technique in the assessment of patients with facial asymmetry. Uptake in the temporomandibular joints can be assessed quantitatively, either as a right-to-left ratio or as the uptake in the joint relative to some other bony structure. We used image registration techniques in the development of an automatic method of quantitative analysis and compared this with a manual region of interest method. Both image warping and region warping were studied. Normal ranges were established in a series of 25 subjects with no evidence of temporomandibular disorder. The results of this study indicate that, by using image registration and standard regions of interest, the results from normal subjects show a smaller standard deviation and improved correlation between observers when compared with manual analysis.
