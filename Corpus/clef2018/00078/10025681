In vivo muscarinic binding of 3-(alkylthio)-3-thiadiazolyl tetrahydropyridines. Based on encouraging in vitro data indicating M2 subtype selectivity, we synthesized, radiolabeled with 18F, and evaluated 3-(3-(2-fluoroethylthio)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yl)-1,2,5,6-tetr ahydro-1-methylpyridine [FE-TZTP], and 3-(3-(3-fluoropropylthio)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yl)-1,2,5,6-tet rahydro-1-methylpyridine [FP-TZTP] for muscarinic subtype selectivity in vivo. [18F]FE-TZTP displays high uptake in vivo but is inhibited only weakly by coinjecting unlabeled P-TZTP. Contrarily, [18F]FP-TZTP shows significant inhibition of uptake by coinjecting unlabeled P-TZTP or the muscarinic agonist L-687,306 (3-(3-cyclopropyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane ). Using in vivo autoradiography, [18F]FP-TZTP displays regional distribution consistent with M2 subtype distribution. In addition, [18F]FP-TZTP shows specific uptake in the heart at 5 min. Analysis of metabolites in the awake rat brain revealed that the parent compound represents >95% of the extractable activity at 30 min. In vivo studies in rhesus monkeys revealed rapid brain uptake of [18F]FP-TZTP, with clearance sustained over 2 h. Administration of P-TZTP or FP-TZTP (80 nmol/kg) at 60 min after injection of [18F]FP-TZTP results in a significant displacement of brain activity in all regions. Metabolite analysis in monkey plasma shows that parent compound represents 20% of the extractable radioactivity at 40 min postinjection. One metabolite, which increases with time, has similar lipophilicity to the parent. However, based on metabolism in rat we believe metabolites are not in the brain to any significant extent in monkeys during the time of imaging studies. Regional uptake, autoradiographic distribution, and clearance rates in the brain are consistent with the hypothesis that [18F]FP-TZTP is M2 selective in vivo.
