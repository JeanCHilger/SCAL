Early detection of the no-reflow phenomenon in reperfused acute myocardial infarction using technetium-99m tetrofosmin imaging. Evaluation of myocardial perfusion in the early stage of acute myocardial infarction (MI) is clinically important for adjunctive therapies to minimize infarct size. To determine the role of early scintigraphic detection of impaired myocardial reperfusion after primary coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in patients with acute MI, semiquantitative technetium-99m tetrofosmin single-photon emission tomographic (SPET) imaging was performed before primary PTCA (before area at risk), 60 min after PTCA (after) and at 1 month (1 M
