201Tl imaging for differentiating between malignant and benign neck masses. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of 201Tl scintigraphy to differentiate between malignant and benign neck masses. Fifty-eight patients with neck masses, whose diagnoses were confirmed by histological examination, were examined. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 201Tl scintigraphy were 80%, 96% and 88% respectively when salivary gland masses were excluded, these values were 87%, 95% and 91% respectively. Our results suggest that 201Tl scintigraphy is highly reliable in determining the malignancy of neck masses, especially when salivary gland masses are excluded.
