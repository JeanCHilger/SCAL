Neuroimaging in patients with CVD. The development of the neuroimaging technique has revolutionized clinical neurology. This is also true in the field of stroke. Because of the easy accessibility and little time consuming, the computed tomography (CT) should be applied first to the stroke patient and other examinations should be prepared later to the patient due to the severity and the characteristic of the lesion. These are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (including MR angiography. MR spectroscopy, diffusion MRI), cerebral angiography, neurosonography (carotid ultrasound, color flow imaging, transcranial Doppler), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), etc. It is a matter of common sense that CT and MRI are now particularly important among laboratory examinations for neurological diseases and these non-invasive techniques will become more important for the elderly stroke patients. Recent study cleared the combination of 3-dimensional computed angiography and neurosonography has an informative value and this is especially important for the elderly patients who are fragile and need rapid and accurate diagnosis.
