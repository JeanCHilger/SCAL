Positive and negative symptoms and regional cerebral perfusion in antipsychotic-naive schizophrenic patients: a high-resolution SPECT study. In 17 antipsychotic-naive schizophrenic patients, the scores of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia were correlated with relative regional cerebral perfusion measured by 99m-Tc-ECD (ethyl cysteinate dimer) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Scans were performed in subjects at rest. The negative symptom dimension was significantly correlated with a decreased level of perfusion in the left thalamic region. Other non-significant trends were also observed the positive symptom dimension was related to decreased perfusion in the left temporal region and to increased perfusion in the right frontal region, while the negative symptom dimension was related to increased perfusion in the left frontal region. These findings suggest that the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia are related to dysfunctions in different regions of the brain and different lateralized patterns of dysfunction.
