Subjective experience and striatal dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy in patients with schizophrenia stabilized by olanzapine or risperidone. The authors' goal was to study the relationship between subjective experience during treatment with olanzapine or risperidone and dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy in stabilized patients with schizophrenia.Subjective experience, psychopathology, and extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed, and D(2) receptor occupancy was determined with [(123)I]iodobenzamide single photon emission computed tomography, in 22 patients whose schizophrenia was stabilized by olanzapine or risperidone.Subjective experience, depression, and negative symptoms were related to dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy, but extrapyramidal symptoms were not.These results provide preliminary evidence that negative subjective experience is related to high D(2) receptor occupancy. Longitudinal study is required because this relationship may have implications for dosing strategies.
