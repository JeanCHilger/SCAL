Magnetic resonance imaging of regional myocardial perfusion in patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease: quantitative comparison with (201)Thallium-SPECT and coronary angiography. The clinical value of magnetic resonance perfusion imaging (MRI) was investigated by quantitative comparison with (201)thallium-single-photon emission computed tomography ((201)TI-SPECT) and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Short-axis imaging was performed during dipyridamole administration in 13 patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease. Using inner and outer contours, the myocardium was divided into 30 contiguous, radial regions. Defining a perfusion defect as a region with less than 90% of maximum (201)TI intensity, nine patients had a matching perfusion defect, two had no defect on both (201)TI-SPECT or MRI, and one had a defect on (201)TI-SPECT but not on MRI. One patient had a defect on both modalities but with inaccurate localization. Three perfusion parameters were investigated: a) maximum contrast enhancement (MCE) b) slope of the signal intensity versus time curve
