Longitudinal effects of estrogen replacement therapy on PET cerebral blood flow and cognition. Observational studies suggest that estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) may protect against age-related memory decline and lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to characterize the neural substrates of those effects by comparing 2-year longitudinal changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 12 ERT users and 16 nonusers. Positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of rCBF were obtained under three conditions: rest, and verbal and figural recognition memory tasks. Groups showed different patterns of change in rCBF over time in a number of brain areas. These group differences, for the most part, reflected regions of increased rCBF over time in users compared to nonusers. The greatest differences between ERT users and nonusers were in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and temporal lobe, regions that form a memory circuit and that are sensitive to preclinical AD. Across a battery of standardized neuropsychological tests of memory, users obtained higher scores than did nonusers of comparable intellect. Group differences in longitudinal change in rCBF patterns may reflect one way through which hormones modulate brain activity and contribute to enhanced memory performance among ERT users.
