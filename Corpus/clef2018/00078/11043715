Prognostic value of myocardial perfusion tomographic imaging in patients after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The authors assessed the prognostic value of stress myocardial perfusion tomographic imaging (SPECT) in patients with recurrent angina or inconclusive results of exercise electrocardiographic tests after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).After PTCA, 70 patients (54 men, 16 women 41 after myocardial infarctionDuring an average follow-up of 25 +/- 10 months, two patients had severe outcomes (one cardiac death and one nonfatal myocardial infarction), and revascularization was required in 13 patients. In patients with normal SPECT or fixed defects, the annual event rate was low (1.2%), with only one revascularization. In patients with reversible or combined defects, the annual event rate was significantly greater (22.4% chi square = 17.32, P = 0.00003).Normal perfusion or fixed defects predict a benign prognosis in patients after successful PTCA. The presence of stress-induced reversible defects appears to be the best predictor of future cardiac events.
