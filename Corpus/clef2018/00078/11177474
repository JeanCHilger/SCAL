The investigation of patients with HIV infection: 10 years of progress. The past decade has seen great advances in the management of patients with HIV infection. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in a decrease in opportunistic infections but the development of new clinical entities such as lipodystrophy and immune reconstitution illnesses. The use of investigations such as lipid profiles and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning to assess lipodystrophy have been necessitated by these changes in the epidemic. Technological advances have resulted in new techniques such as viral resistance assays and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning. The appropriate use of these investigations is subject to ongoing assessment.
