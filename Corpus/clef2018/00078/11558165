New criteria for positron emission tomographic diagnosis of brain glioma using 11C-methionine. The study was based on the data of positron emission tomography (PET) and L-[methyl]-[11C]-methionine used in 117 patients with suspected brain tumor. PET data on 74 patients with histologically verified cerebral tumors were analyzed in detail. New additional criteria for assessing PET scans, which formed the PET syndromes of astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and glioblastomas. Operative and histological verification confirmed the high validity of the proposed criteria for defining the type of a tumor.
