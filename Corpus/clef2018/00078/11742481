Continuous angiotensin II infusion increases tumour: normal blood flow ratio in colo-rectal liver metastases. Insufficient blood flow within colo-rectal hepatic metastases is a factor which may limit drug delivery to, and thus the response of, these tumours to regional chemotherapy. Loco-regional flow may be manipulated pharmacologically to enhance the tumour blood flow relative to that of the normal liver. However, as yet, only transient effects have been studied. Patients receiving regional chemotherapy for unresectable hepatic disease were given a 45 min regional infusion of the vasoconstrictor Angiotensin II. Intrahepatic blood flow distribution was assessed serially by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging together with the trapping tracer copper(II) pyruvaldehyde bis(N-4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (Cu-PTSM) labelled using copper-62. Eleven lesions in nine patients were studied, with no adverse effects. Prior to Angiotensin II administration tumour blood flow was generally found to be greater than that of liver (10/11 lesions 8/9 patients
