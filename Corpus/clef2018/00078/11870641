Deposition of (90)YPO(4) and (144)CePO(4) radioisotopes on polymer surfaces for radiation delivery devices. Intravascular irradiation with beta emitters inhibits restenosis in arteries after balloon angioplasty or stent implantation. Yttrium-90 ((90)Y, T(1/2)=64 h) and cerium-144 ((144)Ce, T(1/2)=286 d) emit beta particles (E(max)=2.28--3.50 MeV) having an ideal energy range for brachytherapy delivery system. In this article, a previously reported method for depositing (32)P on poly(ethylene terephtalate) (PET) surfaces is generalized and modifications that allow deposition of other beta-emitting radioisotopes, such as (90)Y and (144)Ce, are demonstrated. PET films were first coated with chitosan hydrogel and then adsorbed different amounts of phosphoric acid (PA) in aqueous solutions. Yttrium was deposited onto the surface as YPO(4) after the films were immersed in YCl(3) solutions. 1 muCi (90)YCl(3) (2 x 10(-9) g) was used in each sample as a tracer for measuring the deposition efficiency, which is defined as the percentage of YCl(3) deposited on the surface compared to the amount of YCl(3) in solutions before the deposition. In order to improve the safety of brachytherapy treatments, polyurethanes were used to seal the deposited radioisotopes on the surface to minimize the leakage of the isotopes into the patients. The generality of this method presented here for a wide variety of particular radioisotopic components allows design of a broad range of versatile radioisotope sources.
