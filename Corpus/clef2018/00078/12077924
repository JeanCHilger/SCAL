FDG-PET-scan in subarachnoid hemorrhage. Ruptured aneurysms cause subarachnoidal hemorrhage (SAH) that may or may not result in neurological sequelae. Acute SAH has been shown to reduce cerebral blood flow and metabolism. An important question is whether or not the SAH induced vasospasm without clinical symptoms leads to cerebral ischemia? Using postoperative [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in patients with vasospasm diagnosed by transcranial Doppler without clinical changes, hypermetabolism was detected as an indicator of diffuse compensated ischemia in 6 cases. In 2 patients with neurological deficit reduced glucose metabolism was observed in the frontal and temporal-basal cortex.
