Auditory event related potential and PET scan: a possibility for the comprehensive evaluation of cognition. The authors studied the parallel use of event related potential (ERP) and brain activation PET in nine healthy volunteers. The presence of P300 wave in the EEG recording was accompanied by a parallel increase in the blood perfusion of the anterior cingulate gyrus. Furthermore, the functional connectivity between cortical and subcortical structures was also present during the task. This method combines the fine temporal-resolution of ERP and spatial-resolution of PET, which allows for the complex examination of fast cognitive processes. This approach may be useful in the investigation of psychiatric disorders.
