Attention and its disorders. This chapter focuses on the clinical aspects of attention including anatomy, cognitive neuropsychology, disorders, and functional imaging evidence for the role of attention in cognition. Particular emphasis is given to selected aspects of visual attention. Imaging studies discussed are primarily functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). In addition, some evidence will be provided from the time-honoured clinical method of lesion studies.
