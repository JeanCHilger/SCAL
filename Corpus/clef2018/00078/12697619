Language systems in normal and aphasic human subjects: functional imaging studies and inferences from animal studies. The old neurological model of language, based on the writings of Broca, Wernicke and Lichtheim in the 19th century, is now undergoing major modifications. Observations on the anatomy and physiology of auditory processing in non-human primates are giving strong indicators as to how speech perception is organised in the human brain. In the light of this knowledge, functional activation studies with positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are achieving a new level of precision in the investigation of language organisation in the human brain, in a manner not possible with observations on patients with aphasic stroke. Although the use of functional imaging to inform methods of improving aphasia rehabilitation remains underdeveloped, there are strong indicators that this methodology will provide the means to research a very imperfectly developed area of therapy.
