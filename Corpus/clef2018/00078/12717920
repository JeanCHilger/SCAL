Application of new radiopharmaceutical "Sodium 11c-butyrate" and positron emission tomography in patients with coronary artery disease. The aim of this study was to examine the diagnostic value of Sodium 11C-Butyrate (11C-Butyrate) in assessing perfusion and oxydative metabolism in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). 41 patients (39 male and 9 female, mean age 48 +/- 11) with CAD were investigated. PET-scans were performed twice: at 2-7 min and 25-31 min after i.v. injection of 250-400 MBq 11C-Butyrate. Regional perfusion was evaluated by the uptake of radioactivity in the myocardium at the first scan, intensity of beta-oxidation--by decreasing the uptake level at the second scan.Myocardium of the left ventricle was good visualized at the first scan. It was demonstrated fast elimination of radioactivity in segments with normal oxidative metabolism of 11C-Butyrate at the second scan. Fixed defects were seen in the scar segments both at first and second scans. Decreased uptake of 11C-Butyrate at the first scan and diminished rate of agent elimination caused by depressed beta-oxidation at the second scan were revealed in ischemic segments.Application of PET with 11C-Butyrate in patients with CAD allows estimate hypoperfused segments, evaluate heart oxidative metabolism and provides differential diagnosis of scar and ischemia.
