Impact of aging on myocardial metabolic response to dobutamine. In humans, under resting conditions there is an age-related decrease in myocardial fatty acid utilization (MFAU) and oxidation (MFAO) and a relative increase in myocardial glucose utilization (MGU). The impact of age on an individual's myocardial metabolic response to catecholamines is not well defined. Sixteen younger (mean age, 26 +/- 5 yr) and 14 older (mean age, 69 +/- 4 yr) volunteers underwent positron emission tomography to measure myocardial blood flow, myocardial oxygen consumption (M.VO2), MFAU, MFAO, and MGU both under resting conditions and during dobutamine infusion. In response to dobutamine administration, the rate-pressure product, myocardial blood flow, and M.VO2 measurements increased by similar amounts in both groups. No age-related differences were noted in the responses of plasma insulin, glucose, fatty acid, or lactate levels to dobutamine. With dobutamine infusion, MFAU and MFAO increased by a similar extent in both younger and older volunteers (age/dobutamine interactions, P = 0.62 and 0.75, respectively). In contrast, MGU increased with dobutamine administration in the younger (from 149 +/- 71 to 209 +/- 78 nmol.g(-1).min(-1) P = 0.04) but not in the older (from 235 +/- 147 to 176 +/- 84 nmol.g(-1).min(-1)
