[F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) as a diagnostic for hip endoprosthesis loosening. The purpose of this study was to examine the FDG-PET in respect of its diagnostic valency with regard to septic/aseptic loosening of lower limb prostheses.28 patients with 41 lower limb prostheses were examined by means of FDG-PET to evaluate septic/aseptic loosening of their hip prostheses. Therefore, a differentiated FDG-PET result interpretation subdivided into five categories was developed. The final diagnosis was based on operative findings with following culture and histological outcome.The worked-out categories showed a high agreement to the intraoperative macroscopic and histological results (n = 23 correctly positive, n = 1 false positive, n = 1 correctly negative and n = 3 false negative).With a subtly differentiated interpretation (categories I - V) of the qualitative glucose metabolism safe statements can be made regarding septic/aseptic endoprostheses loosening. This was impressively confirmed by the agreement of the FDG results with the histological results.
