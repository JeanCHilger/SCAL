Myocardial perfusion and glucose uptake coupling in CAD patients. To evaluate coronary artery disease (CAD) patients regarding to their perfusion-glucose uptake relationship at rest for all myocardial regions and to determine whether this evaluation could typify patients with different positron emission tomography (PET)-pattern proportions and pathophysiological characteristics.Rest/dipyridamole H(15)2O and 18FDG PET studies were performed in 23 patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Regional index (relative perfusion, %H(15)2O relative glucose uptake, %18FDG) allowed to detect PERFUSION-metabolism mismatch (i.e. hibernation) and dipyridamole-induced reversible stress defects (RSD).The correlation (r) between %H(15)2O and % 18FDG at rest allowed definition of three groups: correlated (CORR r > 0.7Analysis of perfusion and glucose uptake at rest allowed to typify three categories of CAD patients with different PET-patterns proportions, distinctive ranges of perfusion and glucose uptake and distinctive hyperemic response. Our results suggest that myocardial hibernation associated with defective hyperemic response is specific of patients with preserved perfusion and glucose uptake.
