Multimedia for clinical education in myocardial perfusion imaging. Interactive multimedia has many advantages as a presentation medium for diagnostic imaging case studies, particularly for teaching digital imaging techniques such as myocardial perfusion imaging. Multimedia documents may incorporate interactive audiovisual presentations, sophisticated diagnostic images, anatomical illustrations, and text in medical instructional materials. The article describes a multimedia teaching atlas of SPECT and planar myocardial perfusion imaging delivered on Apple Macintosh II microcomputers, and discusses some of the advantages of delivering medical educational materials with interactive multimedia techniques.
