Role of positron emission tomography in the management of breast cancer. Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality that utilises tracers based on biologically important compounds and can be used to study in vivo tissue function. This article reviews the current status of PET imaging in breast disease. The positron emitting glucose analogue 18F-FDG is used to image tissue glycolysis and has been extensively evaluated. Studies have shown that 18F-FDG PET has a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of primary breast cancers, however its use is not superior that of conventional imaging modalities. Considerable interest is now focussing on the application of PET to non-invasively determine the lymph node status of patients with breast cancer and to predict and evaluate tumour response to chemotherapy. Relatively low cost gamma camera systems are now available that are capable of PET imaging, and thus it may therefore be possible to perform PET imaging in the majority of hospitals.
