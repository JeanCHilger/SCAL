Dual-modality PET/CT scanning with negative oral contrast agent to avoid artifacts: introduction and evaluation. The authors qualitatively and quantitatively assessed a solution containing 0.2% locust bean gum (LBG) and 2.5% mannitol (mannitol-LBG) dissolved in water to provide a negative oral contrast material in dual-modality positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scanning. PET/CT was performed in 60 patients with cancer after oral administration of barium, water, or mannitol-LBG. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted to determine bowel distention and a potential influence of the contrast agents on the PET data. Intestinal distention with mannitol-LBG proved superior to that with water or barium. Findings at both quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed apparently increased tracer uptake in the small bowel with barium in comparison to that with mannitol-LBG or water. Mannitol-LBG may, therefore, be used as a negative oral contrast agent at PET/CT scanning because it provides excellent bowel distention while avoiding contrast material-induced PET artifacts.
