Cognitive- and motor-related regions in Parkinson's disease: FDOPA and FDG PET studies. Using 6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-dopa (FDOPA) and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucoce (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), multiple regression analyses were performed to determine the specific brain regions that are related to cognitive and motor symptoms in nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease.Spatially normalized images of FDOPA influx rate constant (Ki) values and relative regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rrCMRglc) were created. Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM) scores and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores were used to determine the patients' cognitive and motor functions, respectively. Multiple correlation analyses between the FDOPA and FDG images and the cognitive and motor scores were performed for each voxel.RCPM score was significantly positively correlated with the FDOPA Ki in the left hippocampus and with the rrCMRglc in the left middle frontal gyrus and right retrosplenial cortex. Motor function was significantly positively correlated with the FDOPA Ki in the bilateral striatum and with the rrCMRglc in association areas and primary visual cortex. The level of motor function was significantly inversely correlated with the FDOPA Ki in the anterior cingulate gyrus and with the rrCMRglc in bilateral primary motor cortex and right putamen.Changes of striatal FDOPA uptake and rrCMRglc in the primary motor cortex likely represent dysfunction in the motor system involving the corticobasal ganglia-thalamocortical loop. Change of FDOPA uptake in the anterior cingulate gyrus may be related to up-regulation of dopamine synthesis in surviving dopamine neurons. The regions where correlation with cognitive function was observed belong to a cognitive frontoparietal-hippocampal network.
