Thiopental and propofol affect different regions of the brain at similar pharmacologic effects. Propofol has a greater amnesic effect than thiopental. In this study we tested whether different brain regions were affected by propofol and thiopental at similar drug effects. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were identified by using SPM99 analysis of images obtained with positron emission tomography with (15)O water. Ten right-handed male volunteers (age, 35 +/- 10 yr weight, 74.1 +/- 7.5 kg
