Potential of [(18)F]beta-CFT-FE (2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl)-8-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)nortropane) as a dopamine transporter ligand: A PET study in the conscious monkey brain. A dopamine transporter (DAT) ligand 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-8-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)nortropane ([(18)F]beta-CFT-FE) was synthesized and evaluated in comparison with [(11)C]beta-CFT in monkey brain using animal positron emission tomography (PET). [(18)F]beta-CFT-FE and [(11)C]beta-CFT were injected intravenously to conscious monkeys for a 91-min PET scan with arterial blood sampling for metabolite analysis. In the conscious state, [(18)F]beta-CFT-FE provided a peak about 20 min after the injection and declined thereafter in the striatum of monkey brain, while [(11)C]beta-CFT continuously increased with time up to 91 min after injection. Metabolite analysis revealed that [(18)F]beta-CFT-FE was more rapidly metabolized in plasma than [(11)C]beta-CFT. The striatal binding of both ligands was dose-dependently displaced by preadministration of a specific DAT inhibitor, GBR12909, at doses of 0.5 and 5 mg/kg however, the displacement degree of [(11)C]beta-CFT-FE was higher than that of [(18)F]beta-CFT. The effects of the anesthetics, ketamine and isoflurane, on binding were more prominent in [(11)C]beta-CFT than [(18)F]beta-CFT-FE. Specificity and affinity of beta-CFT-FE to DAT were evaluated in an in vitro assay using cloned human DAT, serotonin transporter, and norepinephrine transporter in comparison with other conventional DAT ligands, showing that beta-CFT-FE had lower affinity and higher specificity to DAT than beta-CFT and beta-CIT. These results suggested that [(18)F]beta-CFT-FE could be a potential imaging agent for DAT, providing excellent selectivity and tracer kinetics for quantitative PET imaging.
