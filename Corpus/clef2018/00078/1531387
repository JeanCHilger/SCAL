D1 dopamine receptor binding in mood disorders measured by positron emission tomography. D1 dopamine receptor binding in mood disorders was studied by positron emission tomography (PET) using 11C-SCH23390. Ten patients with bipolar mood disorders and 21 normal controls were studied in the drug-free state. The patients were in euthymic (N = 6), depressed (N = 3) and manic (N = 1) states. Regional radioactivity in the brain was followed for 40 min by PET. A two-compartment model was used to obtain the binding potential (k3/k4) for the striatum and frontal cortex. The binding potentials for the frontal cortex for the patients were significantly lower than those for normal controls, whereas those for striatum were not significantly different. These findings suggest that D1 dopamine receptors in the frontal cortex may be in a different state in patients with bipolar mood disorders.
