Is positron emission tomography using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 11C-acetate valuable in diagnosing indeterminate pancreatic masses? It can be impossible to differentiate a mass forming chronic pancreatitis from adenocarcinoma of the pancreas using standard anatomical imaging. Positron emission tomography using 2-[18F] fluoro-2deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG-PET) and 1-[11C]-acetate (11C-acetate-PET) are methods taking advantage of the metabolic differences between benign and malignant tissues.To determine the diagnostic accuracy of 18FDG-PET and 11C-acetate-PET in indeterminate pancreatic masses.Twenty patients with an indeterminate mass of the head of the pancreas were prospectively studied. All patients underwent 18FDG-PET and eighteen of them 11C-acetate-PET. Scans were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively the later by using regional standardised uptake value (SUV). Final diagnosis was established using histopathologic evaluation of resected specimen or biopsy.Adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in twelve patients and chronic pancreatitis in eight. Qualitative evaluation of 18FDG-PET imaging revealed three false negative and one false-positive results. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 75 %, 88 %, and 80 %, respectively. The cut-off SUV to differentiate malignant from benign disease was 3,5 demonstrating a sensitivity of 91.7 % and a specificity of 75 %.18FDG-PET imaging could not confirm or exclude malignancy in indeterminate masses of the head of the pancreas with high sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy. 11C-acetate-PET provided no additional diagnostic benefits.
