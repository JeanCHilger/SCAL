Is there a future for single photon emission tomography? Emission tomography has the potential to be developed into a clinically useful technique. Its clinical applications, however, will be limited and not in the main stream of space occupying disease detection but in the definition of quantitative information particularly relevant in those disease processes where the metabolic component is the most important one. Special purpose designed instrumentation may prove to be the best of several possible compromises.
