How often do patients undergo repeat PET or PET/CT examinations? Experience from a UK institution. According to the report of the Intercollegiate Standing Committee on Nuclear Medicine, the UK requires 40-60 positron emission tomography (PET) machines in the next decade (Intercollegiate Standing Committee on Nuclear Medicine). Positron Emission Tomography: a Strategy for Provision in the UK. London: Royal College of Physicians of London 2003, pp. 1-9). This figure is based mainly on patients receiving only one examination and restricting the clinical indication to three primary diagnoses. The aim of this study was to assess the appropriateness of this figure and the assumptions made in the Intercollegiate report on UK PET provision.We examined retrospectively our institution's entire PET and PET/computed tomography (CT) database, which spans 4 years and 9 months. We recorded the number of patients who received repeat examinations.Reports were available for 3354 PET/CT or PET-only studies 418 of 2268 patients (18.4%) received at least one repeat PET/CT examination. The three main indications for PET examination in the Intercollegiate report only accounted for approximately 60% of the examinations undertaken.Our records suggest that basing the UK's future PET provision on a single examination and on three clinical indications only is no longer realistic.
