The effect of pet ownership on the risk of allergic sensitisation and bronchial asthma. An increasing volume of evidence suggests that early contact of children with the allergens of furred pets (especially those produced by cats) may determine a lower risk of developing allergic sensitisation to these materials. A possible explanation of this data is that an early inhalation of high levels of the major cat allergen Fel d 1 induces the production of IgG and IgG4 antibodies with a "protective" effect. Other authors have shown that the prevalence of allergic sensitisation to cats, in adults, is reduced in those patients exposed to the lowest and highest levels of the allergens. On the contrary, the risk of developing sensitisation to cats is significantly higher when the patients were exposed to intermediate levels of Fel d 1. Moreover, epidemiological studies have demonstrated a relatively low prevalence of cat allergy (about 10%) in some countries where rates of cat ownership are high. This data confirms the role of indirect exposure to pet allergens in inducing allergic sensitisation. Clothes of pet owners have been indicated as the carriers for the dispersal of these allergens in pet-free environments. However, it is important to point out that exposure of highly sensitised patients to relevant amounts of pet allergens (such as in a pet shows/shops) may determine a dramatic exacerbation of nasal and/or bronchial symptoms.
