Clinical and genetic evaluation of 8 Polish families with levodopa-responsive parkinsonism. We studied 8 large Polish families with parkinsonism, 6 of which were newly identified. Thirty-six family members had well-documented levodopa-responsive parkinsonism. The phenotype of affected individuals was indistinguishable from that of persons with idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD). The pattern of inheritance in 5 families was consistent with autosomal dominant transmission in 3 families the mode of inheritance was uncertain. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies with the dopamine transporter radioligand [(123)I]FP-CIT were performed in 1 family. The SPECT study showed striatal presynaptic dopaminergic degeneration consistent with sporadic PD in 1 affected family member and no signs of nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction in 5 at-risk individuals. Sequence analysis in all 8 families excluded known genes associated with familial parkinsonism. Genome-wide 2-point linkage studies in the largest 2 families did not identify significant linkage (z > 3.0), although positive scores were obtained for 5q23 (D5S1462 and D5S2501), a locus previously implicated in disease susceptibility.
