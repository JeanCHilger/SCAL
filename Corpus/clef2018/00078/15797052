Noninvasive dynamic assessment with transthoracic echocardiography of a composite arterial Y-graft achieving complete myocardial revascularization. Composite arterial grafts are increasingly used in coronary artery bypass surgery. We assessed with transthoracic echocardiography the composite radial artery and in situ left internal thoracic artery Y-graft.In 53 of 60 consecutive patients who underwent complete myocardial revascularization using only this composite arterial graft, good transthoracic echocardiographic images and pulsed Doppler signals of the Y-graft main stem were obtained at rest and early after standard exercise. Stress/rest 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was the gold standard for residual myocardial ischemia. The patients with negative SPECT were divided into groups according to the number of coronary artery systems grafted, and history of preoperative myocardial infarction.Diastolic peak velocity, diastolic velocity-time integral, the diastolic-to-systolic ratio of the peak velocities and velocity-time integrals, and the stress-to-rest ratio of the diastolic peak velocities and diastolic velocity-time integrals in the negative-SPECT patients were significantly greater than in the 6 positive-SPECT patients. Sensitivity and specificity for ischemia of the stress-to-rest ratio of the diastolic peak velocities less than 1.5 were 100%. The stress-to-rest ratio of the diastolic velocity-time integrals in the patients with three coronary systems grafted, and in those without preoperative myocardial infarction, were respectively greater than in the patients with two systems grafted (p < 0.0001), and in those with preoperative myocardial infarction (p = 0.0048).Noninvasive dynamic assessment with transthoracic echocardiography of a composite arterial graft, including in situ left internal thoracic artery, is feasible and correlates with myocardial perfusion SPECT. The Y-graft used was able to regulate its flow capacity to myocardial demand.
