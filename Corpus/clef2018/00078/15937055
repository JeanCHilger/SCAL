A 2-month cisplatin-epirubicin-paclitaxel (PET) weekly combination as primary systemic therapy for large operable breast cancer: a phase II study. The present study aimed to define the antitumor activity of eight cisplatin-epirubicin-paclitaxel (PET) weekly cycles with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support in patients with large operable breast cancer.Operable breast cancer (T2-3 N0-1 T >3 cm) patients received eight preoperative weekly cycles of cisplatin 30 mg/m2, epirubicin 50 mg/m2 and paclitaxel 120 mg/m2, with G-CSF (5 microg/kg, days 3-5) support.Sixty-three patients (T2/T3=30/33 N0/N+=8/55) were enrolled. Thirty-one clinical complete (49%) and 30 partial (48%) responses were recorded, giving a 97% response rate (95% confidence interval 89% to 100%). Breast-sparing surgery was performed in 32/63 (51%) patients. At pathological assessment, 28 patients (45%) showed absence of invasive residual disease in breast and 34 (55%) had negative axilla. In 20 women (32%) both breast and axilla were found to be disease-free. At a 23-month median follow-up (range 4-63), only eight relapses and two deaths had occurred, with the 4-year projected relapse-free and overall survival being 59% and 95%, respectively. Grade 3-4 neutropenia and anemia occurred in 24% and 5% of patients, respectively. Emesis, diarrhea and mucositis were the main non-hematological toxicitiesA 2-month weekly treatment with PET represents a well tolerated and highly effective approach in large operable breast cancer patients. In spite of the short duration of chemotherapy, one-third of patients achieved a complete eradication of the tumor in both breast and axilla.
