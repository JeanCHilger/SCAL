In vivo evaluation of expressed protein function by PET. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) allows in vivo visualization of the expression and function of protein using a radioligand. Quantitative analysis of serotonin transporter, receptors, and the function of P-Glycoprotein has been performed in living human brains. Furthermore, the relationship between the phenotype of those proteins and their genetic polymorphism has also been investigated. Regarding the effect of antipsychotics on dopamine D2 receptor, occupancy and its time-course have been measured in a living body using PET. This approach can provide in vivo pharmacological evidences of antipsychotics and establish a rational therapeutic strategy. PET is a powerful tool not only in the field of brain research but also drug discovery and individual medicine.
