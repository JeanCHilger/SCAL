Molecular imaging with positron emission tomography and single photon emission computer tomography. Status and perspectives. Molecular imaging allows for the study of molecular and cellular events in the living intact organism. The nuclear medicine methodologies of PET and SPECT possess several advantages which make them especially suited for molecular imaging. In particular, the possibility of a quick transfer of methods developed in animals to patients (translational research) is a significant strength. This status article briefly discusses the newest applications and their importance and perspective in relation to the shift in paradigm in medicine towards more individualized treatment.
