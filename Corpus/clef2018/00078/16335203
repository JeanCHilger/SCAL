Effects of electroacupuncture of different frequencies on cerebral blood perfusion and cerebral function in the patient of stroke. To explore effects of electroacupuncture of different frequencies on stroke.Forty-seven cases of stroke were treated with electroacupuncture at the motor region of the scalp and divided into 2 Hz, 2/15 Hz and 100 Hz groups according to the used frequency. Cerebral blood perfusion and brain functions before and during electroacupuncture in the 3 groups were investigated with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Local cerebral blood perfusion and brain cell functions could be improved by electroacupuncture of the 3 frequencies, and the actions of 2/15 Hz and 100 Hz were better.Electroacupuncture of 2/15 Hz and 100 Hz has a better therapeutic effect on stroke when the stimulating intensity is fixed.
