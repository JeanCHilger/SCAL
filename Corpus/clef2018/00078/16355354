Impact of experience on improving the surgical outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy. Recently, we have published the results of a first surgical series of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We describe a posterior series of patients intervened of TLE, we compare the functional results with the previous series and we finally analyze the causes of changes.We studied the first 22 consecutive patients surgically intervened of TLE with a minimum post-surgery follow-up of 2 years. Patients showing I and II Engel's grade were used as gold standard for evaluation of pre-surgical complementary studies.We have obtained better functional results: 91% patients showing Engel's grade I, 9% showing grade II and neither III nor IV grades were obtained. Pre-surgical studies changed in comparison with the previous report. The most improving change was observed in video-EEG with foramen-ovale electrodes (FOE) (37%), scalp EEG (26.6%), interictal SPECT (11.7%) and MRI (11.7%). Video-EEG with FOE was the study than showed greater concordance with epileptic focus (95.5%), followed by EEG (86.4%). In 35% of cases, MRI was normal or without valid data for correct localization of focus.Video-EEG with FOE and TLE surgery are safety methods, which results improve with the experience. Normal or not informative MRI do not should a priori reject those patients with drug-resistant TLE from surgery.
