Can molecular imaging predict response to preoperative chemoradiation in patients with rectal cancer? A Fox Chase Cancer Center prospective experience. This study was undertaken to correlate change in fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)FDG-PET) uptake with response to combined-modality neoadjuvant therapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Twenty patients (13 male 7 female) underwent (18)FDG-PET scans before and 3 to 4 weeks after completion of chemoradiation before surgery. Staging by endoscopic ultrasound was T3/T4 (17/1)
