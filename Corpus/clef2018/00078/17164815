Evaluation of N-desmethylclozapine as a potential antipsychotic--preclinical studies. There is growing interest in N-desmethylclozapine (NDMC), the major metabolite of clozapine, as a unique antipsychotic because it acts in vitro as a 5-HT(2) antagonist and as a partial agonist to dopamine D(2) and muscarinic receptors. To explore this, we compared NDMC to a typical (haloperidol), atypical (clozapine), and partial-agonist atypical (aripiprazole) antipsychotic in preclinical models. The comparison was carried out using: brain D(2) and 5-HT(2) receptor occupancy animal models predictive of antipsychotic efficacy (amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion (AIL) and conditioned avoidance response (CAR) models)
