The neural basis of functional neuroimaging signal with positron and single-photon emission tomography. Functional imaging techniques such as positron and single-photon emission tomography exploit the relationship between neural activity, energy demand and cerebral blood flow to functionally map the brain. Despite the fact that neurobiological processes are not completely understood, several results have revealed the signals that trigger the metabolic and vascular changes accompanying variations in neural activity. Advances in this field have demonstrated that release of the major excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate initiates diverse signaling processes between neurons, astrocytes and blood perfusion, and that this signaling is crucial for the occurrence of brain imaging signals. Better understanding of the neural sites of energy consumption and the temporal correlation between energy demand, energy consumption and associated cerebrovascular hemodynamics gives novel insight into the potential of these imaging tools in the study of metabolic neurodegenerative disorders.
