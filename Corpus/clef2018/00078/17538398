Synthesis and evaluation of radioiodine-labelled CP-118,954 for the in-vivo imaging of acetylcholinesterase. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by reduced acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the post-mortem tissues of AD patients. Therefore, AChE has been an attractive target for the diagnosis of AD. In the present study, 5,7-dihydro-3-[2-(1-(phenylmethyl)-4-piperidinyl)ethyl]-6H-pyrrolo[3,2-f]-1,2-benzisoxazol-6-one (CP-118,954), a potent AChE inhibitor, was labelled with radioiodine and evaluated as an AChE imaging agent for SPECT.Radioiodine-labelled CP-118,954 was prepared from CP-144,885 and [(125)I]iodobenzyl bromide, and anti-AChE activities of iodine-substituted CP-118,954 were measured. Metabolism studies were carried out in samples of blood and whole brain of mice injected with 2-[(123)I]iodo-CP-118,954 ((123)I-1). Tissue distribution studies were also performed in mice injected with I-1, and samples of blood, thyroid, stomach, and brain tissue (cerebellum, striatum and cortex) were removed, weighed and counted.Of the ligands, 2-iodo-CP-118,954 exhibited higher binding affinity for AChE (IC50=24 nM) than the other positional isomers. 2-[(125)I]Iodo-CP-118,954 was found to have a lipophilicity (log P=2.1) favouring brain permeability and metabolic stability in mouse brain, but a marginal target (striatum) to non-target (cerebellum) uptake ratio (1.1) in mouse brain.This result demonstrates that 2-[(125)I]iodo-CP-118,954 may be unsuitable for AChE imaging. These findings suggest that radioligands suitable for AChE imaging should have not only a specific structure but also a sub-nanomolar to low nanomolar IC50.
