Augmented acquisition of cocaine self-administration and altered brain glucose metabolism in adult female but not male rats exposed to a cannabinoid agonist during adolescence. Marijuana consumption during adolescence has been proposed to be a stepping-stone for adult cocaine addiction. However, experimental evidence for this hypothesis is missing. In this work we chronically injected male and female Wistar rats with either the cannabinoid agonist CP 55,940 (CP 0.4 mg/kg) or its corresponding vehicle. Adult acquisition (seven 30 min daily sessions) and maintenance (fourteen 2 h daily sessions) of cocaine self-administration (1 mg/kg), food-reinforced operant learning under conditions of normal (ad libitum access to food), and high motivation (food-restriction schedule) were measured. Additionally, brain metabolic activity was analyzed by means of [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. During the acquisition phase, female CP-treated rats showed a higher rate of cocaine self-administration as compared to vehicle-treated females and males
