Space-domain non-iterative approach for SPECT/CT systems considering attenuation and space-variant detector response. A quantitative analysis of emission planar image reconstruction from projections by an object dependent, exact, direct approach in the space-domain considering both object attenuation and space-variant impulse response of SPECT/CT systems is proposed. That approach is compared with iterative methods and non-object-dependent exact methods in both the space domain and the frequency one. Since the mean-projection precorrection method is the concern of some actual 3D methods of compensation for distance-dependent spatial resolution and is thought right for competing with different methods able to quantify the tracer density in the object of interest, it is also examined in the course of the analysis. The direct approach may also augment the simulation power of the Matlab Image Processing Toolbox concerning the direct and inverse Radon transform from parallel projection data, the Toolbox being actually restricted to the ideal transform in the frequency domain.
