Can magnetic resonance imaging replace single photon computed tomography and computed tomography in detecting bony invasion in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma? To determine whether MRI can replace SPECT and CT in detecting bone invasion in patients with oral SCC.A retrospective and independent review of the MRI, SPECT, and when available CT, images of 23 patients with oral malignancy who had formal bone resection was undertaken. Our gold standard was histopathology.Bone involvement was seen in 19/23 resections. Sensitivity of MRI was 100% [95% CI 1.0-1.0] and specificity was 75% [95% CI 0.326-1.174]. Sensitivity of SPECT was 100% [95% CI 1.0-1.0] and specificity was 50% [95% CI 0.01-0.99].MRI is accurate in predicting bone involvement. The addition of SPECT and CT to routine MRI staging protocols seems no longer indicated. CT may be useful in some selected cases to determine maxillary involvement due to the thinner cortex of the maxilla.
