Positron emission tomography for staging of pediatric sarcoma patients: results of a prospective multicenter trial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for initial staging and therapy planning in pediatric sarcoma patients.In this prospective multicenter study, 46 pediatric patients (females, n = 22 males, n = 24FDG-PET and CIMs were equally effective in the detection of primary tumors (accuracy, 100%). PET was superior to CIMs concerning the correct detection of lymph node involvement (sensitivity, 95% v 25%, respectively) and bone manifestations (sensitivity, 90% v 57%, respectively), whereas CT was more reliable than FDG-PET in depicting lung metastases (sensitivity, 100% v 25%, respectively). The patient-based analysis revealed the best results for SBS, with 91% correct therapy decisions. This was significantly superior to CIMs (59% P < .001).In staging pediatric sarcoma, subsidiary FDG-PET scanning depicts important additional information and has a relevant impact on therapy planning when analyzed side-by-side with CIMs.
