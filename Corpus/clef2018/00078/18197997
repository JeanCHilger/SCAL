Abnormalities in myocardial perfusion after surgical correction of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum. We describe the results of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy performed 4 to 15 years after surgery in 12 patients with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum. We used single photon emission computed tomography after injection of technetium Tc-99m tetrofosmin at submaximal exercise test. The patients, 7 girls and 5 boys, with a mean age of 11 years, and a range from 6 to 19 years, had either undergone biventricular repair, in 5 cases, or univentricular palliation in the remaining 7. This second group included 4 patients with ventriculo-coronary arterial communications. Of the children, 3 with biventricular repair and 6 with univentricular palliation had perfusion defects. Children with biventricular repair had perfusion defects in the ventricular septum, while those having univentricular palliation also had defects located to the left ventricular free wall. All children with ventriculo-coronary arterial communications had perfusion defects both in the ventricular septum and in the left ventricular free wall.
