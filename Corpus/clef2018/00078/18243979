Reconstruction Algorithm for Fan Beam with a Displaced Center-of-Rotation. A convolutional backprojection algorithm is derived for a fan beam geometry that has its center-of-rotation displaced from the midline of the fan beam. In single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), where a transaxial converging collimator is used with a rotating gamma camera, it is difficult to precisely align the collimator so that the mechanical center-of-rotation is colinear with the midline of the fan beam. A displacement of the center-of-rotation can also occur in X-ray CT when the X-ray source is mispositioned. Standard reconstruction algorithms which directly filter and backproject the fan beam data without rebinning into parallel beam geometry have been derived for a geometry having its center-of-rotation at the midline of the fan beam. However, in the case of a misalignment of the center-of-rotation, if these conventional reconstruction algorithms are used to reconstruct the fan beam projections, structured artifacts and a loss of resolution will result. We illustrate these artifacts with simulations and demonstrate how the news algorithm corrects for this misalignment. We also show a method to estimate the parameters of the fan beam geometry including the shift in the center-of-rotation.
