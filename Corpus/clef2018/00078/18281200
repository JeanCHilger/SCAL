123I-ADAM SPECT imaging of serotonin transporter binding in patients with night eating syndrome: a preliminary report. Night eating syndrome (NES) represents a delay in the circadian pattern of food intake, manifested by evening hyperphagia and/or nocturnal awakenings accompanied by ingestions of food. A neurobiological marker of NES has been implicated with the recently discovered therapeutic response to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline. This pilot SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) study compared the serotonin transporter (SERT) uptake ratios of night eaters with those of healthy controls. Six night eaters underwent SPECT imaging using the radiopharmaceutical (123)I-ADAM. Uptake, compared with that of the cerebellum, was obtained for the midbrain, basal ganglia, and temporal lobes uptake ratios in night eaters were compared with those of six healthy controls. Night eaters had significantly greater SERT uptake ratios in the midbrain than healthy controls. These findings, in conjunction with the therapeutic response of NES to sertraline, indicate that the serotonin system is involved in the pathophysiology of NES.
