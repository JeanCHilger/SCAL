Myocardial viability in old myocardial infarction as evaluated by T1-201 SPECT and two-dimensional echocardiography. Myocardial viability of the infarcted area was evaluated in 49 patients with old myocardial infarction by thallium-201 myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), two-dimensional echocardiography (2 DE) and electrocardiography (ECG). The following results were obtained: 1. T1 uptake (%TU) correlated significantly with the % systolic thickening ratio (% delta Th) and the interventricular septal excursion (IVSE) (r = 0.66, r = 0.75), suggesting that both parameters are useful in predicting myocardial viability of the infarcted areas. 2. In 18 patients, the % delta Th was 0, IVSE ranged from -3 mm to +3 mm, and a positive correlation between %TU and IVSE was present, suggesting an advantage of IVSE over % delta Th as a parameter. 3. Forty-nine patients were categorized into 4 groups based on their ECG findings 3 with QS and complete RBBB (Group A)
