Developmental stage-related expression and identification of murine erythroid differentiation-denucleation factor (MEDDF). Using MEDDF cDNA fragment in plasmid pBS-SK-MEDDF as template the coding sequence was cloned into pGEM-T-Easy plasmid by PCR method to delete non-coding sequence. After DNA sequencing it was confirmed that the clone sequence was correct, the coding region then was inserted into the vector pET-30a betweenBamH I andHind III to construct eukaryotic expression vector. It was found that the specific protein was up to 40% of total bactorial proteins in certain high-expressionE. coli. High titer of anti-sera was detected by inoculating New Zealand rabbits with purified MEDDF protein as an antigen. By using immunocytochemical staining it was demonstrated that the expression of MEDDF was exhibited in a developmental stage-specific manner, suggesting that MEDDF may play a certain role in the initiation of murine erythroid terminal differentiation and nuclear condensation. As for the expression of MEDDF appearing in granulocytes and megakaryocyter in murine bone marrow, it may indicate that there is an original relationship between the proteins and differentiation of murine myelogenous lineage.
