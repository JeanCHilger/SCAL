What can be expected from nuclear medicine tomorrow? Imaging can take advantage of developments in "omics" approaches and go from routine individual biomarkers to multiple-scale biomarker profiles. Imaging structural, functional, metabolic, cellular, and molecular changes will be made possible by multimodality hybrid techniques, such as positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging. Imaging should predict treatment response, look at stratification for specific treatment modalities, and look at the "omic" characterization of an individual patient or a specific tumor. This should lead to the development of "personalized" medicine. In cancer radiotherapy, patient responses should be accurately predicted. In specific cases, proton and hadrontherapy will be further enhanced by the irradiation dose delivered to the tumors. For disseminated or metastatic disease, targeted radionuclide therapy is an effective addition to the arsenal against cancer. The clinical efficacy of radiolabeled antibodies has been clearly demonstrated in lymphoma as well as that of radiolabeled peptides derived from somatostatin in the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. Preliminary studies now show interesting results in solid tumors, too. Even if the number of objective clinical responses based on tumor shrinkage is small, targeted radionuclide therapy increases progression-free survival or overall survival in some specific cases where tumor burden is small. Avenues for further improvement are multiple and include combination with other therapeutic modalities, development of new approaches (e.g., small molecules, pretargeting, and antibody alternatives). Using alpha-emitting radionuclides is another possibility for specific diseases, such as leukemias, multiple myeloma, or brain tumor remnants.
