Prevalence of intestinal parasites in companion animals in Ontario and Quebec, Canada, during the winter months. Veterinarians in Ontario and Quebec, Canada, typically prescribe monthly heartworm prophylactic and anthelmintic medications for use during the warm months of the year. In many patients, the use of dewormers is discontinued during the winter because of the perception that intestinal parasite infections and shedding of nematode eggs are unlikely when the weather is cold and the ground is frozen or covered with snow. This study examined fecal samples obtained from 96 shelter dogs and cats during the winter in Ontario and Quebec. Intestinal parasites were identified in 34% of submitted samples. These findings support the recommendation that veterinarians should advise pet owners to continue administration of broad-spectrum parasiticides to companion animals during the winter months.
