Intensive cardiovascular risk factors therapy and prevalence of silent myocardial ischaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Screening for silent myocardial ischaemia (SMI) is a controversial strategy undergoing intensive risk factor therapy.To assess the prevalence of SMI and coronary artery disease (CAD) in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients at high cardiovascular risk (two additional risk factors or more) and undergoing long-term intensive risk factor therapy and tight glycaemic control.SMI screening, using isotopic or echographic stress tests, was carried out in 122 asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients at high cardiovascular risk and undergoing long-term intensive risk factor therapy. Coronary angiography was proposed if SMI was detected. Long-term follow-up data on death, myocardial infarction and revascularization were obtained by telephone call or clinical review.The mean age was 65+/-6 years and 74% of patients were men. The mean duration of diabetes was 15+/-9 years. The mean number of additional risk factors was 2.9, 32% of patients had microalbuminuria and 12% had peripheral arterial disease. SMI was detected in 20 (16%) patients. Seven (6%) patients had significant CAD treated successfully by angioplasty (n=6) or bypass surgery (n=1). The positive predictive value of the non-invasive screening test for the diagnosis of significant CAD (stenosis>50%) was 39%. The event rate was very low (1.6%) at 2-year follow-up.Long-term intensive risk factor therapy in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes is associated with low prevalence of SMI and detected CAD. Optimal medical therapy and revascularization of significant CAD are associated with a low cardiovascular event rate at two years.
