Changes in regional cerebral blood flow after body image exposure in eating disorders. Relationships of 'perceptual distortion' and 'cognitive evaluation' components of body image disturbances to brain activity were investigated. Changes in regional cerebral blood (rCBF) of nine patients with anorexia nervosa restrictive type (AN), 13 patients with bulimia nervosa purging type (BN) and 12 controls following three experiments with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were compared: at rest, following a landscape video presentation (neutral stimulus), and after their filmed body image (positive stimulus) exposure. Body distortion was measured with the Silhouette test and body dissatisfaction with the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ). Patients with AN showed a hyperactivation of the left parietal and right superior frontal from neutral to positive stimulus. Patients with BN showed a hyperactivation of the right temporal and right occipital areas. Changes in BSQ responses were associated with changes in the right inferior frontal and right temporal rCBF, whereas changes in body distortion were related to the left parietal. The activation of the right temporal after the own body image exposure might be in accordance with the aversive events' response. Functional abnormalities in AN might be related to the storage of a distorted prototypical image of the body in the left parietal lobe.
