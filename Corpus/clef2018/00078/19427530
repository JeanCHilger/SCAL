Anatomical specificity of functional amygdala imaging of responses to stimuli with positive and negative emotional valence. Non-invasive neuroimaging is increasingly used for investigating the human amygdala. Accurate functional localization in the amygdala region is, however, challenging and quantitative data on the anatomical specificity of functional amygdala imaging is lacking. We have therefore retrospectively investigated 114 recently published human functional imaging studies concerned with the amygdala. We determined the anatomical assignment probabilities of a total of 339 reported activation sites to the amygdala defined using a cytoarchitectonically verified probabilistic atlas system. We find that approximately 50% of reported responses were located in the region with high probability (> or =80%) of belonging to the amygdala. This group included responses related both to stimuli of positive and negative emotional valence. Approximately 10% of reported response sites were assigned to the hippocampus, with up to 100% assignment probability. The remaining peaks were either located in the border regions of the amygdala and/or hippocampus or outside of both of these structures. Within the amygdala, the majority of peaks (96.3%) were found in the laterobasal (LB) and superficial (SF) subregions. Only 3.7% of peaks were found in the centromedial group (CM), possibly because anatomically delineating the CM region of the amygdala is particularly difficult and hence its extent might have been underestimated. Moreover, these results show that a core region of the amygdala is responsive to stimuli both of positive and negative emotional valence. The current findings highlight the usefulness of probabilistic amygdala maps and also point to a need for the development of accurate in vivo delineation and parcellation of the amygdala.
