The effects of measurement errors in the plasma radioactivity curve on parameter estimation in positron emission tomography. The effects of three error sources in plasma curve measurements on parameter estimation in kinetic analysis of positron emission tomography (PET) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) data are investigated by computer simulation. The three error sources are: (1) measurement noise in the radioactivity concentrations of plasma samples (2) linear interpolation between adjacent plasma sampling points of the plasma time activity curve
