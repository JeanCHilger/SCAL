High SUV uptake on FDG-PET/CT predicts for an aggressive B-cell lymphoma in a prospective study of primary FDG-PET/CT staging in lymphoma. Data assessing the role of positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging in lymphoma staging is still being accumulated and current staging is based primarily on CT. This study aims to compare the value of PET/CT over conventional CT and bone marrow biopsy (BMB) in the initial evaluation of patients with lymphoma.Data on 122 patients with PET/CT scans as part of their initial staging were prospectively collected and reviewed. All patients had complete staging, including BMB.Among the 122 patients, 101 had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 21 had Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). Compared with conventional CT, PET/CT upstaged 21 (17%) cases [B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL), 12 T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (T-NHL), 3PET/CT upstages 17% of cases and detects occult splenic involvement. This may have potential therapeutic and prognostic implications. SUV >10 may predict for an aggressive histology. Except for indolent B-NHL, our data show that PET scans have a good overall NPV in excluding lymphomatous bone marrow involvement. This is particularly true of early-stage HL, suggesting that BMB may be safely omitted in this group.
