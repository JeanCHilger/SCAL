Effects of extract of Bulbus Allii Caespitosi on cardiocyte viability of swines with myocardial reperfusion injury evaluated by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography. To investigate the effects of extract of Bulbus Allii Caespitosi on cardiocyte viability of swines with myocardial reperfusion injury by analyzing the 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) position emission tomography (PET) imaging.Twenty-four swines were randomly divided into sham-operated group, untreated group, trimethazine group and extract of Bulbus Allii Caespitosi group. Myocardial reperfusion injury was induced by plugging the anterior descending coronary artery of swine with sacculus. Bulbus Allii Caespitosi or trimetazidine was given twice daily for 28 days. Then myocardial perfusion was detected with (18)F-FDG PET/CT and the radioactivity distribution was evaluated.Compared with the untreated group, Bulbus Allii Caespitosi and trimetazidine could improve the activity of myocardial cells after myocardial infarction (P<0.01), and there were no significant differences between Bulbus Allii Caespitosi and trimetazidine (P>0.05).Bulbus Allii Caespitosi can improve myocardial metabolism after ischemia and reperfusion in swines.
