Quantitative comparison of measurements of cerebral glucose metabolic rate made with two positron cameras. The rapid progress in PET technology has created the dilemma of how to compare data from old and new tomographs. We examined cerebral metabolic data from two scanners, with different spatial resolutions and methods of attenuation correction, to see if metabolic values from the lower-resolution tomograph (ECAT II) could be adjusted to make them comparable to data from the higher-resolution scanner (Scanditronix PC1024-7B). Nine subjects were scanned on both tomographs after a single injection of [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. Regional and lobar gray matter metabolic rates for glucose were obtained from comparable images from each scanner. Ratios of lobar to global gray matter metabolism also were calculated. Regression coefficients and percent differences were computed to compare ECAT II and PC1024 data. Two-thirds of the region pairs showed significant regressions, although percent differences were quite variable, with measures of glucose utilization ranging from 30 to 120% higher on the PC1024 compared to those from the ECAT II. Comparisons of lobar glucose rates between the two machines were less variable (50 to 80%), and ratios differed by only +/- 5% (except for the temporal ratios). Since there was no simple and consistent relationship between regional metabolic rates on the two tomographs, an overall adjustment of regional ECAT values for comparison to PC1024 values would be impossible. A region-by-region adjustment would be necessary. Lobar ratios are sufficiently similar that direct comparisons might be possible.
