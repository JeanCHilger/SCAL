Identification and evaluation of [11C]GSK931145 as a novel ligand for imaging the type 1 glycine transporter with positron emission tomography. The type-1 glycine transporter (GlyT1) is an important target for the development of new medications for schizophrenia. A specific and selective positron emission tomography (PET) GlyT1 ligand would facilitate drug development studies to determine whether a drug reaches this target and help establish suitable doses for clinical trials. This article describes the evaluation of three candidate GlyT1 PET radioligands (GSK931145, GSK565710, and GSK991022) selected from a library of compounds based on favorable physicochemical and pharmacological properties. Each candidate was successfully labeled using [(11)C]methyl iodide or [(11)C]methyl triflate and administered to a pig pre- and postadministration with a pharmacological dose of a GlyT1 inhibitor to determine their suitability as PET ligands in the porcine brain in vivo. All three candidate ligands were analyzed quantitatively with compartment analyses employing a plasma input function. [(11)C]GSK931145 showed good brain penetration and a heterogeneous distribution in agreement with reported GlyT1 localization. Following pretreatment with GSK565710, uptake of [(11)C]GSK931145 was reduced to homogeneous levels. Although [(11)C]GSK565710 also showed good brain penetration and a heterogeneous distribution, the apparent level of specific binding was reduced compared to [(11)C]GSK931145. In contrast, [(11)C]GSK991022 showed a much lower brain penetration and resultant signal following pretreatment with GSK565710. Based on these findings [(11)C]GSK931145 was identified as the most promising ligand for imaging GlyT1 in the porcine brain, possessing good brain penetration, specific signal, and reversible kinetics. [(11)C]GSK931145 is now being progressed into higher species.
