Imaging presentation of venous thrombosis in patients with cancer. The purpose of this article is to review the imaging of venous thrombosis in patients with cancer.Multiple imaging techniques have the capacity to display thrombosis accurately. The optimal choice is dictated by the location and duration of symptoms and by the availability of imaging techniques. Peripheral and superficial thrombi are best managed with ultrasound, whereas central thrombi require CT or MRI. If CT and MRI are contraindicated, flow studies are appropriate. FDG PET/CT appropriately shows venous thrombosis and might play a prominent role in the future.
