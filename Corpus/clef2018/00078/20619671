Positron emission tomography and colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Molecular imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) is now an integral part of multidisciplinary cancer care. In this review, we discuss the role of PET in CRC including well established indications in the assessment of recurrent disease and emerging applications such as initial staging, monitoring therapy efficacy and using PET for radiotherapy planning. With rapid advancement in imaging technology, we also discuss the future potential of combining PET and magnetic resonance imaging and the use of novel radiotracers.
