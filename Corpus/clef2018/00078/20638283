Assessment of glioma proliferation using imaging modalities. The assessment of glioma proliferation rate is important to predict tumor behavior, response to therapy and prognosis. Various methods, largely involving immunohistological markers in tissue samples, have been proposed to this aim however, they all require tissue removal through a biopsy or during a surgical procedure. Consequently, non-invasive imaging modalities that could reliably assess the proliferative potential of intracranial space-occupying lesions in vivo would be of obvious significance. In the present study we review the contribution of MRI, positron emission tomography and single-photon emission CT for the assessment of the proliferative potential of gliomas.
