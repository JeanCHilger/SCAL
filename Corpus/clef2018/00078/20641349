 Malignant melanoma is the sixth most common cancer in the United States (1). Early diagnosis and prompt surgical removal comprise the best approach for a possible cure because malignant melanoma is a very aggressive cancer (2). Melanomas develop from activated or genetically altered neoplastic melanocytes that contain melanin (3-5). Melanin pigment is synthesized and deposited within melanosomes (6). Eumelanin and pheomelanin are the two major types of melanin. Eumelanin is the predominant melanin pigment found in primary tumors. Pheomelanin tends to associate with progression of the disease. Melanins are complex, negatively charged molecules with hydrophobic surfaces, and they have the capability to bind many different types of compounds (3). Therefore, melanins represent a very attractive target for both diagnosis and treatment. Benzamide (BZA) derivatives and iodobenzamides have been found to have affinity for melanomas (3, 7-9). The exact mechanisms of uptake of these compounds have not been fully established (7, 10, 11). Direct melanin binding, involvement in the melanin biosynthesis pathway, and sigma (Ïƒ) receptor mediation have been proposed as the most likely mechanisms for different compounds. In addition, available vascular concentrations of these compounds and their ability to transport into the melanoma cells also influence their cellular uptake (11). Melanin-targeting radiopharmaceuticals that are based on BZA such as [
