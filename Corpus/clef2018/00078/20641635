 The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR)â€“associated tyrosine kinase (TK) is one of the most widely investigated enzymes of this category (1). Under normal conditions, autophosphorylation of the EGFR-TK, as a result of ligand (e.g., the EGF) binding to the receptor, initiates cellular signal transduction pathways that culminate in cell growth, proliferation, motility, and even differentiation into an oncogenic phenotype (2). Because of its participation in the development and spread of several cancer types, the EGFR and the EGFR-TK have been targeted for the treatment of various cancers using a variety of drugs including EGFR antibodies (3) and small molecule inhibitors directed toward the TK (4). In addition, several of these agents are under evaluation in clinical trials approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. The EGFR-TK inhibitors competitively bind to the intracellular ATP binding site of the enzyme and prevent autophosphorylation of the receptor, which thereby inhibits triggering of the signal transduction pathways responsible for initiation of the various biological processes mediated by the EGFR (5). Several types of reversible and irreversible EGFR-TK inhibitors are available, but among these the 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives have been most widely investigated because of their higher potency compared with the other compounds (6). The 4-anilinoquinazoline class of inhibitors has been labeled with nuclides such as fluorine-18, carbon-11, and iodine-124 for positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging of the EGFR in animals (7). However, these labeled compounds were determined to be suboptimal for the studies either due to non-specificity of binding or due to rapid degradation in the blood and liver. In an effort to develop an imaging agent superior to the PET compounds, a technetium (
