 Antibody fragments such as diabodies and minibodies are ideal for molecular imaging because of their compact size and efficient antigen binding (1-4). However, most radiometal-labeled antibody fragments exhibit high kidney retention, which leads to decreased absolute tumor uptake (5-7). In the case of radiometals such as
