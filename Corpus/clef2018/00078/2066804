Quantitative SPECT for indium-111-labeled antibodies in the livers of beagle dogs. Results are presented for SPECT computations of liver volumes and 111In-labeled antibody activities in the livers of eight normal beagle dogs. Administered activities ranged from 1 to 2 mCi. SPECT studies were acquired 1 day postinjection using a rotating gamma camera system with elliptical orbits in a 360-degree rotation (128 views, 15 sec/view, 64 x 64 matrices). Uniformity-corrected images were reconstructed by use of the circular harmonic transform algorithm with computer software developed in-house. Liver volumes and activities were computed from transverse slices, 1 pixel (6.25 mm) in thickness. Comparison of SPECT and autopsy data demonstrated that absolute values of percent differences between measured and computed liver volumes ranged from 1.0% to 7.2%. Absolute values of percent differences between autopsy data and computed 111In activities in the liver ranged from 2.3% to 7.5%. These results suggest that quantitative SPECT has the potential of becoming an important tool in clinical trials for determining activities and localization volumes of radiolabeled antibodies directly from radionuclide images.
