Uterine lesions in 32 female miniature pet pigs. Thirty-two 4-month-old to 19-year-old female miniature pet pigs were spayed. Uterine lesions were present in all except 8 pigs. The 24 remaining pigs had diffuse cystic endometrial hyperplasia, of which 14 had smooth muscle tumors, including leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas, in the uterus or broad ligament. Nodular endometrial lesions-including adenocarcinomas, adenomas, and/or adenomyosis-were present in 10 pigs, 3 of which had concurrent smooth muscle tumors. Pyometra was present in 3 pigs. In uterine sections with cystic endometrial hyperplasia, adenomyosis, or adenomas, approximately 70% of epithelial nuclei expressed estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor immunohistochemically in adenocarcinomas, expression was 20%. Regardless of malignancy, more than 50% of nuclei in smooth muscle tumors expressed estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. Aging was associated with the development of uterine lesions in miniature pet pigs.
