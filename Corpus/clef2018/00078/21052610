Myocardial perfusion imaging using technetium-99m sestamibi in asymptomatic diabetic patients. Myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has been extensively applied in the clinical assessment of patients with diabetes mellitus. The aim of the present study was to evaluate stress technetium-99m sestamibi SPECT MPI perfusion in silent myocardial ischemia and its association with some clinical and laboratory parameters in an asymptomatic diabetic population.83 subjects (age: 57.1Â±6.9 years) with at least five years history of type 2 diabetes, and no suspected or documented coronary artery disease (CAD) accomplished myocardial perfusion imaging angiography was also performed in patients with abnormal MPI.MPI results showed that 58 patients had normal myocardial perfusion, while 25 patients showed perfusion defects (23 reversible and 2 fixed) on MPI. 12 out of the 25 (48%) with abnormal MPI findings represented abnormal angiography. We observed that pretest likelihood of CAD (odds ratio 2.32 95%-CI: 1.05-5.13Occult CAD was present on MPI in 1/3 patients with DM without abnormal electrocardiographic findings or evidence of peripheral arterial disease.
