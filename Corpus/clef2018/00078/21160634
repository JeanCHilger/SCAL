Different imaging techniques in the head and neck: Assets and drawbacks. In this review, the gold standard imaging techniques for the head and neck and the latest upcoming techniques are presented, by comparing computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography-CT, as well as ultrasound, depending on the examined area. The advantages and disadvantages of each examination protocol are presented. This article illustrates the connection between the imaging technique and the examined area. Therefore, the head and neck area is divided into different sections such as bony structures, nervous system, mucous membranes and squamous epithelium, glandular tissue, and lymphatic tissue and vessels. Finally, the latest techniques in the field of head and neck imaging such as multidetector CT, dual-energy CT, flash CT, magnetic resonance angiography, spectroscopy, and diffusion tensor tractography using 3 tesla magnetic resonance are discussed.
