Role of multimodality imaging in ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a major and growing problem in the western hemisphere, affecting about 5Â million patients in the United States. In daily practice patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and significant angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD) are felt to have an ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICMP) and those without CAD or mild-moderate CAD out of proportion to the extent of LVSD are felt to have a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICMP). Although invasive coronary angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of CAD, recent advances in non-invasive imaging have created multiple options for evaluating ICMP and NICMP. This review details the role of cardiac imaging in the diagnosis of ICMP and NICMP and outlines an algorithm of use of non-invasive tests in asymtomatic LVSD and symptomatic heart failure.
