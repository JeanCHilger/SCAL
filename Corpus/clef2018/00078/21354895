CT coronary angiography combined with adenosine stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for detecting flow-limiting coronary stenoses. To assess the feasibility and accuracy of CT coronary angiography (CTCA) combined with adenosine stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) for diagnosis of flow-limiting coronary stenosis.A total of 105 patients with suspected or established coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent CTCA and MPS within 4 weeks before invasive coronary angiography. The accuracy of CTCA/MPS in the diagnosis of flow-limiting coronary stenosis was evaluated in comparison with the results of quantitative coronary angiography and MPS.The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of CTCA/MPS as a combined approach for detection of flow-limiting coronary stenosis were all 100%. In 16% (9/55) of the patients, revascularization procedures were performed and no flow-limiting stenosis was found.Combination of CTCA and MPS has an excellent accuracy for detecting flow-limiting coronary stenosis as compared with quantitative coronary angiography/MPI, and can be a useful gatekeeper for revascularization procedures.
