Left ventricular wall function abnormalities in patients with ankylosing spondylitis evaluated by gated myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. Ankylosing spondilitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease with prominent inflammation in joints and extraarticular organs. AS patients have approximately two times more risk of mortality than the normal population. One reason for this increase in mortality is increased cardiovascular risk. In this study, we have aimed to evaluate myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function using (99m)Tc-MIBI gated myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).The study group consisted of 28 AS patients (19 men, 9 women), and mean age 39.46Â±10.98 years. All patients underwent (99m)Tc-MIBI gated myocardial perfusion SPECT with the same day protocol.We detected various risk factors including smoking habits in 12, family history of cardiovascular disease in 12, hypertension in 3, hyperlipidemia in 9 patients. We performed a myocardial perfusion SPECT for each patient and found normal perfusion pattern in SPECT images. Out of 28 patients, eight patients had normal perfusion but wall motion abnormalities.We detected that myocardial perfusion is preserved in the patients with AS. However, left ventricular wall motion abnormalities are seen. We concluded that ankylosing spondylitis may be associated with microvascular dysfunction and gated myocardial perfusion scintigraphy could be valuable in AS patients for the evaluation of LV function even if the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score are low and the disease duration shorter.
