(18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging detects therapy efficacy of anti-EMMPRIN antibody and gemcitabine in orthotopic pancreatic tumor xenografts. The objective of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic response to a novel monoclonal antibody targeting human extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) in combination with gemcitabine in a pancreatic-tumor xenograft murine model by sequential 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomgraphy (PET/CT) imaging.Four groups of SCID mice bearing orthotopic pancreatic tumor xenografts were injected with phosphate-buffered saline, gemcitabine (120 mg/kg BW), anti-EMMPRIN antibody (0.2 mg), or combination, respectively, twice weekly for 2 weeks, while (18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging was performed weekly for 3 weeks. Changes in mean standardized uptake value (SUV(mean)) of (18)F-FDG and volume of tumors were determined.The tumor SUV(mean) change in the group receiving combination therapy was significantly lower than those of the other groups. Tumor-volume changes of groups treated with anti-EMMPRIN monotherapy or combined therapy were significantly lower than that of the control group.These data provide support for clinical studies of anti-EMMPRIN therapy with gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer treatment.
