Significance of (18)F-FDG-PET/CT for staging and evaluation of therapeutic effect in patient with malignant lymphoma. Imaging examination was already used for an overall assessment of disease sites in patient with malignant lymphoma, it is very important for the disease staging and evaluation of therapeutic effect. Staging is necessary to prevent hyper-or hypo-therapy as well as to minimize morbidity related to the radio-chemotherapy regimens given. (18)F-FDG-PET/CT, a functional imaging modality used for staging and monitoring response to treatment of a variety of human neoplasias, has higher sensitivity and specificity than conventional anatomical imaging. Baseline (18)F-FDG-PET/CT is used for the accurate staging, and helps to interpret the results of the middle therapy and post-therapy middle therapy (18)F-FDG-PET/CT will be usually performed after 2-3 cycles of treatment, which can be used for risk assessment and judgement of therapeutic effect after treatment
