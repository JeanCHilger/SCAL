A method of adjusting and evaluating MRT and SPECT tomograms for comparing cerebral morphology with cerebrovascular regulation. A method is introduced which yields computerized correlations of topographically identical morphological and functional orbito-meatal slices of the brain by employing the specific local resolutions and a simple adaptation algorithm. In addition, a ROI-overlay method is described which may be used to evaluate semiquantitatively (interhemispherical ratios or ratios hemisphere/cerebellum) identical planes to assess rCBF, rCBV and regional vascular regulation. It appears to be advantageous that ROIs can be superimposed on MRI images as well as on SPECT images.
