Whole-body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging: current evidence in oncology and potential role in colorectal cancer staging. Tumour staging in cancer patients generally entails a multimodality imaging approach. Whole-body (WB) imaging techniques may, however, be more time- and cost-effective than a multimodality approach. 2-fluorine-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET), computed tomography (CT) and hybrid positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) are the most established WB modalities, although new techniques, amongst which diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), are emerging. This review aims to evaluate the current evidence for WB-DWI in oncology, to discuss its potential for the WB staging of (colo)rectal cancer and to relate it to the established WB techniques.
