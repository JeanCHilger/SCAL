Specific in vivo binding of [125I]-iodomelatonin to melatonin receptors in rat brain. The in vivo distribution of [125I]-2-iodomelatonin in rat brain was determined at different time intervals after intraarterial injection. After one hour, radioactivity in brain areas devoid of melatonin receptors had washed out to very low concentrations, but significant retention occurred in the medial basal hypothalamus (mbh) which contained the median eminence and in the anterior pituitary gland (ap), areas known to contain high concentrations of melatonin receptors. Coinjection of unlabelled melatonin reduced radioactivity concentrations in the ap and mbh by 44% and 75% respectively at one hour, whereas radiotracer concentrations in other regions remained unchanged. These results indicate the potential for the in vivo study of melatonin receptor concentration changes in human brain in disease states by means of single photon emission computed tomography.
