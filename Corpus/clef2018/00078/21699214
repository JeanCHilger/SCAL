Efficient immobilization and patterning of biomolecules on poly(ethylene terephthalate) films functionalized by ion irradiation for biosensor applications. The surface of a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film was selectively irradiated with proton beams at various fluences to generate carboxylic acid groups on the surface the resulting functionalized PET surface was then characterized in terms of its wettability, chemical structure, and chemical composition. The results revealed that (i) carboxylic acid groups were successfully generated in the irradiated regions of the PET surface, and (ii) their relative amounts were dependent on the fluence. A capture biomolecule, anthrax toxin probe DNA, was selectively immobilized on the irradiated regions on the PET surface. Cy3-labeled DNA as a target biomolecule was then hybridized with the probe DNA immobilized on the PET surface. Liver-cancer-specific α-fetoprotein (AFP) antigen, as a target biomolecule, was also selectively immobilized on the irradiated regions on the PET surface. Texas Red-labeled secondary antibody was then reacted with an AFP-specific primary antibody prebound to the AFP antigen on the PET surface for the detection of the target antigen, using an indirect immunoassay method. The results revealed that (i) well-defined micropatterns of biomolecules were successfully formed on the functionalized PET surfaces and (ii) the fluorescence intensity of the micropatterns was dependent mainly on the concentrations of the target DNA hybridized to the probe DNA and the target AFP antigen immobilized on the PET films. The lowest detectable concentrations of the target DNA and target AFP antigen in this study were determined to be 4 and 16 ng/mL, respectively, with the PET film prepared at a fluence of 5 × 10(14) ions/cm(2).
