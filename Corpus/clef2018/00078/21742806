Sequential FDG-PET/CT as a biomarker of response to Sunitinib in metastatic clear cell renal cancer. To test the hypothesis that sequential (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) is a correlative marker in metastatic clear cell renal cancer (mRCC), patients were treated with sunitinib. Three sequential scans were conducted to determine whether the timing of the investigation was relevant.Forty-four untreated mRCC patients were enrolled into this prospective phase II study. (18)F-FDG-PET/CT scans were conducted before (n = 44) and after 4 weeks (n = 43) and 16 weeks (n = 40) of sunitinib given at standard doses. The primary endpoint was to correlate FDG-PET/CT response (20% reduction in SUV(max)) at 4 and 16 weeks with overall survival (OS).Forty-three (98%) patients had FDG-PET/CT avid lesions at diagnosis (median SUV(max) = 6.8, range: <2.5-18.4). In multivariate analysis, a high SUV(max) and an increased number of PET-positive lesions correlated with shorter OS [HR: 3.30 (95% CI: 1.36-8.45) and 3.67 (95% CI: 1.43-9.39), respectively]. After 4 weeks of sunitinib, a metabolic response occurred in 24 (57%) patients, but this did not correlate with progression-free survival (HR for responders = 0.87 95% CI: 0.40-1.99) or OS (HR for responders = 0.80Baseline FDG-PET/CT yields prognostic significant data. FDG-PET/CT responses occur in the majority of patients after 4 weeks of therapy however, it is not until 16 weeks when the results become prognostically significant.
