Histology and outcomes of newly detected lung lesions in melanoma patients. Melanoma frequently metastasizes to the lung. Improved radiologic techniques may decrease the need for biopsy of such lesions. The aim of this study was to examine factors predictive of a positive biopsy of melanoma.Using the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center melanoma database, all patients with melanoma who had undergone biopsy of a suspicious new lung lesion from 1996 to 2009 were identified. Age, date of diagnosis, histology, and stage were obtained. Chart review was carried out to obtain medical history, smoking status, radiological appearance, and histology of lung lesions biopsied.Two hundred and twenty-nine patients were identified median age was 63 yearsIn this study, 31% of lung lesions were not melanoma. In the subset undergoing PET, this did not differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. Biopsy is mandated in melanoma patients with new lung nodules.
