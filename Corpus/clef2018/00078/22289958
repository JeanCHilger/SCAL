Comparative methods for PET image segmentation  in pharyngolaryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Several methods have been proposed for the segmentation of ¹⁸F-FDG uptake in PET. In this study, we assessed the performance of four categories of ¹⁸F-FDG PET image segmentation techniques in pharyngolaryngeal squamous cell carcinoma using clinical studies where the surgical specimen served as the benchmark.Nine PET image segmentation techniques were compared including: five thresholding methods the level set technique (active contour)The clinical results suggested that four of the thresholding methods and expectation-maximization overestimated the average tumour volume, while a contrast-oriented thresholding method, the level set technique and the FCM-SW algorithm underestimated it, with the FCM-SW algorithm providing relatively the highest accuracy in terms of volume determination (-5.9 ± 11.9%) and overlap index. The mean overlap index varied between 0.27 and 0.54 for the different image segmentation techniques. The FCM-SW segmentation technique showed the best compromise in terms of 3-D overlap index and statistical analysis results with values of 0.54 (0.26-0.72) for the overlap index.The BTVs delineated using the FCM-SW segmentation technique were seemingly the most accurate and approximated closely the 3-D BTVs defined using the surgical specimens. Adaptive thresholding techniques need to be calibrated for each PET scanner and acquisition/processing protocol, and should not be used without optimization.
