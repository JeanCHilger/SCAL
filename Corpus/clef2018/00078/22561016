Over-expression in Escherichia coli, purification and reconstitution in liposomes of the third member of the OCTN sub-family: the mouse carnitine transporter OCTN3. pET-21a(+)-mOCTN3-6His was constructed and used for over-expression in Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS. After IPTG induction a protein with apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa was collected in the insoluble fraction of the cell lysate and purified by Ni(2+)-chelating chromatography with a yield of 2mg/l of cell culture. The over-expressed protein was identified with mOCTN3 by anti-His antibody and reconstitution in liposomes. mOCTN3 required peculiar conditions for optimal expression and reconstitution in liposomes. The protein catalyzed a time dependent [(3)H]carnitine uptake which was stimulated by intraliposomal ATP and nearly independent of the pH. The K(m) for carnitine was 36 Î¼M. [(3)H]carnitine transport was inhibited by carnitine analogues and some Cys and NH(2) reagents. This paper represents the first outcome in over-expressing, in active form, the third member of the OCTN sub-family, mOCTN3, in E. coli.
