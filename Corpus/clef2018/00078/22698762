Functional involvement of superior temporal sulcus in quality of life of patients with schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to investigate the neural substrate underlying quality of life (QoL) in patients with schizophrenia. Thirty-one right-handed patients were included. Patients were grouped according to 'high' and 'low' QoL levels. Whole-brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with (99m)Tc-labeled ethylcysteinate dimer ((99m)Tc-ECD), for the measurement of voxel-based regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), was used to compare these two groups with Statistical Parametric Mapping. Correlations of rCBF with QoL scores were secondarily explored. Nineteen of the 31 patients had a high QoL level. There was no significant difference in demographic and clinical characteristics between patients with high and low QoL levels. In comparison to patients with low QoL, those with high QoL exhibited significant bilateral temporal hypoperfusions, primarily in the superior temporal sulcus (STS). In the total group of patients, perfusion in the left STS was negatively correlated with psychological well-being, self-esteem, and sentimental life, as well as with the global index of the questionnaire. This study shows that perfusion of the STS, a brain area thought to contribute to self/other awareness and metacognition, is involved in the functional substrate underlying QoL. Our findings contribute to clarifying the scientific foundation required for a better clinical use of QoL questionnaires by suggesting that the recognition of illness-related impairment is associated with alteration of QoL.
