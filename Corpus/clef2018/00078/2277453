Indium-111 antimyosin monoclonal antibody uptake in patients with cardiomyopathy and myocarditis. Prognostic significance of myocardial uptake of indium-111 antimyosin antibody was evaluated in 17 patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathy 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 7 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Seven of 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy showed positive images. Three of these 7 patients with strongly positive scans died after scintigraphic examination. Six of 7 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy showed positive images. Three of the patients with dilated left ventricle had prominent positive scans and higher heart to lung ratio. The heart to lung ratio of antimyosin uptake in total patients was correlated with left ventricular end-diastolic dimension and ejection fraction measured by echocardiography. In patients with myocarditis, all three patients showed positive scintigrams within 4 weeks after the onset of the disease and 1 of 6 patients was positive thereafter, who had dilated ventricle and decreased cardiac function. Thus, indium-111 antimyosin antibody imaging may be useful to evaluate prognosis of patients with cardiomyopathy and myocarditis.
