Direct, nucleophilic radiosynthesis of [18F]trifluoroalkyl tosylates: improved labelling procedures. A rapid and efficient protocol to afford the title compound 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2,2-difluoroethyl tosylate ([(18)F]7b) is described. Starting from [(18)F]fluoride ion, labelling reagent 7b was obtained in good yields and a high specific radioactivity. Compound ([(18)F]7b) was then used to synthesise a prospective radiotracer for PET-imaging in dementia.
