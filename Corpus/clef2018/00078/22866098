Fluorine-18-labeled boronophenylalanine positron emission tomography for oral cancers: Qualitative and quantitative analyses of malignant tumors and normal structures in oral and maxillofacial regions. The present study aimed to demonstrate the features of fluorine-18-labeled boronophenylalanine positron emission tomography ((18)F-BPA-PET) to reveal oral cancer, as well as normal structures in the oral and maxillofacial regions. We analyzed (18)F-BPA-PET findings from 8 patients with histologically confirmed recurrent and/or advanced oral cancer scheduled for boron neutron capture therapy. The capacity of (18)F-BPA-PET to delineate tumor and normal structures was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. Tumors were easily identified as high uptake areas in all cases. Although the eyes, which were depicted as a low uptake area, and tongue musculature were readily identified, major vessels were not noted in any of the cases. Areas corresponding to the surface of the dorsum tongue to middle pharynx were expressed as high uptake areas in all of the cases. Quantitatively, tumors were expressed as the highest uptake area in 6 of the 8 cases, while the dorsum tongue had the highest uptake area in the remaining 2 cases. (18)F-BPA-PET is useful in demonstrating the presence of a tumor. Thus, it is crucial to note the presence of a high uptake area corresponding to the dorsum area of the tongue when diagnosing a tumor using this technique.
