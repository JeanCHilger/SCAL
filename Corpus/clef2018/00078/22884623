Dosimetry of [⁶⁸Ga]-labeled compounds. This review compiles and analyzes the available dosimetry data of [(68)Ga] labeled compounds. Dosimetry data are given for [(68)Ga]DOTA-NOC, TOC, TATE, and NODAGA-RGDyK. The number of PET-scans with [(68)Ga]DOTA-compounds for imaging neuroendocrine tumors is increasing because [(68)Ga] has a higher affinity to somatostatin receptors (SSTR) in comparison to comparable [(111)In]-compounds. In addition, the better image resolution of the PET images provides improved diagnostics. Despite its widespread use literature on dosimetry of [(68)Ga]-labeled radiopharmaceuticals is sparse. In some cases the description of the underlying methodology is missing or human data are gained from the extrapolation of animal experiments. More and better documented dosimetry data will further promote the use of these promising new agents.
