Risk stratification of cardiovascular events in patients at all stages of chronic kidney disease using myocardial perfusion SPECT. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, stratification of the prognostic risk of cardiovascular events is useful for their clinical management. We evaluated the ability of electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to predict cardiac events among Japanese patients at all stages of CKD including those on hemodialysis.Patients with CKD undergoing ECG-gated myocardial perfusion SPECT to investigate suspected ischemic heart disease were followed up to monitor retrospectively major cardiac events including cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina pectoris. Summed stress score, summed rest score, and summed difference score were estimated with a 20 segment 5-point scoring model. The severity of CKD was divided into five levels based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) revised for the Japanese population.The follow-up period was 25.8 Â± 11.0 months. Sixty-two major cardiac events (cardiac death, n=30 non-fatal myocardial infarction, n=13Myocardial perfusion SPECT can contribute to the prediction of cardiac events and survival in patients at all stages of CKD including those on hemodialysis.
