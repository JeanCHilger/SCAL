Assessment of the biological activity of residual or recurrent neuroblastoma tumors with 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy. 131I-Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is now accepted as a useful agent for the diagnosis of adrenal medullary tumor. The aim of this paper is to evaluate 131I-MIBG for the assessment of the biological activity of residual or recurrent tumor after initial treatment in patients with neuroblastoma. Nineteen scans were performed for 9 patients, mean age 3.5 years-old. Computed tomography demonstrated paravertebral mass in six and metastatic liver tumor in four cases. Anterior and posterior images of the thorax and abdomen were taken 48-72 hours after injection of 7.4-18.5 MBq (0.2-0.5 mCi) 131I-MIBG. Positive images were obtained in 8 scans for four patients and followed by rapid growth of tumor and increased urinary dopamine. The biological activity of residual or recurrent tumor was thought to be high in these patients. Eleven scans for 5 patients revealed negative. In four of them, the tumor size reduced and urinary dopamine value remained within normal limits on the follow-up study. The tumor was assumed to have low biological activity in these patients. One case in which initial scan was negative became positive on the follow-up study. 131I-MIBG activity did not well correlate with urinary vanillylmandelic acid as compared with urinary dopamine. In conclusion, 131I-MIBG proved to be useful for assessing biological activity of residual or recurrent tumor of neuroblastoma and estimating the prognosis of the patient.
