The diversity of (68)Ga-based imaging agents. Development of new radiopharmaceuticals and their availability are crucial factors influencing the expansion of clinical nuclear medicine. The number of new (68)Ga-based imaging agents for positron emission tomography (PET) is increasing greatly. (68)Ga has been used for labeling of a broad range of molecules (small organic molecules, peptides, proteins, and oligonucleotides) as well as particles, thus demonstrating its potential to become a PET analog of the legendary generator-produced gamma-emitting (99m)Tc but with added value of higher sensitivity and resolution as well as quantitation and dynamic scanning. Further, the availability of technology for GMP-compliant automated tracer production can facilitate the introduction of new radiopharmaceuticals and enable standardized, harmonized multicenter studies to be conducted for regulatory approval. This chapter presents some examples of tracers for targeted, pretargeted, and nontargeted imaging with emphasis on the potential of (68)Ga to facilitate clinically practical PET development and to promote the PET technique worldwide for earlier and better diagnostics, and personalized medicine with the ultimate objective of improved therapeutic outcome.
