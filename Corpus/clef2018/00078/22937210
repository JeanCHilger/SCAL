ImmunoPET and near-infrared fluorescence imaging of CD105 expression using a monoclonal antibody dual-labeled with (89)Zr and IRDye 800CW. CD105 (endoglin) is an independent marker for poor prognosis in more than 10 solid tumor types. The goal of this study was to develop a CD105-specific agent for both positron emission tomography (PET) and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging, which has potential clinical applications in the diagnosis and imaged-guided resection of solid tumors. TRC105, a chimeric anti-CD105 monoclonal antibody, was conjugated to a NIRF dye (800CW) and p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-desferrioxamine (Df-Bz-NCS) before (89)Zr-labeling. Another chimeric antibody, cetuximab, was used as an isotype-matched control. FACS analysis revealed no difference in CD105 binding affinity/specificity between TRC105 and Df-TRC105-800CW. Serial PET imaging revealed that the 4T1 tumor uptake of (89)Zr-Df-TRC105-800CW was 6.3 ± 1.9, 12.3 ± 1.3, and 11.4 ± 1.1 %ID/g at 4, 24, and 48 h post-injection (p.i.) respectively (n = 3), higher than all organs starting from 24 h p.i., which provided excellent tumor contrast. Tumor uptake as measured by both in vivo and ex vivo NIRF imaging had a linear correlation with the %ID/g values obtained from PET, corroborated by biodistribution studies. Blocking experiments, control studies with (89)Zr-Df-cetuximab-800CW, and histology all confirmed the CD105 specificity of (89)Zr-Df-TRC105-800CW. In conclusion, herein we report dual-modality PET and NIRF imaging of CD105 expression in a breast cancer model, where CD105-specific uptake of (89)Zr-Df-TRC105-800CW in the tumor was observed.
