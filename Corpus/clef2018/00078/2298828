Effect of nimodipine on regional cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with acute ischemic stroke as measured by positron emission tomography. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of 27 patients with acute ischemic stroke, the effect on regional CMRglc (rCMRglc) of the calcium channel blocking agent nimodipine administered in addition to routine treatment was investigated. Following computed tomography-supported diagnosis of focal ischemia in the middle cerebral artery territory, positron emission tomography (PET) of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) was performed, and the patients were entered into the study within 48 h after onset of symptoms, randomly receiving either nimodipine (2 mg/h constant i.v. infusion for 5 days, 120 mg/day orally for another 16 days) or carrier/placebo. FDG PET was repeated after completion of therapy. The clinical course was followed during the treatment period and for 6 months after the stroke, using the Mathew Score for early and the Barthel Index for late assessment. During that observation period, five patients died in the nimodipine group and four in the control group. Subsequently, the code was broken, and the clinical and PET data were analyzed in relation to treatment assignment, with the nimodipine group comprising 11 and the control group 12 eligible cases. The two groups were similar with respect to age and sex distribution, initial clinical deficit, and infarct size and location. While the infarct rCMRglc showed comparable slight increases over time in both groups, the metabolic changes in the other evaluated regions (contralateral infarct mirror region, ipsi- and contralateral cerebral gray matter, contra- and ipsilateral cerebellar hemispheres) differed significantly between treatment groups (side x region x treatment interaction p less than 0.025).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
