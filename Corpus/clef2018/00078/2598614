Exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy in the localization of myocardial ischaemia. We performed a retrospective study in order to study the ability of thallium-201 exercise scintigraphy to detect and to localize coronary artery perfusion defects (in comparison with a recent coronary angiogram). We studied 81 patients (67 males) their average age was 52.3 years (men 50.5 and women 54.1 years). They performed a pulse-conducted cycle exercise test, and 2 min before end of exercise 75 MBq of thallium-201 was infused intravenously, and tomographic images were reconstructed by using a Siemens-Rota SPECT gamma camera immediately and 4 h after exercise. The thallium-201 uptake defects were attributed to different coronary arteries, and the results were compared with a coronary angiogram made afterwards in 48 patients. The groups of one-, two- and three-vessel disease were 27, 21, and 21 patients, and only 12 patients did not have significant (over 50%) stenoses. The latter had the highest ejection fraction and working capacity. Sensitivity of thallium-201 exercise scintigraphy was 65%, whereas that of exercise ECG was 41% in patients with a low ejection fraction, while in the whole material the sensitivity of thallium-201 scintigraphy was 91% and that of exercise ECG was 54%. A stenosis in the right coronary artery was best localized by the thallium-201 scintigram (86% correctly)
