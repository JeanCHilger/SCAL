Metabolic fate of the heart agent [18F]6-fluorometaraminol. Studies were performed to determine whether [18F]6-fluorometaraminol (18F-FMR), a new neuronal heart radiopharmaceutical, is metabolized in vivo and if the metabolites are taken up in heart. Rat, dog, baboon and guinea pig were injected with 18F-FMR and tissue samples were analyzed for metabolites by HPLC. Liver contained the most metabolites of the tissues studied with 25-90% of the radioactivity present as metabolites at 1 h in all the species studied. While metabolites of 18F-FMR are found in blood, no significant accumulation of these metabolites is found in heart (less than or equal to 0.3%) 1 h after i.v. administration in any species except rat. These studies suggest that 18F-FMR is a suitable agent for quantitative imaging of the heart by positron emission tomography.
