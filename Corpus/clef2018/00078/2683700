Circadian patterns of myocardial ischemia. In this overview we studied evidence for the occurrence of silent myocardial ischemia, its pathophysiologic mechanisms, and the circadian distribution of ischemic episodes. The correlation between many hemodynamic parameters and their potential as drug targets was assessed. ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia (ST segment), a parameter often used in exercise tests, also occurs during ambulatory monitoring. Use of the isotope rubidium-82 and positron emission tomography helped confirm the significance of these changes in the ST segment, both painful and silent. Ischemia was detected by a reduction in the uptake of the isotope in a region of the heart reflecting a decrease in myocardial blood flow. Also it was shown that both painful and silent ischemia are caused by similar pathophysiologic mechanisms such mechanisms include alterations in coronary blood flow and increases in myocardial oxygen demand. Episodes of ST segment depression show a circadian rhythm similar to that seen for heart rate and catecholamine release. The basic pattern shows a low incidence of ischemia at night, followed by a primary peak on rising, a decrease at midday, and then a secondary peak in the evening, with a final decrease again at night. Similar circadian rhythms have been described for acute cardiovascular events, and this may be important for treatment.
