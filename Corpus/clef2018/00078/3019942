18F]fluoride from a small cyclotron for the routine synthesis of [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucos. [18F]Fluoride was produced via the 18O (p, n) 18F reaction using a low volume stainless steel 18O-water target in a small cyclotron. The average 18F production rate for 60 runs was about 720 microCi/microA-min. A typical bombardment time of 20 min produced 120 mCi of 18F-fluoride. [18F]2-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]2FDG) was prepared using the procedure developed by Tewson [J. Nucl. Med. 24, 718 (1983)] involving a protected cyclic sulfate glucose derivative as precursor. The routine synthesis and quality testing of [18F]2FDG required 1 h and, typically, yields of 30-35 mCi of greater than 95% HPLC-pure product were obtained.
