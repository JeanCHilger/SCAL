Cerebral blood volume is increased in dogs during administration of nitrous oxide or isoflurane. Positron emission tomography was used to study the effects of nitrous oxide (N2O) and isoflurane on regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in dogs during normocapnia and hypocapnia. Regional cerebral blood volume was measured serially during the addition of 50% N2O to a background anesthetic of fentanyl in normocapnic (group 1) and hypocapnic (PaCO2 25 mmHg, group 2) dogs. In each group, after 15 min of N2O administration accompanied by rCBV measurement, elimination of N2O with 100% O2 was continued for 15 min. This was followed by introduction of 2% isoflurane (no N2O), again accompanied by serial measurements of rCBV. In the normocapnic animals, the addition of 50% N2O caused an 11% increase in rCBV (6.1 +/- 1.4 to 6.8 +/- 1.0 ml/100 g, P less than 0.02) while 2% isoflurane caused a 36% increase (6.1 +/- 1.3 to 8.0 +/- 1.7 ml/100 g, P less than 0.02). The initial induction of hypocapnia during infusion of fentanyl in group 2 animals was associated with a 17% decrease in rCBV. In the hypocapnic dogs, there was no change in rCBV when N2O was introduced however, an increase of 15% occurred following the addition of isoflurane (3.9 +/- 0.6 to 4.5 +/- 0.7 ml/100 g, P less than 0.02). Isoflurane, even during hypocapnia, may increase cerebral blood volume which in some circumstances may lead to an increase in ICP.
