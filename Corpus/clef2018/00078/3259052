Detection of ischemia with thallium-201 single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and radionuclide ventriculography in comparison with stress cineventriculography. The accuracy of radionuclide techniques for detection of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia was analyzed with TL-201 single-photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) and gated blood pool ventriculography in 31 patients. Reversible and persistent perfusion defects in the biphasic SPECT studies, parametric phase and amplitude images and global indices of left ventricular function were evaluated and compared to the results of exercise cineventriculography. Out of 25 patients with coronary heart disease, 20 had exercise-induced ischemia and 17 patients had a prior myocardial infarction. SPECT detected ischemia with a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 100%, gated blood pool ventriculography had a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 91%. Both scintigraphic methods were comparable in the detection of myocardial infarcts (SPECT/gated blood pool ventriculography: sensitivity 88%/82% specificity 100%/93%
