The preparation of 11C-labelled fluoromethane for the study of regional cerebral blood flow using positron emission tomography. Fluoromethane, previously labelled with 18F and used as a tracer in the measurement of regional cerebral blood flow, was 11C-labelled by the reaction of 11C-methyl iodide with tetraethylammonium fluoride. Sufficient quantities of radiotracer were prepared with a minimum amount of handling from 15 min target irradiations in the 14N(p, alpha)11C reaction. Total synthesis time was 25 min from end-of-bombardment, allowing serial blood flow measurements 30 min apart. The use of 11C-fluoromethane as a cerebral blood flow tracer in positron emission tomography is discussed.
