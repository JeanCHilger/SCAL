The effect of hemodynamically significant carotid artery disease on the hemodynamic status of the cerebral circulation. Although the presence of a hemodynamically significant carotid artery lesion is commonly used as an indicator of impaired cerebral circulation, the effect of such lesions on cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow has never been determined accurately. We used positron emission tomography (PET) to study 19 patients with unilateral hemodynamically significant carotid artery disease (greater than 66% diameter reduction) and no evidence of cerebral infarction. According to PET measurements in the cerebral hemisphere distal to the lesion, 7 patients had normal cerebral hemodynamics, 8 had reduced perfusion pressure with normal blood flow, and 4 had reduced blood flow. Neither the percent stenosis nor the residual lumen diameter in the carotid artery was a reliable indicator of the hemodynamic status of the cerebral circulation. However, a significant relationship was found between the PET measurements of cerebral hemodynamics and the arteriographic circulation pattern (p = 0.006). The role of hemodynamic factors in the pathogenesis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease cannot be determined from the severity of carotid artery disease alone.
