Definition of hepatic tumor microcirculation by single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). Single photon emission computerized tomography coupled with Tc-99m MAA hepatic-arterial perfusion scintigraphy has been used to examine the density of the functional microcirculation of hepatic tumors relative to normal liver in 24 patients. In both colorectal and carcinoid tumors we have demonstrated an average three-fold greater arteriolar-capillary density in areas of tumor proliferation. The depth of the evoked tumor hypervascularity was found to extend about 4 cm. Tumors greater than 8-9 cm in diameter were uniformly found to have a central hypovascular core. These observations are of importance in the design of selective strategies utilizing therapeutic microspheres directed against the hypervascular proliferating regions of human tumors.
