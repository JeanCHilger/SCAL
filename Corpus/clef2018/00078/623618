The occurrence of antibodies to Brucella canis in domestic dogs in the Federal Republic of Germany. 1000 random serum samples of pet dogs were examined in the serum tube agglutination test for antibodies to Brucella canis. Agglutinating antibodies to Br. canis antigen were detected in 18 cases in a serum dilution of 1 : 50, in 29 cases in a serum dilution of 1 : 100, in 13 cases in a serum dilution of 1 : 200 and in a serum dilution 1 : 400. But the positive results of the agglutination tests were confirmed by complement fixation, agargel-precipitation and indirect immunofluorescence only in 2 cases (0,2%) with titers of 1 :200 and 1 :400. These serological findings indicate that in the Federal Republic of Germany Br. canis infections are rarely in pet dogs as compared with dogs (Beagles) held in research kennels.
