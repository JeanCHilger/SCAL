Estimates of kidney volume by single photon emission tomography: a preliminary report. Algorithms for the estimation of organ volumes have been developed which may provide whole organ volumes and which may or may not, at the operator's choice, take into account any voids which may be contained within the organ. These algorithms have been applied to the estimation of the volume of the kidneys, in normal subjects and in patients with renal disease. The dimensions of the kidneys were similar to those derived from ultrasound study measurements which were performed independently. Kidney volume should prove especially useful in the diagnosis of early graft rejection and in the diagnosis of glomerulonephritis.
