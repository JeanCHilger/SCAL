Transverse section imaging of soft tissue tumors and peripheral vascular disease. The development of soft tissue tumors and peripheral vascular disease is accompanied by changes in physiologic parameters such as blood flow and metabolism. Positron tomography can provide regional values of parameters such as blood flow, blood volume, oxygen utilization, and glucose metabolism in normal and diseased tissue. Such information may be of value in determining appropriate therapy and in assessing the effects of therapy. Equilibrium imaging during continuous inhalation of C15O2 provides a means of measuring blood flow on a regional basis. Equilibrium C15O2 imaging has been applied on a preliminary basis in patients with soft tissue tumors. In general, tumor tissue exhibits markedly higher rate of blood flow than normal tissue. In some patients, necrotic areas exhibit a greatly diminished blood flow. In the case of peripheral vascular disease, equilibrium C15O2 imaging shows decreased blood flow in affected regions. A significant increase in blood flow is seen following transluminal dilation.
