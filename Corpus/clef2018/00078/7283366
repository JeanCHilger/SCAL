Free radical oxidation (peroxidation)products in plasma in normal and abnormal pregnancy. Using recently developed methods for measuring free-radical oxidation products in biological material, plasma extracts were studied in 24 women in the first two trimesters of pregnancy, in 124 women in the third trimester of pregnancy, in 20 women with pre-eclamptic toxaemia (PET), and in a control group. There was a significant progressive rise of two groups of free-radical oxidation products throughout pregnancy and a significantly greater rise in PET. In women whose diastolic blood pressure rose to above 70 mmHg there was a highly significant relation between two groups of free-radical reaction products and blood pressure.
