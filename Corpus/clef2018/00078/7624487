Magnetic resonance imaging using deoxyhemoglobin contrast versus positron emission tomography in the assessment of brain function. 1. Function of the brain can be assessed through radiologic imaging to determine physiology of underlying tissue. 2. Until recently, positron emission tomography has been the standard tool with which to study function. 3. In the past few years, several investigators have attempted to use magnetic resonance imaging, which has better resolution and is less expensive, to provide functional information. 4. A noninvasive technique termed BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) has become a popular area of research to determine physiologic change that occurs in the brain in resting as well as activated states. 5. This article reviews what information PET has given us with regard to function of the brain, followed by a discussion of the principle of functional MRI of the brain with emphasis on what has been done in this field as well as future application of the technique.
