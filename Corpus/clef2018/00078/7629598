Comparative assessment of nine scatter correction methods based on spectral analysis using Monte Carlo simulations. We compared nine scatter correction methods based on spectral analysis which process SPECT projections.Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate histories of photons emitted from a realistic 99mTc phantom. A particular projection was considered. Information regarding the history, location and energy of the photons detected in this projection was analyzed to test the assumptions underlying each scatter correction method. Relative and absolute quantification and signal-to-noise ratio were assessed for each scatter corrected image.For the simulated data, two methods do not enable activity quantification. Among the methods requiring some parameters to be calibrated, the dual-energy window method shows the best compromise between accuracy and ease of implementation but introduces a bias in relative quantification. In this respect, a triple-energy window technique is more accurate than the dual-window method. A factor analysis approach results in more stable quantitative accuracy (error approximately 10%) for a wide range of activity but requires a more sophisticated acquisition mode (30 energy windows).These results show that a scatter correction method using spectral analysis can be used to substantially improve accurate quantification.
