Study on the primary visual cortex of visually impaired subjects by means of 123I-IMP SPECT and MRI. We conducted a study of rCBF in the primary visual cortex of visually impaired subjects who have not been subjected to external stimulation for a long period, by means of 123I-IMP SPECT and MRI. The four subjects had lost their sight due to brain tumors (n = 2), glaucoma (n = 1) and trauma (n = 1). 123I-IMP SPECT showed no differences between the visually impaired group and a visually sound control group on visual analysis as well as semiquantitative analysis. MRI of the visually impaired subjects showed no organic changes, such as atrophy, in the occipital cortex. In conclusion, visually impaired subjects have no decrease in rCBF and no anatomical changes in the primary visual cortex.
