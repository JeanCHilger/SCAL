Prior restraint: a Bayesian perspective on the optimization of technology utilization for diagnosis of coronary artery disease. In conclusion, at least 1/3 of patients with suspected coronary artery disease are inappropriately referred for scintigraphic diagnostic testing from a Bayesian such as those described in this report, may be a powerful mechanism for encouraging more appropriate technology utilization while simultaneously controlling costs, and are thereby deserving of a formal prospective demonstration trial. However, since only half the patients currently being tested are referred for diagnostic purposes, analogous strategies must be developed with respect to prognostic and therapeutic evaluation.
