FDG-PET for predicting the prognosis of malignant lymphoma. To evaluate the usefulness of FDG-PET as a predictor of prognosis, 34 patients with untreated malignant lymphoma in the head and neck region were studied. After FDG-PET and treatment, they were observed from 15 to 50 months. Tumors which were aggressive and resistant to treatment tended to show high uptake of FDG. The survival rate of patients with high uptake of FDG, DAR > or = 8, was lower than the rate of the other patients. It is considered to be useful to add FDG uptake of the tumor to other prognostic factors for predicting the prognosis.
