PET1402, a nuclear gene required for proteolytic processing of cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 in yeast. The nuclear mutation pet ts1402 prevents proteolytic processing of the precursor of cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 (cox2) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The structural gene PET1402 was isolated by genetic complementation of the temperature-sensitive mutation. DNA sequence analysis identified a 1206-bp open reading frame, which is located 215 bp upstream of the PET122 gene. The DNA sequence of PET1402 predicts a hydrophobic, integral membrane protein with four transmembrane segments and a typical mitochondrial targeting sequence. Weak sequence similarity was found to two bacterial proteins of unknown function. Haploid cells containing a null allelle of PET1402 are respiratory deficient.
