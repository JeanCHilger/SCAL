Segmental analysis of resting echocardiographic function and stress scintigraphic perfusion: implications for myocardial viability. In 73 patients with coronary artery disease, we performed segmental analysis of resting two-dimensional echocardiography and stress thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomographic scintigraphy with 24-hour delayed imaging to test the hypotheses that (1) combined analysis of stress thallium-201 scintigraphy (with 24-hour redistribution) and echocardiography provides an evaluation of the viability of most myocardial segments and (2) the severity of the scintigraphic perfusion abnormality in a given segment is equivalent to the severity of its echocardiographically determined functional impairment. Scintigraphy showed 14% of the 1168 segments analyzed to have fixed severe defects. Echocardiography showed 11% of the 1070 segments analyzed to be akinetic or dyskinetic. However, with combined analysis, only 62 (5%) segments showed no evidence of viability by either imaging technique. We conclude that in this group of patients, 95% of segments have evidence of viability by one of these two conventional imaging techniques.
