Automatic control device for the continuous administration of (15)O labeled gaseous tracers for PET measurements. An automatic control device for the administration of (15)O labelled gaseous PET tracers with constant dose per time (continuous inhalation) is presented. The system controls the flow through the target, the flow to the patient and the dose to the patient simultaneously. The desired values for the dose and the flow to the patient are variable. The dose to the patient is kept constant with +/- 4% even if the beam current raises or if the beam is off for some seconds.
