The electroencephalographic correlates of neurological disorders in the late periods of exposure to ionizing radiation (the aftereffects of the accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Station). EEG mapping and three-dimensional localization of epileptic activity sources together with a neurological analysis were carried out in subjects having taken part in 1986-1987 in the liquidation of consequences of the Chernobyl accident. Experimental group included 40 right-handed 25-45 years-old men having received a radiation dose of 15-51 Ber stated officially. Control group consisted of 20 healthy men. Neurological examination of the patients revealed vegetative-vascular and endocrine dysfunctions as well as diffuse neurological symptoms. EEG of one group of patients (25 persons) was characterized by slow alpha- and theta-band foci and epileptic waves in the central-frontal regions epileptic sources were localized at the diencephalic level mainly in the midline being shifted to the right hemisphere. In the EEG of another group (15 persons) delta-waves were recorded in the frontal regions at the background of diffuse beta-activity. The sources of epileptic activity of a diffuse character were localized at the basal level of the brain and in the cortex (predominantly) in the left hemisphere. The results obtained together with SPECT mapping and CT data permit to suppose the organic damage of different brain structures (at the cortical and the midline levels) in the patients, with participation of diencephalic structures in the pathological process hypothalamic-hypophysial system being probably connected with adaptive processes in the CNS.
