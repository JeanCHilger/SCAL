Quantification of infarct size by thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography using the unfolded map method. Comparison with QRS score and angiographic infarct size at 4 weeks after infarction. A new technique of data processing, the unfolded map method, was used with thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography to quantify infarct size in 35 patients with single-vessel disease at 4 weeks after their first myocardial infarction (24 anterior and 11 inferior infarcts), and the results were compared with those obtained by electrocardiography and contrast left ventriculography. The myocardial borders and the infarcted region were defined using the threshold technique and a cutoff value of 55%. Count profile data for each short-axis slice were unfolded zonally into single planes with the same ratio, and their areas were calculated from the slice thickness and radius. Thus, the size of the unfolded map represented the actual left ventricular myocardial area Infarct size was quantitated from the ratio of pixels in the infarcted region to those in the whole map, and the ratio itself was used as the percent infarct size. Although a defect 1 cm in diameter (0.8 cm2) could not be detected in a phantom study, defects > or = 2 cm in diameter (> or = 3.1 cm2) could be measured satisfactorily. The infarct size and percent infarct size determined by the unfolded map method correlated well with the QRS score (r = 0.841 and r = 0.838), the percentage of abnormally contracting segments on left ventriculography (r = 0.835 and r = 0.877), and the ejection fraction (r = -0.835 and r = 0.856). These data indicate that the unfolded map method provides adequate quantification of infarct size, even in the chronic phase, without complicated data processing.
