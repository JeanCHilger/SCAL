A problem of quantitative measurement of regional cerebral blood flow using microsphere model and N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (IMP): comparison with 133Xe SPECT and sequential dynamic 123I-IMP SPECT. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in 13 patients with various cerebral disease by N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (IMP) SPECT with the microsphere model (rCBF (CbST)), which was compared with 133Xe inhalation SPECT (rCBFXe). Continuous withdrawal of arterial blood was performed for 5 minutes and SPECT image was obtained from 25 min to 55 min after the tracer injection. The reconstructed counts at 5 min was corrected using entire cerebral counts collected at 5 min, 20 min, and 60 min after the tracer injection. As compared with rCBFXe, rCBF (CbST) was underestimated in high flow areas and overestimated in low flow areas. Regional CBF was also measured using one minute short time SPECT images at 5 min (rCBF (Cb5)), 20 min (rCBF (Cb20)), and 60 min (rCBF (Cb60)) after the injection. Regional CBF tended to be underestimated with time from the tracer injection due to the wash-out from brain tissue to blood. In comparison with rCBF (Cb5), rCBF (CbST) was underestimated in high flow areas and overestimated in low flow areas. This error was considered to be due to the correction of reconstruct counts using entire cerebral counts, because of the kinetic behavior of 123I-IMP was different in each region of the brain.
