Enhanced detection of brain tumors by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET with glucose loading. We applied glucose loading during PET studies with [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) to enhance detection of brain tumors by diminution of FDG uptake in normal gray matter.This study involved three patients with glioblastomas. Two PET scans were performed in all cases within 1 week in control and with glucose loading state.In all patients, tumor was depicted more clearly with glucose loading than in the control study. The FDG uptake ratio of tumor to normal cortical gray matter showed a mean increase of 27% with glucose loading.This technique might be useful for detection of recurrent or residual tumors.
