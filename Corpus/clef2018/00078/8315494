Iododeoxyuridine uptake and retention as a measure of tumor growth. Iodine-131-iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) uptake and retention was measured in two C6 glioma cell lines (C6m and C6a) with different growth characteristics. Animals with intracerebral (i.c.) C6a tumors had a mean survival of 16 days, whereas only 1 of 20 animals with i.c. C6m tumors died during an 8-wk period of observation. The growth of i.c. C6m tumors could be described by the Gompertz equation tumor doubling time increased from 1.9 to 5.2 days between Days 8 and 16 after tumor inoculation. Corresponding measurements of 131I-IUdR uptake and retention (24 hr after IUdR administration) by i.c. C6m tumors were also time-dependent and decreased from 0.075 to 0.027 to 0.011 %dose/g in 8-, 10- and 16-day-old tumors, respectively. Iodine-131-IUdR uptake in "rapidly growing" i.c. C6a tumors was substantially higher (0.30 %dose/g at 24 hr) than that in "slowly growing" i.c. C6m tumors and corresponded with differences in the survival data. Subcutaneous C6a tumors had comparable high uptake values (0.49 %dose/g at 24 hr), and 93% of total tumor radioactivity was recovered in DNA 24 hr after IUdR administration. Clearance of radioactivity was rapid in nonproliferative tissues
