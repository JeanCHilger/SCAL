Evaluation of 99Tcm-labelled alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate aerosols for SPECT ventilation lung imaging. The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate 99Tcm-labelled alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate (GP) aerosols for single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) ventilation lung imaging in comparison to 99Tcm-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA) aerosols. Ten normal nonsmoking male volunteers (aged 20-30 years) were included in this study after obtaining their informed consent. 99Tcm-GP, 30 mCi, in 2 ml was placed in the nebulizer (Venticis II) and inhalation continued for 5 min of normal breathing with oxygen flowing through. In 10 subjects dynamic images were obtained from the posterior position for 90 min with 45 frames on a 64 x 64 matrix by the use of a gamma camera. At the end of the dynamic study planar images of the lung (anterior, posterior and laterals) were recorded. Decay corrected clearance curves and kep values were obtained by the pulmonary epithelial programme and T1/2 values were calculated. The same procedure was followed by the use of 99Tcm-DTPA in the same subjects 2 weeks later. SPECT studies of the lung were performed in five subjects after inhalation of 99Tcm-GP aerosols. Clearance curves were monoexponential. The difference in T1/2 values between the right and left lungs was statistically insignificant (P > 0.10). The mean T1/2 values were 316.5 +/- 44.7 and 80.8 +/- 13.4 min for 99Tcm-GP and 99Tcm-DTPA, respectively. The difference was significant (P < 0.0005). On scintigraphic images 99Tcm-GP showed high alveolar deposition and low adhesion to major airways like 99Tcm-DTPA. However, it is preferred to 99Tcm-DTPA for SPECT studies because of its prolonged pulmonary clearance.
