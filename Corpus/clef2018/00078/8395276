Synthesis and evaluation of 1'-[18F]fluorometoprolol as a potential tracer for the visualization of beta-adrenoceptors with PET. (+/-)-1'-[18F]Fluorometoprol 4 was prepared from desisopropylmetoprolol and [18F]fluoroisopropyl tosylate 2 with a radiochemical yield of 2% [corrected for decay to end of bombardment (EOB), synthesis time 90 min]. Synthon 2 was prepared from (S)-1,2-propanediol di(p-toluenesulfonate) in 45% radiochemical yield (EOB, 40 min). Compound 4 shows in two in vitro assays a similar affinity at beta-adrenoceptors (about 0.3 microM) as metoprolol 5, but with a slightly higher beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptor selectivity ratio (48.6 vs 30.7). In vivo experiments with 4 showed almost no receptor-mediated uptake in the heart, probably because the affinity of (fluoro)metoprolol for the beta 1-adrenoceptors is too low for successful imaging. However, the in vitro experiments suggest that the fluoroisopropyl group is suitable for the synthesis of [18F]fluorinated beta 1-adrenergic receptor binding ligands.
