PET-study of intracranial meningiomas: correlation with histopathology, cellularity and proliferation rate. The glucose metabolism of 62 meningiomas was measured by fluorine -18-2-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and correlated with proliferation rate (Ki-67 index) and tumor cellularity. The mean metabolic rate (MRGlu) for meningiomas was 0.26 +/- 0.13 mikromol/g/min (range 0.08-0.62 mikromol/g/min). The relative tumor FDG-uptake (Q-MRGlu) (tumor/contralateral cortex) of all meningiomas was calculated with 0.73 +/- 0.37 (0.24-1.79). Differences of Q-MRGlu were significant between the groups with high vs. low cellularity (p < 0.01), increased vs. normal proliferation rate (p < 0.025) and low (WHO grade I) vs. higher (WHO grades II, III) graded tumors. In recurrent meningiomas (14 tumors) the glucose metabolism was not increased. The data show that 18 FDG-PET is suitable to serve as non-invasive predictor of tumor growth characteristics in meningiomas.
