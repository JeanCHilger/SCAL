Comparisons between SPECT and quantitative EEG measures of cortical impairment in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. This study aimed at examining correlations between quantitative REM sleep EEG, regional cerebral blood flow measured by single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and global cognitive functioning in nine patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. REM sleep EEG was not correlated with SPECT measures in any of the 6 regions studied. However, degrees of interhemispheric asymmetry calculated by both measures were concordant for the parieto-occipital region. Mini-mental state score correlated with REM sleep EEG slowing for left frontal, left and right parieto-occipital and left temporal regions but was not correlated with SPECT measures for any of the six regions. These results suggest that quantitative REM sleep EEG would be more useful than SPECT for evaluating cerebral dysfunctions in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
