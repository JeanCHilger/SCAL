Pretreatment with [131I] metaiodobenzylguanidine and surgical resection of advanced neuroblastoma. Pretreatment with [131I] metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) followed by surgical resection in advanced neuroblastoma (stage 3 and 4) has been studied in relation to resectability, morbidity and mortality, survival rate after two years, control of distant metastasis and serum levels of LDH as prognostic factors. Twenty-one patients with advanced neuroblastoma were primarily treated with MIBG radiotherapy, followed by surgical resection. Sixteen patients had stage 4 disease. Between 2 and 6 courses of MIBG treatment were given per patient. In 17 patients gross complete resection was achieved. Two patients developed complications directly related to the operation, one died as a result of this. The overall mortality was 38%. MIBG therapy resulted in partial response in 13 patients and in stable disease in 8 patients. Two years survival in the group with partial response was 86% and in the group with stable disease 28%. Because of the resulting excellent general condition of the patients the interval between pretreatment with MIBG and surgery could be very short. Follow-up till December 1994 showed that 13 children were alive for 3 to 47 months. Seven had no evidence of disease. Preoperative MIBG de novo treatment in advanced neuroblastoma is equal to induction chemotherapy, but less toxic.
