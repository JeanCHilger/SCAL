Brain SPECT with dipyridamole stress to evaluate cerebral blood flow reserve in carotid artery disease. This is a preliminary study of SPECT brain scan using dipyridamole as a stress agent to assess cerebral blood flow reserve in six patients with severe carotid artery disease.We performed SPECT scanning of the brain, with and without dipyridamole stress. Dipyridamole (0.57 mg/kg) was given intravenously 3 min before infusion of 99mTc-HMPAO. Patients were studied 30 min later using a rotating head gamma camera. The scans were analyzed qualitatively and semiquantitatively. An acetazolamide stress SPECT image was also obtained in two patients.All patients had at least 80% stenosis in one internal carotid artery, three of them also had contralateral carotid stenosis. The dipyridamole SPECT showed an increased region of hypoperfusion in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the severe carotid disease in four patients. That suggests poor perfusion reserve and the potential risk of regional ischemia. In four of six patients, side-to-side asymmetry increased from the baseline condition after injection of dipyridamole. The asymmetry index increased more after dipyridamole than after acetazolamide injection in two patients.This study suggests that dipyridamole stress SPECT is useful in assessing cerebral blood flow reserve. It demonstrates the region of poor vascular reserve in patients with severe carotid artery disease. Dipyridamole SPECT scans show more extensive hypoperfusion than acetazolamide in the two cases.
