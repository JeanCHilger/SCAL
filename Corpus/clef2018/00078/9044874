Optimal metabolic conditions during fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose imaging a comparative study using different protocols. Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) can identify viable myocardium in patients with coronary artery disease. Recently, FDG imaging with single-photon emission tomography (SPET) and 511-keV collimators has been described. To obtain optimal image quality in all patients, cardiac FDG studies should be performed during hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamping. It has been suggested that FDG imaging after the administration of a nicotinic acid derivative may yield comparable image quality to clamping. We studied eight patients and compared the image quality of cardiac FDG SPET studies after oral glucose loading, after administration of a nicotinic acid derivative (acipimox, 250 mg orally) and during hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamping. The image quality was expressed as the myocardial to blood pool (M/B) activity ratio, which is used as a measure of the target-to-background ratio The M/B ratios were comparable after clamping and acipimox (2.8+/-0.8 vs 2.9+/-0.7), whereas the M/B ratio was lower after oral glucose loading (2.2+/-0.3, P<0.05 vs clamp and acipimox). To determine the clearance of FDG from the plasma, blood samples were drawn at fixed time intervals and the FDG activity was measured in a gamma well counter. The FDG clearance was significantly lower after oral glucose loading (T(1/2) oral load=16. 2+/-5.7 min) as compared with clamping (T(1/2) clamp=8.1+/-3.1 min) and acipimox (T(1/2) acipimox=10.7+/-4.0 min, NS vs clamp, P<0.05 vs oral load). It may be concluded that FDG SPET imaging after acipimox administration yields image quality and clearance rates comparable to those obtained during clamping. FDG SPET in combination with acipimox may useful in clinical routine for the assessment of myocardial viability.
