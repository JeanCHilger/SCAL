Pulmonary nodules: differential diagnosis using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose single-photon emission computed tomography. The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for differentiating malignant from benign pulmonary nodules.Twenty-six patients with 28 radiologically indeterminate focal pulmonary lesions were examined. Fasting patients were injected with 5 MBq/kg of FDG (maximum dose, 370 MBq). Imaging was performed with dual-head SPECT cameras equipped with 511-keV collimators.Seventeen of 21 pathologically malignant nodules showed FDG uptake on SPECT imaging (sensitivity, 81%). None of the seven benign modules showed uptake (specificity, 100%). SPECT imaging with FDG was positive in all 16 malignant nodules that were larger than or equal to 2 cm in diameter. However, only one (20%) of five nodules smaller than 2 cm in diameter showed positive on SPECT imaging.Using current technology, we found FDG SPECT imaging useful for distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules that were larger than or equal to 2 cm in diameter. However, because of the relatively low sensitivity of SPECT, smaller malignant nodules were not adequately revealed.
