Brain energy metabolism, cognitive function and down-regulated oxidative phosphorylation in Alzheimer disease. Reduced brain glucose utilization in early stages of Alzheimer disease, as measured with in vivo positron emission tomography, reflects potentially reversible down-regulation of gene expression for oxidative phosphorylation within neuronal mitochondria. Such down-regulation may occur when neuronal energy demand is first reduced by synaptic dysfunction or loss.
