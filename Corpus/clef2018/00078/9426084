Risk factors for asthma in young adults. Spanish Group of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey. We assessed the association of asthma prevalence in young adults with susceptibility factors and environmental exposures, taking into account the age at asthma onset. A random sample of the general population, aged 20-44 yrs, in five areas of Spain (Albacete, Barcelona, Galdakao, Huelva, and Oviedo) was selected in the frame of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS). Overall, 2,646 subjects (response rate = 60.9%) responded to a respiratory questionnaire and 1,797 (41.4%) finalized a bronchial challenge. Atopy to perennial (odds ratio (OR) = 10.2, 95% confidence interval 4.2-25) and seasonal allergens (11.5, 4.6-28), parental asthma (4.5, 2.5-8.4), and birth order (OR for no older siblings in comparison to having more than two = 3.2, 1.2-9.1) were associated with current asthma whatever the age of asthma onset. Past asthma was associated to a lesser extent with atopy (OR around 3.5 to both perennial and seasonal allergens). Lower respiratory tract infections before the age of 5 yrs (LRTI), having had a pet in childhood, and being born in a younger cohort were associated with asthma starting before the age of 15 yrs, but not after. Male gender was more frequent in childhood asthma and female gender in adulthood. In addition to the known risk factors of asthma (atopy to perennial allergens, parental asthma) we provide evidence for an association of asthma (whatever the age of onset) with sensitization to seasonal allergens, and having less than three older siblings and for an association of childhood asthma with lower respiratory tract infections.
