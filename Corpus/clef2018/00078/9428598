Determination of 5-hydroxy-L-[beta-11C]tryptophan and its in vivo-formed radiolabeled metabolites in brain tissue using high performance liquid chromatography: a study supporting radiotracer kinetics obtained with positron emission tomography. A high performance liquid chromatographic system was developed for separation of 11C-labeled 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan ([11C]HTP) and in vivo formed radiolabeled metabolites in rat brain tissue. Analysis of brain homogenate revealed that the main part of the radioactivity was associated with 11C-labeled 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid after intravenous injection of [11C]HTP to the rat. The serotonin synthesis rate in the brain was calculated and closely correlated to the serotonin synthesis rate in monkey and human measured using positron emission tomography.
