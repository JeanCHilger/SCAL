The absence of toxicity in intraperitoneal iron dextran administration: a functional and histological analysis. To determine the influence of iron dextran intraperitoneal administration on the function and histology of the peritoneum in rats undergoing chronic peritoneal dialysis.Prospective, randomized experimental study.Fifty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups: 3 study groups--high dose group (H), n = 12 intermediate dose (M), n = 12The study groups were given Dianeal containing iron dextran in a concentration of 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125 mg/L (groups H, M, and L respectively). Group D was given standard Dianeal. Group C was never dialyzed.A 2-hour peritoneal equilibrium test (PET) was performed on the eighth day, at 3 months, and at 6 months. After the final PET, the animals were sacrificed and the peritoneal membrane was evaluated by gross inspection and light microscopy (silver, prussian blue, and trichrome staining).Peritoneal transport of small solutes followed the same pattern in all groups, increasing over time. The peritonitis index was similar in the groups. No iron deposits or morphologic differences were seen in the gross inspection of the peritoneal cavity. No peritoneal iron deposition was detected in the histological analysis with prussian blue staining. No differences were noted in the light microscopic analysis of the mesothelial cell layer (silver staining), nor did the morphometric analysis of the submesothelial space show any differences in thickness between the groups.These findings suggest the absence of toxic effects of iron dextran on the peritoneal cavity of rats in the concentrations studied. Further studies should be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these dosages delivered intraperitoneally to maintain iron homeostasis.
