An examination of regional cerebral blood flow during object naming tasks. The purpose of this study was to examine regional cerebral blood flow using positron emission tomography (PET) during the performance of tasks related to visual confrontation naming. Ten healthy, young participants were scanned twice in each of 5 conditions blood flow was measured using standard PET [15O]-water technology. Two major findings have replicated previous studies. First, the naming of visually presented objects, whether covert or overt, requires a region of the left inferior cortex including the fusiform gyrus. Second, during overt naming, there is an increase in activity in the inferior or frontal cortex and insula as a consequence of generating speech code. These data are consistent with other studies demonstrating the importance of the inferior temporal regions for semantic processing, and the frontal cortex for word form generation.
