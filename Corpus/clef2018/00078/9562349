Effect of glycaemic control on myocardial sympathetic innervation assessed by [123I]metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy: a 4-year prospective study in IDDM patients. Diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) has been directly characterized by reduced or absent myocardial [123I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake, but there is no information available on the relationship between the myocardial adrenergic innervation defects and long-term glycaemic control. In a prospective study over a mean of 4 years we examined myocardial sympathetic innervation in 12 Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients using MIBG scintigraphy (absolute and relative global MIBG uptake at 2 h p.i.) in conjunction with cardiovascular autonomic function tests, QTc interval, and QT dispersion. Six healthy non-diabetic subjects served as controls for the MIBG scintigraphy at baseline. HbA1c was measured twice a year. One patient, in whom MIBG accumulation was reduced maximally, died during follow up. Among the remaining patients 5 had good or borderline glycaemic control (mean HbA1c < 7.6% Group 1), whereas 6 patients were poorly controlled (mean HbA1c > or = 7.6%
