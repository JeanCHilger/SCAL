11C-flumazenil PET in neocortical epilepsy. To investigate focal cortical abnormalities of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A-central benzodiazepine receptors (GABA(A)-cBZRs) in patients with extratemporal partial seizures with acquired lesions and in patients with normal high-resolution MRI.Six patients with acquired lesions and 18 patients with normal high-resolution MRI and extratemporal partial seizures, as well as 24 normal controls, were studied with 11C-flumazenil (FMZ) PET to produce voxel-by-voxel images of FMZ volume of distribution (FMZVD), which reflects density of GABA(A)-cBZRs. These images were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). Each patient was compared with the control group to reveal regions with abnormal FMZVD at p < 0.001 uncorrected, corrected to p < 0.05 for the whole brain volume. Each normal control was compared with the remaining controls in the same manner.All six patients with acquired lesions had a single region of reduced FMZVD. Thirteen of 18 patients with normal MRI had regions of abnormal cortical FMZVD: 10 had regions of increased FMZVD, 6 had regions of decreased FMZVD, and 3 had both regions of increased and decreased FMZVD. Seven patients had an abnormality in the lobe and 12 in the hemisphere of presumed seizure origin.FMZ PET analyzed with SPM is an automated, objective, sensitive, and specific means for detecting regional cortical abnormalities of GABA(A)-cBZRs in patients with partial seizures. This technique may be useful in the evaluation of patients with refractory partial seizures for surgical treatment, particularly in those patients with normal MRI.
