Reopening the mental imagery debate: lessons from functional anatomy. Over the past few years, the neural bases of mental imagery have been both a topic of intense debate and a domain of extensive investigations using either PET or fMRI that have provided new insights into the cortical anatomy of this cognitive function. Several studies have in fact demonstrated that there exist types of mental imagery that do not rely on primary/early visual areas, whereas a consensus now exists on the validity of the dorsal/ventral-route model in the imagery domain. More importantly, these studies have provided evidence that, in addition to higher order visual areas, mental imagery shares common brain areas with other major cognitive functions, such as language, memory, and movement, depending on the nature of the imagery task. This body of recent results indicates that there is no unique mental imagery cortical network rather, it reflects the high degree of interaction between mental imagery and other cognitive functions.
