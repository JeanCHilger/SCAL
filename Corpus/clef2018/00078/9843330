Hepatocellular carcinoma outcomes based on indicated treatment strategy. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Western populations historically has been associated with poor survival. In this study, we conducted a 7-year retrospective analysis of patients evaluated at our institution with HCC to determine the effects of newer treatment strategies on outcome. During the period of study, 117 patients [86 (74%) male mean age, 59 years (range, 16-85)] were evaluated with treatment as follows: surgical resection in 22 (19%), chemoembolization with or without systemic chemotherapy in 40 (35%), systemic treatment alone in 16 (13%), orthotopic liver transplantation in 8 (7%), and supportive care only in 31 (26%). Sixty-nine patients (59%) had documented cirrhosis, with hepatitis C being the most common cause in 27 of 69 (39%). In patients receiving no treatment, median survival was just under 3 months, with only two 1-year survivors. Patients with orthotopic liver transplantation had 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates of 87, 87, and 58 per cent compared with 69, 52, and 43 per cent in surgically resected patients. Survival after chemoembolization was 35, 20, and 11 per cent at 1, 2, and 3 years, whereas survival after systemic chemotherapy was 30 and 15 per cent at 1 and 2 years, respectively. One-year survival was improved in noncirrhotic patients compared with cirrhotics (47% vs 29%
