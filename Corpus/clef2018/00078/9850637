Correlation of fine needle aspiration biopsy and fluoride-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the assessment of locally recurrent and metastatic head and neck neoplasia. Patients with primary head and neck neoplasia can present during follow-up with suspected recurrence, and both fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and fluoride-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan are available methodologies for evaluating these patients. Our objective was to retrospectively correlate patients who underwent both FNAB and FDG-PET scan in order to assess the possibility of recurrent neoplasia.The cytopathology files at Saint Louis University Health Sciences Center were retrospectively searched for patients with known primary head and neck malignancies beginning in 1995. Suspected recurrence and local metastases evaluated by both FNAB and FDG-PET scan were correlated.Twenty-eight patients received a combined total of 37 FNABs with concurrent FDG-PET scans. The majority of patients had primary oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with intermixed, single cases of other primary head and neck neoplasms. Thirty of the 32 aspirates with recurrent or locally metastatic disease had combined positive findings by both FNAB and FDG-PET scan, yielding a sensitivity of 94%. One nonspecific and one negative FDG-PET scan came from a patient who had disease confirmed by FNAB. Five patients had negative findings by both methods that were supported by the subsequent clinical course.FNAB can provide confirmatory evidence of disease in a clinically suspicious abnormality with nonspecific FDG-PET results. FNAB and FDG-PET are highly sensitive for tumors in cases of clinically suspected recurrence and locally metastatic disease.
