Electroencephalographic characterization of brain dopaminergic stimulation by apomorphine in healthy volunteers. Apomorphine, a dopamine receptor agonist (given in a dose of 0.75 mg s.c.), was administered to 8 healthy volunteers electroencephalograph (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) mapping were performed before dosing and 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 h after dosing. Apomorphine caused an overall increase in beta activity at time 0.5 h in both absolute and relative energy
