Advances in cardiac imaging. Silent myocardial ischemia is the most important target of a variety of imaging modalities. The ultimate technology would include anatomic, functional, and myocardial perfusion information. Ultrafast computer tomography, as this time, is the best modality for studying the coronary arteries. Positron Emission Tomography remains the gold standard for studies of myocardial blood flow and myocardial utilization.
