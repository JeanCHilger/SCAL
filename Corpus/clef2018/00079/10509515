Nuclear medicine in neurology and psychiatry. Progress in nuclear medicine has always been a function of technological advances, and applications in neurology and psychiatry illustrate the point. Improvements in radiation detectors now allow for three-dimensional and quantitative mapping of the distribution of a labelled compound in the human brain. New ligands permit the study of specific functioning signals of the blood/brain barrier, blood flow, metabolism (oxygen, glucose, aminoacids), and neurotransmission (dopamine, benzodiazepine, serotonin receptors). The picomolar sensitivity of nuclear medicine can now be coupled to a wide group of ligands which offer specific information that can be obtained in no other way in the living patient.
