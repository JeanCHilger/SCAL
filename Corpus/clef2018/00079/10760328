Relation between evolutionary ST segment and T-wave direction and electrocardiographic prediction of mycardial infarct size and left ventricular function among patients with anterior wall Q-wave acute myocardial infarction who received reperfusion therapy. In the prethrombolytic era it was found that infarct size and left ventricular ejection fraction could be predicted using the Selvester QRS score. We evaluated whether infarct size and left ventricular ejection fraction could be predicted by the predischarge QRS score in patients who had received reperfusion therapy and whether considering the configuration of the ST segments and T waves would increase the accuracy of these predictions. We evaluated 51 patients with first anterior wall myocardial infarction who had received reperfusion therapy and predischarge resting technetium-99m-sestamibi scan. The electrocardiograms recorded on the same day of the scan were analyzed for the QRS score and were divided into 3 groups: A, isoelectric ST and negative T waves B, ST elevation (> or =0.1 mV) and negative T waves
