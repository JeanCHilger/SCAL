Photon energy recovery for crosstalk correction in simultaneous 99mTc/201Tl imaging. Simultaneous 99mTc sestamibi/201Tl imaging enables the acquisition of images of myocardial stress perfusion and myocardial viability in a single process. One of the major limits of this technique is the crosstalk of the 99mTc downscattered photons into the 201Tl window. We propose using the spectral deconvolution technique photon energy recovery (PER) for correcting this crosstalk.A planar line phantom made of 99Tc vertical lines and 201Tl horizontal lines and a cardiac SPECT phantom including an anterior (2 mL) and an inferior (1.5 mL) myocardial fixed defect were used. The phantoms were filled with an initial 99mTc/201Tl ratio of 5:1. Several successive acquisitions were made from time t = 0 to time t = 48 h (99mTc/201Tl ratio approximately 0) without moving the phantoms. Total number of counts, contrast, and normalized SD (NSD) were calculated on the Tl-raw and the Tl-PER planar images. SPECT datasets were analyzed. The Tl-raw images recorded at 48 h were considered the reference "virgin" 201Tl images.Total number of counts, contrast, and NSD ranged from 336% to 201%, 15% to 29%, and 257% to 225% of the virgin 201Tl values, respectively, for Tl-raw planar images whereas values for Tl-PER images ranged from 128% to 108%, 61% to 79%, and 154% to 108%, respectively. Anterior and inferior defect contrasts ranged from 1.18 to 1.22 and 1.12 to 1.16 for Tl-raw SPECT images, respectivelyPER is quantitatively efficient to remove 99mTc crosstalk photons from 201Tl images for 99mTc/201Tl ratios ranging from 5:1 to 2:1.
