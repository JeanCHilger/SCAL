Reduced cerebral glucose metabolism in subjects with incidental hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging. To clarify the significance of incidental and asymptomatic hyperintensities on T(2)-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) in adults, we examined the relationship between a variety of these lesions and cerebral metabolism evaluated by positron emission tomography (PET) with (18)F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG).Two hundred and thirty-one persons with hyperintensities on T(2)-weighted MRI but without overt neurological disease (mean age 60+/-9 years) were studied. MR hyperintensities were classified into deep and/or subcortical white matter hyperintensities (DSWMHs), periventricular hyperintensities (PVHs) and hyperintensities in the basal ganglia and/or thalamus (HBGTs). The relationship between these lesions and cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRgl) measured by [(18)F]FDG-PET was investigated.The CMRgl values in white matter and cerebral cortex in the group with severe PVHs were lower than those in the group with mild PVHs (P<0.0001 and P<0.005). Although the severity of PVHs was associated with the numbers of DSWMHs and HBGTs, the results of multivariate analysis showed a significant relationship of PVHs to glucose metabolism in cerebral cortex and white matter.We conclude that increasing severity of MRI hyperintensities in adults is associated with a deterioration of cerebral metabolism. In particular, involvement of PVHs may be a marker of widespread deterioration of cortical metabolism.
