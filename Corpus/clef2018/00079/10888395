Role of insulin resistance in heart and skeletal muscle F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Altered heart and skeletal glucose usage has been reported in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Although elevations in plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations have been implicated in reduced myocardial 18fluorine-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake (MFU), the specific role of whole-body insulin resistance in MFU in patients with NIDDM compared with skeletal muscle metabolism remains controversial.MFU and skeletal muscle 18fluorine-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake (SMFU) were compared with positron emission tomography and the whole-body glucose disposal rate (GDR) during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamping in 26 normotensive asymptomatic patients with NIDDM who were not taking medication. These factors were also compared in 12 age-matched control subjects to increase the knowledge of the influence of whole-body insulin resistance on MFU. In addition, independent factors for both SMFU and MFU were investigated.GDR in control subjects (10.0 +/- 2.97 mg/min per kilogram) was significantly higher than in patients with NIDDM (4.05 +/- 2.37 mg/min per kilogram, P < .01). SMFU in patients with NIDDM (0.826 +/- 0.604 mg/min per 100 g) was significantly lower than that in control subjects (1.86 +/- 1.06 mg/min per 100 g, P < .01). MFU in patients with NIDDM (5.35 +/- 2.10 mg/min per 100 g) was also significantly lower than that of control subjects (7.05 +/- 1.66 mg/min per 100 g, P = .0182). SMFU significantly correlated with GDR (r = .727, P < .01) and FFA (r = -.52, P < .01) in patients with NIDDM. MFU also correlated with GDR (r = .778, P < .01) and FFA (r = -.72, P < .01) in patients with NIDDM. Multivariate stepwise regression analysis showed that GDR (F = 36.8) was independently related to MFU (r = .85, P < .01) whereas FFA was not (F = 1.763), where F is the value for statistical analysis of multivariate stepwise regression analysis.Insulin resistance is the most essential factor for both heart and skeletal muscle FDG uptake in patients with NIDDM.
