Positron emission tomographic imaging of acoustic neuromas. Positron emission tomography (PET) examination with both [11C]methyl-l-methionine (Met) and [18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) was performed in the same patients with acoustic neuroma wherever possible in order to compare the usefulness of the two methods. The study included six patients who visited the Osaka City University Hospitals, between April 1994 and October 1998, for complaints associated with acoustic neuroma. All patients were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Met-PET. Four patients were examined by FDG-PET. The tumor's region of highest accumulation was selected as the region of interest the tumor/normal ratio (T/N ratio) was defined as the ratio of radioisotope counts for tumor and normal gray matter. All tumors in this series were detected by MRI. In the Met-PET images, four tumors were easily identified, with a high T/N ratio. However, two tumors could not be identified using Met-PET. On FDG-PET, no cases could be identified. The T/N ratio for the four patients with positive Met-PET findings averaged 1.694 +/- 0.266. PET, especially Met-PET, is a powerful means of examination providing functional information on tumors in acoustic neuroma. Met-PET may therefore be useful for acoustic neuroma, which is known to proliferate slowly, as for malignant tumors, in evaluating the proliferating potential of a tumor, in determining patients in whom to perform radiological treatment and in monitoring post-treatment progress.
