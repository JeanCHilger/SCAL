Prognostic value of stress-gated Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT after acute myocardial infarction. Stress-gated technetium-99m (Tc-99 m) sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is used to risk stratify patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In clinical practice, results of this test are used primarily to identify patients with myocardial ischemia for intervention. The value of this test to risk stratify patients with AMI not at high ischemic risk has not been addressed. More than 1-year follow-up was undertaken in 124 patients who underwent predischarge gated Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT studies and who did not undergo subsequent revascularization. Clinical variables and test-derived variables were evaluated to predict cardiac death, recurrent AMI, and hospitalization for unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or coronary revascularization. Independent predictors by multivariate analysis for cardiac death or recurrent AMI were a history of prior AMI (relative risk [RR] = 5.32, confidence interval [CI] 2.17 to 12.96), a low exercise capacity (RR = 6.84, CI 1.99 to 23.48), and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) <40% (RR = 2.63, CI 1.04 to 6.38). The incidence of cardiac death or recurrent AMI was 29.8% in patients with a low exercise capacity versus 4.5% in those with good exercise capacity, and 38.1% in patients with LVEF <40% versus 9.4% in those with LVEF >40%. Independent predictors of cardiac death, AMI, or hospitalization for unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or revascularization were a history of prior AMI (RR = 2.24, CI 1.11 to 4.50) and LVEF <40% (RR = 3.13, CI 1.64 to 5.95). Among patients followed after AMI without revascularization Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT can identify a high-risk subset. The strongest independent predictors are poor exercise capacity and LVEF < 40%.
