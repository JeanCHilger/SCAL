Electrical impedance tomography of human brain activity with a two-dimensional ring of scalp electrodes. Previously, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has been used to image impedance decreases in the exposed cortex of rabbits during brain activity. These are due to increased blood volume at the site of the stimulated cortex as blood has a lower impedance than brain, the impedance decreases. During human brain activity similar blood flow changes have been detected using positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). If blood volume also changes then the impedance of human cortex will change during brain activity
