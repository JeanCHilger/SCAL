Myocardial scintigraphy and coronary arteriography in patients with known or suspected stable angina pectoris. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) demonstrates regional hypoperfusion, whereas coronary angiography shows anatomical stenoses in epicardial arteries. Both modalities are potentially relevant in patients with stable angina pectoris.MPI was undertaken before angiography in 86 randomly selected patients with stable angina pectoris.Of 78 adequately stressed patients, MPI was normal in 28 (36%) and showed reversible and irreversible perfusion abnormalities in 30 (38%) and 20 patients (26%), respectively. Coronary angiograms were normal in 28 (36%) and revealed at least one > or = 50% stenosis in 50 patients (64%) (16 with single vessel and 34 with multivessel disease). With angiography as reference, the sensitivity and specificity of MPI in the detection of coronary artery disease were 88% and 93%, respectively.Patients with stable angina pectoris and a normal MPI have a very low risk of cardiac events and do not usually require invasive investigation and therapy.
