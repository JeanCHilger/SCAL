Carbon-11 acetate as a tracer of myocardial oxygen consumption. Estimation of myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) and myocardial blood flow (MBF) is important for the understanding of various (patho)physiological mechanisms and diseases. Clearance rates of carbon-11 labelled acetate, determined with positron emission tomography, allow estimation of MVO2 on a segmental level and non-invasively. In addition, MBF can be determined from uptake rates. In this review, the background to estimation of MVO2 and MBF is discussed, as well as the currently available literature that has used 11C-acetate to estimate MVO2 and MBF.
