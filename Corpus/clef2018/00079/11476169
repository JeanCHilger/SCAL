PET imaging of hypoxia. Hypoxia in tumors has been related to poor response to conventional therapies. This paper will discuss the methods, both invasive and non-invasive, used to determine hypoxia levels within tumors. PET imaging with two lead compounds 18F-fluoromisonidazole (18FMISO) and Cu(II)-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone (Cu-ATSM) and their relative effectiveness in delineating hypoxic regions will be discussed. The advantages of Cu-ATSM-PET over existing imaging agents will be discussed along with its potential application as a direct- and/or surrogate marker for the determination of oncological hypoxia in vivo.
