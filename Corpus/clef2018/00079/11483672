Correlation between postoperative 3-[(123)I]iodo-L-alpha-methyltyrosine uptake and survival in patients with gliomas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of SPECT imaging using the amino acid analog 3-[(123)I]iodo-L-alpha-methyltyrosine (IMT) in patients with gliomas.One hundred fourteen consecutive patients with newly diagnosed gliomas were examined by IMT SPECT (low-grade glioma, n = 12 anaplastic astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma, n = 46In group A, focal IMT uptake at the resection site was visible in 52 of 71 patients (73%). Median survival was only 13 mo in these patients, whereas median survival was reached in patients without focal IMT uptake (P = 0.02). Furthermore, the intensity of IMT uptake significantly correlated with survival: patients with an IMT uptake ratio > 1.7 were at a 4.6 times higher risk of death than were patients with a lower IMT uptake (P < 0.001). The IMT uptake ratio remained a significant prognostic factor when age and grading were included in a multivariate model. In contrast, IMT uptake did not correlate with survival in group B (P = 0.95).In patients with unresectable high-grade gliomas, IMT uptake appears not to correlate with the biologic aggressiveness of tumor cells. Nevertheless, the clear association between focal IMT uptake after tumor resection and poor survival suggests that IMT is a specific marker for residual tumor tissue. Therefore, IMT SPECT is expected to become a valuable tool for the planning and monitoring of local therapeutic modalities.
