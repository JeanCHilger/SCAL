Age-related changes in muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the living brain: a PET study using N-[11C]methyl-4-piperidyl benzilate combined with cerebral blood flow measurement in conscious monkeys. The effects of changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with aging on muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding were evaluated with [15O]H(2)O and N-[11C]methyl-4-piperidyl benzilate (4-MPB) in the living brains of young (5.9+/-1.8 years old) and aged (19.0+/-3.3 years old) monkeys (Macaca mulatta) in the conscious state using high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET). For quantitative analysis of receptor binding in vivo with [11C]4-MPB, metabolite-corrected arterial plasma radioactivity curves were obtained as an input function into the brain, and graphical Patlak plot analysis was applied. In addition, two-compartment model analysis using the radioactivity curve in the cerebellum as an input function (reference analysis) was also applied to determine the distribution volume (DV=K(1)/k(2)') for [11C]4-MPB. With metabolite-corrected arterial input, Patlak plot analysis of [11C]4-MPB indicated a regionally specific decrease in muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding in vivo in the frontal and temporal cortices as well as the striatum in aged compared with young animals, showing no correlation with the degree of reduced rCBF. In contrast, on the reference analysis with cerebellar input of [11C]4-MPB, all regions assayed except the pons showed a significant age-related decrease of DV, and the degree of reduction of DV was correlated with that of rCBF. These results demonstrated the usefulness of kinetic analysis of [11C]4-MPB with metabolite-corrected arterial input, not with reference region's input, as an indicator of the aging process of cortical muscarinic cholinergic receptors in vivo measured by PET with less blood flow dependency.
