Influence of residual myocardial ischaemia on induced ventricular arrhythmias following a first acute myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to assess the possible effect of residual myocardial ischaemia on induced ventricular arrhythmia during programmed ventricular stimulation in survivors of a first acute myocardial infarction.Most deaths after hospital discharge for acute myocardial infarction are sudden and presumably arrhythmic. Sudden cardiac death results from a dynamic interaction of structural abnormalities and transient triggering factors. The role of myocardial ischaemia as a trigger for ventricular arrhythmias remains unclear. We hypothesized that residual myocardial ischaemia after a first acute myocardial infarction is a potent trigger for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias, particularly in the presence of an abnormal myocardium.In this prospective study, programmed electrical stimulation, coronary angiography and dipyridamole-thallium-201 scintigraphy single-photon emission computed tomography were performed in 90 consecutive survivors of a first acute myocardial infarction. Patients, divided in two groups - group 1 with induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia (n=24) and group 2 without induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia (n=66) - were compared regarding residual myocardial ischaemia. The two groups were comparable in terms of mean left ventricular ejection fraction, infarct size and location, gender ratio, peak creatine kinase value, and extent of coronary disease. Residual myocardial ischaemia was detected in 32 patients: 15 (42.5%) belonged to group 1 and 17 (25.7%) to group 2. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding the presence and the extent of residual myocardial ischaemia (P<0.05).Residual myocardial ischaemia, revealed by dipyridamole-thallium-201 scintigraphy following a first acute myocardial infarction, might contribute to electrical instability evaluated by programmed ventricular stimulation.
