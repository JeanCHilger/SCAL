Correlation between diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI and neurological deficit measured by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale and Barthel Index in hyperacute subcortical stroke (< or = 6 hours). We used combined diffusion-weighted (DWI) and perfusion-weighted (PWI) MRI to characterize hyperacute infarctions within 6 h of symptom onset with special reference to subcortical infarctions, and investigated the relation between perfusion-diffusion mismatch volume and functional outcome.Twenty-two patients presenting with symptoms of acute stroke underwent DWI and PWI within 6 h of symptom onset, and follow-up MRI 30 days later. Twelve of these had a subcortical infarction on acute DWI. Lesion volumes were measured by acute DWI and PWI as well as chronic T(2)-weighted MRI (T2WI). Clinical severity was measured by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) and the Barthel Index (BI).In the 12 patients with subcortical infarctions, PWI and especially DWI correlated strongly with acute and chronic neurological SSS score, as well as with final infarct volume. Furthermore, a hyperacute PWI/DWI mismatch in this subgroup predicted lesion growth. There was a weaker correlation between acute DWI/PWI and neurological score among all 22 patients, and patients with a PWI/DWI mismatch larger than 100 ml had a significantly larger lesion growth and a poorer outcome than patients with a smaller mismatch.Subcortical infarctions may represent a sizeable subgroup of acute stroke patients. Also subcortical infarctions may have a PWI/DWI mismatch and therefore may respond to neuroprotective/thrombolytic therapy. Hyperacute DWI may reflect the acute clinical status and predict the outcome in patients with subcortical infarction.
