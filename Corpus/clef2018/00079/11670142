Synthesis, Characterization, and Structure of Neutral and Anionic Complexes Containing Octahedral W(6)Te(8) Cluster Units. The first examples of molecular telluride complexes, W(6)Te(8)L(6) [L =pyridine (py), piperidine (pip), and PEt(3)], and the reduced salt [Na(py)(6)](+)[W(6)Te(8)(py)(6)](-) were discovered. The amine complexes were prepared by reaction of W(6)Cl(12) with Na(2)Te or a Na(2)Te/Na(2)Te(2) mixture in the amine solvents, whereas W(6)Te(8)(PEt(3))(6) was established by displacement of pyridine in W(6)Te(8)(py)(6) by PEt(3). The cluster unit, W(6)Te(8), showed characteristic T(1u) W-Te stretching vibrations around 180-200 cm(-)(1). From XPS the W4f(7/2) binding energy of 30.8 eV for W(6)Te(8)L(6) compared favorably with values of 30.5 and 30.8 eV for the sulfide and selenide analogues, respectively. Crystallographic data for the three compounds on which structure analyses were performed are as follows: W(6)Te(8)(pip)(6).6pip, hexagonal, R&thremacr, a = 17.738(6) Å, c = 24.318(10) Å, Z = 3
