Local recurrence of cancer of the rectum. [corrected] Although radiotherapy or total mesorectal excision decreases the risk of local recurrence of rectal cancer, this risk remains around 10%.Of 80 patients having a local recurrence, 38 (48%) underwent a re-resection combined in 10 cases with resection of mestastases.The incidence of asymptomatic detected recurrence was higher after anterior resection (39%) than after abdominoperineal resection (18%). Re-resection was performed more often (P <0.01) in the past 2 decades after anterior or Hartman first procedure than after abdominoperineal resection (67% versus 21%), and more often in asymptomatic patients than in symptomatic patients (71% versus 38%). The actuarial 5-year survival rate after re-resection was 20%.Early detection of local recurrence, with PET scan using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (8 cases in the present series), leads to an improved re-resection rate. In patients who did not undergo radiotherapy (all patients but 1) re-resection can be achieved safely (no postoperative mortality). The place for radiation in the treatment of rectal cancer has to be revaluated and compared with total mesorectal excision and results of re-resection for local recurrence.
