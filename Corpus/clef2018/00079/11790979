Carcinoid tumors: molecular genetics, tumor biology, and update of diagnosis and treatment. Carcinoid tumors are rare neoplasms which, by tradition, have been divided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut tumors. Although they share many features, they seem to have different molecular backgrounds. Foregut tumors very often show involvement of the MEN1 gene with deletions and mutations, whereas midgut carcinoids display genetic changes on chromosome 18. Hindgut tumors in general show rather low proliferation capacity, and transforming growth factor-alpha/epidermal growth factor receptor autocrine mechanism may play a role in the tumor development. Sometimes it might be a problem to delineate the location of the primary carcinoid tumor, but analyzing thyroid transcription factor-1 can be of help, because this factor is only expressed in foregut carcinoid and not in midgut or hindgut tumors. Chromogranin A is an important general tumor marker for all types of carcinoid tumors. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy is a cornerstone in staging and localization of carcinoid tumors, but newer techniques such as positron emission tomography will challenge its position in the future. Although surgical cure is not obtainable, a more aggressive surgery has emerged during the last decade. Debulking and other cytoreductive procedures are quite common today. Somatostatin analogues have been the treatment of choice in symptomatic patients with carcinoid tumors, but more recent studies have indicated a cytostatic effect of somatostatin analogues. Tumor-targeted radioactive treatment based on somatostatin analogues is now under clinical evaluation. Preliminary data indicate interesting clinical potentials.
