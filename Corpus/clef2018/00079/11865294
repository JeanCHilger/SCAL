Molecular epidemiology of Japanese isolates of Arthroderma benhamiae by polymorphisms of non-transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal DNA. We made a molecular epidemiological study of Arthroderma benhamiae, a teleomorphic species of the Trichophyton mentagrophytes complex, using polymorphisms of the non-transcribed spacer region (NTS) of ribosomal DNA. Thirteen isolates -Hyogo 2 isolates, Saitama 2 isolates, Shimane 2 isolates, Tokyo 1 isolate, Nagasaki 4 isolates- were isolated from dermatophytoses lesions on pet animals and/or their owners, while 2 Gifu isolates were cultured from lesions on the face and hand of a pet shop worker. Along with the thirteen isolates, four tester strains for a mating study from Belgium were extracted total DNA and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of NTS were detected by a hybridization technique. The thirteen isolates were divided into 6 DNA types but none of them showed the same profile as the strains from Belgium. The most prevalent DNA type was composed of 7 isolates, from Saitama (1 isolate), Shimane (2 isolates) and Nagasaki (4 isolates) in 1996-2001. These isolates were considered to be a clone and spread by the transportation of pet animals. Since the species was not found in an intensive mating study carried out in 1980, several different clones of A. benhamiae may have been transported into Japan after that time.
