Composite arterial Y graft has less coronary flow reserve than independent grafts. It is not known whether a composite Y graft of the left internal thoracic artery can provide sufficient blood flow to the whole left coronary system. The aim of this study was to compare regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve after coronary artery bypass grafting using arterial composite Y graft or independent arterial grafts.Positron emission tomography was performed at rest and after dipyridamole infusion using oxygen-15-labeled water 2 weeks after coronary artery bypass grafting. Regional MBF was calculated in seven segments of the left ventricle. Coronary flow reserve was defined as the ratio of MBF after dipyridamole infusion to MBF at rest. In the Y graft group (n = 22), a free arterial graft to obtuse marginal arteries was anastomosed to the proximal side of in situ left internal thoracic artery, which was anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery. In the independent graft group (n = 13), left anterior descending and obtuse marginal arteries were independently revascularized using in situ left internal thoracic artery and a free arterial graft.There was no difference between the groups in MBF at rest. Coronary flow reserve in the Y graft group was lower than that in the independent group in the anterobasal (1.43 +/- 0.07 versus 1.90 +/- 0.13, p = 0.038), apical (1.24 +/- 0.06 versus 1.64 +/- 0.12, p = 0.003), septal (1.34 +/- 0.05 versus 1.75 +/- 0.13, p = 0.023), and lateral regions (1.19 +/- 0.04 versus 1.66 +/- 0.09, p = 0.001).Although arterial composite Y graft improved MBF at rest, it was not as effective as independent grafts for improving coronary flow reserve soon after coronary artery bypass grafting.
