An investigation of helminth parasites in well-cared for dogs in Accra. A survey of a relative prevalence of helminth parasites in pet dogs has been conducted in the Accra metropolitan area. Carcass examination revealed a high incidence of Ancylostoma caninum (58%), Toxocara canis (40%), Dipylidium caninum (24%), Spirocerca lupi (18%) and a low 2% of Taenia pisiformis. Stool examination revealed hookworm ova in approximately 39% stools, ascarid ova in 4%, tapeworm in 1.3% and Spirocerca in 0.24 a low incidence of Strongloides (0.03) and trichurid ova (0.1%) were also encountered. It appears that anthelmintic treatment of dogs is relatively ineffective and indirect transmission of hook-worm and ascarids in children may occur in Accra.
