Breast cancer imaging with PET and SPECT agents: an in vivo comparison. Several radiopharmaceuticals and imaging techniques are proposed for breast cancer imaging. Since limited data are available of the uptake of SPECT and PET radiopharmaceuticals in malignant breast tumors and their metastases the aim of this study was to compare the uptake values and to correlate these data with imaging findings.We have studied the uptake of F-18 FDG, Tc-99m MIBI and Tc-99m (V)DMSA in 31 tumors using immunosuppressed rats implanted with HH-16 clone 4 mammary tumor cells. Tumor gamma camera and PET imaging was performed to gain biokinetic data and uptake values by ROI-analysis.Tumor uptake was highest for F-18 FDG > Tc-99m (V)DMSA > Tc-99m MIBI. The uptake ratios (tumor to muscle) correlated well with the ratios calculated by ROI-analysis determined by imaging.In this in-vivo model, F-18 FDG revealed the best uptake and imaging properties and may be the radiopharmaceutical of choice for routine breast cancer imaging.
