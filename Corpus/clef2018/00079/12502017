Dopaminergic effects after chronic treatment with nandrolone visualized in rat brain by positron emission tomography. Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) have recently been shown to induce neurochemical alterations in areas of the male rat CNS related to behavioural changes that have been observed among AAS misusers. In the present study, positron emission tomography (PET) is suggested as a suitable in vivo method in order to visualize the density of the dopamine transporter ([11C]-FE-beta-CIT) as well as the dopamine D1-like ([11C]-(+)-SCH23390) and the D2-like receptors ([11C]-raclopride) in the male rat brain. Chronic treatment with the AAS nandrolone decanoate (15 mg/kg/day for 14 days) caused an up-regulation of the binding potential of the dopamine transporter in the striatum.
