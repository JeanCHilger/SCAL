Appropriate uptake period for myocardial PET imaging with 18F-FDG after oral glucose loading. Identification of a rationale for the appropriate uptake period for myocardial (18)F-FDG-PET imaging of patients with and without diabetes mellitus.In a subset of 27 patients, static 2D-PET examination was performed of patients with chronic coronary artery disease and known myocardial infarction. The patients fasted (at least 4 h) before examination. (18)F-FDG (330 +/- 20 MBq) was injected intravenously. The image quality was semiquantitativly determined by ROI-analysis and the myocardium-to-blood pool activity ratio (M/B) was calculated. I.) Scans 30, 60, and 90 min p. i. of 10 non-diabetic patients (60 g oral glucose loading one hour before FDG-injection, low-dose intravenous insulin bolus if necessary). II.) Scans 30, 60, and 90 min p. i. of 10 patients with known non-insulin dependent diabetes (20 g glucose, insulin bolus). III.) Scans 90 min p. i. of 7 patients with known non-insulin dependent diabetes and elevated fasting serum glucose level (140-200 mg/dl insulin bolus, no glucose).I.) The M/B ratio significantly increases in nondiabetic patients with the uptake time (30 min 1.95 +/- 0.20 60 min 2.96 +/- 0.36In static myocardial viability PET studies with (18)F-FDG an uptake time of 90 min yields image quality superior to that obtained after shorter uptake time.
