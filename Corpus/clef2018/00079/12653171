Comparison of four allergen-sampling methods in conventional and allergy prevention classrooms. Several allergen-sampling methods are used to assess level of personal or indirect exposure to cat in homes, schools and other public buildings and working environments.To compare four different allergen-sampling methods (dust collectors, Petri dishes, person-carried pumps and intranasal samplers) by simultaneous sampling in classrooms and to compare the cat allergen levels between conventional classrooms and allergy prevention classrooms. Another aim was to relate the results to self-reported frequency of allergy and asthma symptoms among the children, to their perception of the school environment.Among all compulsory schools (n = 257) in the Stockholm suburban area, 35 classrooms (five with implemented allergy prevention measures, seven with additional cleaning and 23 with normal cleaning routines) were chosen for allergen-sampling. Dust collectors (two models), Petri dishes, person-carried pumps and intranasal samplers were used simultaneously. All children (n = 829) received a self-administered questionnaire which included questions about home and school environment, allergic disease, asthma symptoms and pet contact.The correlation between sampling methods was generally poor.Furthermore, there was no significant difference in allergen levels between allergy prevention and allergen avoidance classes compared to conventional classes. Median levels were generally, but not significantly, lower in classes with few cat owners, compared to classes with many cat owners. Children in allergy prevention classes were more satisfied with the indoor air quality and cleaning than children attending classes with fewer or no allergy prevention measures (P < 0.0001). Nine per cent of all children reported allergic symptoms while at school.The lack of correlation between sampling methods used simultaneously demonstrates the difficulty in assessing allergen levels in schools and similar environments. The implemented intervention measures (allergy prevention/allergen avoidance) did not influence cat allergen levels at school.
