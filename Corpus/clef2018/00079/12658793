Subacute thyroiditis as seen initially in ENT department--a report of 30 cases. To assess the pharyngeal presentations and the diagnostic value of thyroid SPECT and thyroid fine needle aspiratory biopsy (FNAB) in subacute thyroiditis (SAT) as seen initially in ENT department, 30 patients, during the course of SAT, were examined for pharyngeal symptoms and tested for serum T3, T4 level. The thyroid SPECT imaging or thyroid FNAB were performed. Our results showed that, of the 30 patients, 21 had sore throat of various degrees, and 9 had abnormal sensation of throat. Six were diagnosed as having SAT by only SPECT, in the remaining 24, the final diagnoses was established by SPECT combined with FNAB. Two of them were finally diagnosed as having SAT by trial treatment with oral prednisone. It is concluded that sore throat and abnormal sensation of pharynx are the important presentations of SAT, and thyroid SPECT imaging and thyroid FNAB are valuable in diagnosing SAT.
