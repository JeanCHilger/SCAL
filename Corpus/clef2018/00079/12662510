Non-Invasive Analysis of Awareness. A program is outlined which indicates in what manner awareness may be probed by the recently developed non-invasive instruments (PET, fMRI, MEG and EEG). The nature of the neural systems needed for the creation of awareness is reviewed, leading to a set of characteristics required for the crucial experiments able to uncover the processes involved. The assessment of experiments possible to probe the emergence of perception is then surveyed in terms of these criteria, and those which appear to be most effective are delineated. Brief conclusions are then drawn as to the viability of the program.
