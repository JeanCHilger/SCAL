PET instrumentation and reconstruction algorithms in whole-body applications. The aim of this work is the presentation and comparison of state-of-the-art dedicated PET systems actually available on the market, in terms of physical performance and technical features. Particular attention has been given to evaluate the whole-body performance by sensitivity, spatial resolution, dead time, noise equivalent counting rate (NECR), and scatter fraction. PET/CT systems were also included as new proposals to improve diagnostic accuracy of PET, allowing effective anatomic integration to functional data. An overview of actually implemented reconstruction algorithms is also reported to fully understand all of the factors that contribute to image quality.
