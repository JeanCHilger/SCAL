Combined 201Tl and 67Ga brain SPECT in patients with suspected central nervous system lymphoma or germinoma: clinical and economic value. Surgical resection is costly and an unfavorable prognostic factor for primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma and germinoma patients.To assess the diagnostic and economic impact of combined 201Tl and 67Ga brain SPECT on the management of patients suspected of having CNS lymphoma or germinoma.Sequential 201Tl and 67Ga brain SPECT was performed in 40 patients with cranial tumors to assess the diagnostic and economic impact of combined 201Tl and 67Ga SPECT on the management of patients suspected of having CNS lymphoma or germinoma. All intracranial masses were pathologically confirmed. The final diagnoses of a total of 47 foci were: 11 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in 10 patients, 3 germinomas in 2 patients, 10 glioblastomas in 9 patients, 10 cerebral metastases in 8 patients, 13 meningiomas in 11 patients. Decision-tree sensitivity analysis for pretest probability regarding expected cost saving was performed for introduction of the combined study.All but one focus of CNS lymphomas or germinomas (92.9%, 13/14) exhibited more intense uptake of 67Ga than of 201Tl (p < 0.001). All foci of glioblastomas (10/10) and meningiomas (13/13), and 60% of metastatic foci (6/10) exhibited higher uptake of 201Tl than of 67Ga (p < 0.035). Expected cost saving in the 1% to 50% range of pretest probability of CNS lymphoma or germinoma would be from minus dollars 842US to plus dollars 2,047US per patient for introduction of the combined study, because of substitution of stereotactic biopsy for craniotomy. The pretest probability was the key factor for cost saving of the combined study.A 67Ga-positive and 201Tl-positive pattern with more intense uptake of 67Ga than 201Tl probably suggests CNS lymphoma or germinoma. This combination study appears to be cost-effective only in patients highly suspected of having CNS lymphoma or germinoma.
