Correlation between left ventricular systolic function and dipyridamole thallium SPECT redistribution patterns in coronary artery disease. The dipyridamole thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and resting gated blood pool ventriculography were sequentially conducted in 31 consecutive patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease. The functional significance of various thallium redistribution patterns was assessed. The patients with an entirely complete (CR) or partial (PR) redistribution pattern had a higher global left ventricular ejection fraction than those with combined PR and no redistribution (NR), while patients with an entirely CR pattern did not have a statistically better ejection fraction than those with PR. Furthermore, myocardial segments with normal perfusion (N) and those with CR or PR had a higher regional ejection fraction than those with NR in the infero-apical area and the septal area. The regional ejection fraction was statistically higher in patients with CR than in those with PR in the septal area and higher, though not statistically significant, in the infero-apical area. The functional difference between groups with N and CR was not significant. Thus, we conclude that the redistribution patterns of dipyridamole thallium SPECT are closely correlated with systole function. Myocardium, in the presence of redistribution, will have a better functional performance in coronary artery disease.
