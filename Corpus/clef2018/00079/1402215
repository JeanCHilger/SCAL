Cerebral SPECT with 99mTc-HMPAO in extracranial carotid pathology: evaluation of changes in the ischemic area after carotid endarterectomy. The authors report their experience in studying patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy with simple photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). This technique made it possible to identify areas of preoperative cerebral hypoperfusion in 54.8% of the patients which had a good correlation with neurological symptoms. To distinguish gradual changes in the ischemic lesions, a method of assessing the surface of the hypoperfused areas was adopted. In addition, SPECT made it possible to detect a greater number of hypoperfused areas even in sites other than those revealed by CT. Moreover, there was good correlations between the SPECT data and the grade and site of the carotid lesion and the data provided by some intraoperative monitoring procedures. The Authors therefore propose the use of SPECT in the evaluation of patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency following a carotid disease.
