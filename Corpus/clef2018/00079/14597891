New frontiers in risk stratification using stress myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography. The purpose of this review is to review the recent published literature since 2002 for studies using stress myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography for determination of the prognostic value of testing.A series of manuscripts dealing with myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography have been published over the past 2 years that have altered a number of the most basic concepts defining risk stratification. These studies may have redefined the manner in which noninvasive stress imaging results will be interpreted and applied.Recent studies have expanded the understanding of how stress myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography is helpful in the identification of risk, enhanced the means of identifying risk, and improved its use as a means to identify optimal posttest treatment.
