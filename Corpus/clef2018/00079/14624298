Health effects associated with indoor storage of organic waste. The storing of organic waste indoors for several days can be considered a risk factor for microbial contamination of homes. This has become relevant in the scope of modern waste management programmes. This study specifically addresses possible health aspects in this context.In a cross-sectional study, doctors collected 384 questionnaires in three neighbourhoods without industrial sources for microbial contamination in 1997 in Hesse, Germany. Self-reported prevalence of airway, skin and general health complaints during the past year, lifetime diagnoses by a doctor, and home hygiene (storage of garbage, private composting, pet contact, indoor mould growth), were assessed. With logistic regression analysis, odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for age, gender, level of school education, and frequent contact with dog or cat were determined for indoor storage of waste for more than 2 days for the whole study group and also for a subgroup reporting atopic disposition.Longer indoor storage of organic waste was associated with "skin rash" (OR=2.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09, 3.83]), "itching skin rash (>2 months) in the past 12 months" (OR=3.58 [95% CI 1.61, 7.96]) and "itching skin rash (>2 months) ever" (OR=2.77 [95% CI 1.33, 5.75]), as well as lifetime diagnoses of skin disease by a doctor (OR=3.16 [95% CI 1.40, 7.10]) and allergy other than hay fever (OR=2.74 [95% CI 1.28, 5.85]). Associations remained when adjustment was made for atopic disposition. Atopic subjects were at higher risk for these skin-related complaints and diseases.These results point to a possible health relevance of the storing of organic waste in the home for several days, especially as far as skin irritation is concerned. These associations possibly result from indoor microbial contamination, e.g., endotoxins due to waste. Atopic disposition is a possible risk factor for this health impairment. Personal waste management should also be considered in studies on health and indoor environments.
