Heparin-induced extracorporeal LDL precipitation (H.E.L.P.). The H.E.L.P procedure (heparin-induced extracorporeal LDL precipitation) is a selective and sophisticated apheresis procedure. By means of heparin and lowering the pH level, lipoproteins and fibrinogen are reduced by 50-60%. In addition to lipoprotein (a) reduction (50- 60%) adhesion molecules (ICAM- 1, VCAM-1, P selectin), which play a major role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, are significantly lowered. Within 20 hours after LDL apheresis, positron emission tomography was able to verify an improvement of coronary vasodilation capacity. This is likely to result from a considerable reduction of LDL cholesterol and fibrinogen with a consecutive improvement of both endothelial function and rheology.
