Diffusion correction of sodium sieving applicable in a peritoneal equilibration test. Sodium sieving is a measure of free water transport. However its assessment is disturbed when a large difference exists between sodium concentrations in plasma and in dialysate--that is, when the diffusion rate is high. Based on previous findings concerning similarity in the mass transfer area coefficients (MTACs) of sodium and urate, we developed a model that corrects for high diffusion. The model enabled us to predict the dialysate sodium concentration resulting from diffusion alone at any time point during a dwell. The correction was based on knowledge of the intraperitoneal volume at any time point during the dwell, which can be calculated by using a volume marker (reference method). However, in a peritoneal equilibration test (PET), only the drained volume after 4 hours is available, and urate concentration is not routinely measured. Therefore, our objective in the present study was to investigate whether a diffusion correction using the MTAC of creatinine and the drained volume at the end of the dwell would be as accurate in estimating maximum sodium sieving as the reference method is. We analyzed standardized 4-hour dwells in 28 patients, 19 with stable PD and 9 with ultrafiltration failure. The dialysate consisted of a 3.86% glucose-containing solution to which dextran 70 was added as a volume marker. The correlation coefficient between the PET correction method and the reference method was 0.92 in all patients [0.90 in stable patients and 0.95 in the patients with ultrafiltration failure (p < 0.01 for all)]. We conclude that a diffusion correction for sodium can be made using PET data. A diffusion correction yields a better estimate of sodium sieving than does the sole use of the lowest dialysate-to-plasma (D/P) sodium irrespective of diffusion rate.
