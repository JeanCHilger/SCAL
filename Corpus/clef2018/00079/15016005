Predictors of seizure outcome after temporal lobectomy for intractable epilepsy. To assess predictors of outcome of temporal lobectomy for intractable epilepsy.In 63 adult patients operated with anterior temporal lobectomy during 198892, we used logistic regression analysis to assess predictors of being seizure-free (Engel's class I) 2 years after surgery. As potential predictors, we included the following variables: gender, age at operation, age at onset of seizures, epilepsy duration, etiology, generalized vs not generalized seizures, seizure frequency, intelligence quotient, ictal electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), side of resection, and extent of the resection.About 44% of the surgery patients were seizure-free (Engel's class I) 2 years after surgery. In multivariate analysis (n = 55), MRI pathology defined as atrophy in the temporal lobe, angioma, tumor or mesial temporal sclerosis (odds ratio, OR 7.4, 95%CI: 1.7-32.9) and extent of the hippocampal resection (increase of 1 cm) (OR 2.2, 95%CI: 1.1-4.6) predicted being seizure-free.Focal pathology in preoperative MRI and the extent of the hippocampal resection were the only significant predictors of being seizure-free after 2 years.
