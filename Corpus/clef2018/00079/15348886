Apatite-organic polymer composites prepared by a biomimetic process: improvement in adhesion of the apatite layer to the substrate by ultraviolet irradiation. A dense and uniform layer of highly bioactive apatite can be formed in arbitrary thickness on any kind and shape of organic polymer substrates by the following biomimetic process. The substrate is first placed in contact with granular particles of CaO, SiO2-based glass soaked in a simulated body fluid with ion concentrations nearly equal to those of human blood plasma for forming apatite nuclei, and then soaked in another fluid highly supersaturated with respect to the apatite for making the apatite nuclei grow. In the present study, the polymer substrates were pretreated with ultraviolet (UV) light, and then subjected to the biomimetic process described above. By UV irradiation, the induction period for the apatite nucleation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly-ether sulphone (PESF), polyethylene (PE), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polyamide 6 (N6) substrates were reduced form 24 h to 10 h. The adhesive strengths of the apatite layer to the substrates increased from 2.5-3.2 MPa to 4.5-6.0 MPa for PET, PESF and PMMA, and from about 1.0 MPa to 4.0-6.5 MPa for PE and N6 substrates. These results have been explained by assuming that silicate ions, which induce apatite nucleation, are easily adsorbed on the substrates due to the formation of polar groups, with an improved hydrophilic nature, on the polymer surfaces by UV irradiation.
