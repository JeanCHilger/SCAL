Cloning and sequence analysis of gene oipA encoding an outer membrane protein of human Helicobacter pylori. To construct a recombinant E. coli strain that would highly express the proinflammatory outer membrane protein of human Helicobacter pylori (H pylori).The oipA DNA was amplified by PCR, inserted into pET-32a, and transformed into Top10 E. coli strain. This recombinant plasmid of Top10 was sent out for nucleotide sequence analysis. Finally this sequence AF479754 was compared with HP0638 and JHP0581.The sequence of the aim gene was obtained. It had 924 base pairs. The identity was 95.32% against HP0638, 95.02% against JHP0581, which was higher than the identity between HP0638 and JHP0581.Although the aim gene was obtained, but it was different from the published sequence of GenBank. It is not clear what makes this difference. Maybe it is because different strain was used or because there were some variations. So more researches are required to prove it.
