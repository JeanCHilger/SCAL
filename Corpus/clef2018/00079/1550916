Border-area cerebral ischemia--3D-SPECT for the imaging of the regional cerebral blood flow. 15 patients with suspected cerebral ischaemia were examined using 99mTc-HM-PAO-SPECT to assess cerebral blood flow. Results obtained from SPECT were correlated with CT and Doppler ultrasound findings. A 3D-display algorithm is proposed to enhance the lesion to non-lesion contrast compared to the standard 2D-image interpretation. In all cases contrast was superior on 3D-display to 2D-display (-0.38 versus -0.09). 3D-display of SPECT-data enhances lesion contrast due to postreconstructive data processing and may improve exact interpretation of cerebral blood flow studies.
