CT evaluation of the response of gastrointestinal stromal tumors after imatinib mesylate treatment: a quantitative analysis correlated with FDG PET findings. We correlated changes in tumor density on CT with changes in glucose metabolism, or the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)), on FDG PET and sought to develop CT imaging criteria that can be used to objectively evaluate tumor response in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) who undergo treatment with imatinib mesylate.Using the criteria established by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) group, we selected 173 tumors (in 36 patients) for study. Tumor size and density were determined objectively, and overall tumor response (OTR) was evaluated subjectively on CT images. The changes in these parameters before and after treatment were correlated with changes in SUV(max).Significant decreases were seen in both tumor density (mean, 12.3 H [16.5%] p < 0.0001) and SUV(max) (mean, 3.43 [64.9%]FDG PET is sensitive and specific for evaluating tumor response but cannot be used in patients whose baseline FDG PET results are negative for tumors. Although subjective evaluation was a better indicator of treatment response than was tumor density alone, the tumor density measurement is a good indicator and provides a reliable quantitative means of monitoring the tumor. RECIST, using only tumor size, was unreliable for monitoring GISTs during the early stage of imatinib mesylate treatment.
