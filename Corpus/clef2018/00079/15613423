Quantitative assessment of glucose transport in human skeletal muscle: dynamic positron emission tomography imaging of [O-methyl-11C]3-O-methyl-D-glucose. Insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle is regarded as a key determinant of insulin sensitivity, yet isolation of this step for quantification in human studies is a methodological challenge. One notable approach is physiological modeling of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using 2-[18-fluoro]2-deoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) however, this has a potential limitation in that deoxyglucose undergoes phosphorylation subsequent to transport, complicating separate estimations of these steps. In the current study we explored the use of dynamic PET imaging of [(11)C]3-O-methylglucose ([(11)C]3-OMG), a glucose analog that is limited to bidirectional glucose transport. Seventeen lean healthy volunteers with normal insulin sensitivity participated
