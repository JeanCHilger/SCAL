Magnetic resonance imaging of myocardial infarction using gadolinium-based contrast agent. To evaluate myocardial infarcts using a segmented inversion-recovery prepared gradient echo sequence on a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner after injection of a gadolinium-based contrast agent.Fourteen patients were prospectively offered a cardiac MR exam between November 2003 and February 2004. Six patients had a history of anterior wall MI, six had a history of inferior wall MI and two patients had MI of undetermined location.Delayed enhancement indicating the presence of scarring was visualized in all fourteen patients. The scarring was transmural in ten patients and non-transmural in four patients.Delayed enhancement of infarcted areas in the myocardium after injection of gadolinium-based contrast agent represents scarring and adequate resolution exists to distinguish transmural from non-transmural scarring. This technique is useful in determining viability of infarcted myocardium, may detect infarcts missed by SPECT and may help in the selection of patients for implantation of defibrillators.
