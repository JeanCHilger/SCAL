Evaluation of liver metastases after radiofrequency ablation: utility of 18F-FDG PET and PET/CT. Our objective was to review the CT appearance of liver metastases after radiofrequency ablation and to describe the imaging findings of and utility of (18)F-FDG PET and PET/CT in assessing tumor recurrence after ablation.(18)F-FDG PET and PET/CT can provide added diagnostic information compared with conventional imaging in patients after radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases and can be useful in guiding repeat ablation procedures.
