Correlation between striatal dopamine D2 receptor density and neuroticism in community volunteers. The central dopaminergic system, as well as the central serotonergic system, has been reported to be correlated with higher neuroticism. The present study examined the relationship between striatal dopamine D(2) receptor density and neuroticism. Neuroticism was assessed with the Maudsley Personality Inventory, and psychiatric morbidity was evaluated with both the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Single photon emission computed tomography with [(123)I]iodo-benzamide was used to measure striatal dopamine D(2) receptor density. HAM-D scores and psychiatric morbidity in high-neuroticism individuals were higher than in low-neuroticism individuals. Moreover, striatal dopamine D(2) receptor densities were significantly correlated with the neuroticism score of the 41 subjects. The central dopaminergic system may play an important role in the neurobiological characteristics of neuroticism.
