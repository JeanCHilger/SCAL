(18)F-FDG PET/CT in the evaluation of recurrent ovarian cancer: a prospective study on forty-one patients. Many patients with ovarian cancer are at high risk of recurrence especially in the 2 years following first-line therapy. CA125 serum levels measurement associated to computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are currently used during follow-up to detect recurrent disease. Unfortunately, in a relevant percentage of cases all of these traditional imaging techniques provide a significant number of doubtful/equivocal results or turn out negative even in presence of elevated Ca125 levels. Aim of our study was to evaluate sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in a group of patients with suspicion of ovarian cancer recurrence.We prospectively evaluated 41 patients with a mean age of 59.4 years who had been previously treated for ovarian cancer with surgery and radio-chemotherapy or radio-chemotherapy alone. Following the performance of traditional radiologic imaging (US, CT, MRI) and Ca125 measurement, all patients underwent additional (18)F-FDG PET/CT. PET/CT results were compared with histologic findings or clinical, laboratory and repeated traditional imaging techniques during subsequent follow-up data.Of 41 patients 32 had a positive PET-CT (30 true positive, two false positive) whereas nine a negative PET/CT (five true negative, four false negative). Overall, in our experience (18)F-FDG PET/CT provided a good sensitivity (88.2%), specificity (71.4%) and accuracy (85.4%), superior to that reported in literature for traditional radiologic imaging.It can be concluded that (18)F-FDG PET/CT appears to be a useful and accurate tool in disclosing early recurrent ovarian cancer.
