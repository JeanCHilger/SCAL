Positron emission tomography imaging for lymphoma. To review the current role and the limitations of F-fluorodeoxygenase positron emission tomography in the management of lymphoma, with a particular focus on studies published since January 2004.F-fluorodeoxygenase positron emission tomography should be routinely performed at the initial diagnosis of patients with suffering from Hodgkin's disease because it adds useful informations to conventional staging techniques. Residual F-fluorodeoxygenase uptake is an important prognostic factor after one or a few cycles of chemotherapy, but it is clearly too early to change patient treatment on the basis of F-fluorodeoxygenase positron emission tomography results. F-fluorodeoxygenase positron emission tomography is the best noninvasive imaging technique after treatment however, it is always indicated to correlate positron emission tomography findings with clinical data, other imaging modalities, a biopsy, or all three to reduce the risk of false positive results. There are some concerns about the positive predictive value of positron emission tomography after treatment, especially in childhood lymphoma. Clinicians should be aware of positron emission tomography findings in specific clinical conditions in this patient population. F-fluorodeoxygenase positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography offers advantages over the two used separately and read side by side. It may be particularly useful for the planning of radiation therapy or for the planning of a surgical biopsy. Several studies have shown that F-fluorodeoxygenase positron emission tomography is definitively superior to Ga scintigraphy. New radiotracers such as F-fluorothymidine may be useful for the noninvasive assessment of proliferation in vivo.F-fluorodeoxygenase positron emission tomography has become the most important nuclear medicine imaging modality in the field of lymphoma. It should be routinely used in the treatment of lymphoma patients.
