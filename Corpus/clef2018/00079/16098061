Continuing challenges in childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in children includes a number of different pathological subtypes and, with improved diagnostic techniques and better understanding of the natural history of each type, treatment strategies have become more tumour-specific. Original staging systems are now less useful in determining treatment stratification and there is a need for careful analysis of large cohorts of patients, treated in the same manner, to determine the clinical and biological features that, with current therapies, are of prognostic value. Novel imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography, and molecular techniques to detect low-level marrow involvement are likely to be incorporated into new risk grouping. These will be used to determine the extent of initial disease and evaluate more accurately the speed and quality of response to chemotherapy. With high cure rates, it becomes particularly important to minimize late effects of therapy and the introduction of monoclonal antibodies in combination with chemotherapy may provide a method for improving outcome in poor risk groups and reducing sequelae by allowing reduction in chemotherapy in good risk patients.
