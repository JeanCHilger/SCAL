In vivo comparison of the inflammatory response induced by different vascular biomaterials. Biomaterial implants induce a local inflammatory response. A comparison of the inflammatory cell response was made between several biomaterials commonly used as vascular prostheses. Disks of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), aluminum, titanium, copper, and stainless steel were surgically placed into the peritoneum of mice. Recruited macrophage and neutrophil populations were measured after recovery from the disk surface and peritoneal lavage. Following peritoneal biomaterial implants, there was no difference in total neutrophil or macrophage recruitment between mice implanted with PET, PTFE, aluminum, or titanium disks. However, there was significant attenuation of total neutrophil and macrophage recruitment to stainless steel compared with the other implants. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the percentage of leukocytes adherent to the PET, aluminum, or titanium disks. Macrophage adherence to the stainless steel disks was attenuated by 19.1%, and the number of neutrophils was attenuated by 69.1% when compared with PET implant mice. Mice implanted with copper disks universally expired. Leukocyte recruitment did not differ between PET, PTFE, aluminum, or titanium disks, suggesting that these materials stimulate similar inflammatory responses. Stainless steel disks recruited both fewer neutrophils and fewer macrophages and support lower adherence of these cells than the other biomaterials. Copper incited an overwhelming and fatal response.
