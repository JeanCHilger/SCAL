Placebo or trimetazidine (99m)Tc tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT and low-dose dobutamine echocardiography in hibernating myocardium. Trimetazidine (TMZ) improves (99m)Tc sestamibi uptake in myocardial single photon emission tomography (SPECT). This study compared TMZ (99m)Tc tetrofosmin SPECT and low-dose dobutamine echocardiography (LDDE) as predictors of functional recovery of hibernating myocardium after coronary revascularization.Thirty-one patients with prior myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction underwent coronary angiography, LDDE, placebo SPECT and TMZ SPECT. Echocardiographic follow-up was obtained at 2/6 months the clinical follow-up lasted 2 years.Twenty-three (74.2%) patients (195 dysfunctioning left ventricular segments) were revascularized. TMZ improved (99m)Tc tetrofosmin uptake (p = 0.0001) as well as LVEF at gated SPECT (p = 0.04). At 2-months, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated (LDDE 71.9, 78.7, 71, 79.5 placebo SPECT 66.2, 75.6, 65.4, 76.3The addition of TMZ to (99m)Tc tetrofosmin SPECT improved diagnostic accuracy. The importance of hibernating myocardium revascularization was confirmed.
