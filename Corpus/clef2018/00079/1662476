Parametric in vivo imaging of benzodiazepine receptor distribution in human brain. Emission computed tomographic methods for the in vivo quantification of radioligand-binding sites in human brain have previously been limited either by a lack of correction for possible effects of altered ligand transport or by highly complicated physiological models that preclude display of binding data in a detailed anatomical format. We investigated the application of a simplified compartmental model to the kinetic analysis of in vivo ligand binding to central benzodiazepine receptors. The human brain distribution of [11C]flumazenil, as determined by dynamic positron emission tomography, combined with metabolite-corrected arterial blood samples, permitted estimations of local cerebral ligand transport and of receptor binding. This approach allows calculation of transport and binding "maps" on a pixel-by-pixel basis, resulting in the display of binding data in a familiar tomographic format while maintaining much of the physiological accuracy inherent in more complex methods. The results obtained in a study of 6 normal volunteers revealed good interindividual precision, with coefficients of variation between 10 and 15% of mean regional values, suggesting the utility of this approach in future clinical studies of benzodiazepine receptor binding.
