Alteration of regional cerebral blood flow to thyrotropin-releasing hormone therapy in acute encephalitis and encephalopathy during childhood. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is now used as a therapeutic agent for various neurological disorders. Animal study has shown that TRH was attributable to increased cerebral blood flow (CBF).There have been occasional reports that TRH therapy was effective for improving symptoms of persistent disturbance of consciousness after acute encephalitis or encephalopathy during childhood. To determine whether TRH has an effect on increasing CBF to patients who have consciousness disturbance caused by acute encephalitis or encephalopathy, and to determine the optimal method of administration.Sixteen patients aged 0.7-10.9 years (mean age, 3.2+/-3.1 years) who presented with persistent disturbance of consciousness resulting from acute encephalitis or encephalopathy and were treated with TRH. Regional CBF (rCBF) was measured by single photon emission computed tomography before and after TRH therapy. The alteration rates of rCBF were compared between the divided two groups concerning the dose levels, dosing periods, and treatment lags.The alteration rates of rCBF of the high dose group were higher than those of the low dose group. Differences in the dosing periods and treatment lags did not cause any significant difference of the alteration rates of rCBF.The study showed that higher alteration rates of the CBF were observed in the higher dosing group, and TRH have the potency of increasing CBF. TRH therapy would have the potential for effective treatment of persistent consciousness disturbance caused by childhood acute encephalitis or encephalopathy.
