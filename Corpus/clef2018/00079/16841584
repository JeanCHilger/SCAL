Cardiovascular nuclear medicine 1976/'06: 30 years representation in clinical cardiology. Over the past 30 years, cardiovascular nuclear medicine has become an important diagnostic tool in patients with known and suspected coronary artery disease. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy is indicated in: patients with suspected coronary artery disease and an intermediate likelihood of disease to detect myocardial ischemia, patients with a sustained myocardial infarction to assess myocardial viability, patients following revascularization for risk stratification, and coronary patients to assess prognosis. Gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging offers the potential of assessing left ventricular function and myocardial perfusion simultaneously. Information on left ventricular function and volumes significantly improves the diagnostic accuracy of myocardial perfusion imaging. The gated SPECT technique is a valuable tool for risk stratification because it offers the potential of assessing left ventricular function and volumes, which are both important prognostic parameters.
