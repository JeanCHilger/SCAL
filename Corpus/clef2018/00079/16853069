Crystallization of silver chloride in crazed porous polymers. During this study the formation and growth of silver chloride crystals in crazed porous polymeric matrixes of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and polypropylene (PP) were under investigation. The rate of formation and dispersity and the way AgCl particles aggregate in porous polymers were shown to be dependent on the effective volume porosity, pore dimension, and physical state of the polymer. Methods of the determination of diffusion and distribution constants for low-molecular substances in porous polymers were suggested, and a mechanism of silver chloride crystallization in porous medium was proposed.
