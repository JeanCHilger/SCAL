Ultrafast electron transfer in a nanocavity. dimethylaniline to coumarin dyes in hydroxypropyl gamma-cyclodextrin. Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from N,N-dimethylaniline (DMA) to four coumarin dyes (C151, C481, C153, and C480) inside the cavity of hydroxypropyl gamma-cyclodextrin (hpCD) is studied using femtosecond upconversion. The rate of PET is found to be nonexponential and to vary significantly with the coumarin dyes. The rate for C481 is 100 times faster than that for C480. The PET rate displays a bell-shaped dependence on the free energy change and thus reveals a Marcus-type inverted region. The anisotropy decay of the four dyes in hpCD are found to be very similar, and hence the observed variation in the rate of PET is not due to variation in rotational diffusion of the acceptors (coumarin dyes).
