Myocardial positive pre-ejection velocity accurately detects presence of viable myocardium, predicts recovery of left ventricular function and bears a prognostic value after surgical revascularization. To assess the accuracy of tissue Doppler imaging-derived myocardial positive pre-ejection velocity (+Vic) in detecting myocardial viability defined by dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE), fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and in predicting recovery of left ventricular (LV) function after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with chronic ischaemic LV dysfunction.+Vic in dysfunctional segments was recorded in 54 patients treated medically and 65 patients undergoing CABG [age 67 +/- 9 year LV ejection fraction (EF) 30 +/- 6%]. A good agreement was observed between +Vic and detection of viable myocardium at DSE, PET, and MRI (kappa = 0.76). The presence of +Vic in greater than or equal to five dysfunctional segments had the highest sensitivity (93%) and specificity (60%) to identify patients (n = 28) with > or =10% increase in LV EF between baseline and 6-month echocardiogram. During follow-up (median 333 days, interquartile range 209-490 days), 13 cardiac events (6 deaths, 7 hospitalizations) occurred in 24 patients with small extent of viable myocardium (< 5 + Vic), whereas only four hospitalizations in 39 patients with > or =5 + Vic (54% vs. 10%The extent of +Vic in dysfunctional segments accurately predicts extent of viable myocardium and bears a clinical prognostic value in patients with ischaemic LV dysfunction considered for CABG.
