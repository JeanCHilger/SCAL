Highlights of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine Congress, Athens, Greece, 30 September to 4 October 2006. The 2006 EANM Congress, held in Athens, Greece, was once again a major event in the nuclear medicine scientific and educational calendar. The scientific programme, which included the second biennial ISRTRD meeting, confirmed the major developments taking place in (1) the diagnostic and prognostic uses of nuclear medicine imaging (both in PET and in single-photon studies), (2) radionuclide therapies, (3) radiochemistry and radiopharmacy, and (4) physics. This paper outlines the major findings in each of these areas.
