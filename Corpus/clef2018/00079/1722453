Maternal levels of alpha-fetoprotein in African women. In a prospective and cross-sectional study, 147 serum samples from normal antenatal indigenous Kenyan women were analysed for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentrations between 8 and 28 weeks gestation. There was progressive rise in AFP levels with gestation, most rapid between 12 and 24 weeks. There were wide variations in AFP concentrations at every gestation but no correlation was established with maternal age or parity. All the eleven women with very high AFP values had subsequent complications, including 2 abortions, 1 APH, 7 PET and one pair of twins. The need for more studies on the value of AFP in monitoring of pregnancy in the African set up is emphasised.
