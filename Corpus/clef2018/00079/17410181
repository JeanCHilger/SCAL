SPECT/CT imaging of baculovirus biodistribution in rat. Non-invasive imaging provides essential information regarding the biodistribution of gene therapy vectors and it can also be used for the development of targeted vectors. In this study, we have utilized micro Single-photon emission computed tomography to visualize biodistribution of a (99m)Tc-polylys-ser-DTPA-biotin-labelled avidin-displaying baculovirus, Baavi, after intrafemoral (i.f.), intraperitoneal (i.p.), intramuscular (i.m.) and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration. The imaging results suggest that the virus can spread via the lymphatic network after different administration routes, also showing accumulation in the nasal area after systemic administration. Extensive expression in the kidneys and spleen was seen after i.p. administration, which was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Additionally, transduction of kidneys was seen with i.m. and i.f. administrations. We conclude that baculovirus may be beneficial for the treatment of kidney diseases after i.p. administration route.
