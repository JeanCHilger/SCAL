Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with DSM for primary hepatic malignant carcinoid. A 66-year-old male with multiple liver tumors was diagnosed as having malignant carcinoid. The case exhibited carcinoid syndrome with wheezing and high urine 5-Hydroxy-Indole Acetic Acid and serum serotonin concentrations. A search for the primary lesion failed to detect tumors except those in the liver, leading to the diagnosis of primary hepatic carcinoid. Repeated transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with degradable starch microspheres decreased the tumors in size and improved the subjective symptoms. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with degradable starch microspheres is a useful treatment for unresectable malignant carcinoid of liver origin.
