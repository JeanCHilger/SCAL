Recent developments in neurology. This review aims to highlight the significant developments in neuroscience and clinical neurology that have been recorded in the past few years.Original research and reviews were identified by searching PubMed for articles published from January 1995 using the following search terms: recent, developments, advances, progress, neurology, and neuroscience.Notable strides have been made in the management of neurological conditions like stroke and epilepsy. There is also greater understanding of the pathogenesis of the neurodegenerative diseases, and some form of treatment is now available for previously 'untreatable' conditions like motor neuron disease and Alzheimer's disease. The application of the techniques of molecular genetics and molecular cell biology has advanced the understanding and diagnosis of several neurological disorders, such as Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy. Clinical neurology has also profited from the huge advances in structural and functional brain imaging that have taken place in recent years. Areas of current research include the potential use of stem cells to treat a wide variety of neurological disorders, and the use of nerve growth factors to promote regeneration of neurons in the central nervous system.Current advances in neurology and neuroscience hold the promise of new approaches to the understanding and management of neurological diseases.
