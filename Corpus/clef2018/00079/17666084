Migraine aura lasting 1-24 h in children: a sequence of EEG slow-wave abnormalities vs. vascular events. The aim of this study was to describe the abnormalities associated with migraine aura lasting 1-24 h in children as shown by EEG, trancranial Doppler (TCD) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In this retrospective study, 11 patients each underwent EEG, TCD and brain SPECT on the day of admission and the day thereafter. On the day of admission, the migrainous hemisphere of all patients showed that the mean velocities were decreased in the middle cerebral artery by TCD, slow-wave abnormalities were recorded after several hours of aura by EEG and the SPECT showed hypoperfusion. On the day after, in the same hemisphere, slow waves were recorded only in the occipital area by EEG, and SPECT showed slight hyperperfusion. In these patients, there was a clear sequence of EEG, TCD and SPECT abnormalities.
