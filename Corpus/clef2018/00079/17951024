PET and digestive cancers. In digestive oncology, the most frequent indication for FDG PET, in our experience and as reported in the literature, is the localisation of recurrent colorectal cancer. This molecular imaging method has also been shown to be clinically useful in various other settings, especially for preoperative staging, for colorectal, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, hepatic and biliary cancers. We also report on current PET practice in two particular cancers: hepatocellular carcinoma, for which other tracers, including fluoromethylcholine-(18F), are being currently evaluated, and gastrointestinal endocrine tumours, which are included in the recent French marketing authorisation of fluoroDOPA-(18F) and which are also potential targets for radiolabelled somatostatin analogues for PET imaging.
