3-D SPECT simulations of a complex 3-D mathematical brain model: effects of 3-D geometric detector response, attenuation, scatter, and statistical noise. The quantitative imaging characteristics of ultrahigh-resolution parallel-hole SPECT, including 3-D geometric detector response, attenuation, scatter, and statistical noise, were investigated by simulations based on a complex digitized 3-D brain model of the gray and white matter distributions. The projection data resulting from a uniform distribution of gray and white matter radioactivity, in a ratio of 5:1, were simulated. The results demonstrate significant qualitative and quantitative artifacts in reconstructed human brain images. In the absence of attenuation, scatter, and noise, artifactual variation caused inaccuracies in regional radioactivity quantification. Inclusion of attenuation scatter, and noise in the simulation caused additional artifacts, and resulted in reconstructed images which qualitatively and quantitatively corresponded very closely to reconstructed images of the actual 3-D brain phantom which was constructed from the same set of data as the mathematical 3-D brain model. It is concluded that the major degrading factor in SPECT neuroimaging is the 3-D geometric detector response function.
