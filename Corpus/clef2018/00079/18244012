Stationary positron emission tomography and its image reconstruction. Feasibility of stationary positron emission tomography (PET) using discrete detectors has been investigated by simulation studies. To enable full utilization of detector resolution, a "bank array" of detectors is proposed and an EM algorithm is adopted for image reconstruction. The bank array consists of an odd number of detector banks arranged on a circular ring with a gap equal to one half the detector width. The EM algorithm [11] is used with some modifications for reducing the quantity of computation, improving the convergence speed, and suppressing statistical noise, so as to meet the present purpose. Simulation studies involving several phantoms show that the stationary PET with the new detector array provides image quality which is good enough for clinical applications. For fast dynamic studies with low spatial resolution, the convolution-backprojection method is efficient, but for high-resolution static imaging, resolution enhancement by an iterative method is required. Problems arising in the corrections for attenuation of photons and detector sensitivity, etc., are also discussed. A totally stationary PET avoids the mechanical problems associated with accurate movement of heavy assemblies and is particularly advantageous in gated cardiac imaging or in fast dynamic studies. Elimination of a scan along the detector plane allows a quick scan in the axial direction to achieve three-dimensional imaging with a small number of detector rings.
