Diagnostic impact of 18F-FDG PET-CT evaluating solid pancreatic lesions versus endosonography, endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography with intraductal ultrasonography and abdominal ultrasound. This prospective single-centre phase II trial assessed the diagnostic impact of (18)F-FDG PET-CT in the evaluation of solid pancreatic lesions (phi >or= 10 mm) compared to endosonography (EUS), endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) with intraductal ultrasound (IDUS), abdominal ultrasound (US) and histopathological reference.Forty-six patients (32 men/14 women, phi 61.7 years) with suspected pancreatic neoplasms underwent PET-CT with contrast-enhanced biphasic multi-detector CT of the upper abdomen followed by a diagnostic work-up with EUS, ERCP with IDUS and US within 3 weeks. PET-CT data sets were analysed by two expert readers in a consensus reading. Histology from surgery, biopsy/fine-needle aspiration and/or clinical follow-up >or=12 months served as standard of reference.Twenty-seven pancreatic malignancies were histopathologically proven 19 patients had benign diseases: 36/46 lesions (78%) were detected in the head of the pancreas, 7/46 and 3/46 in the body and tail region, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of PET-CT were 89% and 74%, respectively(18)F-FDG PET-CT achieves a comparably high diagnostic impact evaluating small solid pancreatic lesions versus conventional reference imaging modalities. Additional clinical diagnoses are derived from concomitant whole-body PET-CT imaging.
