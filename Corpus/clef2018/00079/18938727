Pulmonary thromboembolism. Therapy recommendations of the practice guidelines of the Mexican Society of Cardiology. Prevalence and incidence of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) is very high, and in many cases, remains undiagnosed. In developed countries, it's the third cause of cardiovascular mortality, a fact that is also observed in developing countries. Within the clinical spectrum, PTE is regarded as minor and massive, in between a sub-massive PET, which is characterized by normal arterial pressure, or even hypotension, with compensated systemic perfusion and right ventricle dysfunction (RVD), with presence or not or positive biomarkers. When there is no evidence of severe pulmonary hypertension, or RVD, anticoagulation therapy stands as the pharmacological approach. When RVD is observed, pulmonary reperfusion is advised. According to the guidelines and recommendations for stratification, diagnose, and treatment of PTE, from the Pulmonary Circulation Chapter of the Mexican Society of Cardiology, evidence is established between physiopathology and the degree of vascular pulmonary obstruction.
