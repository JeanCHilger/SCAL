Episodic memory loss is related to hippocampal-mediated beta-amyloid deposition in elderly subjects. Although beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques are a primary diagnostic criterion for Alzheimer's disease, this pathology is commonly observed in the brains of non-demented older individuals. To explore the importance of this pathology in the absence of dementia, we compared levels of amyloid deposition (via 'Pittsburgh Compound-B' (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging) to hippocampus volume (HV) and episodic memory (EM) in three groups: (i) normal controls (NC) from the Berkeley Aging Cohort (BAC NC, n = 20) (ii) normal controls (NC) from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI NC, n = 17)
