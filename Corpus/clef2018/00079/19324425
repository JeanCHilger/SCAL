Gold laser adenoidectomy: long-term safety and efficacy results. To report the long-term results of Gold laser adenoidectomy with pressure equalization tube (PET) placement by measuring the incidence of otorrhea and middle ear effusion after tube extrusion.A prospective study of 50 patients, ages 8-48 months, that underwent Gold laser adenoidectomy with PE tube placement in a pediatric outpatient setting.We previously reported the initial results at 4 months post-op of 50 patients treated for adenoid hypertrophy and chronic otitis media with effusion (COME). All patients were then evaluated at 8, 12, and 16 months post-operatively. The incidence of otorrhea, extrusion of the PE tubes, and middle ear status was recorded.The incidence of otorrhea was 3/50 (6%) at 8 months, 0 (0%) at 12 months, and 2 (4%) at 16 months. At 16 months, the PE tubes had extruded in 29 (58%) and 28/29 (97%) of these had clear middle ears. Forty-nine patients (98%) overall had clear middle ears at the last exam. One patient required a second set of tubes.The long-term results of Gold laser adenoidectomy with PE tube placement for adenoid hypertrophy and COME compare favorably with the initial report of the technique, as well as with other techniques as reported in other studies.
