A novel method for fast imaging of brain function, non-invasively, with light. Imaging of the human body by any non-invasive technique has been an appropriate goal of physics and medicine, and great success has been obtained with both Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in brain imaging. Non-imaging responses to functional activation using near infrared spectroscopy of brain (fNIR) obtained in 1993 (Chance, et al. [1]) and in 1994 (Tamura, et al. [2]) are now complemented with images of pre-frontal and parietal stimulation in adults and pre-term neonates in this communication (see also [3]). Prior studies used continuous [4], pulsed [3] or modulated [5] light. The amplitude and phase cancellation of optical patterns as demonstrated for single source detector pairs affords remarkable sensitivity of small object detection in model systems [6]. The methods have now been elaborated with multiple source detector combinations (nine sources, four detectors). Using simple back projection algorithms it is now possible to image sensorimotor and cognitive activation of adult and pre- and full-term neonate human brain function in times < 30 sec and with two dimensional resolutions of < 1 cm in two dimensional displays. The method can be used in evaluation of adult and neonatal cerebral dysfunction in a simple, portable and affordable method that does not require immobilization, as contrasted to MRI and PET.
