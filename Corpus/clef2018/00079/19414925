Magnetic resonance lymphography: a novel technique for lymph node assessment in gynecologic malignancies. Lymph node status determines both prognosis and treatment choice in gynecological malignancies. Both CT and MRI are standard techniques used to detect lymph node involvement but these techniques have low sensitivity and specificity. Magnetic resonance lymphography (MRL) using iron oxide nanoparticles is a new technique for lymph node assessment which has shown much promise. This article discusses the applications of MRL in the setting of gynecological malignancy.
