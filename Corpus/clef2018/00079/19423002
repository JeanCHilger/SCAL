In vivo examination of (188)Re(I)-tricarbonyl-labeled trastuzumab to target HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein, acts as an immunotherapeutic agent for HER2-overexpressing human breast cancers. Radiolabeled trastuzumab with beta- or alpha emitters can be used as radioimmunotherapeutic agent for the similar purpose but with additional radiation effect.In this study, trastuzumab was labeled with (188)Re for radioimmunotherapy of HER2/neu-positive breast cancer. (188)Re(I)-tricarbonyl ion, [(188)Re(OH(2))(3)(CO)(3)](+), was employed as a precursor for directly labeling the monoclonal antibody with (188)Re. The immunoreactivity of (188)Re(I)-trastuzumab was estimated by competition receptor-binding assay using HER2/neu-overexpressive BT-474 human breast cancer cells. The localization properties of (188)Re(I)-trastuzumab within both tumor and normal tissues of athymic mice bearing BT-474 human breast cancer xenografts (HER2/neu-overexpressive) and similar mice bearing MCF-7 human breast cancer xenografts (HER2/neu-low expressive) were investigated.When incubated with human serum albumin and histidine at 25 degrees C, (188)Re(I)-trastuzumab was found to be stable within 24 h. The IC(50) of (188)Re(I)-trastuzumab was found to be 22.63+/-4.57 nM. (188)Re(I)-trastuzumab was shown to accumulate specifically in BT-474 tumor tissue in in vivo biodistribution studies. By microSPECT/CT, the image of (188)Re localized BT-474 tumor was clearly visualized within 24 h. In contrast, (188)Re(I)-trastuzumab uptake in HER2-low-expressing MCF-7 tumor was minimal, and the (188)Re image at the localization of the tumor was dim.These results reveal that (188)Re(I)-trastuzumab could be an appropriate radioimmunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of HER2/neu-overexpressing cancers.
