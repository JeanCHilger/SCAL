Current state of PET in head and neck tumours: impact on the planning of radiotherapy treatment. The use of positron emission tomography (PET) in head and neck tumours is increasingly widespread. To its clinical indications--especially in the staging of patients but also in evaluating response to treatment and in detecting or confirming relapses--is now added its possible therapeutic impact through its contribution to the planning of radiotherapy treatment. The integration of PET images in the radiotherapy process seems promising, although important doubts remain about it, which means that it is still under research. This article reviews the current state of PET in the area of head and neck tumours, as well as its impact on radiotherapy treatment planning.
