Radiation exposure for medical staff performing quantitative coronary perfusion PET with 13N-ammonia. To evaluate radiation doses to medical staff performing quantitative (13)N-ammonia myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography (PET).Seventeen PET examinations were performed. Nine examinations consisted of two PET scans (one during rest and one after pharmacological stress with dipyridamole) and eight examinations consisted of three PET scans (additionally a scan after cold pressor testing). The two nuclear technologists and the physician attending the examinations were equipped with an electronic dosemeter over the chest and thermoluminescent dosimetry chips on the right index finger and wrist.The highest mean equivalent dose per examination for a staff member was 453 microSv (417-490 microSv) to the right index finger, 138 microSv (127-149 microSv) to the right wrist and 13 +/- 0.8 microSv to the chest.Myocardial perfusion PET with (13)N-ammonia exposes the staff to radiation doses that are comparable to doses from (18)F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose scans and the annual doses are well within the recommended upper limits for radiation workers.
