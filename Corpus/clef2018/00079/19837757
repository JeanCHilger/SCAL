Assessment of interobserver reproducibility in quantitative 18F-FDG PET and CT measurements of tumor response to therapy. Our goal was to estimate and compare across different readers the reproducibility of the (18)F-FDG PET standardized uptake value (SUV) and CT size measurements, and changes in those measurements, in malignant tumors before and after therapy.Fifty-two tumors in 25 patients were evaluated on (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans. Maximum SUVs (SUV(bw) max) and CT size measurements were determined for each tumor independently on pre- and posttreatment scans by 8 different readers (4 PET, 4 CT) using routine nonautomated clinical methods. Percentage changes in SUV(bw) max and CT size between pre- and posttreatment scans were calculated. Interobserver reproducibility of SUV(bw) max, CT size, and changes in these values were described by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and estimates of variance.The ICC was higher for the pretreatment, posttreatment, and percentage change in SUV(bw) max than the ICC for the longest CT size and the 2-dimensional CT size (before treatment, 0.93, 0.72, and 0.61, respectively after treatment, 0.91, 0.85, and 0.45, respectivelyThe interobserver reproducibility of SUV(bw) max for both untreated and treated tumors and percentage change in SUV(bw) max are substantially higher than measurements of CT size and percentage change in CT size. Measurements of tumor metabolism by PET should be included in trials to assess response to therapy. Although PET reproducibility was high, the variability observed in analyses of identical image sets by 4 readers indicates that automated analytic tools to assess response might be helpful to further enhance reproducibility.
