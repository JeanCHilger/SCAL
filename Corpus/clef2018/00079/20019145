Alterations in frontal lobe tracts and corpus callosum in young children with autism spectrum disorder. Major frontal lobe tracts and corpus callosum (CC) were investigated in 32 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, mean age: 5 years), 12 nonautistic developmentally impaired children (DI, mean age: 4.6 years), and 16 typically developing children (TD, mean age: 5.5 years) using diffusion tensor imaging tractography and tract-based spatial statistics. Various diffusion and geometric properties were calculated for uncinate fasciculus (UF), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFO), arcuate fasciculus (AF), cingulum (Cg), CC, and corticospinal tract. Fractional anisotropy was lower in the right UF, right Cg and CC in ASD and DI children in right AF in ASD children
