Change of accumulation and filling pattern in evolution of cerebral infarction with I-123 IMP brain SPECT. Twenty-eight patients with cerebral infarction were examined by brain SPECT with I-123 IMP a total of 46 times from Day 2 to Day 84 after the onset of stroke. Depending on the pattern of change in the abnormal accumulation of I-123 IMP between the early and delayed images, the patients were classified into one of five types. The number of patients in each type and the number of days after infarction at which each type occurred were as follows: Type (I), n = 5 and 4 +/- 2 days Type (II), n = 8 and 12 +/- 4 days
