Characterizing the contribution of cardiac and hepatic uptake in dedicated breast SPECT using tilted trajectories. A small field of view, high resolution gamma camera has been integrated into a dedicated breast, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) device. The detector can be flexibly positioned relative to the breast and image beyond the chest wall, allowing the system to capture direct views of the heart and liver. The incomplete sampling of these organs creates artifacts in reconstructed images, complicating lesion detection. To understand the limits imposed on a 3D acquisition trajectory, sequential tilted trajectories at increasing polar tilt are utilized to collect data of anthropomorphic phantoms filled with aqueous (99m)Tc in a clinically realistic concentration ratio. The counts collected per projection between different scans and the SNR, contrast and resolution (FWHM) of two hot lesions were compared. As expected, the counts per projection increased when the camera had direct views of the heart and liver, but remained relatively constant at other angles. The SNR, contrast and FWHM were more affected by the insufficient sampling of the data by the large polar angles than by the cardiac and hepatic activity. An upper bound on polar tilt for each azimuthal position reduces the artifacts in the reconstructed images. Such trajectories were implemented to show artifact-free reconstructed images.
