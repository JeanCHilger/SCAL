Bio-kinetic analysis on treatment of textile dye wastewater using anaerobic batch reactor. An anaerobic digestion technique was applied to textile dye wastewater aiming at the colour and COD removal. Pet bottles of 5 L capacity were used as reactor which contains methanogenic sludge of half a liter capacity which was used for the treatment of combined synthetic textile dye and starch wastewater at different mixing ratios of 20:80, 30:70, 40:60, 50:50 and 60:40 with initial COD concentrations as 3520, 3440, 3360, 3264 and 3144 mg L(-1), respectively. The reactor was maintained at room temperature (30±3°C) with initial pH of 7. The maximum COD and colour removal were 81.0% and 87.3% at an optimum mixing ratio of 30:70 of textile dye and starch wastewaters. Both Monod's and Haldane's models were adopted in this study. The kinetic constants of cell growth under Haldane's model were satisfactory when compared to Monod's model. The kinetic constants obtained by Haldane's model were found to be in the range of μmax=0.037-0.146 h(-1), Ks=651.04-1372.88 mg L(-1) and Ki=5681.81-18727.59 mg L(-1).
