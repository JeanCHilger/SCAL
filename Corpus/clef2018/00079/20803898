Characteristics of bottled waters available for purchase in the Silesia region. The aim of the study was to characterize bottled waters available for purchase in the Silesia region in relation to total mineral contents and main ion concentrations. In descriptive epidemiological design, we investigated 70 types of available for purchase bottled waters (mineral, spring and table ones), sold in glass or PET bottles. On the basis of data revealed by producers, we analyzed total mineral contents and concentrations of main cations (sodium, magnesium, calcium and potassium) and anions (hydrocarbons, sulfate, chloride and fluoride). The study group comprised of 35 mineral waters and 35 spring waters. There were no table waters available for purchase. Total mineral content in mineral waters was 1310.0 +/- 814.8 mg/dm3, concentration of cations was 295.4 +/- 181.2 mg/dm3 and of anions: 968.1 +/- 638.5 mg/dm3. The concentrations of investigated cations were adequately: Ca 178.7 +/- 107.3 mg/dm3, Mg 54.3 +/- 52.7 mg/dm3, Na 53.5 +/- 67.4 mg/dm3 and K 8.9 +/- 9.4 mg/dm3. The contents of anions were: HCO3 930.5 +/- 647.2 mg/dm3, SO4 25.9 +/- 21.6 mg/dm3, Cl 11.5 +/- 11.2 mg/dm3 and F 0.2 +/- 0.27 mg/dm3. In relation to spring waters, total mineral content was 365.9 +/- 150.8 mg/dm3 and concentrations of cations and anions were adequately: 87.9 +/- 37.6 mg/dm3 and 255.1 +/- 111.9 mg/dm3. The concentrations of analyzed cations were adequately: Ca 55.4 +/- 19.7 mg/dm3, Mg 10.6 +/- 6.9 mg/dm3, Na 20.6 +/- 30.3 mg/dm3 and K 1.3 +/- 1.7 mg/dm3. For anions the concentrations were as follows: HCO3 223.2 +/- 105.8 mg/dm3, SO4 18.9 +/- 19.1 mg/dm3, Cl 12.9 +/- 16.5 mg/dm3 and F 0.11 +/- 0.12 mg/dm3. The quantity of available for purchase mineral waters is similar to spring waters. Total mineral content is on average 4-fold higher for mineral than spring waters. The variation of investigated ions concentrations is higher for mineral than spring waters. Both mineral and spring waters differ the most in relation to Na and K concentrations, and Cl and F contents.
