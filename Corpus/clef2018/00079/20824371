National trends in the management and survival of surgically managed gallbladder adenocarcinoma over 15 years: a population-based analysis. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend hepatic resection and lymphadenectomy (LND) for gallbladder adenocarcinoma (GBA). We sought to evaluate compliance with these recommendations and to assess trends in the management and survival of patients with GBA.Using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare-linked data, we identified 2,955 patients with GBA who underwent cancer-directed surgery from 1991 to 2005. We assessed clinicopathologic data, trends in surgical management, and survival.From 1991 to 2005, preoperative evaluation included CT (62%), MRI (6%), and PET (2%). Only 383 (13%) patients underwent radical resection/hepatectomy with a temporal increase over the study period (1991-1995, 12% 1996-1999, 10%Compliance with NCCN guidelines for GBA remains poor. Survival of patients with surgically managed GBA has not improved over time.
