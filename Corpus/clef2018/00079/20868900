Nuclear medicine imaging of the breast: a novel, physiologic approach to breast cancer detection and diagnosis. Nuclear medicine imaging of the breast is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved imaging modality that is being integrated into clinical practice to increase the armamentarium of tools available to diagnose breast cancer. The authors' practice, and others that have integrated nuclear medicine imaging of the breast into their clinical protocols, has found it to be a critical tool in optimally evaluating women for breast cancer. This physiologic/metabolic approach of nuclear medicine breast imaging studies, and their utility in clinical situations make them an important part of the entire spectrum of modalities for optimal breast cancer diagnosis.
