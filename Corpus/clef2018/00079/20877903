First bodipy-DOTA derivatives as probes for bimodal imaging. The synthesis and the photophysical studies of the first bodipy-DOTA and its In(III), Ga(III) and Cu(II) complexes are reported. The introduction of an isothiocyanate handle generates a new bimodal imaging agent capable of both optical and nuclear imaging.
