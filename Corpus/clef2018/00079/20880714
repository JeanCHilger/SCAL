Labelling of commercially available human serum albumin kits with 68Ga as surrogates for 99mTc-MAA microspheres. An alternative method of labelling different commercially available human serum albumin kits with generator produced (68)Ga as possible surrogate markers for the investigation of the biodistribution, and to exclude a possible lung shunt in patients with solid primary tumours and liver metastases by positron emission-tomography (PET) and effective substitute for (99m)Tc HSA as a PET perfusion tracer is described. The radioactive labelling with (68)Ga was based on the elution of a commercial (68)Ge/(68)Ga generator system, which uses a modified tin dioxide column to absorb (68)Ga. We obtained (68)Ga-MAA and (68)Ga-HSA in radiochemical yields of 79 Â± 5% with less than 5% free (68)Ga. The whole procedure takes a total of less than 30 min from elution to the final product.
