Exploring dopaminergic activity in ring chromosome 20 syndrome: a SPECT study. Several lines of evidence indicate that the dopaminergic system may play a role in the propagation of epileptic seizures and, indeed, DOPA metabolism impairment has recently been demonstrated in PET studies of ring chromosome 20 [r(20)] patients. We conducted a study looking for correlations between r(20) mosaicism, other clinical variables and both pre-synaptic dopamine transporter (DAT) expression and post-synaptic D2 receptor density.Five patients with r(20) and epilepsy were enrolled in the study. DAT expression and D2 density were measured by single photon emission tomography (SPECT) imaging with 185 MBq of [¹²³I]ioflupane and [¹²³I]IBZM, respectively, on different days. Linear correlations between r(20) mosaicism, clinical variables and binding of [¹²³I]ioflupane or [¹²³I]IBZM were examined.A significant correlation between seizure frequency and r(20) mosaicism was detected (r=0.903, P<0.05), along with a negative correlation between r(20) mosaicism and binding of [¹²³I]ioflupane in the putamen and in the caudate nucleus (r=-0.692 and r=-807 P<0.05). Seizure frequency was positively correlated with post-synaptic D2 density (r=0.925, P<0.05).Striatal neurons are involved in r(20) epilepsy the relationship found between r(20) mosaicism and DAT expression suggests that drugs acting on the dopaminergic system could have a place in the treatment of this rare form of epilepsy.
