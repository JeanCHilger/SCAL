Comments on 'Elevated antimony concentrations in commercial juices'. The recent J. Environ. Monit. communication 'Elevated antimony concentrations in commercial juices' contains several inaccuracies and misrepresentations about PET packaging as well as food safety and risk assessment. None of the data indicates that "elevated" or unsafe levels of antimony were found in any of the commercial juices or that the variations in antimony levels were attributable to either PET or the other packaging materials.
