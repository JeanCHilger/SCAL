A comparison of 131I-labeled antibodies, 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose and 68Ga-EDTA in the imaging of human tumor xenografts in nude mice. Three different biological properties--glucose metabolism, gallium imaging and antigen-antibody interaction--have been targeted to image human tumor xenografts implanted in nude mice. Seventy-two experiments were performed in 25 nude mice. Two types of human tumors were used: colorectal carcinoma SW 1116 and melanoma WM 9. Immunoscintigraphic studies produced the highest tumor sampling and confirmed earlier findings that F(ab')2 fragments generate better tumor images than whole antibodies.
