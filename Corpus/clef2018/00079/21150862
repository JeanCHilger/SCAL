Bone marrow disease detection with FDG-PET/CT and bone marrow biopsy during the staging of malignant lymphoma: results from a large multicentre study. To compare the accuracy of bone marrow biopsy (BMb) and positron emission tomography (PET) in bone marrow disease (BMD) detection, in a large multicentre population of patients with new diagnosis of malignant lymphoma.PET and BMb were performed to complete disease staging in 337 consecutive patients: 130 Hodgkin's disease (HD), 207 aggressive non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of both techniques in BMD detection were evaluated and compared.87 patients with BMD (25 positives at both exams, 27 only at the BMb and 35 only at the PET study). PET vs. BMb were reordered: sensitivity: 69% vs. 59.8% specificity: 99.2% vs. 100%The sensitivity of PET and BMb is similar (69% and 60%, respectively), PET and BMb are complementary: in fact out of 87 patients with confirmed BMD only 25 are positive at both exams, while 27 only at the BMb and 35 only at the PET exam the integration of PET findings with BMb ones increases the diagnostic accuracy. Consequentially PET is essential during the staging of malignant lymphomas.
