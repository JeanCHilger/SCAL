Use of computed tomography in the management of colorectal cancer. Computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the management of colorectal cancer (CRC). The use of CT (colonography) as a screening tool for CRC has been validated and is expected to rise over time. The results of prior studies suggest that CT is suboptimal for assessment of local T stage and moderate for N stage disease. Recent advances in CT technology are expected to lead to some improvement in staging accuracy. At present, the main role of CT in pre-treatment imaging assessment lies in its use for the detection of distant metastases, especially in the liver. In a select group of patients, routine post-treatment surveillance with CT confers survival benefits. The role of CT for post-treatment assessment has been radically altered and improved with the advent of fusion positron emission tomography/CT. Perfusion CT shows promise as another functional imaging modality but further experience with this technique is necessary before it can be applied to routine clinical practice.
