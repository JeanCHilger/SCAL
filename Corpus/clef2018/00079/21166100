Ask the doctor.  I am an 84-year-old man with atrial fibrillation, mild heart failure, and well-controlled high blood pressure.  My doctor had me wear a Holter monitor and get a SPECT scan (which showed mild nonischemic cardiomyopathy). Now he wants me to have a cardiac MRI.  What information would this test give that he doesn't already have?
