Serological detection of Epstein-Barr virus infection in dogs and cats. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is widespread in humans world-wide. The virus, which is linked to Burkitt's and Hodgkin lymphoma in humans, has recently been detected in pet dogs in Taiwan. The aim of this study was to determine if EBV is present in other canine populations, whether infection is associated with lymphoma in dogs, and whether infection is present in cats. Canine and feline serum samples were analysed by immunofluorescence assay. Antibodies to EBV or an EBV-like virus were detected in 38.4% of UK dog sera, 64% of US dog sera and 38% of cat sera. Canine blood samples, tissue samples from the palatine tonsil and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy samples from canine lymphoma cases were analysed by PCR. Using EBV-specific primers, EBV was detected in one tonsil sample, whereas all other samples tested were negative. PCR using consensus herpesvirus primers identified canine herpesvirus in twelve tonsil samples and one biopsy but no gammaherpesviruses were detected. Canine blood samples from EBV antibody-positive dogs were analysed by RT-PCR to determine if transcripts associated with lytic EBV infection (BcLF1) or latency (LMP2) were present, however all samples tested were negative. In conclusion, there is serological evidence of exposure to EBV or an EBV-like virus in dogs and cats but persistent infection in the canine palatine tonsil is rare and no evidence was found of EBV in canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The effect of EBV on canine and feline cells and the possible outcome of the infection for the host require further investigation.
