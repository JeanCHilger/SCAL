How have developments in molecular imaging techniques furthered schizophrenia research? Molecular imaging techniques have led to significant advances in understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and contributed to knowledge regarding potential mechanisms of action of the drugs used to treat this illness. The aim of this article is to provide a review of the major findings related to the application of molecular imaging techniques that have furthered schizophrenia research. This article focuses specifically on neuroreceptor imaging studies with PET and SPECT. After providing a brief overview of neuroreceptor imaging methodology, we consider relevant findings from studies of receptor availability, and dopamine synthesis and release. Results are discussed in the context of current hypotheses regarding neurochemical alterations in the illness. We then selectively review pharmacological occupancy studies and the role of neuroreceptor imaging in drug development for schizophrenia.
