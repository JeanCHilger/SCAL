Analysis of 2735 canine uroliths in Spain and Portugal. A retrospective study: 2004-2006. The objective of the study was to evaluate epidemiological data derived from 2735 canine uroliths received by Hill's Pet Nutrition from Spain and Portugal between January 2004 and December 2006. The results of quantitative analysis from Minnesota Urolith Center (MUC) were compared with that from other countries and interrelations of mineral composition, age, breed, and gender were determined. The most frequent calculus was calcium oxalate (38.1%) followed by struvite (32.9%). Eighty-three breeds plus crossbreeds (25%) were identified. In all of them, but Dalmatians, calcium oxalate and struvite accounted for 71-78%. The mean age of urolith appearance was 7.6 years. There was a significant difference in the frequency of different uroliths composition among the six most common breeds presenting urolithiasis in Spain and Portugal (Yorkshire terrier, Miniature Schnauzer, Cocker Spaniel, Poodle, Shih Tzu and Dalmatian). This is the first report on xanthine urolithiasis found in Spain. Prevalence of cystine calculi was significantly lower (3.2%) than that reported previously in parts of Spain (26%).
