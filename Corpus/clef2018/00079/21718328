PET and PET/CT in cardiovascular disease. The present review provides an overview of the role of cardiac positron emission tomography in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. It expands on the relative advantages and disadvantages over other imaging modalities as well as the available evidence supporting its value in the diagnosis and management of patients with coronary artery disease, the assessment of myocardial viability, and evaluation of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system. Furthermore, the recent developments, such as the implementation of high-end computed tomography devices to form hybrid systems, and the advances of molecular imaging probes in experimental applications are briefly discussed.
