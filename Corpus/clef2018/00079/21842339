Importance of quantification for the analysis of PET data in oncology: review of current methods and trends for the future. In oncology, positron emission tomography (PET) is an important tool for tumour diagnosis and staging, assessment of response to treatment and evaluation of the pharmacokinetic properties and efficacy of new drugs. Despite its quantitative potential, however, in daily clinical practice PET is used almost exclusively with 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) and, in addition, [(18)F]FDG data are normally assessed visually or using simple indices as the standardised uptake value (SUV). After explaining why more sophisticated quantification methods can be useful in oncology, the paper reviews the approaches that are commonly used and those available but not routinely employed. Particular emphasis is addressed to the SUV, for its importance in clinical practice. Issues specific to PET quantification in oncology and related examples are then discussed. Finally, some ideas for the development of new quantitative methods for analysing PET data in oncology and for the application of approaches already existing but not commonly employed are presented.
