Phase I, first-in-human study of BMS747158, a novel 18F-labeled tracer for myocardial perfusion PET: dosimetry, biodistribution, safety, and imaging characteristics after a single injection at rest. (18)F-labeled BMS747158 is a novel myocardial perfusion imaging tracer that targets mitochondrial complex 1. The objectives of this phase I study were to evaluate radiation dosimetry, biodistribution, human safety, tolerability, and early elimination of (18)F activity in urine after injection of a single dose of the tracer at rest in healthy subjects.Thirteen healthy subjects were injected with 170-244 MBq (4.6-6.6 mCi) of BMS747158 intravenously. Dynamic PET was obtained over the heart for 10 min, followed by sequential whole-body imaging for 5 h. Blood samples and urinary excretion were collected for up to 8 h. Heart rate, electrocardiogram, and blood pressure were monitored before and during imaging. The residence times were determined from multiexponential regression of organ region-of-interest data normalized by injected dose. Absorbed dose estimates for all target organs were determined using MIRD schema with OLINDA/EXM software.The organ receiving the largest mean absorbed dose was the kidneys at 0.066 mSv/MBq (0.24 rem/mCi), followed by the heart wall at 0.048 mSv/MBq (0.18 rem/mCi). The mean effective dose was 0.019 mSv/MBq (0.072 rem/mCi). The heart exhibited high and sustained retention of BMS747158 from the earliest images through approximately 5 h after injection. There were no drug-related adverse events, and the tracer was well tolerated in all subjects. Mean urinary excretion was 4.83 percentage injected dose (range, 0.64-12.41 percentage injected dose).These preliminary data suggest that (18)F-labeled BMS747158 appears to be well tolerated and has a unique potential for myocardial perfusion PET.
