Pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma: computed tomography and ¹⁸F fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging findings and follow-up. The aim of the study was to present the computed tomography (CT) and fluorine 18 (F) fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT imaging findings of pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and evaluate their roles in the follow-up of this tumor.Computed tomography and FDG-PET/CT imaging findings of 18 cases of pathologically proven pulmonary MALT lymphoma were reviewed retrospectively.Multiple and solitary lesions were detected in 15 and 3 patients, respectively. Of those patients with multiple pulmonary lesions, 12 were bilateral, and 3 were unilateral. A total of 51 pulmonary lesions were identified in 18 patients, which included lesions with consolidation (31/51), mass and nodule (12/51), and ground-glass attenuation (8/51). F fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/CT imaging (n = 8) revealed increased FDG uptake in all lesions in 8 cases. At follow-up, 3 patients experienced complete remission, 10 had partial remission, and 2 remained stable.Computed tomography and FDG-PET/CT images of the pulmonary MALT lymphoma usually reveal multiple, bilateral consolidations, masses, or nodules with air bronchogram and increased FDG uptake. Computed tomography and FDG-PET/CT imaging play important roles in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with pulmonary MALT lymphoma.
