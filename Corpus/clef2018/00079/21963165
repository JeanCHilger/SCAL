Imaging of soft tissue and osseous sarcomas of the extremities. Soft tissue and osseous sarcomas of the extremities are uncommon malignancies that represent very important diagnostic entities because of their aggressive nature. Radiologic investigations, including plain film, computed tomography, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scintigraphy, ultrasound, and positron emission tomography-computed tomography, play critical roles in providing a differential, establishing the diagnosis, demonstrating prognostic characteristics, and tailoring tumor treatment. The purpose of this review is to describe the most common soft tissue and osseous sarcomas of the extremities, with emphasis on their plain film and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics with the aim of aiding the reader to accurately describe the important imaging features and generate an appropriate differential diagnosis to aid the referring clinician with prompt appropriate management and treatment.
