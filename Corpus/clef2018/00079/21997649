The potential value of hybrid positron emission tomography/dual-source computed tomography imaging in coronary bypass surgery. We evaluated how comprehensive assessment of coronary artery lesions and their hemodynamic relevance by means of hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) imaging would affect decision-making in coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), compared with using invasive coronary angiography (ICA) alone.After undergoing ICA, 27 patients (21 men and 6 women mean SD age, 66 Â± 10 years) planned for cardiac surgery were scheduled for myocardial perfusion stress/rest evaluation with [13N]ammonia PET and CT coronary angiography. Only ICA was available to the surgeon. Postoperatively, the performed CABG was compared with the hypothetical strategy based on hybrid PET/CT findings (regional coronary flow reserve [CFR], myocardial perfusion defects). Procedures included CABG (n = 18) alone, CABG combined with valve replacement (n = 6), and CABG combined with isolated valve replacement (n = 3). A total of 56 bypass grafts (28 venous and 28 arterial) and 66 distal anastomoses were placed.CT evaluation showed 93% concordance (66/71) with ICA regarding significant stenoses, with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 93.1%, 98.7%, 94.4%, and 98.4%, respectively. In the PET scan, 16 patients had 1 ischemic region, and 12 patients had 1 scar region, including 5 patients who presented with mixed conditions (scar and ischemia). One patient had a completely normal myocardium. Compared with the performed surgery, PET/CT fusion evaluation showed that of the performed anastomoses, 48% had documented ischemia (with a CFR <2 in 86%), 38% were nonischemic (although a CFR value <2 was found in 78%), and 14% had scar tissue (fixed perfusion defect).Although <50% of bypasses were placed to areas with myocardial ischemia, the CFR was low in the majority of nonischemic regions, a finding that may have important prognostic relevance. PET/CT fusion imaging could potentially influence planning for CABG and provide incremental prognostic information.
