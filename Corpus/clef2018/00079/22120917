Nondermatomal somatosensory deficits in chronic pain patients. Nondermatomal somatosensory deficits (NDSDs) are frequently found in chronic pain patients and allude to pain sensitization and pain centralization. In the clinical examination NDSDs are as a rule accompanied by hyposensitivity to touch and heat perception often with a quadrantal or hemibody distribution. The majority of NDSD patients show a trigger episode with a somatic nociceptive trauma in the case history. These somatic findings, however, never fully explain the pain disorder, analogue to the complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Most patients with chronic pain disorders as well as those with NDSD often report an antecedent period of high psychobiological stress. The data from functional imaging reveal a complex pattern of a central nervous dysregulation.
