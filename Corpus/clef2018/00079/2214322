Unfolded map of coronary artery territories by myocardial SPECT. Coronary artery territories were evaluated precisely by Bull's-eye and unfolded map generated from myocardial SPECT. In addition, unfolded maps including apical information were also developed. The coronary artery territories were determined by 54 cases of typical single vessel disease (more than 75% stenosis) with myocardial infarction and angina pectoris. There were 12 of right coronary artery disease, 24 of left anterior descending coronary artery disease, 5 of diagonal coronary artery disease, and 13 of left circumflex artery disease. Each diseased region was summed and normalized using the standard pattern (21 cases of normal male and 13 cases of normal female). Apical information was simply obtained using the anterior and posterior count from short and long axial image. Then, their data were added to the unfolded map. In conclusion, unfolded map was proven to be useful for the determination of coronary artery territory, since this map expressed the extent and site of myocardial damage precisely compared to Bull's-eye. The unfolded map to contain the apical information was also useful for the evaluation of left anterior descending coronary artery involvement.
