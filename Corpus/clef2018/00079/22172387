An allogenic site-specific rat model of bone metastases for nuclear medicine and experimental oncology. Bone metastases are a major problem in several tumor entities affecting the therapeutic decision and the patient's prognosis. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are promising techniques for identifying bone tumors using gamma- or positron-emitting labeled radiotracers, but the same tracers if labeled with beta-emitters may also be used to apply therapeutic radionuclides for localized irradiation. For the tracer development specifically accumulating in osseous lesions, animal models of bone metastasis are needed. A technique was developed for tumor cell injection into the circulation of the hind limb of rats. For tumor implantation, the arteria epigastrica caudalis superficialis (a branch of the femoral artery) was cannulated, and 2×10(5) cells were injected. By using the allogenic Walker 256 mammary carcinoma cell line, isolated bone metastases were induced. For visualizing of the tumor growth, PET with 18F-fluoride was performed weekly on a μ-PET system. After 2-3 weeks, tumor invasion was confirmed by histology. Three weeks after tumor cell inoculation, PET images showed signs of bone metastases in 9 out of 11 animals. The tumors were located either in the proximal tibia/fibula or in the distal femur. At this time, the animals showed no restrictions in mobility. The tumors grew constantly over time. The final histological analysis showed tumors growing invasively into the bone matrix. With this model, new SPECT or PET tracers can be evaluated for their potency of accumulating in bone metastases in vivo and to determine which are therefore suitable for diagnosis and/or therapy.
