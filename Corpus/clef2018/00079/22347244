Seroepidemiological investigation of toxocariasis in the isparta region of Turkey. Toxocariasis is a common disease around the world. Our objective was to determine Toxocara seroprevalence in humans in the city of Isparta, Southwest Turkey, in respect of some determinants such as age, socio-economic level, residence in city center or rural area etc.Five hundred and thirty four individual participants from Isparta center and 85 from Asagi Gokdere village were included in the study. T. cati specific antibodies were analyzed using excretory-secretory (ES)-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method.T. cati antibodies were detected as positive in 73 (13.6%) of 534 samples which were collected from subjects living in the city center and 24 (28.2%) of 85 samples from Asagi Gokdere village. Toxocara seropositivity was detected among 15.6% of whole study group. The seroprevalence of toxocariasis was significantly higher among subjects from village than in subjects from city center (P=0.001). While gender, high school education, source of the water which is used, family income and geophagia/eating nail behaviors were the features which were detected as being associated with toxocariasis seropositivity (odds ratios=0.5 6.52It can be suggested that untreated lost pet population, environmental contamination, and way of life have influence on the epidemiology of toxocariasis.
