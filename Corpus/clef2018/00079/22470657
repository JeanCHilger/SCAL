The role of CT imaging in the congenital absence of a cervical spine pedicle: a case report and review of the literature. The congenital absence of a cervical spine pedicle is a rare clinical condition which is usually picked up as an incidental finding on imaging studies performed on patients complaining of neck pain following trauma. It is important to recognize that the finding is not traumatic in origin as this has implications regarding the treatment. We report a case of congenital absence of a cervical spine pedicle and present a review of the literature.
