Quantitative assessment of glucose metabolism in the vessel wall of abdominal aortic aneurysms: correlation with histology and role of partial volume correction. Inflammatory-proteolytic processes in the vessel wall are essential in the pathophysiology of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). It has been demonstrated that, (18)F-FDG-PET/CT may be useful for detection of pathological wall metabolism and therefore risk stratification. Quantification of the FDG-uptake in AAA wall is hampered by partial-volume (PV)-effects. For correction and accurate quantitative (18)F-FDG-uptake analysis we designed and validated a novel IDL-based software in correlation to phantom studies, histopathology and clinical presentation of AAA patients. For in vivo studies 23 patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic AAA underwent (18)F-FDG-PET/CT before surgery. In areas with (18)F-FDG-uptake the maximum and mean standardized uptake values in the vessel wall with (PVC-SUV(max), PVC-SUV(mean)) and without (SUV(max), SUV(mean)) PV-correction were determined. Results were correlated with clinical presentation, corresponding macrophage-infiltration and MMP-2- and -9-expression in surgical specimens. In patients, SUV(max), SUV(mean) as well as PVC-SUV(max) or PVC-SUV(mean) enabled a highly significant (p < 0.005) discrimination of symptomatic and asymptomatic AAA. Uncorrected and corrected SUVs showed comparable correlations with macrophage-infiltration and MMP-9 expression. No correlation of (18)F-FDG-uptake and MMP-2 was found. In vivo correlations of detected FDG-uptake with clinical and histological results showed comparable results for corrected and uncorrected SUVs. PV-correction is not mandatory for qualitative clinical assessment of glucose metabolism in the vessel wall of AAA-patients but may be necessary to establish quantitative cut off values to stratify patients for aneurysm repair.
