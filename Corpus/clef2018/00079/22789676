PET of hypoxia: current and future perspectives. In the past 25 y, a large amount of clinical experience with hypoxia PET tracers has accumulated. This article discusses recent improvements in image acquisition protocols and tracer pharmacology that have resulted in improved understanding of the underlying physiologic processes. The widespread clinical adoption of hypoxia PET tracers will depend largely on their utility in treatment prescription and in outcome monitoring. The establishment and validation of hypoxia-directed treatment protocols are still under development, and it is envisaged that the design and use of future hypoxia PET tracers will develop as part of this process.
