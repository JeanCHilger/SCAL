Iodine-123 labeled reboxetine analogues for imaging of noradrenaline transporter in brain using single photon emission computed tomography. Preliminary investigation of the radioiodinated (S,S)-reboxetine analogue, (123) I-INER, in baboons showed this tracer to have promise for imaging the noradrenaline transporter (NAT) using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). More recently, the radioiodinated (R,S)-stereoisomer of (123) I-INER, (123) I-NKJ64, has been synthesized and preliminary evaluation in rats has been reported. This article reports the brain distribution and pharmacokinetic properties of (123) I-NKJ64 in baboons and compares results with (123) I-INER data in the same species. SPECT studies were conducted in two ovariectomized adult female baboons using two different protocols: (1) bolus of (123) I-INER or (123) I-NKJ64 and (2) bolus plus constant infusion of (123) I-NKJ64 with reboxetine (2.0 mg/kg) administration at equilibrium. Following bolus injection, both radiotracers rapidly and avidly entered the baboon brain. The regional brain accumulation of (123) I-NKJ64 did not match the known distribution of NAT in baboon brain, contrasting with previous results obtained in rats. Conversely, the regional distribution of (123) I-INER was consistent with known distribution of NAT in baboon brain. No displacement of (123) I-NKJ64 was observed following administration of reboxetine. This contrasts with previous data obtained for (123) I-INER, where 60% of specific binding was displaced by a lower dose of reboxetine. These data suggest that (123) I-NKJ64 may lack affinity and selectivity for NAT in baboon brain and (123) I-INER is the most promising iodinated reboxetine analogue developed to date for in vivo imaging of NAT in brain using SPECT. This study highlights the importance of species differences during radiotracer development and the stereochemical configuration of analogues of reboxetine in vivo.
