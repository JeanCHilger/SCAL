Prognostic significance of volume-based metabolic parameters in uterine cervical cancer determined using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. We compared the prognostic value of volume-based metabolic parameters determined using fluorine 18 (F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) (F-FDG PET) (with other prognostic parameters in uterine cervical cancer.The subjects were 73 female patients who had an initial diagnosis of uterine cervical cancer and who underwent F-FDG PET. Various metabolic or volume-based PET parameters including maximum and average standardized uptake values, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were measured in primary cervical tumors. Survival analysis for disease-free survival or progression-free survival was performed with a Kaplan-Meier method using PET parameters and other clinical variables. For determining independent prognostic factors, Cox regression analysis was performed.Recurrence or disease progression occurred in 23 patients (31.5%). In univariate analysis, patient age (cutoff, 57 years, P < 0.05), International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (P = 0.07), primary tumor size (cutoff, 6.7 cm P < 0.05), lymph node status on PET (P < 0.005), treatment method (P < 0.01), metabolic tumor volume (cutoff, 82 cmIn uterine cervical cancer, TLG, a volume-based metabolic parameter, and lymph node status on PET may be significant independent prognostic factors for event-free survival.
