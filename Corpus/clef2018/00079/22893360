Orthostatic hypotension, non-dipping and striatal dopamine in Parkinson disease. Orthostatic hypotension and non-dipping are relatively common autonomic dysfunctions in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). These abnormalities have been thought to occur independently of striatal dopaminergic depletion however, only little preliminary information is available. In this study, we investigated the association of neurocirculatory changes with striatal dopamine transporter status in 69 patients with early PD. Seventeen patients had orthostatic hypotension and 55 patients were non-dippers. A comparison between cases with and without orthostatic hypotension was insignificant for striatal dopamine transporter uptake. These insignificances continued in a comparison of dippers and non-dippers. These results suggest that sympathetic noradrenergic dysfunctions in PD are independent of striatal dopamine transporter depletion.
