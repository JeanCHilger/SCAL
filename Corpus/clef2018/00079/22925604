Detecting peritoneal dissemination of ovarian cancer in mice by DWIBS. Diffusion-weighted whole-body imaging with background body signal suppression (DWIBS) is a relatively new diffusion-based pulse sequence that produces positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG)-like images. We tested the feasibility of DWIBS in detecting peritoneal ovarian cancer in a syngeneic mouse model. Female C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with ID8 murine ovarian carcinoma cells. After 11 weeks, the abdomen was imaged by DWIBS. A respiratory gating diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar imaging in abdomen was used (imaging parameters of field of view of 47×47 mm(2), matrix size of 64×64 zero-filled to 256×256 and b-value of 1500 s/mm(2)). We also performed FDG microPET as the reference standard. For comparison of the correlating surface areas of tumor foci on both DWIBS and FDG microPET imaging, two-dimensional region-of-interest (ROI) analysis was performed, and correlation between the two modalities was determined. Mice were also subjected to macroscopic examination for tumor location and pathology after imaging. DWIBS in all mice depicted the tumors as abnormal high signal intensity. The results show that the ROI analysis of correlating lesions reveals relatively high correlation (r²=0.7296) and significant difference (P=.021) between DWIBS and FDG microPET. These results demonstrate that DWIBS has the potential for detecting peritoneal dissemination of ovarian cancer. Nonetheless, due to low ratios of image signal-to-noise and motion artifacts, DWIBS can be limited for lesions near the liver.
