New frontiers in the design and synthesis of imaging probes for PET oncology: current challenges and future directions. Despite being developed over 30Â years ago, 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose remains the most frequently used radiotracer in PET oncology. In the last decade, interest in new and more specific radiotracers for imaging biological processes of oncologic interest has increased exponentially. This review summarizes the strategies underlying the development of those probes together with their validation and status of clinical translation a brief summary of new radiochemistry strategies applicable to PET imaging is also included. The article finishes with a consideration of the challenges imaging scientists must overcome to bring about increased adoption of PET as a diagnostic or pharmacologic tool.
