Influence of passive changes of lung volume on upper airways. The total upper airway resistances are modified during active changes in lung volume. We studied nine normal subjects to assess the influence of passive thoracopulmonary inflation and deflation on nasal and pharyngeal resistances. With the subjects lying in an iron lung, lung volumes were changed by application of an extrathoracic pressure (Pet) from 0 to 20 (+Pet) or -20 cmH2O (-Pet) in 5-cmH2O steps. Upper airway pressures were measured with two low-bias flow catheters, one at the tip of the epiglottis and the other in the posterior nasopharynx. Breath-by-breath resistance measurements were made at an inspiratory flow rate of 300 ml/s at each Pet step. Total upper airway, nasal, and pharyngeal resistances increased with +Pet [i.e., nasal resistance = 139.6 +/- 14.4% (SE) of base-line and pharyngeal resistances = 189.7 +/- 21.1% at 10 cmH2O of +Pet]. During -Pet there were no significant changes in nasal resistance, whereas pharyngeal resistance decreased significantly (pharyngeal resistance = 73.4 +/- 7.4% at -10 cmH2O). We conclude that upper airway resistance, particularly the pharyngeal resistance, is influenced by passive changes in lung volumes, especially pulmonary deflation.
