The optimum Butterworth-Wiener filter for I-123 IMP brain SPECT. The optimum Butterworth-Wiener filter (BWF) for the preprocessing of N-isopropyl-p-[I-123]-iodoamphetamine (I-123 IMP) SPECT was determined by a simulation experiment. Sixty-four images of the brain phantom containing 14.8 MBq of I-123 IMP were collected with a gamma camera equipped with a slant hole collimator during a 360-degree rotation. The images were processed with 27 BWFs of different shapes, followed by SPECT image reconstruction and visual comparison. The optimum BWF had a cutoff frequency of 0.25/pixel, FWHM of four pixels, and constant of 0.05. The image quality was greatly affected by the cutoff frequency of BWF used for preprocessing.
