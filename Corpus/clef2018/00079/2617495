Inventory of the shedding of Chlamydia psittaci by parakeets in the Utrecht area using ELISA. Using a Chlamydia-ELISA test to detect the agent in cloacal swabs in budgerigars and other parakeets, the following findings may be summarised: --10/25 Breeders of budgerigars (40 per cent) housed birds shedding the agent, involving ten per cent of all birds tested, average shedding being 28 per cent in positive lofts. --4/15 Pet shops (27 per cent) were found to have positive birds on sale, at least three per cent of all tested birds being shedders, the proportion of shedders averaging nine per cent per infected pet shop. --In the flocks of five breeders of psittaciformes, which were known positive flocks from the outset average shedding was eighteen per cent. The test may also be used for detecting the agent in organs. The shedding pattern in known positive birds was apparently decreasing, when a large dose of corticosteroids was administered, shedding recurred. The possibility of a cage bird sanitation scheme is discussed.
