Silent myocardial ischemia in patients with myocardial infarction: evaluation with positron emission computed tomography. To evaluate myocardial blood flow and glucose utilization, N-13 ammonia and F-18 deoxyglucose positron emission tomography were performed in 33 patients with myocardial infarction. The N-13 ammonia study was performed at rest and during supine exercise, and the F-18 deoxyglucose was done at rest after greater than or equal to 5 hours of fasting. Based on angina, exercise-induced hypoperfusion, and deoxyglucose uptake, 3 groups of patients were classified 10 patients in group I (neither angina nor exercise induced hypoperfusion), 8 patients in group II (painless exercise-induced hypoperfusion) and 15 patients in group III (anginal patients with/without exercise-induced hypoperfusion). The F-18 deoxyglucose positron study demonstrated accumulation of deoxyglucose in 6 patients in group I, 7 in group II, and 14 in group III. Thus, our results indicated that a significant number of patients with antecedent myocardial infarction had exercise-induced hypoperfusion and/or altered glucose metabolism without accompanying anginal pain.
