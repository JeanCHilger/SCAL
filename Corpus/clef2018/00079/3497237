Comparison of high-resolution MRI and SPECT bone scintigraphy for noninvasive imaging of the temporomandibular joint. Prospective evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and both single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and planar bone scintigraphy was undertaken in 31 temporomandibular joints (TMJs) of 21 symptomatic patients. When compared with the results of subsequent arthrography, MRI (0.88) was more sensitive than SPECT (0.76) or planar (0.56) scintigraphy for detection of internal derangement of the TMJ. A diagnostic sensitivity of 0.96 was achieved when the results of either MRI or SPECT was considered evidence of internal joint derangement. Five symptomatic TMJs, clinically thought to be abnormal, were positive on SPECT but showed no evidence of anterior disk displacement at the time of arthrography. In such instances, SPECT may be detecting functionally significant altered joint mechanics that are not evident on anatomic imaging of the TMJ.
