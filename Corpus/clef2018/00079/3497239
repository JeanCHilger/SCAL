Estimation of left ventricular mass in normal and infarcted canine hearts using thallium-201 SPECT. A new automated edge detection program has been developed to estimate left ventricular mass from single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) 201Tl images and 14 dogs were studied. Six of the 14 dogs underwent imaging before and 5 hr after coronary artery occlusion with a closed-chest technique. True left ventricular mass was determined at time of killing within 1 hr of the last 201Tl study. Left ventricular mass determined by tomography correlated well with autopsy left ventricular mass (r = 0.94 p less than 0.001, s.e.e. = 5.9 g) over a range of 62-156 g. The intraobserver variation between repeated measurements of the same SPECT study yielded an r = 0.99
