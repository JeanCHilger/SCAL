Septal Q wave in exercise testing: evaluation by single-photon emission computed tomography. Changes of septal Q waves in lead V5 by exercise were evaluated with single-photon emission computed tomography. Coronary artery disease was present in 66 patients, 48 of whom had left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) involvement. Forty-one subjects had normal coronary arteries. All patients under investigation were classified into 3 groups: group A (18 patients)--regression of Q amplitude during exercise group B (48 patients)--progression or no change of Q wave or a new Q wave during exercise
