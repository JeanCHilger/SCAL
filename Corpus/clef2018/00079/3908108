Tomographic renal cortical scintigraphy: correlation with intravenous urography, computed tomography, ultrasonography, angiography, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. This study evaluates single-photon renal tomoscintigraphy (SPECT) in the evaluation of renal masses and correlates this modality, where indicated, with computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US), angiography (ANGIO) and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMR). Eight patients with renal cortical lesions detected on intravenous urography (IVP) were evaluated by SPECT and planar nuclear imaging using Tc-99m glucoheptonate (GH). Three of these patients were felt particularly likely to have renal tumors and were additionally evaluated with US, CT, ANGIO and NMR. The five patients with nodules on IVP that were not particularly suggestive of malignancy had functioning, benign, renal tissue accounting for their IVP lesions. Four of five were found by planar-GH nuclear imaging, five/five by SPECT-GH. In addition, SPECT-GH allowed better "confidence" in the normal renal tissue diagnosis in three/five cases. Of the three renal lesions that were highly suggestive of malignancy, two were hypernephromas and one was hypertrophied functioning cortical tissue. All three were correctly identified prospectively on SPECT-GH however, one hypernephroma was missed on planar-GH. NMR, CT, and ANGIO detected only one of two hypernephromas prospectively (US detected both)
