Gallium-68 lipophilic complexes for labeling platelets. Generator produced 68Ga-labeled platelets could be useful for positron emission tomographic (PET) studies of thrombosis or atherosclerosis. To label platelets with 68Ga, we have studied the effects of trace metals in elutions of 68Ga from 68Ge. Studies were conducted on the formation of lipophilic 68Ga complexes 8-hydroxyquinoline, tropolone, and mercaptopyridine-N-oxide (MPO). Parameters such as pH, buffers, concentration of ligand, and stability with time were investigated. High performance liquid chromatography and instant thin layer chromatography were used to quantitate formation of the 68Ga complex. Platelets from human, dog, and rabbit plasma were incubated with the 68Ga complexes and the percent labeling determined. Accumulation of platelets in the catheter scraped aorta of the rabbit was determined by PET imaging, tissue counting, and autoradiography. Gallium-68 MPO gave 40-60% labeling of rabbit platelets with higher accumulation in the scraped aorta compared to the normal.
