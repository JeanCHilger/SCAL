Neurosurgical management of epilepsy: a personal perspective in 1983. The therapeutic goal in the neurosurgical treatment of medically intractable epilepsy is complete seizure control, for both biologic and psychosocial reasons. Cortical resections are more likely to accomplish this than other surgical alternatives for epilepsy. Although abnormalities on new imaging techniques (CT, positron emission scanning) aid in identifying the epileptic focus, interictal epileptiform EEG changes remain the main indicator of focal origin of the seizures. Where this is equivocal, direct brain recording of spontaneous seizures with subdural electrodes is of value in identifying the side and lobe of seizure onset. The cortical resection is then tailored by the extent of the interictal electrocorticographic abnormalities and functional identification of essential areas such as those for language, using an electrical stimulation mapping technique, under local anesthesia. With this approach, half of the patients with temporal lobe foci are seizure-free since the time of operation, over two-thirds become so with time, and over three-quarters have at least very major reductions in seizure frequency.
