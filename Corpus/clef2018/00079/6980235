Muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding: in vivo depiction using single photon emission computed tomography and radioiodinated quinuclidinyl benzilate. An attempt was made to characterize, in vivo, specific binding to the muscarinic cholinergic receptor in the calf using the radioiodinated ligand quinuclidinyl benzilate (123I-OH-QNB) and single photon detection emission computed tomography (SPECT). The supratentorial brain activity was significantly increased after the intravenous infusion of 123I-OH-QNB as compared to free 123I. Scopolamine, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist, decreased the measured brain activity when infused prior to 123I-OH-QNB consistent with pharmacologic blockade of specific receptor binding. Quantitative in vitro tissue distribution studies obtained following SPECT imaging were consistent with regionally distinct specific receptor binding in the striatum and cortical gray matter, nonspecific binding in the cerebellum, and pharmacologic blockade of specific binding sites with scopolamine. Although 123I-OH-QNB is not the ideal radioligand, our limited success will hopefully encourage the development of improved binding probes for SPECT imaging and quantitation.
