Evaluation of myocardial ischemia using a rest metabolism/stress perfusion protocol with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose/technetium-99m MIBI and dual-isotope simultaneous-acquisition single-photon emission computed tomography. This study sought to develop a dual-isotope single-acquisition single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) protocol using a multihead SPECT camera equipped with an ultra-high energy collimator to evaluate rest metabolism/stress perfusion simultaneously with fluorine-18 (F-18) deoxyglucose/technetium-99m (Tc-99m) 2-hexakis-2-methoxy-2-methylpropyl isonitrile (MIBI).The most accurate and logistic method of identifying injured but viable myocardium remains a diagnostic challenge.Sixty-five patients were given 25 to 50 g of glucose and, after approximately 60 min, an injection of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose. After a 35-min distribution phase, patients underwent exercise or pharmacologic stress followed by administration of 925 MBq (25 mCi) of Tc-99m MIBI. Five patients underwent F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose position emission tomography before dual-isotope SPECT:With a window of 20% for both photopeaks and a technetium-99m/fluorine-18 concentration of 3.2:1, the "spillover" from fluorine-18 into the technetium-99m window is < 6% of the total counts in the window in patients with a normal distribution of both radiopharmaceuticals. Phantom images clearly demonstrated cardiac defects measuring 2 x 1 and 2 x 0.5 cm. There was no significant difference in the images of the five patients who underwent both positron emission tomography and SPECT: Fifty-seven patients (mean [+/- SD] age 55 +/- 15 years, range 25 to 83 38 men, 19 women) had satisfactory images and were included in the study. Twenty-one patients had normal study resultsDual-isotope SPECT may provide an alternative, accurate, cost-effective method to nitrogen-13 ammonia/F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography or thallium-201 reinjection for identifying injured or dysfunctional but viable myocardium.
