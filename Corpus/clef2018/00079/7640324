Cholecystokinin messenger RNA deficit in frontal and temporal cerebral cortex in schizophrenia. No consistent markers of pathology have been established yet in schizophrenia, although abnormalities in frontal and temporal structures are indicated from positron emission tomography (PET) studies. We have used in situ hybridization to investigate functional changes focusing on the quantitation of cholecystokinin (CCK) mRNA, whose product has been shown to be depleted in schizophrenia. CCK mRNA and G(o) alpha-subunit mRNA were measured in eight schizophrenic and eight control subjects matched for age and postmortem delay. The study revealed a marked decrease in CCK mRNA of 83% in frontal cortex (BA10) and 63% in superior temporal cortex (BA22) in schizophrenia with no change in G(o) alpha-subunit mRNA in either region. This study was extended to a further series of eight patients to determine the reproducibility of this effect and to quantitate laminar changes in CCK mRNA. Quantitation of CCK mRNA in inner cortical layers (layer V/VI) was carried out in frontal and temporal cortex in comparison with G(o) alpha-subunit mRNA, which is also concentrated in this region this study showed a similar selective decrease in CCK mRNA in frontal and temporal cortex of 47% and 51%, respectively. A confirmatory decrease in CCK mRNA was also obtained by slot blot analysis of CCK mRNA in tissue extracts of frontal cortex by reference to levels of beta-tubulin mRNA, CCK mRNA:beta-tubulin mRNA was significantly decreased (67%) in schizophrenic tissue compared to control tissue. There was no significant correlation of CCK mRNA loss with neuroleptic treatment or duration of illness.
