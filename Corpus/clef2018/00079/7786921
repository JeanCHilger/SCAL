A bioimaging integration system implemented for neurological applications. A system aimed at the management and fusion of multimodal biomedical images, including X-ray computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and single photon emission computed tomography, has been implemented for neurological applications. This bioimaging integration system (BIS) consists of a network for image transmission from acquisition machines to dedicated image processing workstations, a software library for image standardization, and an image registration technique to project multimodal volumetric images into a common reference space. The registration procedure was evaluated in MRI/PET correlation studies, in which misalignment errors of 2.6 mm in the xy transaxial plane and 3.4 mm along the z axis were found. BIS has been validated for the anatomical-functional correlation analysis of MRI and PET images in neurological research protocols and clinical studies.
