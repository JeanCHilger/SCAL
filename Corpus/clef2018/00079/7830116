Detection of lymph node metastases of squamous-cell cancer of the head and neck with FDG-PET and MRI. The uptake of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) in neck lymph nodes of twelve patients with a squamous-cell carcinoma of the oral cavity was studied with PET in order to detect and locate lymphogenic metastases.The results of FDG-PET imaging were compared with clinical, MRI and histopathologic findings. Standardized uptake values (SUV) were also calculated.A sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 88% were calculated for FDG-PET. In contrast, a sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 94% were calculated for MRI. Calculated SUVs for reactive lymph nodes, metastatic lymph nodes and the primary tumor were undifferentiated.Using FDG-PET, lymph node metastases of squamous-cell carcinomas of the oral cavity can be visualized with a high sensitivity and specificity. FDG-PET can be an improvement in the evaluation of the neck.
