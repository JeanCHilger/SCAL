Planar cardiac F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose imaging with a conventional gamma camera. To examine the potential of an adapted gamma camera to image cardiac uptake of the positron emitting glucose analogue fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG).Postprandial studies were performed in 19 patients (mean age, 56 +/- 9 years) with coronary disease and resting cardiac dysfunction who had undergone a routine clinical 7 min/view planar thallium-201 (Tl-201) stress reinjection or rest redistribution study. A glucose/insulin protocol was used and, an hour after FDG injection, 15-minute static planar myocardial images were acquired in the four views used for Tl-201 scanning.The diagnostic quality of FDG images was at least as good as that of their Tl-201 counterparts, with less liver background in all but one FDG study. In the left anterior oblique 45 degrees view uncorrected global myocardial FDG and stress Tl-201 counts were similar, but the FDG study had significantly higher peak myocardial to background ratios.Assessing regional cardiac FDG uptake and myocardial perfusion seems feasible with conventional gamma camera technology, providing a widely available and cost effective means of detecting hibernating myocardium. Similar equipment may appreciably reduce the need for positron emission tomography in a range of clinical conditions.
