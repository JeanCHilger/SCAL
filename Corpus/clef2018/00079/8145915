The diagnostic value of SPECT with Tc 99m HMPAO in Alzheimer's disease: a population-based study. We studied the diagnostic accuracy of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium 99m-labeled hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (Tc 99m HMPAO) in 48 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and in 60 controls recruited from a population-based study. With logistic regression, we identified decreased temporal regional cerebral blood flow as the best discriminating variable between patients and controls. Receiver-operator characteristic curves showed that the discriminative ability of SPECT improved with increasing dementia severity. With specificity set at 90%, sensitivity figures were 42% in mild, 56% in moderate, and 79% in severe AD. The diagnostic gain as a function of the prior probability of the disease being present was computed for those with mild AD. When the prior probability varied at around 50%, the diagnostic gain for mild AD patients was substantial (a maximum of 34%) for a positive test result but poor for a negative test result. The results suggest that the practical usefulness of SPECT as a diagnostic adjunct in patients suspected of having mild AD is confined to situations in which, on clinical grounds, there is considerable diagnostic doubt.
