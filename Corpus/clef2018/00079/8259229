Determination of myocardial risk on basis of the outcome of previous myocardial infarcts. Advantages of myocardial tomoscintigraphy using thallium with dipyridamole. Exercise stress test, 24-hour-ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and myocardial perfusion 201-Thallium single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) with dipyridamole pharmacological stress probably have different sensitivities and specificities for the identification of residual ischemia after an acute myocardial infarction. Their clinical value is still a matter of debate. To comparatively evaluate various non-invasive methods, we studied 63 patients with previous myocardial infarction consecutively referred to our Nuclear Medicine Department to undergo myocardial dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg) Thallium SPECT, by comparing scintigraphic results with those of the exercise stress test and Holter monitoring. In basal conditions, heart rate was 67 +/- 14 beats per minute systolic and diastolic arterial pressures were 139 +/- 24 and 86 +/- 12 mmHg, respectively. Following intravenous dipyridamole, heart rate rose to 84 +/- 15 beats per minute (p < 0.0001), while systolic and diastolic pressures dropped to 133 +/- 26 and 79 +/- 13 mmHg, respectively (p < 0.0001
