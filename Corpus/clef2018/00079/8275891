Value of NMR spectroscopy in exploring the cerebral metabolism of patients affected by Alzheimer's disease. Besides imaging NMR can obtain spectrum reflecting brain tissues components able to resound. Some of these take an active part in a CNS metabolism: such are H (in water) and P (in MPA-TPA, etc.). This new investigating method already showed interest in vitro (tissues cultures) and in vivo (muscular metabolism) studies. Its application to cerebral metabolism studies are going to spread thanks to technological advances (magnetic field more powerful: air gap broad enough for human head passage). The first results of this investigation, in 5 SDAT patients diagnosed with respectively international inclusion criteria (NINCDS-ADRDA) and exclusion ones (such as XR Scan and SPECT exploration), are presented they are divided into two different groups showing PME (phosphomonoesters) peak dropped to 3.2 or 1.8 in one part, and raised to 15.5 till 27 ppm (parts by million: conventional unit dealing with substances concentration) as the normal range is set at about 7 +/- 4.5 ppm. Such PME changes have showed in an other B. Roussel's study to be a good biological index correlated with the age and the CNS state
