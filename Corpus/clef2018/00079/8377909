Analysis of IMP-SPECT in cerebral infarcts. We performed single photon emission computed tomography with N-isopropyl[123I]-p-iodoamphetamine in 22 normal volunteers (mean age, 68.3 +/- 9.5 years) and 190 patients with unilateral cerebral infarcts (66.1 +/- 11.4 years). We then compared visual and semiquantitative assessment of the left/right ratio of the early images. Cerebral blood flow in the patients with cerebral infarcts was compared with data from normal volunteers. An abnormal left/right ratio was recognized in 110 of 136 (81%) patients in whom X-ray computed tomography (CT) showed an abnormality, while visual inspection revealed abnormalities in only 99 (73%). In 54 patients no abnormality on CT, an abnormal left/right ratio was found in 28 (52%), and visual abnormalities in only 9 (17%). Altogether, the left/right ratio was abnormal in 138 of 190 (73%) patients, and abnormalities were detected visually in 108 (57%). Of 95 patients, 56 (59%) showed markedly larger lesions using the left/right ratio method than with the visual method.
