Regional myocardial blood flow and glucose utilization in symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Previous studies suggested the presence of myocardial ischemia in symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Positron emission tomography, a technique that can identify metabolic consequences of ischemia in coronary artery disease, permits the noninvasive measurements of regional myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism. This new quantitative imaging approach should therefore be suitable for detecting a possible enhancement of glucose utilization in myocardium of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and thus may help to elucidate the pathomechanism of ischemia in this disease.In 13 symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocardial blood flow and glucose utilization were measured with intravenous N-13-ammonia and F-18 deoxyglucose at rest and, in four patients, again during supine bicycle exercise. At rest, blood flow was significantly lower in hypertrophied than in normal myocardium (0.78 +/- 0.19 versus 0.99 +/- 0.13 mL.min-1.g-1, p < 0.025), whereas rates of glucose utilization were similar (0.88 +/- 0.31 versus 0.87 +/- 0.35 mumol.min-1.g-1). With exercise, blood flow and glucose utilization failed to increase in hypertrophic and normal segments but became more heterogeneously distributed throughout the left ventricular myocardium. Blood flow-metabolism mismatches indicative of myocardial ischemia were noted in three patients at rest and in three of the four patients during exercise and were due to reduced flow in the presence of maintained glucose uptake. The discordance between flow and glucose metabolism in hypertrophied myocardium was significantly more prominent in younger than in older patients.Normal or even elevated rates of glucose utilization and the presence of diminished blood flow in hypertrophied relative to normal myocardium suggest the presence of myocardial ischemia in symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The age dependence of blood flow metabolism disparity suggests differences in the underlying pathophysiology or severity of disease.
