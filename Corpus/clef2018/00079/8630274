Localisation of [131I]MIBG in nude mice bearing SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma xenografts: effect of specific activity. The biodistribution of no-carrier-added (n.c.a.) meta-[131I]iodobenzylguanidine ([131I]MIBG) and that prepared by the standard isotopic exchange method were compared in athymic mice bearing SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma xenografts. No advantage in tumour uptake was observed for the n.c.a. preparation. BALB/c nu/nu mice exhibited lower uptake in highly innervated normal tissues (heart and adrenals) than normal BALB/c mice. In another experiment, the distribution of n.c.a. [131I]MIBG in the absence or presence (3-9 micrograms) of MIBG carrier was determined. At both 4 h and 24 h, the heart uptake was reduced by a factor of 1.5 even at a dose of 3 micrograms MIBG. Tumour uptake was not significantly altered by various amounts of unlabelled MIBG at either time point.
