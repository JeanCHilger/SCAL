Species specific animal housing in pet shops (catalogue of measures). Many veterinarians lack the essential zoological and ethologic knowledge of toy fishes and birds, reptiles, and the amphibians to correctly judge the specific keeping of animals in pet shops. To make up such deficits, the study group "AK 8 Zoofachhandel" (= study group 8 pet shops) of "Tierärztliche Vereinigung für Tierschutz TVT" (= Veterinarian Consortium for the Protection of Animals) has been setting up lists, which contain criteria that enables veterinarians to judge the conditions of animal keeping in pet shops equally. Any kind of defect determined in an inspection of a pet shop will consequentially lead to the specific measures for each individual case. These measures have to be made out by the veterinarian in accordance with those lists and his individual knowledge. The following slides are examplary for good as well as bad keeping conditions.
