Detection of coronary artery disease: comparison between technetium 99m-labeled sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography and two-dimensional echocardiography with dipyridamole low-level exercise-stress. Myocardial perfusion imaging in conjunction with dipyridamole low-level exercise stress has proved its value in the evaluation of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Simultaneous wall motion analysis by two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography may provide additional information beyond that obtained by myocardial perfusion imaging alone. The purpose of this study was to compare 99mTc-labeled sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and 2D echocardiography for the evaluation of CAD according to a dipyridamole low-level bicycle exercise stress protocol.We studied 35 consecutive patients referred for the evaluation of chest pain who had undergone coronary arteriography. 99mTc-labeled sestamibi SPECT and 2D echocardiography agreed in 27 patients (80%) studied for overall detection of CAD. On a segmental basis, agreement was found between SPECT and 2D echocardiography in 124 (73%) of 170 segments (Cohen's kappa = 0.43). The accuracy of the combined assessment of myocardial perfusion and echocardiographic wall motion in detecting CAD was 86%, which was not different from the accuracy of SPECT alone (80% difference not significant) but significantly higher than for 2D echocardiography alone (71%The combined simultaneous assessment of myocardial perfusion by 99mTc-labeled sestamibi SPECT and wall motion by 2D echocardiography did not significantly improve overall accuracy over that obtained by 99mTc-labeled sestamibi SPECT alone. Therefore 99mTc-labeled sestamibi SPECT with dipyridamole low-level exercise stress appears the preferred imaging modality for the evaluation of patients with CAD.
