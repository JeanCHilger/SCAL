Effect of the number of projections collected on quantitative perfusion and left ventricular ejection fraction measurements from gated myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomographic images. Gated myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging is currently performed by step-and-shoot detector rotation, resulting in acquisition dead time and lengthened study duration compared with nongated SPECT imaging with continuous or pseudocontinuous rotation. Dead time is particularly undesirable in new fast-gated SPECT imaging protocols with inotropic pharmacologic stress.This article evaluated the influence of projections' angular spacing on quantitative measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and perfusion from postexercise 99mTc-labeled sestamibi images. Gated 60-projection data sets from 30 patients were compacted into 30- and 15-projection sets. The three sets (corresponding to 3-, 6-, and 12-degree spacing over 180 degrees) were reconstructed into gated and ungated short-axis image sets. LVEFs were measured from the gated images according to a previously described automatic algorithm, whereas perfusion was assessed from the ungated images by a 20-segment division of their maximal pixel polar maps. LVEF values were essentially unchanged between 60- and 30-projection images (y = 0.37 + 0.996x r = 0.999Thirty-projection gated SPECT imaging is a practical, accurate, and time-saving approach in standard gated protocols and, potentially, fast-gated protocols. Fifteen-projection gated SPECT imaging is not generally recommended and should be considered only for LVEF assessment in conjunction with fast-gated protocols.
