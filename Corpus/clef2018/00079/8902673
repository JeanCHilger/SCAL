Tolerance, hemodynamic changes, and safety of dobutamine stress perfusion imaging. Dobutamine myocardial perfusion imaging is being used increasingly for assessment of coronary artery disease. Heretofore, there have been no large series documenting its tolerance and safety. The aims of this study were to assess the tolerance, hemodynamic changes, and safety of dobutamine stress in conjunction with myocardial perfusion imaging.The tolerance, hemodynamic changes, and safety of dobutamine myocardial perfusion imaging were investigated in a consecutive series of 1012 patients. Dobutamine was infused at incremental doses of 10, 20, 30, and 40 micrograms/kg/min at 3-minute intervals. Perfusion tomography was performed according to standard protocols with either 201Tl or 99mTc-labeled sestamibi. Seven hundred twenty-nine patients (72%) reached a maximal dobutamine dose of 40 micrograms/kg/min. Dobutamine significantly increased heart rate (76 +/- 14 beats/min to 127 +/- 20 beats/min p < 0.001) and systolic blood pressure (141 +/- 20 mm Hg to 168 +/- 36 mm HgWhen done with the necessary caution, dobutamine myocardial perfusion imaging is a safe diagnostic test, although side effects are common.
