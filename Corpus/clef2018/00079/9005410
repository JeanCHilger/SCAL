Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy using 99mTC-tetrofosmin: a comparison with coronary angiography. Coronary angiography is still the most reliable method for the detection of coronary artery disease. In this study we compared to this method the accuracy of 99mTc-Tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT.Fifty two patients (38 male and 14 female) were studied with stress-rest 99mTc-Tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT. Two independent observers evaluated the uptake of the radiotracer using a score from 0 to 4. All patients underwent coronary angiography and the results were compared to SPECT findings. We considered as hemodynamic significant any obstruction greater than 50% and as ischemic any myocardial region with radiotracer uptake less than 4 at stress.There was good segmental correspondence between tetrofosmin scintigram and angiography. Sensitivity 72.2-91.1%, specificity 80.0-88.2%, ppv 76.4-88.5% and npv 83.3-85.7%, depending on the obstructed vessel.99mTc-Tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT is a reliable alternative for the detection of CAD.
