Bone SPECT of the jaws after fracture, onlay osteoplasty of insertion of implants. The aim of this study was early differentiation between uncomplicated and complicated processes of healing in the jaw using bone SPECT.Investigations were performed in 40 mandibular fractures and 26 jaws after onlay osteoplasty as well as secondary insertion of implants. Bone SPECT was carried out within 1-2 months and after approximately 4-5 months. The uptake in the jaw was assessed semi-quantitatively using ROI analysis.Fractures with uncomplicated healing showed a decrease of uptake in follow-up, whereas fractures with an infection in the later course showed an increase, resulting in a significantly higher uptake at the follow-up investigation for the latter group. 1-2 months after onlay osteoplasty significantly lower uptake was found in regions with later occurrence of sequestration. In regions with implants in which osseointegration failed, there was significant reduction of uptake initially and significant elevation at the follow-up investigation.These results indicate a prognostic relevance of bone SPECT in the evaluation of processes of healing in the jaw.
