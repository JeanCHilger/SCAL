Clinical evaluation of 123I-BMIPP myocardial SPECT in patients with hypertensive heart disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: comparison with the findings of 201Tl SPECT and Gd enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. 123I-BMIPP SPECT (123I-BMIPP), 201Tl SPECT (201Tl), and Gd-DTPA enhanced magnetic resonance myocardial imaging (MR) were performed in patient groups with hypertensive heart disease (HHD), apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (APH), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without APH(HCM). SPECT was divided into 20 segments and each segment was scored as one of 4 grades (0 = normal 1 = mildly decreased
