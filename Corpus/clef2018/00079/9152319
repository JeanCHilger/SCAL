Indium In-111 pentetreotide scintigraphy: application to carotid body tumors. This study was conducted to investigate and illustrate the use of Indium In-111 pentetreotide scintigraphy as it applies to carotid body tumors (CBT). Localization has relied primarily on ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging with angiographic confirmation. These methods only assess the cervical bifurcation without providing an evaluation of metastasis in patients without symptoms or recurrence in patients after surgery.Indium In-111 pentetreotide scintigraphy was used in five patients with a diagnosis of CBT. Four patients were evaluated after surgical excision for evidence of tumor recurrence. One patient was evaluated before excision for diagnostic confirmation.No evidence of tumor recurrence was demonstrated in the four patients who had undergone previous CBT excision. One of these patients had increased activity in the pituitary, later confirmed as an enlarged pituitary without evidence of an adenoma with computed tomography. The diagnosis of CBT was confirmed in the patient evaluated before surgery. This patient also had increased activity in the occipital region, confirmed as the site of previous ischemia on computed tomography.Indium In-111 pentetreotide scintigraphy is a new innovative method for viewing neuroendocrine tumors. Its potential lies not only in tumor localization but also in identification of recurrent tumor at the operative site and metastatic disease.
