The Nordic multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial of prophylactic ursodeoxycholic acid in liver transplant patients. Prophylactic treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been reported to reduce the incidence of acute rejection after liver transplantation compared with historical controls. We investigated this in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study.Fifty-four liver transplant patients were allocated to the UDCA treatment group (15 mg/kg/day), and 48 patients were allocated to the placebo group. Trial medicine was started on the first postoperative day and was given for 3 months. Follow-up was for 12 months. Treatment was stratified for adults with chronic liver disease (n=77), adults with acute liver failure (n=10), and children (n=15).The frequency of patients with acute rejection was 65% in the UDCA treatment group and 68% in the placebo group. The frequency of steroid-resistant rejection was similar in both groups. The probability of acute rejection, analyzed according to the intention-to-treat policy with Kaplan-Meier analysis, was similar in both treatment groups. No significant differences were found in patient survival and graft survival probabilities. For the biochemical markers of cholestasis, only gamma-glutamyltransferase was significantly improved after 2 months of UDCA treatment.The initial optimistic report of a beneficial effect of prophylactic treatment with UDCA on acute rejection after liver transplantation was not confirmed in this controlled study.
