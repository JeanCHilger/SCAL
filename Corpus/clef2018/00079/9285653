Incremental prognostic value of adenosine stress myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography and impact on subsequent management in patients with or suspected of having myocardial ischemia. We examined 1,159 consecutive patients who underwent adenosine stress dual isotope single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and had follow-up performed at a mean of 27.5 +/- 9.1 months (94% complete) for hard events (cardiac death and myocardial infarction) and referral to cardiac catheterization after nuclear testing. During follow-up, 120 hard events occurred (11.0% hard event rate 72 cardiac deaths [6.7% cardiac death rate] and 57 myocardial infarctions [5.3% myocardial infarction rate]). Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that nuclear testing added incremental value after adjusting for clinical and historical variables (global chi-square increased 13 to 98 for cardiac death as the end point, global chi-square increased 19 to 105 for hard events as the end point
