Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome dementia complex. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has become an epidemic in the United States. AIDS dementia complex (ADC) is a neurological dysfunction which has been indicated in 25-90% of AIDS patients, 30-40% of HIV-infected patients, and may be the only presenting manifestation of AIDS. Researchers have investigated many aspects of ADC including clinical features, etiology, epidemiology and prevalence, diagnosis (psychological parameters and laboratory investigations such as CSF, EEG, CT, MRI, PET, and ERP), assessment, neurological features (including neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological measures, and neuropathology), prognosis, and treatment. The research is controversial, complex, and contradictory. A discussion of the many areas of ADC and many hypotheses will be included.
