Adequacy of dialysis in automated peritoneal dialysis: a clinical experience. To compare the peritoneal clearances of urea and creatinine in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with three types of automated peritoneal dialysis (APD): continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), 50% tidal peritoneal dialysis (TPD), and 25% TPD and to assess the usefulness of the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) in predicting peritoneal clearances in overnight APD.Eleven uremic patients (mean age 44.5 +/- 15.45 years with a mean time on dialysis of 42.63 +/- 25.62 months) were included in the study.PET for urea and creatinine following Twardowski's method. Peritoneal clearances for urea and creatinine CAPD: samples of blood and dialysate within 24 hours. APD: blood mean levels of urea and creatinine before and after nighttime dialysis. Dialysate: urea and creatinine in nocturnal and daytime dialysate.Peritoneal clearance of creatinine was 38.14 +/- 9.99 L/week/1.73 m2 in CAPD, 44.28 +/- 12.4 L/week/1.73 m2 in CCPD, 50.07 +/- 17.86 L/week/1.73 m2 in 50% TPD (p < 0.05) and 40.18 +/- 6.65 L/week/1.73 m2 in 25% TPD. Peritoneal clearance of urea improved significantly in the three modalities of APD: 51.91 +/- 12.58 L/week/1.73 m2 in CAPD 66.7 +/- 9.9 L/week/1.73 m2 in CCPD (p < 0.05)A remarkable improvement was observed with APD regarding the clearance of urea mainly when 50% tidal peritoneal dialysis was used, whereas it was less noticeable in the clearance of creatinine. The PET is a helpful tool in predicting overnight peritoneal clearances of creatinine but it is less useful in predicting urea clearance.
