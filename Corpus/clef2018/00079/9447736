The temporal dynamics of reading: a PET study. The temporal dynamics of evoked brain responses are normally characterized using electrophysiological techniques but the positron emission tomography study presented here revealed a temporal aspect of reading by correlating the duration a word remained in the visual field with evoked haemodynamic response. Three distinct types of effects were observed: in visual processing areas, there were linear increases in activity with duration suggesting that visual processing endures throughout the time the stimulus remains in the visual field. In right hemisphere areas, there were monotonic decreases in activity with increased duration which we relate to decreased attention for longer stimulus durations. In left hemisphere word processing areas there were inverted U-shaped dependencies between activity and word duration indicating that, after 400-600 ms, activity in word processing areas is progressively reduced if the word remains in the visual field. We conclude that these inverted U effects in left hemisphere language areas reflect the temporal dynamics of visual word processing and we highlight the implication of these effects for the design of activation studies involving reading.
