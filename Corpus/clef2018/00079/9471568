Breast carcinoma and the axillary lymph node status: the use of 99mTc-sestamibi scintimammography for the diagnosis and preoperative staging. Preliminary results. The purpose of this study is the sensitivity and specificity evaluation of the 99mTc-sestaMIBI scintimammography (SMM) in the diagnosis and pre-surgical staging of patients with clinical and/or radiological suspicion of breast cancer.Forty-five patients with clinical and/or mammographic breast cancer suspicion were enrolled. Prone lateral views of both mammalian glands and anterior of chest, to evaluate the axillary lymph node infiltration, were acquired 60 min after i.v. injection of 20-25 mCi of 99mTc-sestaMIBI.Breast cancer was diagnosed by histological findings in 44 patients benign disease in 1 case. The tumors diameter ranged from 0.3 to 4 cm. The SMM sensitivity in the detection of breast cancer was 90% and the VPP was 100%. The smallest diameter in these detected lesions was 0.5 cm. The pathologic examination showed metastatic axillary involvement in 15 patients. The SMM sensitivity in the detection of axillary lymph node metastases was 75%, specificity was 90%. For each lesion grading, mitosis number, 67Ki expression, diameter, were considered and correlated to 99mTC-sestaMIBI uptake. The 5 breast cancer non-uptake cases had low cytoproliferative indexes. According to our data it is possible to observe that there is a correlation between uptake and cellular proliferation.The 99mTc-sestaMIBI SMM is a highly accuracy test in the breast cancer detection. The sensitivity in the axillary lymph node metastatic detection is just little below average according to the literature it is possible that the results can improve with higher accrual of patients, operator experience and equipment improvement and the using of SPECT.
