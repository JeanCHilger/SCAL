Single-photon emission-computed tomography in evaluation of cerebral microcirculation of patients with epileptiform syndrome. One-photon emission computed tomography (OPECT) was used to examine 87 patients with the epileptiform syndrome. Eighty five patients had impaired drug distribution which was suggestive of varying degree cerebral circulatory disorders. OPECT with a Tc-99m-gm-pao used in patients with the epileptiform syndrome revealed the morphological substract of brain structures. OPECT findings in the patients suggested the brain structural microcirculatory changes to be diffuse and focal, of varying magnitude. There was no clear correlation between clinical manifestations and OPECT and CT findings.
