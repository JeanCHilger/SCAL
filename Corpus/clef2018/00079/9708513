Fluorine-18-FDG detection of laryngeal cancer postradiotherapy using dual-head coincidence imaging. The aim of this study was to investigate whether, in patients treated for laryngeal carcinoma, a differentiation was possible between local recurrence or local control using a dual-head SPECT camera with PET capability.Eleven male patients (age range 51-71 yr mean age 62 yr) who had previously undergone radiotherapy for laryngeal carcinoma were studied using 5 mCi (185 MBq) 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). The mean interval between initial treatment and 18F-FDG PET was 21.9 mo (range 6-65 mo). Six patients had histologically proven local recurrence and five patients showed local control clinically. The mean follow-up in the local control group was 5.2 mo.Fluorine-18-FDG PET scans were positive in all six local relapses. Histopathological examination of the laryngectomy specimen revealed a mean tumor size of 2.6 cm (range 1.4-5.0 cm). In one patient, false-positive uptake was seen in an inflammatory lymph node. Fluorine-18-FDG PET scans were negative in all five patients with local control.It is possible to differentiate between local recurrence and local control in patients previously treated for laryngeal carcinoma with a dual-head SPECT scanner with PET capability.
