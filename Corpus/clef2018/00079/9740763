Origin of human motor readiness field linked to left middle frontal gyrus by MEG and PET. Combined magnetoencephalography and positron emission tomography identified a prior source of activity in the left middle frontal gyrus during uncued movements of the right index finger. Voluntary movements gave rise to a change in the cortical electrical potential known as the Bereitschaftspotential or Readiness Potential, recorded as early as 1500 ms before the onset of movement. The Readiness Field is the magnetic field counterpart to the Bereitschaftspotential. In the present study, magnetoencephalography identified four successively active sources of fluctuation in the Readiness Field in the period from 900 ms before, to 100 ms after, the onset of the movement. The first source to be active was registered between 900 and 200 ms prior to the onset of the movement. This source of initial activity was mapped by positron emission tomography to the middle frontal gyrus, Brodmann area 9. The three sources subsequently to be active were mapped to the supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, and motor cortex (M1), all in the left hemisphere.
