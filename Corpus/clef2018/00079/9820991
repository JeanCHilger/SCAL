Results of transmyocardial laser revascularization in non-revascularizable coronary artery disease after 3 years follow-up [ssee comments]. Transmyocardial laser revascularization is a new therapeutic option for end-stage coronary artery disease if no other cardiological or cardiosurgical intervention is possible. Data are few on how patients fare after more than 1 year follow-up.From a total of 157 patients who were suggested for transmyocardial laser therapy in the years 1995-1997, 126 were judged to have non-revascularizable coronary artery disease (mean age 61.9 +/- 14 years, 80% men, mean left ventricular ejection fraction 46.2 +/- 17.1%). Sixty-six patients had a good clinical response to intensification of the antianginal therapy and were therefore treated further medically. In 60 patients with refractory angina, sole transmyocardial laser revascularization without cardiopulmonary bypass or additional grafts was performed. The transmyocardial laser revascularization group was 32% female 78.3% patients had had bypass operationsFifty percent of patients with non-revascularizable coronary artery disease submitted for transmyocardial laser revascularization can be stabilized medically. Transmyocardial laser revascularization led to a rapid early relief of symptoms, but with a trend towards worsening over time and showed a high peri-operative risk (> 10%) dependent on the pre-operative ejection fraction. Our data were in contrast to other published reports on the more beneficial effects of transmyocardial laser revascularization and should lead to further investigation of this experimental method. Transmyocardial laser revascularization should only be performed after failure of maximal anti-anginal therapy, and should be avoided when the left ventricular ejection fraction is < 40%.
