Usefulness of endocoronary electrocardiogram in the detection of myocardial viability and comparison with single-photon emission computed tomography Tl-201. In 20 patients who had recently had an acute myocardial infarction, we compared endocoronary electrocardiographic modifications recorded during angioplasty with thallium-201 for the detection of myocardial viability. Our data demonstrate that endocoronary electrocardiography can be an easy and reliable tool to assess viability, with sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 100%, 80%, 94%, 100%, respectively.
