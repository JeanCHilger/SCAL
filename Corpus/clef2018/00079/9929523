Improved detection of coronary artery disease by exercise electrocardiography with the use of right precordial leads. Exercise electrocardiography is an perfect test for the detection of coronary artery disease. We attempted to improve the diagnostic accuracy of exercise testing as a noninvasive method for the detection of coronary artery disease by using a combination of the left and right precordial leads.We studied 245 patients (218 men and 27 women) ranging from 32 to 74 years of age (mean [+/-SD], 52+/-8) who underwent treadmill exercise testing, thallium-201 scintigraphy, and coronary arteriography. During exercise testing, each patient had one electrocardiogram recorded with the standard 12 leads and 3 right precordial leads (V3R, V4R, and V5R), with the results for each set of leads recorded and analyzed separately.On the basis of coronary arteriography, 34 patients had normal coronary arteries, 85 had single-vessel disease, 84 had two-vessel disease, and 42 had three-vessel disease. The sensitivities of the standard 12-lead exercise electrocardiogram, exercise electrocardiography incorporating right precordial leads, and thallium-201 scintigraphy were 52 percent, 89 percent, and 87 percent, respectively, for the detection of single-vessel disease 71 percent, 94 percent, and 96 percent for the detection of two-vessel diseaseUse of right precordial leads along with the standard six left precordial leads during exercise electrocardiography greatly improves the sensitivity of exercise testing for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.
