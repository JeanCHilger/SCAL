Enhanced lateral premotor activity during paradoxical gait in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease (PD) patients often show marked improvement of hypokinetic gait when exposed to special stimuli. To investigate physiological mechanisms underlying this "paradoxical gait" induced by visual cues in PD patients, we examined regional cerebral blood flow changes during gait on a treadmill guided by two different visual cues, the lines oriented transversely to the direction of walk (TL) and the lines parallel to it (PL). Ten PD patients and 10 age-matched controls received injections of 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime twice, once during each walking condition. Brain perfusion images were obtained by single-photon emission computed tomography. When affected by TL, PD patients showed marked improvement of gait parameters, mainly reduction of cadence. In regional cerebral blood flow analysis, when TL was compared with PL, both groups had common activation in the posterior parietal cortex and cerebellar hemispheres. Especially in the right lateral premotor cortex, PD patients showed enhanced activation induced by TL to a significantly greater degree than the controls. The present study indicates that the network dedicated to visuomotor control, particularly the lateral premotor cortex, plays an important role in the development of the paradoxical gait induced by special visual stimuli in PD patients.
