Impact of stress single-photon emission computed tomography perfusion imaging on downstream resource utilization. This study shows that in patients with intermediate pretest probability of coronary artery disease stress single-photon emission computed tomography perfusion imaging decreases the rate of coronary angiography and coronary revascularization and is economically a superior strategy to routine coronary angiography.
