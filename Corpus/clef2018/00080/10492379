New insights on flow-independent mechanisms of 99mTc-HMPAO retention in nervous tissue: in vitro study. SPECT using 99mTc-hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) mainly reflects regional cerebral blood flow, however metabolic abnormalities also affect the retention of 99mTc-HMPAO.To rule out any flow factor, a test-tube model was used to evaluate the effects of metabolic alterations both on intracellular trapping of 99mTc-HMPAO and on extracellular glutamate and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) outflow from rat brain slices.Under control conditions, slices took up 7.0%+/-1.4% of 99mTc-HMPAO contained in the medium, whereas prelabeled slices released 10.8%+/-2.6% of their radioactive content glutamate and LDH outflow were 49.1+/-21.6 pmol/mg protein/ min and 4.8+/-0.9 U/L/mg protein/min, respectively. The control medium was altered by adding a metabolic poison (5 mmol/L azide), removing glucose and replacing O2 with N2 to mimic ischemia (in vitro ischemia) and replacing Krebs solution with hypotonic medium to evoke cell lysis. Both azide and in vitro ischemia induced a significant increase in 99mTc-HMPAO release (15.8%+/-3.3% and 18.3%+/-6.2%, respectively), without any modification in LDH efflux. However, only azide reduced the uptake of the tracer. Conversely, glutamate outflow was massive during in vitro ischemia and was far lower during azide treatment. Under hypotonic medium conditions, the release of 99mTc-HMPAO, glutamate and LDH were dramatically increased. Surprisingly, a two-fold increase of 99mTc-HMPAO uptake was also found. When 1 mmol/L glutathione was added to the medium, to convert native lipophilic 99mTc-HMPAO into hydrophilic derivatives, tracer uptake was inhibited both under control and hypotonic medium conditions.This study provides evidence that not only poisoning of the tissue but also in vitro ischemia induced a reduction of 99mTc-HMPAO retention. Moreover, we demonstrated that injuries causing cell membrane disruption led to hyperfixation of 99mTc-HMPAO.
