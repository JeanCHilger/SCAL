Cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid beta-peptide1-42, but not tau have positive correlation with brain glucose metabolism in humans. To address the question of whether assay for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid beta-peptide 1-42 (A(beta)1-42) and tau allow us to monitor the neurodegenerative processes that lead to a progressive and massive death of neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD patients, cerebral glucose metabolism using 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose was quantified by positron emission tomography in fifteen AD patients and nine non-AD patients with defined levels of CSF-A(beta)1-42 and CSF-tau. The CSF-A(beta)1-42 levels, but not the CSF-tau levels, in both AD and non-AD patients consistently and significantly correlated with global and, in particular, temporal lobe glucose metabolism. Results from our study suggest that the CSF-A(beta)1-42 levels may reflect residual brain function and help monitoring progression of dementing disorders.
