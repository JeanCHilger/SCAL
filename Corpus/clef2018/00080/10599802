No evidence of hypoxic tissue on 18F-fluoromisonidazole PET after intracerebral hemorrhage. We studied six patients after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and eight controls using positron emission tomography (PET) with to determine whether a zone of tissue hypoxia, possibly representing "penumbral" tissue, exists surrounding an intracerebral hemorrhage. None of the stroke patients, studied 24 to 43 hours after symptom onset, nor any of the controls exhibited areas of tissue hypoxia on 18F-fluoromisonidazole PET images. These findings may have implications for the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage with neuroprotective strategies.
