Dynamic changes in cerebral glucose metabolism in conscious infant monkeys during the first year of life as measured by positron emission tomography. Recently, advances in spatial resolution have provided the opportunity to utilize positron emission tomography (PET) to examine local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (lCMR(glc)) in large animals noninvasively, thereby allowing repeated lCMR(glc) measurements in the same animal. Previous studies have attempted to describe the ontogeny of cerebral glucose metabolism in anesthetized nonhuman primates using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and PET. However, the use of sedation during the tracer uptake period may influence lCMR(glc). This study was conducted to describe lCMR(glc) in conscious infant vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus) during the first year of life utilizing FDG-PET. Cross-sectional studies (n=23) displayed lowest and highest lCMR(glc) in all structures at the 2-3 and 8-9 month age groups, respectively. The metabolic pattern suggested an increase in lCMR(glc) values between 2 and 8 months of age with decreased metabolism observed at 10-12 months of age in all regions. Peak lCMR(glc) values at 8 months were an average of 84+/-24% higher than values seen at the youngest age examined quantitatively (2-3 months). The regions of greatest and smallest increases in lCMR(glc) at 8 months were the cerebellar hemispheres (90%) and the thalamus (39%), respectively. Longitudinal analysis in 4 animals supported this developmental pattern, demonstrating the ability to detect changes in cerebral glucose metabolism within animals and the potential for FDG-PET in nonhuman primate models of brain maturation. By determining the normative profile of lCMR(glc) during development in monkeys, future application of FDG-PET will provide the opportunity to longitudinally assess the effects of environmental or pharmacological intervention on the immature brain.
