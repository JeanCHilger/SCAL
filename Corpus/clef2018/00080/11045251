Outcome for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients is not predicted by peritoneal permeability characteristics. For the present study, we investigated the peritoneal transport of fluid and solutes and the clinical outcomes of 44 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients with various peritoneal transport characteristics. Based on 24-hour urine and dialysate collections and 4-hour dwell studies [peritoneal equilibration test (PET)], the patients were divided into two transport groups by dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creatinine at 240 minutes (D/PCr240). The groups consisted of 21 high transporters (D/P = 0.81 mean age: 63.9 +/- 8.2 years) and 23 patients of other transport types (D/P < 0.81
