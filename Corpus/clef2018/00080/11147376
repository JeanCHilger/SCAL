The experience of pet ownership as a meaningful occupation. This qualitative study examined the experience of pet ownership in the everyday lives of seven men with human immuno-deficiency virus or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Interviews and field observations were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. The findings demonstrate that the experience of pet ownership is both typical of any pet owner and yet profoundly impacted by the illness of the owners. The results of this preliminary study indicate pet ownership can be a highly valued occupation for some, and thus has implications for occupational therapy intervention.
