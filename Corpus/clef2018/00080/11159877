Gastric distention correlates with activation of multiple cortical and subcortical regions. The pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia may involve abnormal processing of visceral stimuli at the level of the central nervous system. There is accumulating evidence that visceral and somatic pain processing in the brain share common neuronal substrates. However, the cerebral loci that process sensory information from the stomach are unknown. The aim of this study was to localize the human brain regions that are activated by gastric distention.Brain (15)O-water positron emission tomography was performed in 15 right-handed healthy volunteers during baseline and distal gastric distentions to 10 mm Hg, 20 mm Hg, threshold pain, and moderate pain. Pain, nausea, and bloating were rated during baseline and distentions (0-5 scale). Statistical subtraction analysis of brain images was performed between distentions and baseline.Symptoms increased with distending stimulus intensity (maximum pain, 2.1 +/- 0.4 nausea, 2.2 +/- 0.4Symptomatic gastric distention activates structures implicated in somatic pain processing, supporting the notion of a common cerebral pain network.
