Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of the dopamine transporter ligand. 18F-labeled 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-(-2-fluoroethyl)nortropane ([18F]FECNT) is a recently developed dopamine transporter ligand with potential applications in patients with Parkinson's disease and cocaine addiction.Estimates of the effective dose equivalent and doses for specific organs were made using biodistribution data from 16 Sprague-Dawley rats and nine rhesus monkeys. PET images from two rhesus monkeys were used to calculate the residence time for the basal ganglia. The computer program MIRDOSE3 was used to calculate the dosimetry according to the methodology recommended by MIRD.The basal ganglia were the targeted tissues receiving the highest dose, 0.11 mGy/MBq (0.39 rad/mCi). The effective dose equivalent was 0.018 mSv/MBq (0.065 rem/mCi), and the effective dose was 0.016 mSv/MBq (0.058 rem/mCi).Our data show that a 185-MBq (5-mCi) injection of [18F]FECNT leads to an estimated effective dose of 3 mSv (0.3 rem) and an estimated dose to the target organ or tissue of 19.4 mGy (1.93 rad).
