Optimal dosing with risperidone: updated recommendations. Drug dosages utilized during controlled clinical trials are not always optimal for patients encountered in day-to-day practice. The original trials of risperidone, a novel antipsychotic, suggested that an initial target dose of 6 mg/day was appropriate, but these trials were necessarily conducted among patients who were chronically impaired, hospitalized, and often partly drug resistant.Relevant data relating to the dosage of risperidone identified through an online (MEDLINE) search using the keywords risperidone, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder dementia, bipolar disorder, and dose were supplemented by a review of international and U.S. Congress abstracts in which the dose of risperidone was specifically described.On the basis of naturalistic studies, clinical audit, phase 4 trials, positron emission tomography data, and 5 years of clinical experience, the currently recommended target dose of risperidone is 4 mg/day for most patients, with less-rapid titration than previously recommended. Moreover, a lower dose than this and slower titration may be appropriate for elderly patients, young patients, and first-episode patients.
