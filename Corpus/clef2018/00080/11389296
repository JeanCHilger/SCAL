Contribution of residential exposures to asthma in us children and adolescents. Residential exposures are recognized risk factors for asthma, but the relative contribution of specific indoor allergens and their overall contribution to asthma among older children and adolescents in the United States are unknown.To estimate the relative contributions, population-attributable risks, and costs of residential risk factors for doctor-diagnosed asthma. Design. Nationally representative, cross-sectional survey conducted from 1988 to 1994.A total of 5384 children who were 6 to 16 years old and participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, a survey of the health and nutritional status of children and adults in the United States.Doctor-diagnosed asthma, as reported by the parent.Five hundred three of 5384 children and adolescents (11.4%) had doctor-diagnosed asthma.
