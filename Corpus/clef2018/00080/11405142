Diagnosis of questionable mandibular infiltration by squamous epithelial carcinomas. 3-D 99mTc-DPD SPECT reconstruction and (18F) fluoride PET study: diagnostic advantages or unnecessary expense?. A prospective study was designed to compare computer-aided 3D 99mTc-DPD SPECT reconstruction, conventional 99mTc-DPD SPECT investigation (n = 88) and flurine-18 PET (n = 10) in the assessment of mandibular bone invasion by SCC.Between 10/97 and 03/00 88 patients with SCC of the mandibular region were enrolled in this study. In 50 cases mandibular resection (segmental or marginal) was performed basing on the pretherapeutic diagnostic results.No differences could be found between 3D 99mTc-DPD SPECT reconstruction and conventional 99mTc-DPD SPECT investigation. Both techniques revealed the same high sensitivity (100%) and the same specificity of 91.6 (efficiency 95.4%). Flurine-18 PET showed a sensitivity of 100%, but specificity only reached 50% (efficiency 60.0%).This investigation does not provide evidence that the financial and time consuming techniques of computer-aided 3D 99mTc-DPD SPECT reconstruction and flurine-18 PET show advantages compared to conventional 99mTc-DPD SPECT investigation in the assessment of mandibular invasion by SCC.
