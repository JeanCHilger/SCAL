Development of a Tc-99m labeled sigma-2 receptor-specific ligand as a potential breast tumor imaging agent. A novel in vivo imaging agent, 99mTc labeled [(N-[2-((3'-N'-propyl-[3,3,1]aza-bicyclononan-3alpha-yl)(2"-methoxy-5-methyl-phenylcarbamate)(2-mercaptoethyl)amino)acetyl]-2-aminoethanethiolato] technetium(V) oxide), [99mTc]2, displaying specific binding towards sigma-2 receptors was prepared and characterized. In vitro binding assays showed that the rhenium surrogate of [99mTc]2, Re-2, displayed excellent binding affinity and selectivity towards sigma-2 receptors (K(i) = 2,723 and 22 nM for sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptor, respectively). Preparation of [99mTc]2 was achieved by heating the S-protected starting material, 1, in the presence of acid, reducing agent (stannous glucoheptonate) and sodium [99mTc]pertechnetate. The lipophilic racemic mixture was successfully prepared in 10 to 50% yield and the radiochemical purity was >98%. Separation of the isomers, peak A and peak B, was successfully achieved by using a chiralpak AD column eluted with an isocratic solvent (n-hexane/isopropanol 3:1
