Effects of feeding regimens on bodyweight, composition and condition score in cats following ovariohysterectomy. The effects of ovariohysterectomy on bodyweight, composition and condition score were evaluated in 49 cats that were fed ad libitum and 11 cats that had their food allowances controlled with the aim of maintaining a stable bodyweight. In cats fed ad libitum, bodyweight increased by an average of 31 per cent in the 12 months following ovariohysterectomy compared with 3.1 per cent over the 12 months before surgery, and this was largely due to increased body fat content. There was no difference in weight gain between cats fed dry or canned foods, but weight gain was inversely related to age and bodyweight at the time of neutering. Mean bodyweight increased by 7.5 per cent in the controlled feeding group, compared with 3.6 per cent over the 12 months before surgery, and individual bodyweights were maintained to within 10 per cent of pre-neutering values in nine cats. The other two cats experienced substantial weight gain (+20 per cent and +36 per cent), despite being fed only 40 kcal/kg/day. There were no significant changes in body composition of cats with controlled dietary allowances and their condition scores were significantly lower than those of cats fed ad libitum. The results confirm a link between ovariohysterectomy and the development of obesity in cats with free access to food, and indicate that substantial reductions in energy intake are required to prevent weight gain in such cats.
