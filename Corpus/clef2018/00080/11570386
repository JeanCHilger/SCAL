Prevalence of odontoclastic resorptive lesions in a population of clinically healthy cats. The prevalence of odontoclastic resorptive lesions (ORLs) was determined in a clinically healthy cat population (228 cats) using both clinical (oral examination) and radiographic (full-mouth series with intraorally positioned dental film) methods. The overall prevalence rate was 29 per cent (mean age of the cat population 4.9 years). The mandibular third premolars (307, 407) were the most commonly affected tooth and the pattern of ORL development was symmetrical in most cats. The risk of having ORLs was found to increase with increasing age and cats with clinically and radiographically missing teeth were more likely to have the condition. Neutering, gender, age at neutering or mean whole mouth gingivitis index did not affect the prevalence of ORLs.
