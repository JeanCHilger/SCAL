99mTc-MIBI stress-rest myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in patients with complete left bundle branch block. Patients with complete left bundle branch block (LBBB) often show a false-positive ischaemic pattern in the interventricular septum on thallium-201 (201TI) stress-rest myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. Equivocal results have been reported with technetium-99m labelled hexakis-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) in such patients. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the effect of LBBB on the septal uptake of 99mTc-MIBI during stress-rest single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scintigraphy.We studied 75 consecutive patients with LBBB, referred for 99mTc-MIBI stress-rest SPECT. Studies were evaluated by visual analysis using a semi-quantitative grading technique. In all patients with abnormal septal segments, the presence or absence of ischaemic heart disease was confirmed either clinically or by means of angiographical examination.Forty-three patients (57.3%) had completely normal studies. Only 15 (20%) had septal abnormalities (11 with reversible and 4 with fixed defects), while 17 patients (22.7% had abnormal segments in areas other than the interventricular septum. Except for 1 patient lost to follow-up, ischaemic heart disease was confirmed in all the patients with septal changes.We conclude that 99mTc-MIBI is more specific than 201TI for identifying ischaemic heart disease in the presence of LBBB.
