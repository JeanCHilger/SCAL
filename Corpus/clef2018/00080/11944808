Prevalence of Bartonella infection in domestic cats in Denmark. Whole blood and serum from 93 cats (44 pets and 49 shelter/stray cats) from Denmark were tested for the presence of feline Bartonella species by culture and for the presence of Bartonella antibodies by serology. Bartonella henselae was isolated from 21 (22.6%) cats. Bacteremia prevalence was not statistically different between shelter/stray cats (13/49, 26.5%) and pet cats (8/44, 18.2%), but varied widely by geographical origin of the cats, even after stratification for cat origin or age (p < 0.001). All isolates but one were B. henselae type II. The only cat bacteremic with B. henselae type I was not co-infected with B. henselae type II. None of the cats was harboring either B. clarridgeiae or B. koehlerae. Almost half (42/92, 45.6%) of the cats were seropositive for B. henselae and antibody prevalence was similar in shelter/stray cats (23/49, 46.9%) and pet cats (19/43, 44.2%). This is the first report of isolation of B. henselae from domestic cats in Denmark. This study also indicates that domestic cats, including pet cats, constitute a large Bartonella reservoir in Denmark.
