(11)C] Carbon monoxide in selenium-mediated synthesis of (11)C-carbamoyl compound. Using either amines, amino alcohols, or alcohols in selenium-mediated synthesis with [(11)C]carbon monoxide, 3 ureas, 6 carbamates, and 1 carbonate were labeled. Tetrabutylammonium fluoride ((TBA)F) was discovered to form a soluble and reactive complex with selenium and drastically increase the radiochemical yields. Of the selected carbamoyl compounds, one was a receptor ligand, one was an enzyme inhibitor, and one was a muscular relaxant pharmaceutical. The (11)C-target compounds were obtained in radiochemical yields ranging from low to almost quantitative and with specific radioactivity up to 1300 GBq/micromol. The radiochemical purity of the final products exceeded 98%. In one case, the corresponding (13)C-substituted compound was produced to verify the position of the (11)C-label. In a typical experiment starting with 16.4 GBq [(11)C]carbon monoxide, 7.0 GBq of LC-purified 5-phenyl-1,3-oxazolidin-[2-(11)C]-2-one was obtained within 20 min from start of the carbonylation reaction (84% decay-corrected radiochemical yield). The presented approach is an interesting alternative to the use of [(11)C]phosgene in labeling chemistry.
