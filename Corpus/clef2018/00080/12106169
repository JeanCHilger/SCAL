Changes in Regional Cerebral Oxidative Metabolism Induced by Tactile Learning and Recognition in Man. We measured the regional cerebral oxidative metabolism (rCMRO2) with positron emission tomography in normal healthy volunteers in three different stages: rest, tactile learning, and tactile recognition of complicated geometrical objects. The frequency of manipulatory movements during tactile recognition was twice that of tactile learning. Tactile recognition with the right hand increased rCMRO2 in six prefrontal cortical areas, bilaterally in the supplementary motor areas, the premotor areas and supplementary sensory areas, in the left primary motor and primary sensory area, in the left anterior superior parietal lobule, bilaterally in the secondary somatosensory area, the anterior insula, lingual gyri, hippocampus, basal ganglia, anterior parasagittal cerebellum, and lobus posterior cerebelli. These structures have in other studies been found to participate in manipulatory movements and analysis of somatosensory information. Tactile learning increased rCMRO2 in the same structures as did tactile recognition. Thus we found no differences in the anatomical structures participating in storage and retrieval. However the rCMRO2 increases in the left premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, and left somatosensory hand area were larger during tactile recognition in accordance with the higher frequency of manipulatory movements and higher flux of somatosensory information from the periphery during recognition. Despite this the rCMRO2 was significantly higher in the neocerebellar cortex during tactile learning. Since there were no learning effects on the manipulatory movements, this extra metabolic activity in the lateral cerebellum was attributed to energy demanding processes associated with climbing fibre activity during storage of somatosensory information.
