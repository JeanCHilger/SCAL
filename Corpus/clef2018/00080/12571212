11C-acetate PET imaging in hepatocellular carcinoma and other liver masses. It is well known that (18)F-FDG PET has a high average false-negative rate of 40%-50% in the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This is not an acceptable accuracy, particularly in countries where this tumor is prevalent. In this study, we evaluated prospectively the characteristics of (11)C-acetate and (18)F-FDG metabolism in HCC and other liver masses.Fifty-seven patients were recruited into this study, with masses consisting of 39 HCC 3 cholangiocarcinomasIn the subgroup of HCC patients with the number of lesions < or = 3 (32 patients 55 lesions(11)C-Acetate has a high sensitivity and specificity as a radiotracer complementary to (18)F-FDG in PET imaging of HCC and evaluation of other liver masses.
