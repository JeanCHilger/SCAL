Imaging of neurotransmitter receptors in the living human brain by positron emission tomography (PET). More than 30 receptors or subtypes will be investigated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders using PET in the near future. However, the data obtained by PET should be carefully evaluated, because the PET method is based on the ligand-receptor binding in vivo. Extensive studies on animals and autopsied human brain samples are important to assess the significance of the findings revealed by PET technique to substantiate its validity.
