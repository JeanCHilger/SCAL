Risk factor analysis and relative supersaturation as tools for identifying calcium oxalate stone-forming dogs. Twenty-four hour urine samples were collected from 17 calcium oxalate (CaOx) stone-forming (SF) dogs and 17 normal (N), age-, breed- and sex-matched dogs. Urinary CaOx relative supersaturation (RSS) was calculated and found to be significantly higher in the SF group than the N group. RSS measurement is not readily applicable to veterinary practice thus, alternatives were explored. Discriminant analysis failed to identify key factors differentiating most SF from N dogs. Urinary calcium, oxalate and uric acid, which differed between the SF and N animals, were combined into a measure of relative probability of CaOx stone formation (PSF) to establish whether this approach could be used to assess the risk of CaOx stone formation in dogs. Although there was good correlation between the techniques, RSS more clearly discriminated between SF and N dogs. These data suggest that neither PSF nor discriminant analysis is preferable to RSS for assessing the risk of CaOx stone formation in dogs.
