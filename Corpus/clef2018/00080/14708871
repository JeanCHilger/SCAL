Pathophysiology and functional consequences of human partial epilepsy: lessons from positron emission tomography studies. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful clinical and research tool that, in the past two decades, has provided a great amount of novel data on the pathophysiology and functional consequences of human epilepsy. PET studies revealed cortical and subcortical brain dysfunction of a widespread brain circuitry, providing an unprecedented insight in the complex functional abnormalities of the epileptic brain. Correlation of metabolic and neuroreceptor PET abnormalities with electroclinical variables helped identify parts of this circuitry, some of which are directly related to primary epileptogenesis, while others, adjacent to or remote from the primary epileptic focus, may be secondary to longstanding epilepsy. PET studies have also provided detailed data on the functional anatomy of cognitive and behavioral abnormalities associated with epilepsy. PET, along with other neuroimaging modalities, can measure longitudinal changes in brain function attributed to chronic seizures as well as therapeutic interventions. This review demonstrates how development of more specific PET tracers and application of multimodality imaging by combining structural and functional neuroimaging with electrophysiological data can further improve our understanding of human partial epilepsy, and helps more effective application of PET in presurgical evaluation of patients with intractable seizures.
