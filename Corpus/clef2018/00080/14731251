Correlation between laser Doppler perfusion imaging and visual scoring of patch test sites in subjects with experimentally induced allergic and irritant contact reactions. To compare laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) measurements in experimentally induced allergic contact reactions and irritant contact reactions. The degree of correlation between visual scores and LDPI measurements was also studied.Fifteen patients with known contact allergy to nickel or fragrance were patch tested with nickel sulfate 5% pet., fragrance mix 8% pet., sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) 0.5% pet., SLS 1.0% pet. and two empty control chambers. Visual readings and LDPI measurements were taken at 0, 48 and 96 h.There was a positive correlation between visual scores and LDPI measurement in the nickel sulfate and fragrance mix patch test sites. However, no correlation between visual scores and LDPI measurements was seen in the SLS 0.5% and SLS 1.0% patch test sites. There was no significant difference (P=0.125) in LDPI measurements between contact-allergic reactions and contact-irritant reactions.LDPI correlates with visual scoring in contact-allergic reactions, but not in irritant reactions. LDPI is not useful in distinguishing between allergic and irritant reactions.
