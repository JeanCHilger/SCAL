Factors affecting the serological response of dogs and cats to rabies vaccination. After being vaccinated against rabies some cats and dogs fail to show an antibody titre adequate to meet the requirements of the UK Pet Travel Scheme. To investigate this problem, the data derived from 16,073 serum samples submitted to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency for serological testing between 1999 and 2002, 1002 samples submitted to BioBest during March and April 2001, and 1264 samples associated with one make of vaccine submitted to BioBest between June 2001 and January 2003, were analysed. The probability of antibody titre failing to reach at least 0.5 iu/ml was analysed by logistic regression as a function of the choice of vaccine, the interval between vaccination and sampling, the sex and age of the animal, and its country of origin. In dogs, all these factors, except sex, had highly significant (P < 0.001) effects on the test failure rate, and in cats all the factors had a significant effect (P < 0.05).
