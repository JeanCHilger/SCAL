Positron emission tomography with F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose in a combined staging strategy of esophageal cancer prevents unnecessary surgical explorations. Distant metastases or local invasion are frequently found during the explorative phase of surgery for esophageal cancer. This study was performed to determine the rate of patients with incurable disease encountered during exploration and to examine the impact of preoperative staging, including positron emission tomography (PET), on the number of unnecessary explorations. The records of 203 patients with esophageal cancer who were eligible for curative resection were retrospectively reviewed. The surgical reports were analyzed to obtain the reasons for abandoning resection. Furthermore, the different staging modalities according to the related time interval were reviewed for each patient to analyze the influence of them on the number of explorations. After exploratory surgery, resection was abandoned in 78 of the 203 patients (38%) because of distant metastases (n=59 29%), metastatic spread and local irresectability (n=5
