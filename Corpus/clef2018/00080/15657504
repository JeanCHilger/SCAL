Illustrations of abdominal abnormalities on 99mTc tetrofosmin gated cardiac SPECT. 99mTc tetrofosmin is predominantly cleared by the hepatobiliary system and its scan is analogous to a cholescintigraphy. The radiopharmaceutical may be localized in the bone marrow. During cardiac acquisition, when the area being viewed includes the lower thorax and abdomen, abnormalities of the liver, gallbladder and kidneys, and the radioactivity in the oesophagus, stomach and bowel, as well as bone marrow uptake, can be depicted by routine raw data cine images. Excluding the intrathoracic abnormalities, these abdominal abnormalities are illustrated in this paper.Retrospectively, we reviewed the raw data cine images from 566 patients. These images were 180 degrees or 360 degrees rotation and showed the abdominal organs and thoracic cage, including the ribs, sternum and spine. We found 234 abnormalities, which were correlated with radiography, laboratory and clinical findings.Intra-abdominal abnormalities included bone marrow visualization, 93 occurrences (39.7%) duodeno-gastric (DG) and entero-gastric (EG) reflux, 47 (20.1%)(1) The bone marrow uptake of the vertebrae accounts for almost 40% of the abdominal abnormalities, and is usually concordant with anaemia (2) DG and EG refluxes represent 20% of abdominal abnormalities
