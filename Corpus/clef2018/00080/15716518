Degree of inhibition of cortical acetylcholinesterase activity and cognitive effects by donepezil treatment in Alzheimer's disease. To determine in vivo cortical acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and cognitive effects in subjects with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 14) prior to and after 12 weeks of donepezil therapy.Cognitive and N-[(11)C]methyl-piperidin-4-yl propionate ([(11)C]PMP) AChE positron emission tomography (PET) assessments before and after donepezil therapy.Analysis of the PET data revealed mean (temporal, parietal, and frontal) cortical donepezil induced AChE inhibition of 19.1% (SD 9.4%) (t = -7.9 p<0.0001). Enzyme inhibition was most robust in the anterior cingulate cortex (24.2% (6.9%), t = -14.1Donepezil induced inhibition of cortical AChE enzyme activity is modest in patients with mild AD. The degree of cortical enzyme inhibition correlates with changes in executive and attentional functions.
