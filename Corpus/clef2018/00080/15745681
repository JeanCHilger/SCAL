Correlation of hematologic parameters with bone marrow and spleen uptake in FDG PET. To assess the relationship between various hematologic parameters and bone marrow (BM) and splenic uptake of FDG in PET imaging.29 patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) referred for baseline FDG PET imaging before treatment and without evidence of bone marrow (BM) involvement were included in the study. Splenic uptake also was analyzed in 18 patients without splenic involvement. BM and splenic activity were visually graded on a 3 point scale. Activity pattern was classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous. Semi-quantitative analysis was also performed by drawing regions of interest (ROI) over the spine and spleen. ROIs also were drawn over right lung and liver. FDG uptake ratios for the spine and spleen in comparison with the lung and liver were generated. Visual scoring of marrow and splenic uptake, and the various ratios were correlated with hemoglobin (Hb), white blood cell (WBC), and platelet counts, and correlation coefficients were calculated.In 27/29 patients (93 %) BM and in 18/18 patients (100 %) spleen uptake was diffuse. There was a direct correlation between BM and spleen uptake of FDG with increasing WBC, which was stronger than the inverse correlation seen with Hb (the lower the Hb the greater the uptake). Correlation with platelet counts was weaker.There is a correlation between hematologic parameters such as Hb, WBC and platelet counts and the uptake of FDG in BM and spleen in PET imaging. Knowledge of this correlation should help to better interpret and understand PET imaging.
