Impact of positron emission tomography with FDG-PET in treatment of patients with suspected recurrent ovarian cancer. Recurrent ovarian cancer is a major problem and an accurate diagnosis can often change patients' management. This study aimed to assess the impact on management of FDG-PET in recurrent ovarian cancer.Forty-three patients in whom FDG-PET scan was performed due to suspected recurrent ovarian cancer were included. FDG-PET results were confirmed by histopathology and clinical follow-up of at least 12 months. To assess impact on management the treatment plan based on conventional imaging methods was compared with the treatment plan based on inclusion of PET findings, classifying FDG-PET impact on management as high, medium, low or no impact. Management changes, when present, were classified as intermodality or intramodality.FDG-PET had a high impact on therapeutic management in 28 patients (65.1 %), medium impact in 2 patients (4.6 %), low impact in 9 patients (20.9 %), and no impact in 4 patients (9.3 %). FDG-PET induced an intermodality change in management in 27 patients (62,8 %) intramodality changes were induced in 3 patients (7 %). Finally, it produced no treatment changes in 13 patients (30.2 %).FDG-PET supplied additional information when compared to conventional diagnostic procedures and allowed adequate management changes in most patients.
