First-trimester NRBC count in maternal circulation: correlation with doppler ultrasound studies. This study aimed to determine whether the number of nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) in maternal circulation during the first trimester of pregnancy could identify pregnancies that will have an anomalous Doppler in the second trimester. A total of 85 blood samples were obtained at 11-14 weeks of gestation with mean uterine arterial perfusion index >1.6, as noted by Doppler ultrasonography. NRBCs were enriched by magnetic automated cell sorting using anti-CD71 and were stained with May/Grunwald/Giemsa. A total of 4.8 NRBCs (range 1-75) were identified in 68 cases. Follow-up scans at 22-24 weeks were available in 46 cases. In 39 women, blood flow in the uterine arteries normalized, whereas in seven, high resistance was noted. One woman in the high-resistance group developed preeclampsia (PET four NRBCs) and another delivered an intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) baby (75 NRBCs). The number of NRBCs in women whose Doppler indices later normalized and in those who continued to have increased impedance was similar. The study indicates that NRBC number in maternal circulation during the first trimester cannot be used to screen pregnancies at high risk for developing preeclampsia (PET)/IUGR. High-impedance blood flow in the uterine arteries in the first trimester may be due to an unfinished process of trophoblastic invasion, most likely to be completed successfully by 22-24 weeks.
