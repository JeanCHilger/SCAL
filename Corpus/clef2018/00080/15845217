Clinical and histological features of multiple meningiomas compared with solitary meningiomas. Between 1991 and 2002, 456 patients with an intracranial meningioma were treated. Thirty-nine of these had more than one meningioma (8.6%). The mean age was 58 years (27-85 years). Sex distribution was 8.8:1 (35 female, four male). There was no associated spinal meningioma. No patient had neurofibromatosis. In 19 patients all meningiomas were removed. Twelve showed the same histology, seven had different histological features. In the remaining 20 patients only the symptomatic meningioma was removed. Recurrences occurred in 11 patients (28.2%). Six patients died during follow-up. Multiple meningiomas have their own clinical features. Besides a high female preponderance, PR expression was stronger in multiple meningiomas than in solitary meningiomas while p53 status and MIB-1 LI were similar between the two groups. Progesterone receptor, p53 status and MIB-1 LI were valuable markers for predicting a patient's outcome in multiple meningiomas. The number of meningiomas is growing in patients with recurrent meningiomas.
