Visualization of brainstem perfusion using a high spatial resolution SPECT system. The authors explored the high spatial resolution of a three-head rotating SPECT system, equipped with lead super-fine fanbeam collimator. The brainstem was high-lighted in a three-dimensional reconstruction, showing perfusion small structures such as mesencephalon, pons, and medulla oblongata. The visualization of brainstem perfusion sets new landmarks in functional neuroimaging and, moreover, was obtained with a commercially available three-head SPECT system.
