A new data consistency condition for fan-beam projection data. The sum of all attenuation data acquired in one view of parallel-beam projections is a view angle independent constant. This fact is known as a data consistency condition on the two-dimensional Radon transforms. It plays an important role in tomographic image reconstruction and artifact correction. In this paper, a novel fan-beam data consistency condition (FDCC) is derived and presented. Using the FDCC, individual projection data in one view of fan-beam projections can be estimated from filtering all other projection data measured from different view angles. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the new FDCC in correcting ring artifacts caused by malfunctioning detector cells.
