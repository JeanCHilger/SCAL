Ghrelin does not influence gastric emptying in obese subjects. To evaluate the relationship between fasting plasma concentrations of ghrelin and gastric emptying in obese individuals compared with lean subjects.We included 20 obese patients (9 men and 11 women, BMI > 30 kg/m2) and 16 nonobese control subjects (7 men and 9 women, BMI < or = 25 kg/m2). Gastric emptying of solids (egg sandwich labeled with radionuclide) was measured at 120 minutes with (99m)Tc-single photon emission computed tomography imaging. Ghrelin and leptin were analyzed by radioimmunoassay and ELISA methods, respectively.The gastric half-emptying time was similar in obese men and women (67.8 +/- 14.79 vs. 66.6 +/- 13.56 minutes) but significantly shorter (p < 0.001) than in the control population (men: 88.09 +/- 11.72 minutes women: 97.25 +/- 10.31 minutes). Ghrelin levels were significantly lower in obese subjects (131.37 +/- 47.67 vs. 306.3 +/- 45.52 pg/mLThis report shows that, in humans, gastric emptying is faster in obese subjects than in lean controls and that, whereas ghrelin is the best determinant of gastric kinetics in healthy controls, this action is lost in obesity.
