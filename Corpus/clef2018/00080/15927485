Material-specific lateralization of memory encoding in the medial temporal lobe: blocked versus event-related design. Lesion-deficit studies have provided evidence for a functional dissociation between the left medial temporal lobe (MTL) mediating verbal memory encoding and right MTL mediating non-verbal memory encoding. While a small number of functional MRI studies have demonstrated similar findings, none has looked specifically for material-specific lateralization using subsequent memory effects. In addition, in many fMRI studies, encoding activity has been located in posterior MTL structures, at odds with lesion-deficit and positron emission tomography (PET) evidence. In this study, we used an event-related fMRI memory encoding paradigm to demonstrate a material-specific lateralization of encoding in the medial temporal lobes of ten healthy control subjects. Activation was left-lateralized for word encoding, bilateral for picture encoding, and right-lateralized for face encoding. Secondly, we demonstrated the locations of activations revealed using an event-related analysis to be more anterior than those revealed using a blocked analysis of the same data. This suggests that anterior MTL structures underlie memory encoding as judged by subsequent memory effects, and that more posterior activity detected in other fMRI studies is related to deficiencies of blocked designs in the analysis of memory encoding.
