Biomimetic synthesis silver crystallite by peptide AYSSGAPPMPPF immobilized on PET film in vitro. AG3 (AYSSGAPPMPPF) is an inorganic-binding peptide that specifically and selectively binds to silver demonstrated by phage display library according to the Stone group. In our experiment, synthesized silver-binding peptide AG3 was immobilized on the surface of protonated poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film which was prepared for biomimetic synthesis silver particles in vitro. Silver crystallites formatted on the surface of AG3-PET film showed various shapes and was 1-4 microm in size. In addition to hexagonal and triangular crystallite, a silver crystallite presents a cubical shape that has seldom been reported in the literatures so far. With comparison of the control and silver nitrate salt, the surface energy of the silver particles on AG3-PET film surface XPS analysis suggested that Ag+ was being reduced to Ag0 in the reaction. Moreover, CD spectrum revealed that the secondary structure of AG3 peptide in solution had a little change before and after binding silver.
