Different concentrations of various radiopharmaceuticals in the two main liver lobes: a preliminary study in clinical patients. At clinical scintigraphic examinations of the abdomen using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), we have observed a different distribution between the left and right main liver lobes of various radiopharmaceuticals. This was studied retrospectively in clinical patients.Examinations with [123I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine MIBG (n=19), a 99mTc-labelled monoclonal antibody against granulocytes (n=18), and 111In-pentetreotide (n=26) were assessed. There was no known history of, or risk factor for liver disease, and all lobes showed a uniform activity distribution. Twenty healthy volunteers underwent consecutive examinations with 99mTc-dimethyliminodiacetic acid (HIDA). The activity ratios between the left and right main liver lobes were calculated from the transverse tomographic (SPECT) sections.The left: right lobar activity ratio for [123I]-MIBG was (mean+/-SD) 1.25+/-0.21 (null hypothesis=1.00 P<0.001)The differences in tracer uptake between the liver lobes cannot be caused only by differences in blood flow. One explanation of the higher uptake of [123I]-MIBG by the left lobe may be a greater presence of catecholamines and a higher sympathetic nerve density in this liver portion. Consequently, there may be a functional difference between the two main liver lobes.
