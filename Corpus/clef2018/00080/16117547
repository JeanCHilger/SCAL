Transfer of amido groups from isolated rhodium(I) amides to alkenes and vinylarenes. The reaction of monomeric and dimeric rhodium(I) amido complexes with unactivated olefins to generate imines is reported. Transamination of {(PEt(3))(2)RhN(SiMePh(2))(2)} (1a) or its -N(SiMe(3))(2) analogue 1b with p-toluidine gave the dimeric [(PEt(3))(2)Rh(mu-NHAr)](2) (Ar = p-tolyl) (2a) in 80% isolated yield. Reaction of 2a with PEt(3) generated the monomeric (PEt(3))(3)Rh(NHAr) (Ar = p-tolyl) (3a). PEt(3)-ligated arylamides 2a and 3a reacted with styrene to transfer the amido group to the olefin and to form the ketimine Ph(Me)C=N(p-tol) (4a) in 48-95% yields. The dinuclear amido hydride (PEt(3))(4)Rh(2)(mu-NHAr)(mu-H) (Ar = p-tolyl) (5a) was formed from reaction of 2a in 95% yield, and a mixture of this dimeric species and the (PEt(3))(n)RhH complexes with n = 3 and 4 was formed from reaction of 3a in a combined 75% yield. Propene reacted with 2a to give Me(2)C=N(p-tol) (4b) and 5a in 90 and 57% yields. Propene also reacted with 3a to give 4b and 5a in 65 and 94% yields. Analogues of 2a and 3a with varied electronic properties also reacted with styrene to form the corresponding imines, and moderately faster rates were observed for reactions of electron-rich arylamides. Kinetic studies of the reaction of 3a with styrene were most consistent with formation of the imine by migratory insertion of olefin into the rhodium-amide bond to generate an aminoalkyl intermediate that undergoes beta-hydrogen elimination to generate a rhodium hydride and an enamine that tautomerizes to the imine.
