The role of 99mTc-ciprofloxacin scan in infection imaging. In this article there is an attempt, to critically review the literature referring to the clinical validity and clinical applications of in vivo imaging of infected areas of our body, with 99mTc-ciprofloxacin (infection). Infection is the product of labeling a broad spectrum antibiotic, ciprofloxacin, with 99mTc. There is increased interest and expectation that this agent will become a useful tool for every day clinical practice, in discriminating, infectious from inflammatory lesions. Although this radiopharmaceutical is not widely available, a number of papers have been published recently regarding clinical and experimental trials with this agent. There is some debate regarding its production procedure and its specificity in discriminating infection from inflammation. Comparison with other infection-imaging agents is described, as well as its clinical validity in specific clinical situations.
