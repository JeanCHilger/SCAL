Arylfluoroborates and alkylfluorosilicates as potential PET imaging agents: high-yielding aqueous biomolecular 18F-labeling. Organometalloid compositions of silicon and boron permit rapid, high-yielding, one-step radiolabeling of a covalently linked protein ligand (biotin) under aqueous conditions to give the corresponding alkyltetrafluorosilicates and aryltrifluoroborate salts. Biotin was chosen as a test ligand for protein targeting because of its quantitative interaction with avidin, which in turn allowed us to calculate fluoridation yields that approach 80-100%. The silicate was found to be moderately stable to hydrolysis, whereas the borate appears to be so stable that its hydrolytic decomposition was not readily measured. With the stability of both compounds ascertained, this work describes a novel and robust radiolabeling method that may find use in the development of positron emission tomography radiopharmaceuticals.
