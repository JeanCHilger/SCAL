Speedup OS-EM Image Reconstruction by PC Graphics Card Technologies for Quantitative SPECT with Varying Focal-Length Fan-Beam Collimation. In the paper, we present a new hardware acceleration method to speedup the ordered-subsets expectation-maximization (OS-EM) algorithm for quantitative SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) image reconstruction with varying focal-length fan-beam (VFF) collimation. By utilizing the geometrical symmetry of VFF point-spread function (PSF), compensation for object-specific attenuation and system-specific PSF are accelerated using currently available PC video/graphics card technologies. A ten-fold acceleration of quantitative SPECT reconstruction is achieved.
