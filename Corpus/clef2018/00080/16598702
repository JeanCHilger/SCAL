Age and APOE-epsilon4 genotype influence the effect of physostigmine infusion on the in-vivo distribution volume of the muscarinic-2-receptor dependent tracer [18F]FP-TZTP. The apolipoprotein E-epsilon4 allele (APOE-epsilon4) confers greater susceptibility to age-related memory disorders. Abnormalities in the cholinergic system are likely contributors to these disorders with both age and APOE-epsilon4 genotype modifying behavioral and physiological responses to drugs that alter cholinergic pathway function. Recently, we reported a greater in vivo distribution volume of the F-18 labeled muscarinic-2 (M2) selective agonist, 3-(3-(3-[18F]Flouropropyl)thio)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine ([18F]FP-TZTP), in aging healthy subjects with an APOE-epsilon4 allele. To examine the effects of aging and the APOE-epsilon4 allele on the response of the muscarinic component of cholinergic pathway to pharmacologic augmentation, two [18F]FP-TZTP PET scans were conducted in 19 subjects varying in age from 22 to 74 years, the first served as baseline for the second scan that was performed while the subjects were either infused with saline (n = 6) or with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (6 with an APOE-epsilon4 allele and 7 without an APOE-epsilon4 allele). Using a multiple regression analysis, both AGE (beta = 0.621 +/- 0.135, B = 0.353 +/- 0.077, t(10) = 4.61, P < 0.001) and APOE-epsilon4 genotype (beta = 0.742, B = 14.8 +/- 2.69, t(10) = 5.51, P < 0.0003) were found to be significant contributors to subject response to physostigmine. The adjusted R2 for the model as a whole was 0.786 (F(2,10) = 23.00, P < 0.0002) with both increasing age and the presence of the APOE-epsilon4 allele modifying the response to physostigmine in the direction of larger decreases in [18F]FP-TZTP distribution volumes in all brain regions examined. The findings, particularly the absence of an interaction between AGE and APOE-epsilon4 genotype, contribute to the growing body of evidence that suggests that the APOE-epsilon4 genotype is likely to contribute to brain structure and function prior to aging.
