Electron- and positron-emitting radiolanthanides for therapy: aspects of dosimetry and production. All lanthanides have similar chemical properties regarding labeling. Therefore, radiolanthanides that have been used for therapy, such as (153)Sm and (177)Lu, might easily be replaced with other radiolanthanides. The aim of this work was to investigate the suitability of electron- and positron-emitting radiolanthanides for radionuclide therapy with reference to dosimetry and production possibilities.Radiolanthanides with half-lives of 1 h to 15 d, stable or long-lived daughters, and limited photon emission were selected. The ratio of the absorbed dose rate to the tumors and the normal tissue (TND) was calculated for different tumor sizes and compared with the TND values for (90)Y and (131)I. The normal tissue and tumors were simulated as an ellipsoid and spheres, respectively. The TND values depend on the physical parameters of the radionuclides, the tumor size, and the ratio between the activity concentrations in the tumor and normal tissue (TNC).(153)Sm, (161)Tb, (169)Er, (175)Yb, and (177)Lu had the highest TND values for most of the tumor sizes studied. Among these radiolanthanides, (161)Tb and (177)Lu are the only ones that can be produced no-carrier-added (nca) and with high specific activities. The Auger-electron emitters (161)Ho and (167)Tm had high TND values for tumors weighing less than 1 mg and can be produced nca and with high specific activities. (142)Pr, (145)Pr, and (166)Ho showed TND values similar to those of (90)Y. (166)Ho is generator produced and can be obtained nca and at high specific activities. (143)Pr, (149)Pm, (150)Eu, (159)Gd, (165)Dy, (176m)Lu, and (179)Lu had higher TND values than did (90)Y for all tumor sizes studied, but only (149)Pm can be produced nca and at high specific activities. The other electron-emitting radiolanthanides and the positron-emitting radiolanthanides showed low TND values for all tumor sizes because of the high photon contribution.The low-energy electron emitters (161)Tb, (177)Lu, and (167)Tm might be suitable for radionuclide therapy. The Auger-electron emitter (161)Ho might not be suitable for systemic radionuclide therapy (intravenous injection) because of its short half-life but might be suitable for local therapy (e.g., in body cavities). If higher electron energy is needed, (149)Pm or (166)Ho might be suitable for radionuclide therapy.
