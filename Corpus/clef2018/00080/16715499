In vivo characterization of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacological properties of [11C]-(+)-PHNO in rats using an intracerebral beta-sensitive system. This study reports on the binding kinetics and pharmacological characterization of [11C]-(+)-PHNO ((+)-4-propyl-3,4,4a,5,6,10b-hexahydro-2H-naphtho[1,2-b][1,4]oxazin-9-ol), a promising agonist radiotracer for in vivo evaluation of the D2-receptor. Its in vivo kinetics were monitored in rat striatum and cerebellum using a beta-sensitive Microprobe system. Control studies showed that [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding was reversible and reached a peak time equilibrium of specific binding in striatum 30 min after radiotracer injection. The binding potential (BP) calculated by the simplified reference tissue model was 3-fold higher than that measured with [11C]-(-)-NPA (2.14 +/- 0.50 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.01, respectively). In contrast, the methyl analog of (+)-PHNO, [11C]-(+)-MHNO, which displayed promising D2-agonist properties in vitro, showed no specific binding in the striatum in vivo. [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding was totally blocked by raclopride (1 mg/kg i.v.) and 97% displaced by NPA (2 mg/kg
