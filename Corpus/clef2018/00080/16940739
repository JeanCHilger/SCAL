Sensitization to rabbit allergens in Italy--a multicentre study in atopic subjects without occupational exposure. Rabbits as pets are becoming popular in Italy, but few data are available on sensitization to rabbits in patients without occupational exposure. In a multicentre study, we assessed the prevalence of rabbit sensitization in atopic subjects and their modality of exposure.Allergists from the whole country were required to assess the presence of skin prick test positivity to rabbits in about 100 consecutive patients with allergic rhinitis and/or asthma. In the rabbit-positive patients, clinical history, pet ownership and modality of exposure were assessed.Skin tests were performed on 2,329 outpatients, of whom 1,602 had at least one positivity. Among them, 39 (2.43%) were sensitized to rabbit dander (4 monosensitized). The prevalence of sensitization ranged between 0.65 and 4.72%. Nineteen patients reported direct rabbit contact (10 for ownership and 9 for occasional contact) and 5 patients only indirect exposure through the contact with rabbit owners. Fifteen subjects denied any direct or indirect exposure. All the monosensitized patients were rabbit owners and had persistent (moderate-severe) respiratory symptoms.Sensitization to rabbit in Italy is not to be neglected. In atopic subjects without occupational exposure, contact and indirect exposure to rabbits may induce sensitization. A progressive increase in rabbit sensitization is expected in the future as consequence of the increased rabbit ownership.
