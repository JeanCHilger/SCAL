Dopaminergic deficiency in mice with reduced levels of the dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and regulated kinase 1A, Dyrk1A(+/-). The dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) gene encodes a protein kinase known to play a critical role in neurodevelopment. Mice with one functional copy of Dyrk1A (Dyrk1A(+/-)) display a marked hypoactivity and altered gait dynamics in basal conditions and in novel environments. Dopamine (DA) is a key neurotransmitter in motor behavior and genetic deletion of certain genes directly related to the dopaminergic system has a strong impact on motor activity. We have studied the effects of reduced Dyrk1A expression on the function of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. To characterize the dopaminergic system in DYRK1A(+/-) mice, we have used behavioral, pharmacological, histological, neurochemical and neuroimaging (microPET) techniques in a multidisciplinary approach. Dyrk1A(+/-) mice exhibited decreased striatal DA levels, reduced number of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, as well as altered behavioral responses to dopaminergic agents. Moreover, microdialysis experiments revealed attenuated striatal DA release and positron emission tomography scan display reduced forebrain activation when challenged with amphetamine, in Dyrk1A(+/-) compared with wild-type mice. These data indicate that Dyrk1A is essential for a proper function of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and suggest that Dyrk1A(+/-) mice can be used to study the pathogenesis of motor disorders involving dopaminergic dysfunction.
