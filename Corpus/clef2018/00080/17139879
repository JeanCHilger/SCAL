Cytoreductive approach to peritoneal carcinomatosis originated from colorectal cancer: Turkish experience. Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) in contrast to lymph nodes and liver metastases was assumed as a terminal condition with no curative treatment options having a 5 to 9 months median survival rate until recently. Today, in properly selected patients, curative surgical treatment of PC is possible like resection of lymph nodes and liver metastases. Between 1996 and 2005, 29 patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery combined with intraperitoneal chemotherapy for PC originated from colorectal cancer (CRC) were analysed prospectively at the Department of Surgery in Dokuz Eylul University Hospital. Mean age was 54 year (range, 23-75 years). There was no peroperative mortality in 29 patients. The morbidity rate was 41% (12/29) and 6 (20%) patients required reoperation(s) for major complications. Mean and median survival time was 34 and 21 months, respectively. The overall 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 72%, 13%, and 7%, respectively. Mean survival time was 56 months in patients with peritoneal cancer index (PCI) < 10, and 22 months in patients with PCI > 10 (P = 0.075). The mean survival time was 62 months in patients with complete cytoreduction (CC)-0 score, 21 months in patients with CC-1 score, and 7 months in patients with CC-2 and 3 scores. Patients who had CC-0 score had better survival than patients having CC-1 and CC-2 scores (P = 0.003 and P = 0.000, respectively). Patients who had CC-0 and 1 scores had better survival than patients with CC-2 score (P = 0.000). The overall 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates for patients with CC-0 score were 87%, 37%, and 25%, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the PCI and CC score (P = 0.001, correlation coefficient = 0.585 with correlation is significant at level 0.01). Cytoreductive approach combined with intraperitoneal chemotherapy and systemic chemotherapy prolongs survival in selected patients with PC of CRC with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Prognosis is better in patients with limited disease and in whom complete cytoreduction is achieved. In patients with PC of CRC, the key issue is to select the patients in whom complete cytoreduction is feasible. Better patient assessment with new diagnostic tools such as (PET)-CT or PET-magnetic resonance imaging will be used to detect more precisely the patients with low tumor burden in the new feature.
