The role of functional neuroimaging in exploring the overlap between borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder. In light of the recent discussions of possible diagnostic overlap between borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder, we explored the neuroimaging literature to determine if findings from this literature might illuminate the issue of overlap between the two diagnoses. We looked at studies of executive functions and emotion-related functions. Although similar brain areas have been explored in each population and several findings are suggestive of overlap, as well as differences between the two disorders, conclusions are limited because of the lack of studies that employed the exact same paradigm in the two patient groups. The authors suggest methods for conducting future neuroimaging research that may better clarify some of these issues of possible diagnostic overlap.
