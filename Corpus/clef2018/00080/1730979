Kinetic behavior of technetium-99m-HMPAO in the human brain and quantification of cerebral blood flow using dynamic SPECT. The kinetic behavior of 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) in the human brain was investigated in 11 patients with various brain diseases (176 regions), using dynamic SPECT and a four-compartment model with five parameters (K1: rate constant for the transport of HMPAO from blood to brain, K2: backdiffusion from brain to blood, K3: conversion to a hydrophilic form in the brain, K5: conversion to a nondiffusible form in the blood, and fa: fraction of radioactivity attributable to the vascular compartment). Although K1 correlated well with cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by the 133Xe inhalation method (Xe-CBF) (r = 0.888), its value was underestimated by 28.9% +/- 11.9%, indicating a low extraction fraction (E) for HMPAO. From E = K1/CBF, a regression equation of E = 0.857 - 0.00335. Xe-CBF was obtained. Significant correlations were observed for K2 versus Xe-CBF (r = 0.679), for K3 versus Xe-CBF (r = 0.483), for K3/(K2 + K3) versus Xe-CBF (r = -0.487), for K3/K2 versus Xe-CBF (r = -0.501), and for K2 + K3 versus Xe-CBF (r = 0.655), but not for K1/K2 versus Xe-CBF (r = 0.005). Thus, this model was useful for elucidating the kinetic behavior of HMPAO in the human brain, and correction for E appears to be indispensable for accurate CBF quantification using HMPAO.
