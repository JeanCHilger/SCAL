Fast predictions of variance images for fan-beam transmission tomography with quadratic regularization. Accurate predictions of image variances can be useful for reconstruction algorithm analysis and for the design of regularization methods. Computing the predicted variance at every pixel using matrix-based approximations [1] is impractical. Even most recently adopted methods that are based on local discrete Fourier approximations are impractical since they would require a forward and backprojection and two fast Fourier transform (FFT) calculations for every pixel, particularly for shift-variant systems like fan-beam tomography. This paper describes new "analytical" approaches to predicting the approximate variance maps of 2-D images that are reconstructed by penalized-likelihood estimation with quadratic regularization in fan-beam geometries. The simplest of the proposed analytical approaches requires computation equivalent to one backprojection and some summations, so it is computationally practical even for the data sizes in X-ray computed tomography (CT). Simulation results show that it gives accurate predictions of the variance maps. The parallel-beam geometry is a simple special case of the fan-beam analysis. The analysis is also applicable to 2-D positron emission tomography (PET).
