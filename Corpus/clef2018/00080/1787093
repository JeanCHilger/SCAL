Antibody fragments labeled with fluorine-18 and gallium-68: in vivo comparison with indium-111 and iodine-125-labeled fragments. Although monoclonal antibodies have been radiolabeled with many different radionuclides, the application of positron emission tomography (PET) to the imaging of radiolabeled antibodies has been limited to the investigation of a small number of long-lived radionuclides. In this study, we labeled F(ab')2 fragments of a mouse monoclonal antibody (BB5-G1) specific for a human parathyroid surface antigen with the positron emitting radionuclides, gallium-68 and fluorine-18. The biodistribution of the fragments was evaluated in a nude mice model and the results were compared to those obtained with fragments labeled with iodine-125 and indium-111 using conventional labeling techniques. All labeled fragments bound to human parathyroid tissue implanted in nude mice, with parathyroid-to-muscle ratios reaching as high as 10:1, 4 h after administration. A major difference was observed in the uptake and clearance of the various labeled fragments through the kidney. The halogen activity cleared, but the metal radioactivity was retained in the kidney. The results indicate that the fluorine-18 or gallium-68 labeled fragment may be useful for parathyroid imaging with positron emission tomography.
