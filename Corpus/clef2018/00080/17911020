Novel synthetic ligands for targeted PET imaging and radiotherapy of copper. Novel ligands, NBEA, NBPA, NETA, NE3TA, and NE3TA-Bn, were synthesized and evaluated as potential chelators of copper radioisotopes for use in targeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging or radiation therapy. The new ligands were radiolabeled with (64)Cu, and in vitro stability of the radiolabeled complexes was assessed in rat serum. Serum stability results suggest that among the ligands tested, NETA, NE3TA, and NE3TA-Bn form stable complexes with (64)Cu.
