Broad-spectrum multi-modality image registration: from PET, CT, and MRI to autoradiography, microscopy, and beyond. Image registration and fusion are increasingly important components of both clinical and small-animal imaging and have lead to the development of a variety of pertinent hardware and software tools, including multi-modality, e.g. PET-CT, devices. At the same time, advances in microscopic imaging, including phosphor-plate digital autoradiography and immunohistochemistry, now allow ultra-high (sub-100 microm)-resolution molecular characterization of tissue sections. To date, however, in vivo imaging of intact subjects and ex vivo imaging of harvested tissues sections have remained separate and distinct, making it difficult to reliably inter-compare the former and the latter. The Department of Medical Physics and the Radiation Biophysics Laboratory at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, under the direction of Dr. Clifton Ling, has now designed, fabricated, and tested a stereotactic imaging system for so-called "broad-spectrum" image registration, from coarser-resolution in vivo imaging modalities such as PET, CT, and MRI to ultra-high-resolution ex vivo imaging techniques such as histology, autoradiography, and immunohistochemistry.
