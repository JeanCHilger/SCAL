Cloning and expression of coxsakievirus B3 viral protein-1 in E. coli. Viral protein-1 (VP1) is a major capsid protein of Coxsakievirus B3 (CVB3) that plays an important role in directing viruses towards permissive cells and acts as a main antigenic site of the virus in eliciting of host immune response, hence it seems VP1 can be considered as a vaccine candidate against CVB3 infection. In this study, cDNA of VP1 was prepared, cloned into pET expression vector and the recombinant protein (VP1) was over expressed in E. coli.The viruses were grown in suspension cultures of Vero cells with an input virus multiplicity of 10-50 plaque-forming units/cell. After observing complete cytopathic effect, the total RNA (cells and virus) was prepared for RT-PCR and by using specific primers, VP1 cDNA was amplified and ligated into pET vectors (32 a and 28 a). The recombinant vector was transferred into competent E. coli (BL-21) and after selection of proper colony, which carried correct cDNA within the vector cells were cultured and induced with isopropyl B-D-thiogalactopyranoside, in order to express protein (VP1). The cultures were tested for presence of VP1 by SDS-PAGE and Western-Blotting analysis.Molecular techniques such as PCR which showed exact defined size of the VP1 (819 bp), restriction digestion and finally immunoblot analysis of over expressed protein all confirmed the correct cloning and expression of VP1 in this research.In this research, full length of VP1 as major capsid protein of CVB3 was over expressed in E. coli which, can be used for further studies, including neutralizing antibody production against CVB3.
