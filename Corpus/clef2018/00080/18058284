Neuroimaging approaches in mood disorders: technique and clinical implications. Clinical research in mood disorders increasingly involves advanced neuroimaging techniques. The encompassing aim of this review is to provide the mental health care practitioner with a pragmatic understanding of neuroimaging approaches and their possible clinical application.We conducted a literature search of English-language articles using the search terms, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, cross-referenced with available neuroimaging technologies and analytical approaches, The search was supplemented with a manual review of relevant references. We organize the review by reviewing frequently asked questions on the topic of neuroimaging by mental health-care providers.Magnetic resonance (MR) approaches provide information on white and gray matter pathology (segmentation), cellular metabolism (MRS), oxygen consumption (BOLD), and neurocircuitry (DTI). Radionuclide-based neuroimaging methodologies provide quantitative estimates of brain glucose metabolism, regional blood flow, and ligand-receptor/transporter binding. Clinical implications of neuroimaging methodologies are reviewed.Advances in neuroimaging technology have refined models of disease pathophysiology in mood disorders and the mechanistic basis of antidepressant action. Multivariate analysis of functional and structural neuroimaging data, longitudinal analysis in the depressed and remitted states, and inclusion of representative patients with medical and psychiatric comorbidities will enhance the clinical translation of future research findings.
