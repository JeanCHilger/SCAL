Low-dose of statin treatment improves cerebrovascular reactivity in patients with ischemic stroke: single photon emission computed tomography analysis. Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzymeA reductase inhibitors, have pleiotropic effects that are independent of their cholesterol-lowering activities. For example, they improve vascular endothelial function and exert anti-inflammatory effects. In large clinical trials they reduced the incidence of stroke and myocardial infarction however, little is currently known regarding the mechanism or mechanisms underlying their clinically confirmed stroke protection.We assessed 10 patients who had experienced a stroke at least 6 months earlier they received low-dose (5 mg) simvastatin. Using our triple-injection technetium 99m-ethylcysteinate dimer method, we determined their cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity. A second assessment of at-rest cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity was performed 4 or more months (mean 6 months) after the start of statin administration. We used acetazolamide (1 g) as the vasodilator. The region of interest was the middle cerebral artery territory on a 3-dimensional stereotaxic region of interest template.Statin administration did not significantly affect the regional cerebral blood flow at rest. Before statin treatment, the patients' vasoreactivity, determined by the triple-injection technetium 99m-ethylcysteinate dimer method, demonstrated delayed, poor, or near-normal response patterns. Statin treatment improved vasoreactivity in all patients. Their mean serum total cholesterol level before statin administration was 200 mg/dL (range 187-256 mg/dL). Statin treatment significantly reduced their mean serum total cholesterol to 180 mg/dL (range 128-220 mg/dL) (P < .01).The clinically confirmed stroke protection activity exerted by statins may be attributable to improved cerebrovascular reactivity.
