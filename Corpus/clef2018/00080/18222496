Cerebral ischemia: models, methods and outcomes. Experimental research into brain ischemia contributes substantially to the understanding of ischemic injury mechanisms but suffers from its limited relevance for clinical treatment strategies. One of the reasons is the use of experimental models and methods that do not or only partially replicate the pathophysiology of naturally occurring brain ischemia. To facilitate the understanding and interpretation of experimental data, the most widely used experimental models and analytical methods of brain ischemia are reviewed. Particular emphasis is given to the pathophysiological particularities of the various ischemia models, the application of imaging methods for the reliable differentiation between infarct core, penumbra, benign oligemia and normal tissue, as well as to the final outcome of experimental interventions. Based on this analysis, recommendations are given to improve the translational power of brain ischemia-related experimental research.
