CT, MRI, PET, PET/CT, and ultrasound in the evaluation of obstetric and gynecologic patients. The role of imaging in obstetrics and gynecology has undergone a revolution over the past few decades. Well-established methods such as endovaginal ultrasound have had a central role in the evaluation of nongravid patients with pelvic pain, as well as in the workup for ectopic pregnancy and evaluation of adnexal masses. Additional tools include MRI in the evaluation of appendicitis and other potentially surgical conditions in pregnant patients and MRI and CT in the evaluation of surgical complications. Newer tools in the radiology armamentarium include PET scanning which, alongside MRI and CT, are often helpful in staging gynecologic malignancy. The role of imaging in the obstetric and gynecology patient will continue to change as new modalities and techniques are introduced.
