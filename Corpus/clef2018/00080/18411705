Minocycline as a therapeutic drug for methamphetamine use disorders. Use of methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is an extremely serious and growing problem throughout the world, including Japan. Antipsychotic drugs have been used for psychotic symptoms associated with these abused drugs. However, there are currently no particular pharmacological treatments for the wide range of symptoms associated with these abused drugs. Recently, we reported that the second generation antibiotic drug minocycline can attenuate behavioral abnormalities and neurotoxicity in the brain after administration of methamphetamine or MDMA. In this review, we discuss minocycline as a new potential therapeutic drug for schizophrenia as well as psychosis associated with these abused drugs.
