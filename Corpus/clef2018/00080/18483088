Comparison of 99mTc- and 18F-ubiquicidin autoradiography to anti-Staphylococcus aureus immunofluorescence in rat muscle abscesses. 99mTc-ubiquicidin (UBI) 29-41 is under clinical evaluation for discrimination between bacterial infection and unspecific inflammation. We compared the distribution of 99mTc-UBI 29-41, the potential PET tracers 18F-UBI 29-41 and 18F-UBI 28-41, and 3H-deoxyglucose (DG) in rat muscle abscesses to that of anti-Staphylococcus aureus immunofluorescent imaging.Calf abscesses were induced in 15 CDF-Fischer rats after inoculation of Staphylococcus aureus. One to 6 d later, either 18F-UBI 29-41 and 3H-DG (n = 5) or 18F-UBI 28-41 and 3H-DG (n = 6) or 99mTc-UBI 29-41 and 3H-DG (n = 4) were injected simultaneously. Dual-tracer autoradiography of the abscess area was compared with the distribution of bacteria and macrophages.The UBI derivates exhibited increased uptake in the abscess area that partly matched 3H-DG uptake and macrophage infiltration but showed no congruity with areas that were highly positive for bacteria.A specific binding of UBI derivatives to Staphylococcus aureus in vivo could not be confirmed in this study.
