Survey of owned feline and canine populations in apartments from a neighbourhood in Curitiba, Brazil. Animal population estimates are essential for public health services to ensure the success of zoonoses control programmes. Canine and feline populations vary among different regions mainly because of local human income status and type of human residence. Accordingly, the present study estimated the pet population size living in apartments of a vertical neighbourhood in Curitiba, Brazil. We chose a neighbourhood with a predominance of apartment buildings. All apartment buildings were visited, and questionnaires were completed by doormen or residents. Data were obtained from 120 of 173 apartment buildings. Survey questions included the number of apartments, residents, dogs and cats. Two thousand nine hundred and sixty six apartments with a total of 7429 residents were surveyed. The number of dogs and cats was 569 and 86 respectively. Thus, the human:dog and human:cat ratios were 13.05:1 and 86.38:1. These ratios were higher than those observed in other neighbourhoods in Curitiba. The present study indicates that the number of pets from apartments may be different from houses, and different among distinct areas within the same city.
