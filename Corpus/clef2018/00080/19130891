The relationships between daily life events and the availabilities of serotonin transporters and dopamine transporters in healthy volunteers--a dual-isotope SPECT study. The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between the daily life events and the availabilities of serotonin transporters (SERT) and dopamine transporters (DAT) in healthy volunteers. Thirty-seven volunteers, 19 males and 18 females, were recruited. The SERT availability was approximated using SPECT and [123I] ADAM while the DAT availability was approximated using SPECT and [99mTc] TRODAT-1. All participants completed the Recent Life Change Questionnaire. The results showed that SERT and DAT may be sensitive to the presence of stressful events.
