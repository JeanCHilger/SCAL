PET studies with L-[1-11C]tyrosine, L-[methyl-11C]methionine and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose in prolactinomas in relation to bromocryptine treatment. Aspects of metabolism in prolactinomas were investigated by positron emission tomography using L-[1-11C]tyrosine, L-[methyl-11C]methionine and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG). Using L-[1-11C]tyrosine, four patients were monitored prior to and 18 h after an injection of 50 mg bromocriptine. At 18 h after bromocriptine intervention, L-[1-11C]tyrosine uptake into tumour was reduced with 28% (P less than 0.07). A correlation analysis of the bromocriptine-induced decrease in L-[1-11C]tyrosine uptake and the reduction of serum prolactin levels indicated that the action of bromocriptine on prolactin synthesis and prolactin release is not coupled. In the untreated situation, the four patients were investigated with 18FDG as well, but the prolactinomas could not be visualized. Three untreated patients were studied with L-[methyl-11C]methionine. The tumour-imaging potential of L-[methyl-11C]methionine and L-[1-11C]tyrosine appeared to be nearly equivalent for prolactinomas. Unlike prolactinoma tissue, the salivary glands showed a pronounced preference for L-[1-11C]tyrosine as compared to L-[methyl-11C]methionine. L-[1-11C]tyrosine is a valuable tool to obtain information on the metabolism and treatment of prolactinomas.
