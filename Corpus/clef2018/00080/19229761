Prevalence of antibody to hepatitis E virus among pet dogs in the Jiang-Zhe area of China. In order to investigate the prevalence of HEV infection and immunity in pet dogs in the Jiang-Zhe area of China, we examined 192 dog serum samples collected from 11 animal hospitals in this area for anti-HEV IgG and HEV RNA, using ELISA and RT-PCR assays, respectively. Two dogs were injected intravenously with swine HEV to obtain anti-HEV antibody positive serum for ELISA assay. After the ELISA assay, 26 samples showing OD values higher than 0.20 were selected and examined by Dot-blot assay, and 88.5% (23/26) were confirmed to be positive for anti-HEV IgG. Although our results indicated swine HEV could experimentally induce anti-HEV IgG in the serum, we failed to detect HEV RNA in the serum samples from either the 2 intravenously injected dogs or 192 serum samples collected from animal hospitals. This implied that dog may not be a reservoir of HEV in this area.
