New molecular imaging targets to characterize myocardial biology. Molecular imaging represents a targeted approach to noninvasively assess biologic (both physiologic and pathologic) processes in vivo. Ideally the goal of molecular imaging is not just to provide diagnostic and prognostic information based on identification of the molecular events associated with a pathologic process but rather to guide individually tailored pharmacologic, cell-based, or genetic therapeutic regimens. This article reviews the recent advances in myocardial molecular imaging in the context of the cardiovascular processes of angiogenesis, apoptosis, inflammation, and ventricular remodeling. The focus is on radiotracer-based single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography molecular imaging approaches.
