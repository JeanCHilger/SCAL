Reverse oblique reconstruction for SPECT of the spine. Anatomic localization of spine lesions, shown by Tc-99m phosphonate SPECT, to facet joint or pedicle is often difficult due to limitations in resolution. Indirect localization, relating lesion position on sagittal reconstruction to the adjacent visible vertebral bodies and also to patient spine radiographs, might be required. Some laterally placed lesions, however, cannot be visualized in the more midline slices showing the vertebral bodies. Oblique tomographic reconstruction overcomes this limitation.
