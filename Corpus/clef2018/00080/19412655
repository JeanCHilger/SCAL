Attenuation correction of myocardial SPECT by scatter-photopeak window method in normal subjects. Segmentation with scatter and photopeak window data using attenuation correction (SSPAC) method can provide a patient-specific non-uniform attenuation coefficient map only by using photopeak and scatter images without X-ray computed tomography (CT). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of attenuation correction (AC) by the SSPAC method on normal myocardial perfusion database.A total of 32 sets of exercise-rest myocardial images with Tc-99 m-sestamibi were acquired in both photopeak (140 keV +/- 10%) and scatter (7% of lower side of the photopeak window) energy windows. Myocardial perfusion databases by the SSPAC method and non-AC (NC) were created from 15 female and 17 male subjects with low likelihood of cardiac disease using quantitative perfusion SPECT software. Segmental myocardial counts of a 17-segment model from these databases were compared on the basis of paired t test.AC average myocardial perfusion count was significantly higher than that in NC in the septal and inferior regions (P < 0.02). On the contrary, AC average count was significantly lower in the anterolateral and apical regions (P < 0.01). Coefficient variation of the AC count in the mid, apical and apex regions was lower than that of NC.The SSPAC method can improve average myocardial perfusion uptake in the septal and inferior regions and provide uniform distribution of myocardial perfusion. The SSPAC method could be a practical method of attenuation correction without X-ray CT.
