Feasibility of ex vivo FDG PET of the colon. To facilitate future direct correlations between fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid colonic lesions and immunohistochemical assay findings, the authors tested the feasibility of ex vivo FDG positron emission tomography (PET) of the colon resected from humans. In this institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant study, the authors, after obtaining informed patient consent, injected FDG intraoperatively in five patients with neoplasms and imaged their resected colons approximately 3 hours later. The colon could be imaged during this fairly limited time interval, and polyps and cancers could be identified. No biologic tissue degradation occurred. The authors concluded that ex vivo FDG PET of the colon is feasible and, when combined with careful histologic and immunohistochemical analyses, may serve as a research tool to determine the mechanisms of the normal colonic uptake of FDG and the localization of FDG in polyps and cancers.
