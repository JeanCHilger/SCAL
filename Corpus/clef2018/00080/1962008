Tick-borne zoonoses: Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The primary health risk for veterinary staff and companion pet owners is exposure to ticks in the wooded/pasture areas or to ticks brought indoors by their pets. There are no proven cases of direct animal to human transmission for Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, or Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Direct inoculation of blood from a bacteremic animal, eg, by needle stick is a theoretical, but, so far, undocumented health risk. However, veterinarians should record needle sticks or other inoculation-type injuries that occur in their practices. Prevention of Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and other tick-borne diseases depends on the avoidance of tick-infested areas and proper use of repellents and acaricides.
