18F-FDG-PET and histopathology in 131I-lipiodol treatment for primary liver cancer. The diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG-PET (fluoro-2-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography) remains questionable for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but seems to be more promising for restaging and therapy control. Yet, there are no data on FDG-PET in 131I-lipiodol treatment for primary liver cancer. The aim of this study was to relate baseline FDG-PET findings to histologic data and to assess, for the first time, the role of repetitive FDG-PET imaging for follow-up of 131I-lipiodol treatment. Eighteen (18) patients (16 HCC, 2 cholangiocellular carcinoma CCC) with 36 treatment courses (up to four per patient) had 35 PET exams, including 18 post-treatment follow-up scans in 10 patients (up to three per patient, one without baseline PET
