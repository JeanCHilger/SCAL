Occurrence of extractable ink residuals in packaging materials used in the Czech Republic. Residues of printing ink components were determined in 94 samples of packaging materials commercially used in the Czech Republic for food packaging. The samples tested included printed polyethylene and polypropylene films, co-extruded and laminated films, paperboard beverages boxes, foils for thermo sealing of polystyrene cups, and polypropylene cups. Printing ink components were extracted with diethylether, then separated and determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Fifty compounds potentially originating from printing were isolated, identified and quantified. No acute health risk for consumers were identified, even though several findings of high levels of photo-initiators (e.g. in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films for thermo sealing of polystyrene cups) as well as plasticizers (acetyl tributyl citrate, tributyl aconitate, 2-butoxyethyl oleate and 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate in co-extruded films) indicate that their real migration into food and/or food simulants needs to be undertaken for a proper safety evaluation.
