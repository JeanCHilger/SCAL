Time-dependent changes in 18F-FDG activity in the thymus and bone marrow following combination chemotherapy in paediatric patients with lymphoma. To investigate the time-dependent changes in (18)F-FDG uptake by the thymus and marrow following combination chemotherapy for lymphoma in a paediatric study population.Included in the study were 27 paediatric patients who were in complete metabolic remission after chemotherapy and who underwent off-therapy follow-up with serial whole-body PET-CT scans. A total of 142 PET-CT scans were recorded. (18)F-FDG uptake by the thymus and marrow was assessed both visually and semiquantitatively. Visual uptake was scored on the three-dimensional maximum intensity projection of the whole-body PET image according to a three-point scale. For the semiquantitative assessment, standard uptake values were measured. To find a pattern in the (18)F-FDG uptake by the thymus and marrow a moving average technique was applied.Our time series analysis indicated that the marrow activity was highest at cessation of chemotherapy and declined thereafter. During an off-chemotherapy period of on average 6 months, marrow activity decreased quickly. From 6 months onward, the activity declined more slowly. The posttherapy changes in (18)F-FDG uptake by the thymus were quite different from the changes in uptake by the marrow. The lowest thymic FDG uptake was found at cessation of chemotherapy. Thereafter, thymic activity steadily increased, reached a peak on average 10 months after therapy, and then slowly decreased.Knowledge of the time-dependent changes in metabolic activity in the thymus and marrow is important to avoid misinterpretation of increased (18)F-FDG uptake as disease in the off-therapy setting.
