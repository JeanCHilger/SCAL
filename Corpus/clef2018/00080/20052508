Impact of bifunctional chelators on biological properties of 111In-labeled cyclic peptide RGD dimers. The present study describes the synthesis and biological evaluation of (111)In(DOTA-3P-RGD(2)) (DOTA = 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclo-dodecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid 3P-RGD(2) = PEG(4)-E[PEG(4)-c(RGDfK)](2)
