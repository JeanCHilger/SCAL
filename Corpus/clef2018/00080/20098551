Monte Carlo simulation studies on scintillation detectors and image reconstruction of brain-phantom tumors in TOFPET. This study presents Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) results of detection efficiencies, spatial resolutions and resolving powers of a time-of-flight (TOF) PET detector systems. Cerium activated Lutetium Oxyorthosilicate (Lu(2)SiO(5): Ce in short LSO), Barium Fluoride (BaF(2)) and BriLanCe 380 (Cerium doped Lanthanum tri-Bromide, in short LaBr(3)) scintillation crystals are studied in view of their good time and energy resolutions and shorter decay times. The results of MCS based on GEANT show that spatial resolution, detection efficiency and resolving power of LSO are better than those of BaF(2) and LaBr(3), although it possesses inferior time and energy resolutions. Instead of the conventional position reconstruction method, newly established image reconstruction (talked about in the previous work) method is applied to produce high-tech images. Validation is a momentous step to ensure that this imaging method fulfills all purposes of motivation discussed by reconstructing images of two tumors in a brain phantom.
