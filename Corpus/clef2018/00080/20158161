Cloning and expression of Brassica napus beta-carbonic anhydrase cDNA. A new full-length beta-carbonic anhydrase cDNA was obtained from Brassica napus by homologous cloning. The cDNA has an open-reading frame of 996 nucleotides, encoding 331 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 35,692 Da and an estimated pI value of 5.459. The deduced amino acid sequence of beta-carbonic anhydrase from Brassica napus shared significant identity with beta-carbonic anhydrases from Brassica carinata, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Thlaspi caerulescens (97.9%, 94%, and 93.5% identity, respectively). This cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using the expression vector pET-32a(+). The expression band corresponded to the calculated mass plus the N-terminal fusion protein derived from the vector.
