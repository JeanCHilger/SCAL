Development of effective PET and SPECT imaging agents for the serotonin transporter: has a twenty-year journey reached its destination? The serotonin transporter (SERT) has been implicated in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, schizophrenia, substance abuse, alcoholism, and Alzheimer's disease. Radiotracer-based in vivo imaging techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) are important tools to investigate the functions of SERT in the living brain under normal conditions and its dysfunction in diseases. In this report we review the development and validation of effective PET and SPECT radiotracers in the last twenty years. First, the requirements for an effective imaging tracer, and factors influencing a tracer's in vivo imaging performance are discussed. PET and SPECT radiotracers for SERT are then categorized and reviewed according to their chemical scaffolds: 1) SSRIs and related compounds 2) tropane-based ligands
