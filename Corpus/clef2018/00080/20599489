Using 18F-FDG microPET imaging to measure the inhibitory effects of Clematis chinensis Osbeck on the pro-inflammatory and degradative mediators associated with inflammatory arthritis. This study examined the modulating effects of Clematis chinensis Osbeck (Ranunculaeae) on pro-inflammatory and degradative mediators associated with inflammatory arthritis.Primary human chondrocytes (PHC) were stimulated with IL-1Î² or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce the enhanced release of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), metalloproteinase (MMP-3 and -13), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expression. The (18)F-FDG microPET imaging system was used to evaluate the anti-arthritic effects of Clematis chinensisin vivo.The acetone extracted Clematis chinensis (CC6) contained the most total saponins compared to other solvent's extracts and showed significant and dose-dependent inhibitory effects on PGE(2), MMP-3, -13, and COX-2 productions by LPS-stimulated PHC. Furthermore, CC6 also exerted inhibitory effects on 2-(18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ((18)F-FDG) uptake when assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) uptake in the joints and serum PGE(2) of rabbits with knee joints injected with LPS.The results suggest the significant chondroprotective effects of Clematis chinensis are through its anti-inflammatory and MMPs inhibitory abilities. Meanwhile, we established a new analysis method to evaluate the Chinese herbal anti-arthritic effects.
