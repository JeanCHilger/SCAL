Nucleotide sequences of the continuous and separated petA, petB and petD chloroplast genes in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We have mapped and sequenced the petA (cytf), petB (cytb6) and petD (subunit IV) genes on the chloroplast genome of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. At variance with the pet genes in higher plant chloroplasts, the petB and petD genes are continuous, not adjacent and not located next to the psbB gene. The corresponding polypeptide sequences are highly conserved when compared with their counterparts from other sources but have a few features specific of algal cytb6/f complexes. In particular the transit sequence of cytf displays unique characteristics when compared with those previously described for cytf in higher plants.
