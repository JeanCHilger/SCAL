Incremental value of PET/CT Over CT for mediastinal nodal staging of non-small cell lung cancer: Comparison between patients with and without idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We aimed to compare the incremental value of FDG PET/CT over CT for the assessment of mediastinal nodal status between patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and those with NSCLC but without IPF.Forty-two patients with NSCLC and IPF (mean age, 66 years) were matched to 168 patients with NSCLC but without IPF (mean age, 65 years). Patients underwent surgical mediastinal nodal staging after both integrated PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT scans had been obtained. Histopathologic nodal assessment served as the reference standard.PET/CT had better specificity (91% [29/32 patients] vs 47% [15/32] p = 0.0002) and accuracy (83% [35/42] vs 50% [21/42]PET/CT offers significantly increased accuracy versus CT in mediastinal nodal staging in patients with NSCLC and IPF compared with patients with NSCLC but without IPF, mainly because of improved specificity.
