Detection of cardiovascular system involvement in Behçet's disease using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Behçet's disease (BD) theoretically affects all sizes and types of vessels however, there have been few reports describing the clinical efficacy of using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in patients with BD.Eight patients who were registered at the BD Specialty Clinic of Severance Hospital between 2004 and 2008 underwent FDG-PET scans to evaluate the cardiovascular presentations associated with BD. Medical records and FDG-PET images of the patients were retrospectively reviewed to determine the clinical significance of the cardiovascular findings.The median quantitative FDG uptake index was 1.46 (range, 0.58-2.61). FDG uptake was detected in multiple pseudoaneurysms, aortitis and arteritis associated with aortic regurgitation, and aneurysmatic dilation of the sinus of Valsalva, atherosclerotic change of the proximal ascending aorta associated with aortic regurgitation, and multiple pulmonary artery aneurysms. The quantitative FDG uptake intensity was significantly associated with the ESR level.FDG-PET scans may have clinical value as a workup study for patients with BD who have cardiovascular presentations.
