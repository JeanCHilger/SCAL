Radiolabeling and preliminary biological evaluation of a (99m)Tc(CO)(3) labeled 3,3'-(benzylidene)-bis-(1H-indole-2-carbohydrazide) derivative as a potential SPECT tracer for in vivo visualization of necrosis. N,N'-bis(diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid)-3,3'-(benzylidene)-bis-(1H-indole-2-carbohydrazide) (bis-DTPA-BI) was radiolabeled with (99m)Tc(CO)(3). The resulting (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-bis-DTPA-BI was characterized (LC-MS) and evaluated as a potential SPECT tracer for imaging of necrosis in Wistar rats with a reperfused partial liver infarction and Wistar rats with ethanol induced muscular necrosis. To study the specificity, uptake of (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-bis-DTPA-BI was also studied in a mouse model of Fas-mediated hepatic apoptosis. The obtained results indicate that (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-bis-DTPA-BI displays selective uptake in necrotic tissue and can be used for in vivo visualization of necrosis by SPECT.
