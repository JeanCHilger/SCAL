Prevalence, prognosis, and therapeutic implications of unrecognized left ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients with anemia and chronic kidney disease. The prevalence and outcomes of unrecognized left ventricular dysfunction (ULVSD) in patients with anemia and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not known. The authors determined whether anemia (hemoglobin <13 g/L) and CKD (glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min) are risk factors for ULVSD (ejection fraction <35%, no known heart failure [HF]) and to determine its impact on clinical outcomes. A total of 1358 patients without history of HF undergoing gated myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography for evaluation of suspected coronary artery disease were followed for a mean of 2.15 Â± 0.8 years. End points were death and heart failure hospitalization (HFH). Patients were divided into 4 groups (I: no anemia/no CKD, n=752 II: CKD/no anemia, n=285
