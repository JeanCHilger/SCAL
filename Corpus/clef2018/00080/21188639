99 mTc-MIBI washout as a complementary factor in the evaluation of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) using myocardial perfusion imaging. Rapid technetium-99 m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99 mTc-MIBI) washout has been shown to occur in impaired myocardia. This study is based on the hypothesis that scintigraphy can be applied to calculate the myocardial 99 mTc-MIBI washout rate (WR) to diagnose and evaluate heart failure severity and other left ventricular functional parameters specifically in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) patients. Patients with IDCMP (n = 17 52.65 ± 11.47 years) and normal subjects (n = 6
