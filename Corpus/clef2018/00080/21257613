Placental stem cells pre-treated with a hyaluronan mixed ester of butyric and retinoic acid to cure infarcted pig hearts: a multimodal study. Pre-treating placenta-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (FMhMSCs) with a hyaluronan mixed ester of butyric and retinoic acid (HBR) potentiates their reparative capacity in rodent hearts. Our aim was to test FMhMSCs in a large-animal model by employing a novel combination of in vivo and ex vivo analyses.Matched regional quantifications of myocardial function and viability were performed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) 4 weeks after myocardial infarction combined with intramyocardial injection of FMhMSCs (n = 7), or HBR-pre-treated FMhMSCs (HBR-FMhMSCs, n = 6), or saline solution (PBS, n = 7). Sham-operated pigs (n = 4) were used as control animals. Despite no differences in the ejection fraction and haemodynamics, regional MRI revealed, in pigs treated with HBR-FMhMSCs compared with the other infarcted groups, a 40% smaller infarct scar size and a significant improvement of the end-systolic wall thickening and circumferential shortening of the infarct border zone. Consistently, PET showed that myocardial perfusion and glucose uptake were, respectively, 35 and 23% higher in the border zone of pigs treated with HBR-FMhMSCs compared with the other infarcted groups. Histology supported in vivo imaging the delivery of HBR-FMhMSCs significantly enhanced capillary density and decreased fibrous tissue by approximately 68%. Moreover, proteomic analysis of the border zone in the HBR-FMhMSCs group and the FMhMSCs group indicated, respectively, 45 and 30% phenotypic homology with healthy tissue, while this homology was only 26% in the border zone of the PBS group.Our results support a more pronounced reparative potential of HBR-pre-treated FMhMSCs in a clinically relevant animal model of infarction and highlight the necessity of using combined diagnostic imaging to avoid underestimations of stem cell therapeutic effects in the heart.
