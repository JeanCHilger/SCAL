Mechanistic insight into protonolysis and cis-trans isomerization of benzylplatinum(II) complexes assisted by weak ligand-to-metal interactions. A combined kinetic and DFT study. Low-temperature NMR measurements showed that protonolysis and deuterolysis by H(D)X acids on meta- and para-substituted dibenzylplatinum(II) complexes cis-[Pt(CH(2)Ar)(2)(PEt(3))(2)] (Ar = C(6)H(4)Y(-) Y = 4-Me, 1a
