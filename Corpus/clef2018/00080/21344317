The prognostic significance of a fragmented QRS complex after primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Fragmented QRS (fQRS) may occur due to non-homogeneous activation of ischemic ventricles. We want to investigate the prognostic significance of a fQRS complex in a patient who had undergone primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Eighty-five patients with no history of coronary artery disease who underwent primary PCI were included in the study. Of these patients, 34 who were found to have a fQRS at the 48th hour after primary PCI were defined as group 1, and 51 who were found not to have a fQRS were defined as group 2. Both groups were monitored for adverse cardiac events. At 6.6 Â± 2.3 months of follow-up, major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was found significantly higher in the fQRS group [group 1:10 (29.4%) vs. group 2:3 (5.9%) p:0.003].
