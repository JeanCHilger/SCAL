fMRI language dominance and FDG-PET hypometabolism. Atypical language dominance is common in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. We examined the association of left temporal hypometabolism with laterality of fMRI activation in a language task in a cross-sectional study.Thirty patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (mean age 32.4 ± 11.0 years [range 18-55] epilepsy onset 15.3 ± 11.3 years [range 0.8-40]Nineteen patients had ipsilateral temporal hypometabolism 3 of 4 patients with atypical language had abnormal FDG-PET. Increasing left midtemporal hypometabolism correlated with decreased MFG LI (r = -0.41, p < 0.05) and showed trends with WA LI (r = -0.37, p = 0.055) and IFG LI (r = -0.31, p = 0.099)We did not find evidence of impaired blood oxygenation level-dependent response in hypometabolic cortex. Regional hypometabolism appears to be a marker for the temporal lobe dysfunction that leads to displacement of language function.
