Environmental risk factors for pulmonary Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex disease. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) is a ubiquitous pathogen found in soil and water. Environmental exposure is the primary route for MAC infection. However, specific environmental risk factors have been poorly determined in immunocompetent patients with pulmonary MAC disease.A case-control study was performed with 106 patients with pulmonary MAC disease (men [women], 23 [83] age, 64.3 ± 9.2 years) and 53 age-matched control patients with bronchiectasis but not pulmonary MAC infection (men [women], 7[46]No differences were identified in the patient characteristics and underlying diseases. More case patients experienced high soil exposure (≥ 2 per week) than control patients (23.6% vs 9.4%, P = .032) this remained significant after multivariate analysis (OR, 5.9Patients with pulmonary MAC disease had significantly more soil exposure than noninfected control patients, which suggests that environmental soil exposure is a likely risk factor for the development of pulmonary MAC disease.
