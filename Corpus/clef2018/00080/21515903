Impaired sequence learning in dystonia mutation carriers: a genotypic effect. Abnormalities in motor sequence learning have been observed in non-manifesting carriers of the DYT1 dystonia mutation. Indeed, motor sequence learning deficits in these subjects have been associated with increased cerebellar activation during task performance. In the current study, we determined whether similar changes are also present in clinically manifesting DYT1 carriers as well as in carriers of other primary dystonia mutations such as DYT6. Additionally, we determined whether sequence learning performance and associated brain activation in these subjects correlate with previously described genotype-related abnormalities of cerebellar pathway integrity and striatal D2 dopamine receptor binding. Nineteen DYT1 carriers (10 non-manifesting DYT1: 51.5±15.1 years nine manifesting DYT1: 46.1±15.1 years) and 12 healthy control subjects (42.8±15.3 years) were scanned with H2(15)O positron emission tomography while performing controlled sequence learning and reference tasks. Eleven DYT6 carriers (four non-manifesting DYT6: 38.0±22.1
