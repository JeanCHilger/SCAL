Effect of Ayurvedic mercury preparation Makaradhwaja on geriatric canine--a preliminary study. Makaradhwaja, an alchemical Ayurvedic mercury preparation is used as stimulant and vitalizer. Towards veterinary practices, the acceptability, tolerability and toxicity studies were undertaken in geriatric pet dogs aged more than 10 years irrespective of breed and sex for future use. Makaradhwaja (2.5 mg/kg) was used with honey once daily for 30 days. Before and after treatment, blood was collected for hematological studies as well as liver, kidney function and anti-oxidant activity. In control group, honey itself showed no appreciable change whereas, Makaradhwaja lowered neutrophil and total leucocyte count. Serum cholesterol, urea, glucose, alanine amino transferase, aspartate amino transferase, sodium, phosphorus and calcium were decreased. Haemoglobin and serum creatinine were significantly increased. There was appreciable physical, behavioral and body weight change including quality of life. The dose was used in replication of human dose (125 mg/50 kg). Anti-oxidant study showed significant increase of lipid per oxidation in experimental group while the values of ABTS radical cation decolorisation assay although decreased but did not show any significant changes. Decrease of serum urea and increase of serum creatinine could not be explained on single dose response. Different dose study could only explain the optimum dose to be required in canine practices.
