Different patterns of nigrostriatal degeneration in tremor type versus the akinetic-rigid and mixed types of Parkinson's disease at the early stages: molecular imaging with 123I-FP-CIT SPECT. The various associations of motor and non-motor symptoms, the onset of motor complications, the cognitive disorder's appearance and other factors make Parkinson's disease (PD) a heterogeneous syndrome with multiple phenotypes. The necessity of discriminating between different forms of PD could have a role in understanding the pathophysiology of extrapyramidal signs with clinical implications. The aim of this study was to evaluate if there is a relationship between the clinical motor phenotypes of PD and the scintigraphic pattern of 123I-FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). We examined 47 patients with early idiopathic PD (25 males 22 females
