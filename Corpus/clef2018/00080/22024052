123I]N-ω-fluoropropyl-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane single-photon emission computed tomography brain imaging in the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodie. Early, accurate diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), in particular its differentiation from Alzheimer's disease, is important for optimal management, providing patients/carers with information about the likely symptomatology and illness course, allowing initiation of effective pharmacotherapy, and avoiding the consequences of neuroleptic sensitivity. Clinical diagnosis of DLB has high specificity but low sensitivity. Clinical trials of [(123)I]N-ω-fluoropropyl-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane single-photon emission computed tomography ([(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT) indicate high positive and negative percent agreement with reference to clinical diagnosis, and high sensitivity and specificity in patients with neuropathologically confirmed diagnoses of DLB. An abnormal [(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT image in patients fulfilling criteria for possible DLB advances the certainty of a diagnosis to probable DLB. [(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT, by identifying the striatal dopaminergic deficit, can be a valuable diagnostic aid and can provide support to a clinical diagnosis of DLB in patients with dementia. The technique is likely to be of particular utility in patients with dementia with an uncertain diagnosis.
