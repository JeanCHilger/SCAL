Pharmacologic magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI): imaging drug action in the brain. The technique of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), using various cognitive, motor and sensory stimuli has led to a revolution in the ability to map brain function. Drugs can also be used as stimuli to elicit an hemodynamic change. Stimulation with a pharmaceutical has a number of very different consequences compared to user controllable stimuli, most importantly in the time course of stimulus and response that is not, in general, controllable by the experimenter. Therefore, this type of experiment has been termed pharmacologic MRI (phMRI). The use of a drug stimulus leads to a number of interesting possibilities compared to conventional fMRI. Using receptor specific ligands one can characterize brain circuitry specific to neurotransmitter systems. The possibility exists to measure parameters reflecting neurotransmitter release and binding associated with the pharmacokinetics and/or the pharmacodynamics of drugs. There is also the ability to measure up- and down-regulation of receptors in specific disease states. phMRI can be characterized as a molecular imaging technique using the natural hemodynamic transduction related to neuro-receptor stimulus. This provides a coupling mechanism with very high sensitivity that can rival positron emission tomography (PET) in some circumstances. The large numbers of molecules available, that do not require a radio-label, means that phMRI becomes a very useful tool for performing drug discovery. Data and arguments will be presented to show that phMRI can provide information on neuro-receptor signaling and function that complements the static picture generated by PET studies of receptor numbers and occupancies.
