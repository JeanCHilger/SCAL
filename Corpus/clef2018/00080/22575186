Clinical significance of (18)F-FDG PET/CT evaluation of response to treatment in T-cell lymphoma. To investigate the usefulness of (18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging in restaging, evaluating the treatment outcome, monitoring relapse and predicting prognosis of T-cell lymphoma.Retrospective analysis of PET/CT image results of thirty-four patients with T-cell lymphoma, and to evaluate its clinical significance in restaging, treatment efficiency, relapse monitor and prognosis prediction.Clinical restaging among the 20 stage I and II patients, 6 were ascended, 9 descended and 5 unchanged. Restaging among the other 14 stage III and IV patients, 3 were ascended, 4 descended and 7 unchanged. There were 12 patients in complete remission (CR), 11 in partial remission (PR), 2 in stable disease (SD) and 9 in progressive disease (PD) among all the 34 patients. There is obvious statistical difference of the standardized uptake value (SUV) between the efficacy group and the inefficacy group after treatment of 6 courses at least in 25 patients among all the 34 patients (P = 0.009). There is obvious statistical difference of the SUV value before and after treatment in 8 patients among all the 34 patients (P = 0.000). There is obvious statistical difference in the survival time between the efficacy group and the inefficacy group after treatment of 6 courses at least in 25 patients among all the 34 patients (P = 0.015).(18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging plays an very important role in guiding clinical restaging, evaluating the treatment outcome, monitoring relapse and predicting prognosis of T-cell lymphoma. It is helpful to establish personalized treatment planning.
