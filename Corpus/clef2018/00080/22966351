Unique intense uptake demonstrated by (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography in primary pancreatic lymphoma: A case report. Patients with primary pancreatic lymphoma (PPL), which is rare, require a different therapeutic approach and have a better prognosis than those with pancreatic cancer. However, conventional imaging modalities alone are not able to differentiate between pancreatic cancer and other rare tumors such as PPL, although the accurate diagnosis of PPL is crucial. The development of new modalities such as F-18 2'-deoxy-2fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) contributes to the evaluation of lymphoma staging. However, few reports are currently available regarding PET/CT findings in PPL. In this study, a 56-year old man with PPL was examined using FDG PET/CT imaging, which showed the unique intense uptake of FDG in the pancreas with atypical findings of malignancy in the CT scan and magnetic resonance images.
