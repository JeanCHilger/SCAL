Use of pretreatment metabolic tumor volumes on PET-CT to predict the survival of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus treated by curative surgery. To investigate the prognostic role of the pretreatment metabolic tumor volume (MTV) as determined by Positron emission tomography--computed tomography (PET-CT) in patients with esophageal cancer undergoing curative surgery.We retrospectively reviewed the data of 26 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, who underwent 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT before surgery. MTVs were defined as the volumes with FDG uptake above a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 2.5 (MTV2.5), or a fixed threshold of 20% (MTV20%) of the maximum intratumoral activity. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were examined by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test.In a median follow-up of 15 months, 13 patients had died. The mean MTV2.5 was 18.9 ± 15.4 ml (median, 16.0), whereas the mean MTV20% was 21.7 ± 15.0 ml (median, 19.1). Patients who had tumors of an MTV2.5 >16.0 ml had an inferior one-year OS compared with patients with a lower MTV2.5 (70% vs. 84%, p=0.018). Similarly, patients with an MTV20% >19.1 ml had poorer outcomes compared with patients who had small tumors, with one-year OS of 69% and 85%, respectively (p=0.016). No statistical significance was found in DFS for both MTV approaches. The SUVp-max had no impact on the OS and the DFS when using a median value of 8.3.Pretreatment MTV is a novel marker for OS of patients with esophageal cancer treated with curative surgery. For those with higher MTVs, more aggressive adjuvant treatments should be considered.
