The TESTASCAN single-photon emission multidetector computed gamma tomograph. A TESTASCAN single-photon emission multidetector gamma tomograph is a special purpose unit designed to investigate RP distribution in the brain. It permits obtaining transversal tomographic images with the resolution of about 10 mm, the thickness of an emitted layer being about 15 mm. The time of patient's examination during obtaining an image of 10-12 layers does not exceed 30 min. and can be reduced by increasing RP activity and minimizing the number of emitted transversal sections. The clinical testing of the unit has shown that it is reliable in maintenance and simple to operate during radionuclide data collection, reproduction and analysis. Emission computerized tomography in brain tumors can be regarded as a method increasing the accuracy and reliability of radionuclide diagnostic examination of neurosurgical and neurological patients.
