Psychomotor disturbances in psychiatric patients as a possible basis for new attempts at differential diagnosis and therapy. IV. Brain dysfunction during motor activation measured by EEG mapping. In parts I-III of this series psychometric evidence was reported of a "psychotic motor syndrome" (PMS) in schizophrenic and endogenous depressed patients, which was not found in non-endogenous depressed or healthy persons. An attempt is reported to establish signs of brain dysfunction in these patient groups during motor activation, using a 16-channel EEG mapping system. "Resting" conditions after a special relaxation procedure were compared with simple and complex motor tasks (and music perception/reproduction to be reported separately). Two measurements, at least 2 weeks apart, were obtained for each subject, in order to obtain information on the influence of drug treatment and/or psychopathological improvement on brain dysfunction. In all, 23 male and 25 female schizophrenics, 11 male and 18 female non-endogenous depressed patients (not actually mediated, i.e. drug naive or wash-out period of 1 week to 17 years), and 26 male and 37 female endogenous depressed patients (medicated with tri- or tetracyclic antidepressants and/or benzodiazepines
