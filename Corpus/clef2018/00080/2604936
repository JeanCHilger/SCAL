The use of an investigational radiopharmaceutical in neuroblastoma: a nursing perspective. Children with advanced-stage neuroblastoma usually have a poor prognosis. While conventional treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation may provide some palliation, long-term survival is rare. A number of investigational therapies are being performed nationwide in an attempt to improve the prognosis for children with neuroblastoma. One such treatment is the use of 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine. This article will review the pathophysiology of neuroblastoma, give an overview of this investigational treatment, and discuss the nursing care associated with radioactive treatment.
