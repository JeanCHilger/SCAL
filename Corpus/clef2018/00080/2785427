The localization of myocardial ischaemia with technetium-99m methoxy isobutyl isonitrile and single photon emission computed tomography. Thirty-two patients with suspected coronary artery disease were studied by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging with oblique reconstructions of the myocardium following the intravenous administration of technetium-99m methoxy isobutyl isonitrile at peak exercise. All patients also underwent three-vessel coronary angiography. The SPECT technique produced very detailed images allowing easy delineation of localized myocardial defects. Segmental myocardial uptake defects were compared with diseased vessels as shown at angiography. A good correlation was shown between right coronary artery (RCA) disease and mid and proximal inferior segments and between left circumflex (LCx) artery disease and mid and proximal lateral segments, allowing accurate localization of a defect to one of these two vessels' territories. Sensitivity and specificity of detection of disease of the RCA and LCx artery were high. Defects associated with a lesion of the left anterior descending vessel were more variable.
