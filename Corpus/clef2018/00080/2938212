Evaluation of distance-weighted SPECT reconstruction for skeletal scintigraphy. In 15 patients who had undergone skeletal scintigraphy for evaluation of low back pain, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) reconstruction techniques of distance-weighted filtered backprojection (new method) and non-distance-weighted filtered backprojection (standard method) were compared. Mid-spine sagittal views differing only by reconstruction methods were evaluated by trained observers and by a quantitative profile technique. When asked to compare image quality, the observers demonstrated a clear preference for images reconstructed by the new method. Profile quantitation showed significantly greater contrast in more superficial structures with the new method.
