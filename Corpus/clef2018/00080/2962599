Positron emission tomography with 11C-methionine and computed tomography of intracranial tumours compared with histopathologic examination of multiple biopsies. A selected group of 36 patients with suspected supratentorial gliomas were investigated with positron emission tomography (PET) using 11C-methionine and transmission computed tomography (CT) before and after intravenous injection of contrast medium. Every examination was performed with the head fixed in a plastic helmet and a baseplate to guarantee that the slice orientation was the same at examinations with the two modalities and over time. Guided by the examinations, multiple stereotactic biopsies were performed with the biopsy instrument mounted on the baseplate. Regional accumulation of methionine was compared with histology of the corresponding samples and with attenuation before and after injection of contrast medium as well as mass effect on CT. Typically, there was a low attenuating lesion with a slight mass effect on CT. There was an increased accumulation compared with normal brain tissue in 31 cases of tumours and ordinary or decreased accumulation in 3 cases of tumours. In 22 cases with increased accumulation of methionine the extension of the tumour judged by PET corresponded with that of histology. In 4 cases tumour cells were found outside the area with pathologic methionine uptake. In 5 patients there were areas with increased methionine accumulation where no tumour cells were found. In 22 cases PET using methionine was more accurate than CT in defining the tumour boundaries as determined from the histologic findings. Four groups of biopsy specimens with different amounts of methionine accumulation are described. The uptake in a single biopsy gives good but not exact information about the histology of the specimen.
