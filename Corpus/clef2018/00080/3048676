The role of nuclear cardiology in assessment of acute myocardial infarction. In summary, nuclear techniques have important roles in both the acute and convalescent phase of MI. Acutely, both myocardial perfusion and ventricular function may be assessed. In patients treated with thrombolytic therapy, perfusion imaging, and metabolic imaging using PET may be able to delineate ischemic myocardium. These techniques are being developed to accurately quantify salvaged myocardium for assessing the efficacy of an acute intervention, and to characterize (functionally) the remaining myocardium for possible further intervention. In the convalescent phase, prognostic information is obtained from both rest and exercise evaluation of ventricular function and reserve, ambulatory monitoring, as well as from the presence of exercise-induced ischemia as documented by quantitative thallium imaging. The results of these studies can be used to determine appropriate management strategies.
