Normal anatomy of the lumbosacral spine and pelvis. A correlation of SPECT and radiographic techniques. SPECT of the lumbosacral spine and pelvis is an advancement over planar imaging, which allows for improved lesion detection and more precise anatomic localization of an abnormality. Recognition of skeletal anatomy shown by SPECT is paramount for diagnostic accuracy as well as for meaningful consultations with referring physicians and diagnostic radiologists. This is a correlative study of normal anatomy of the lumbosacral spine and pelvis demonstrated by SPECT and radiography in order to assure that morphologic detail resulting from SPECT is recognized and matched with radiographic landmarks in the same area.
