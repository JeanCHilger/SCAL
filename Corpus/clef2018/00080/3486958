Diagnosis of diffuse hepatocellular diseases using SPECT. In the scintigraphic diagnosis of diffuse hepatocellular diseases, increased splenic uptake of colloids and splenomegaly are helpful signs. To quantify these patterns, the volume and activity of liver and spleen were measured by using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The spleen-to-liver (S/L) ratios in volume and activity that were calculated from SPECT images were estimated in normal individuals and in patients with diffuse hepatocellular diseases. The maximum normal limits of S/L ratios of volume, activity, and activity/volume were predicted as 0.19, 0.087, and 0.72 (mean +/- 2 s.d.). Twenty-two of twenty-three patients (96%) with liver cirrhosis had at least two elevated S/L ratios, and three elevated S/L ratios could clearly differentiate the patient with liver cirrhosis from normal individuals. On the other hand, only six patients (32%) with chronic hepatitis had elevation of any S/L ratio. Abnormal S/L ratios of activity/volume in the range from 0.72 to 1.05 were not obvious on planar or SPECT images.
