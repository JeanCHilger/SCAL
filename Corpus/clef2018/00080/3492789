Pathophysiologic study of chronic infarcts with I-123 isopropyl iodo-amphetamine (IMP): the importance of periinfarct area. Seventeen chronic cerebral infarcts were investigated by a highly sensitive, dedicated brain single photon emission computerized tomography system using 123I-isopropyl iodoamphetamine (IMP) and 133Xe. IMP uptake was measured 10 minutes, 2 hours, and 5 hours after injection, and regional cerebral blood flow was measured with 133Xe. In 4 cases a positron emission tomography system was used to measure the rCBF and the regional metabolic rate of oxygen with C15O2 and 15O2. The results obtained allowed us to identify 2 abnormal zones. One, the "central area," was characterized by a severe decrease in IMP uptake and rCBF averaging 34% and 46% respectively and by a hypodense image on the x-ray computerized tomography scan. The second, the periinfarct or "peripheral area" was characterized by a moderate decrease in IMP uptake and regional cerebral blood flow averaging 13 and 19% respectively this area extended around the central area and had a normal density on computerized tomography scan. The IMP hypofixation of the peripheral area observed at the 10th minute tended to disappear at the 5th hour. The volume of this area was often found to be quite large, covering more than 30% of a hemisphere whereas the central area did not exceed 25%. Volume appeared to be correlated with the neurological status of the patient. The nature of the peripheral area is not established with certainty. It may be caused by deafferentation of areas not directly affected by the ischemic insult and/or selective ischemic neuronal loss. The results stress the important role played by the peripheral area, which may be useful in establishing the prognosis and evaluating the efficacy of therapy in individual stroke cases.
