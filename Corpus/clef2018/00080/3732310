Uptake of 131I-MIBG by medullary carcinoma of thyroid in familial cases. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MCT) and pheochromocytoma are APUD tumors. MIBG (Meta Iodo Benzyl Guanidine) uptake by pheochromocytomas is now well known but very few cases of MIBG uptake in sporadic MCT have been described. We report here the two first cases of inherited MCT with MIBG uptake.
