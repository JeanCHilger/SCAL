The prevalence of Toxocara species ova in backyards and gardens of Baltimore, Maryland. Toxocara species ova were found in 16 of 146 (11 per cent) soil samples collected from backyards and gardens of private residences within Baltimore City. The recovery rate of parasite ova was similar for households regardless of their grouping by pet ownership characteristics or the presence of visible animal feces. The findings demonstrate the common occurrence of these eggs in locations likely to be important in the transmission of visceral larva migrans.
