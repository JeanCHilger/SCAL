Measurement of the liver and spleen volume by single photon emission computed tomography. Organ volume was experimentally and clinically determined using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In organ phantom filling with 99mTcO4-, the error was less than 3.3% in the volume over 400 ml but 11% at 200 ml. In 28 cases of patient, liver and spleen volume were measured by SPECT and X-CT. Good correlation was founded between SPECT volume and X-CT volume (r = 0.99, n = 49), although SPECT volume were 16% higher than X-CT volume (y = 1.16 x + 11.6, x: X-CT volume, y: SPECT volume).
