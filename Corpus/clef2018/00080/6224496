Initial observations on the biocompatibility of a polymer used as a skin dressing. In the development of a dressing for burn wound covers, a material is required which combines good oxygen permeability, high water content and good biocompatibility with reasonable mechanical properties. One of the most important functions of the cover is to protect the burned surfaces from drying out and to constitute the first defence against microbial invasion. In this study composite sheets crosslinked either in presence of glicerol or diacetin, obtained by reinforcing PHEMA with a tricot PET net have been implanted subacute in rabbits, to test their biocompatibility. The same composites crosslinked in presence of diacetin and grafted on a polybutadene film, have been used as a skin graft on rabbits.
