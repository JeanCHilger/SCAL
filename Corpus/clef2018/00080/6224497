Biological and surgical aspects of the use of polymers in experimental surgery. 1: implants on the oculo-extrinsic musculature. Composite sheets obtained reinforcing PHEMA with a tricot PET net have been implanted in rabbits to test their potential applications for cross-eye surgical correction. The mechanical characterization of the composites has been carried out both in static tension and fatigue. The clinical evaluation was performed on twelve adult New Zealand white Rabbits implanting the sheets on the rectus dorsalis muscle of the eye. The material seems to be highly compatible with the surrounding tissue, mechanical satisfying and clinically helpful in correcting many of the pathological conditions connected with strabismus. The long term behaviour of the implanted prosthesis in still under investigation.
