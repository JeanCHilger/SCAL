Positron emission tomography in venous ulceration and liposclerosis: study of regional tissue function. Oxygen-15 administered by continuous inhalation and emission computed tomography were used to study regional tissue oxygen utilisation and blood flow in the limbs of 11 patients with venous ulceration and five patients with liposclerosis due to venous insufficiency. The results showed increased blood flow and appreciably reduced fractional oxygen extraction in the diseased tissues. These findings indicated a local, functional shunting of blood through the abnormal microcirculation of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. This may be an important factor in the aetiology of the skin changes seen in patients with calf muscle pump failure.
