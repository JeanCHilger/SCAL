Design of steady-state positron emission tomography protocols for neurobehavioral studies: CO15O and 19Ne. Although the [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomographic technique for measuring regional glucose metabolic rate has been successfully employed for neurobehavioral studies, the long (greater than 30 min) equilibration time required may complicate the interpretation of experimental results. Positron emission tomography neurobehavioral protocols employing the continuous inhalation of CO15O and 19Ne were developed for measuring regional cerebral blood flow during multiple control and stimulation periods. Timing, lung absorbed dose, statistical accuracy, and resolution were considered. Studies with 19Ne require shorter equilibration and stimulation times than do CO15O studies but entail higher absorbed doses and yield poorer imaging statistics.
