Disturbance of oxidative metabolism of glucose in recent human cerebral infarcts. Eight patients with recent cerebral hemispheric infarction were studied with positron emission tomography and the oxygen-15 steady-state inhalation and [18F]deoxyglucose techniques to obtain values of regional cerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption, and glucose metabolism. The Sokoloff equation, used to calculate glucose metabolism, was simplified to exclude the exponential terms containing the rate constants. A value of the lumped constant quoted for normal brain (0.42) was used for infarcted regions and contralateral hemisphere. Mean regional cerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption, and glucose metabolism were all significantly depressed within the infarcts compared with the mirror regions in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. The mean fractional extraction of oxygen was low, indicating an adequate supply of oxygen for residual oxidative metabolism. Regional oxygen consumption and glucose metabolism were significantly correlated within the infarcts, but with a relationship of 2 moles of oxygen per mole of glucose--one-third that in the contralateral hemisphere and in normal brain. Although these results suggest that the metabolizing tissue of a recent cerebral infarct utilizes aerobic glycolysis, caution about the validity of this pathophysiological observation is dictated by limitations in current positron emission tomographic tracer methodology.
