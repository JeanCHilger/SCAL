Values and limitations of pet ownership. A questionnaire was used to collect information concerning the values and limitations of pet ownership. The major reasons given for nonownership were housing limitations, emotional dissatisfaction with animals, destructive habits of pets, and a transient household status. Various stages of the family's "life cycle" had a role in determining pet ownership. The pet's agreeable temperament (eg, intelligence, gentleness, and playfulness) was considered to be the major advantages of pet ownership. The major negative characteristics of pet ownership were the destructiveness and overaggressiveness of the pet.
