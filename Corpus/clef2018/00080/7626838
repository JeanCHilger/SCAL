Head trauma: use of SPECT. Brain damage inflicted by head trauma may not be visible on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This is true not only for mild head trauma, but also for moderate and severe head trauma. Perfusion imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography has proved in several controlled studies to be more sensitive than either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in detecting brain abnormalities in patients with head trauma.
