Clinical evaluation of 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigram in patients with valvular heart disease. Myocardial sympathetic nerve function can be evaluated by 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy. Congestive heart failure is closely related to myocardial sympathetic nerve function. This study evaluated the severity of congestive heart failure in 30 patients with valvular heart disease [aortic regurgitation (AR): n = 20, mean age = 70 +/- 13 years mitral regurgitation (MR): n = 10, mean age = 61 +/- 18 years], who had chronic heart failure by MIBG myocardial scintigraphy. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and anterior planar myocardial images were obtained 15 minutes (initial images) and 4 hours (delayed images) after injection of MIBG (111MBq). Defect score was determined by the delayed SPECT images visually as a semi-quantitative index. Myocardial MIBG uptake was quantified by the heart to upper mediastinum uptake ratio on the delayed anterior planar images (H/M) and mean cardiac MIBG washout rate during 4 hours was calculated from the bull's eye display data (clearance). These indices were compared with the NYHA class and echocardiographic findings of the patients. MIBG regional defect in the delayed image was most frequently seen in the inferoposterior wall, and defect score and clearance were significantly higher and the H/M ratio was significantly lower in NYHA class III patients than in class II patients. In patients with AR, clearance significantly correlated with left ventricular end-systolic dimension. In patients with MR, both the H/M ratio and clearance significantly correlated with left atrial dimension. Defect score, H/M, and clearance were closely related to the severity of AR and MR. These results indicate that MIBG scan can be used to assess the severity of valvular heart disease.
