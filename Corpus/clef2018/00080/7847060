Quantitative SPECT cisternography in normal pressure hydrocephalus. Twenty-one patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), 8 patients with various brain diseases with an element of hydrocephalus, and 7 patients with miscellaneous dementia disorders were investigated with quantitative radionuclide cisternography (RC) using single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). The total intracranial counts as well as the counts in the lateral and third ventricles were measured. All 15 NPH patients accessible for postoperative examination were improved after shunt surgery. In all groups the ventricular and total intracranial counts level increased during the measurement period but remained constant in distribution in each group. The NPH patients had a higher relative count value in the lateral and third ventricles compared to the patients with miscellaneous dementia disorders. The relative values in the third and lateral ventricles were predictive for the outcome of shunt surgery. Quantitative SPECT RC appears to be a useful diagnostic procedure in NPH investigations.
