Computerized localization of brain structures in single photon emission computed tomography using a proportional anatomical stereotactic atlas. An accurate identification of cerebral structures is necessary to perform quantification of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). We have developed an anatomical localization system that accounts for individual brain shapes and sizes by using the Talairach proportional grid system. The locations of the commissural lines, which define the stereotactic coordinate system, are calculated from the external landmarks provided by the canthomeatal line. This is validated on MRI images. When applied to SPECT data, the use of a neuroanatomical atlas data along with the automaticity of the processing guarantees a high degree of objectivity and inter-observer reproducibility.
