Successful prevention of neurological deficit in SAH patients with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. Twenty patients suffering from subarachnoid haemorrhage due to ruptured intracranial aneurysm and operated on within 72 h after SAH were treated with an experimental immunosuppressive drug 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA), dose 0.05 mg/kg/day i.v. for 7 days. The 2-CDA treatment was started immediately after angiographic confirmation of ruptured aneurysm, and the standard pharmacological treatment (nimodipine and steroids) was also given. 50% of patients were severely threatened by "delayed vasospasm" or late neurological deficit (Fisher's score 3 or 4). The neurological outcome (assessed 8-12 weeks after SAH) was good (GOS = 1) in 70%, and fair (moderate disability, GOS = 2) in 25%. A single case of severe disability (GOS = 3), as well as two cases of less than perfect outcome (GOS = 2), were related to unusual pre- or intraoperative complications. We conclude that the low doses of 2-CDA can be considered as a valuable adjunct to the standard pharmacotherapy of SAH patients operated on early.
