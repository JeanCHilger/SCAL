Diagnosis of intracranial lymphoma in patients with AIDS: value of 201TI single-photon emission computed tomography. Although the prevalence of intracranial lymphoma is high among patients with AIDS, current imaging techniques are not reliable for differentiating this tumor from other common nonneoplastic lesions, such as those seen in toxoplasmosis. The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate the use of 201Tl single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in identifying intracranial lymphoma in patients with AIDS.Thirteen patients with AIDS and intracranial masses underwent 201Tl imaging with a three-headed SPECT camera. Sic of the 13 were subsequently proved to have lymphoma. Studies were interpreted prospectively as showing tumor if uptake of 201Tl was increased in the region where the lesion was seen on MR images. A lesion-to-nonlesion uptake ratio (counts/pixel) was calculated retrospectively.The SPECT images of six patients were interpreted prospectively as showing no lymphoma. Uptake ratios in these six patients were 0.77-1.95 (mean, 1.45). In each, tumor was excluded as a final diagnosis (four had toxoplasmosis, one had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and one had venous angioma). Among the seven patients with SPECT images interpreted as showing lymphoma, six were later proved to have lymphoma (uptake ratio: mean, 3.65 range, 2.95-4.30This preliminary study indicates that 201Tl SPECT might be a useful, noninvasive method for differentiating intracranial lymphoma from nonneoplastic lesions in patients with AIDS.
