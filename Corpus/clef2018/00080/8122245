Husbandry-related diseases in the chinchilla. The developing popularity of the chinchilla as a pet over recent years has increased its importance in veterinary practice. The husbandry of pet chinchillas differs significantly from that in commercial fur farms, where the veterinary input is directed towards diseases of animal groups. Veterinary advice and prophylaxis is particularly important for pet chinchillas, as there is relatively little literature about their husbandry and relevant diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The owners of this 'new' companion animal frequently lack relevant knowledge, and many chinchillas are presented due to inadequate husbandry and feeding. Therefore this report describes the physiology, the management and feeding requirements and examination methods. A selection of the most frequent diseases caused by poor husbandry is presented.
