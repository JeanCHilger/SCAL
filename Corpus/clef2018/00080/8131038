Abnormal pattern of cerebral glucose metabolic rates involving language areas in young adults with Down syndrome. Correlational and discriminant analyses were applied to "resting" state (eyes covered, ears plugged) regional cerebral glucose metabolic data, obtained with positron emission tomography (PET) and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose in 14 retarded adults with Down syndrome (10 men, 4 women age 26-38 years) and 17 age- and sex-matched controls. Down and control subjects showed no differences in the pattern of correlations. However, a discriminant function, reflecting regional interactions involving primary language areas, successfully classified the Down (100%) and control (88%) subjects. The results are consistent with a disruption of brain regional interactions involving language areas in adults with Down syndrome.
