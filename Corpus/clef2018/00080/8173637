Indirect contact with pets can confound the effect of cleaning procedures for reduction of animal allergen levels in house dust. To investigate the capacity of common vacuum cleaners and chemical treatment to reduce cat (Fel d I) and dog (Can f I) allergen content in house dust, 52 families with allergic children and no pets at home were recruited. Five groups of 10-11 families used their central vacuum cleaners (n = 10), their own old vacuum cleaners plus either tannic acid (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) applied to carpets and upholstry after the first sample was collected on Day 0 or new vacuum cleaners equipped with either HEPA (high efficiency particulate air)- (n = 11) or microfilters (n = 10). Dust samples were collected from carpets and upholstered furniture in the living rooms and from the mattresses of the children on Days 0, 7, 21, and 35. Fel d I and Can f I allergens were determined by sandwich ELISA methods. Central, micro-filter and HEPA-filter vacuum cleaners did not reduce the concentrations nor the total amount/sampling area of Fel d I or Can f I. Tannic acid initially reduced (p < 0.05) both the concentration and the total amount of Fel d I by 30% and Can f I by 10%, but only for one week. The levels increased to base-line after 21-35 days. The concentrations of Fel d I increased 10-30 times in homes visited by cats or cat owners. We conclude, that tannic acid treatment reduced pet allergen concentrations and total amounts in dust for one week only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
