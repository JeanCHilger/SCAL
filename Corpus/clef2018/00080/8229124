Metabolic monitoring of breast cancer chemohormonotherapy using positron emission tomography: initial evaluation. We assessed the feasibility of noninvasive metabolic monitoring of cancer chemohormonotherapy using sequential quantitative positron emission tomographic (PET) scans of tumor glucose metabolism with the glucose analog 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG).Eleven women with newly diagnosed primary breast cancers larger than 3 cm in diameter beginning a chemohormonotherapy program underwent a baseline and four follow-up quantitative PET scans during the first three cycles of treatment (days 0 to 63). Tumor response was sequentially determined clinically, radiographically, and then pathologically after nine treatment cycles.Eight patients had partial or complete pathologic responses. Their maximal tumor uptake of FDG assessed by PET decreased promptly with treatment to the following: day 8, 78 +/- 9.2% (P < .03) day 21, 68.1 +/- 7.5% (P < .025)Quantitative FDG PET scans of primary breast cancers showed a rapid and significant decrease in tumor glucose metabolism after effective treatment was initiated, with the reduction in metabolism antedating any decrement in tumor size. No significant decrease in FDG uptake (SUV) after three cycles of treatment was observed in the nonresponding patients. FDG PET scanning has substantial promise as an early noninvasive metabolic marker of the efficacy of cancer treatment.
