Gated blood pool SPECT and phase analysis to assess simulated Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in the baboon. This study assesses the diagnostic potential of a tomographic technique with phase analysis to detect premature electroventricular contraction patterns simulated by pacing in the baboon. The data of gated SPECT were analysed by backprojection of the Fourier coefficients, followed by angulation and integration to thick slices of the entire ventricular mass yielding separate ventricular contraction patterns in three perpendicular views. Electrodes were implanted in each baboon: at the sinoatrial node posterior, left ventricular
