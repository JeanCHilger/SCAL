Brain SPECT with 123I-labelled iodobenzamide (IBZM): aspects of semiquantitative evaluation. The striatal dopamine-D2-receptor uptake of 123I-IBZM in 32 patients (18 without and 14 under therapy with typical neuroleptics) was measured semiquantitatively using different ROI techniques. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of these techniques on the different ratios (striatum/cortex) found by various examiners. Using the same SPECT system no major differences were found between rectangular and manually drawn ROIs of the same size. All ROI techniques could differentiate between patients with and without therapy on a highly significant level. Therefore, the resulting ratio is mainly dependent on the spatial resolution of the camera system and only to a relatively minor extent on the ROI technique. Ratios obtained by different observers are not comparable quantitatively.
