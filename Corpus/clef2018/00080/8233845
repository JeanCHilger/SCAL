Highlights and trends--German Society of Nuclear Medicine, Annual Meeting 1993 in Cologne. The lecture presented at the end of the annual meeting 1993 of the German Nuclear Medicine Society in Cologne contrasts with the usual form of "high-light lecture". The aim was to elucidate developments and to analyse trends in nuclear medicine between the '87 congress in Freiburg and the '93 meeting. This analysis covered the following topics: In-vitro tests, magnetic resonance imaging, therapy with radioisotopes, "newly" developed tracers, methods and their comparison, correlative studies, interventional activities, relationship of the presented papers to daily clinical routine and, finally, scope and size of the study populations. Only few scientific contributions were mentioned to support the trend analysis presented.
