The use of PET in Parkinson's disease. Activation studies with positron emission tomography (PET) have provided an understanding of the pathophysiology of akinesia and tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD). [18F]6-fluoro-L-dopa (FD)-PET and dopamine receptor imaging by PET can assist in the differential diagnosis of various forms of parkinsonism. FED-PET is capable of detecting subclinical dopaminergic deficits. This allows not only the early or preclinical detection of PD but also the investigation of subclinical lesions of the substantia nigra in PD-related disorders. Longitudinal studies of PD and MPTP induced parkinsonism have provided new insight into the pathogenesis of PD.
