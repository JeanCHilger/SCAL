The clinical impact of thallium-201 reinjection for the detection of myocardial hibernation. Thallium-201 reinjection improves detection of hibernating myocardium in about 30%-50% of persisting defects. The main goal of cardiac revascularization techniques is amelioration of clinical symptoms such as angina and dyspnoea however, improvement in regional and global pump function is an additional and important target. The aim of this study was to investigate whether fill-in in the reinjection study is correlated with improved contractile function after treatment (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/aortocoronary bypass surgery). We studied 32 patients with coronary heart disease and impaired regional wall motion (RWM). RWM and ejection fraction (EF) were assessed by analysing ventriculographic images using the centreline method (values in standard deviations from mean values found in a healthy control group). Three 201Tl single-photon emission tomographic studies (stress, redistribution and reinjection) were performed prior to revascularization and analysed using a bull s-eye scheme. Patients were divided into two groups (group FI-=no fill-in, n=16
