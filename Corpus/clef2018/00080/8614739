Dynamic computed tomography in the characterization of focal hepatic lesions. The main goal of our study was to test dynamic CT capability to characterize focal liver lesions. We examined 57 patients: 6 were affected with focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), 19 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 1 with a regenerating nodule on cirrhosis 14 patients had metastases, 3 focal fatty infiltration, 1 a necrotic nodule, 1 a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 a cysto-adeno-cholangiocarcinoma and 11 hemangiomas. All lesions were identified with US and the diagnosis was confirmed with the gold standard technique--that is, biopsy or surgery, and red blood cell SPECT for hemangiomas. All lesions were studied with a CT multiphase protocol consisting of a single-level dynamic phase followed by an incremental dynamic phase and finally by a delayed phase to study prolonged and delayed enhancement. Single-level dynamic bolus CT requires an injection of 60 ml nonionic contrast agent administered with a power injector into a cubital vein, at a rate of 5 ml/s. Scanning begins 10 seconds after the injection and consists of 6 series of 2 scans each
