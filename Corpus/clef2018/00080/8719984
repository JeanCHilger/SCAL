Can the microsphere model by applied to cerebral blood flow measurement using N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine with SPET regardless of washout from brain tissue? The microsphere model and the continuous withdrawal of arterial blood have commonly been used in clinical studies when measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (IMP) single photon emission tomography. The method is considered to underestimate rCBF because of the washout of tracer from brain tissue however, the extent of this underestimation is not known. To assess whether this underestimation can be determined quantitatively, we performed simulation analysis based on the microsphere model and the two-compartment model [influx, K1(rCBF)
