Immunoscintigraphy for the detection of brain abscesses. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the diagnostic usefulness of a 99Tcm-anti-granulocyte antibody in the early differentiation of the aetiology of a ring-enhancing structure on computed tomography (CT) scans following neurosurgical intervention. In 26 patients (15 males, 11 females) aged 20-82 years with suspected intracranial infection, 29 SPET scans of the head were obtained 4-6 h following the intravenous injection of 555 MBq 99Tcm-anti-granulocyte antibody. The patients had antibiotic, antimycotic or corticosteroid therapy. The diagnosis was confirmed by surgery (19 cases) or subsequent CT/MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans and clinical follow-up (10 cases). The immunoscan was true-positive (abscess) in 6 (sensitivity = 100%), true-negative in 19 and false-positive in 4 (specificity 83%) cases. There was no obvious detrimental effect on the results due to the antibiotic, antimycotic or corticosteroid therapy. In conclusion, despite false-positive results, the 99Tcm-anti-granulocyte antibody is a useful tool in the early detection and exclusion of intracranial abscess after neurosurgical interventions.
