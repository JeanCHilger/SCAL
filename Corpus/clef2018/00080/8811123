Vascular changes in the cerebral cortex in HIV-1 infection. II. An immunohistochemical and lectinhistochemical investigation. In human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients, a hypoperfusion is seen by SPECT analyses in different brain regions but a specific pattern for the predominance of a specific brain region has not been found. The vessels of the cerebral cortex of the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) brains and control brains were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and lectin histochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed for collagen IV, laminin (basal lamina), and factor VIII (endothelial cell) and lectin histochemistry [Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA-I), Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA-I), wheatgerm agglutinin (WGA) and soybean agglutinin (SBA)] was used to study changes of glycoproteins in the endothelial cell membrane. Vessels were counted in the gray and white matter, and their staining intensity for the different antibodies and lectins was rated using a three-point scale. Immunoreactivity for collagen IV was reduced in AIDS brains, which may be related to thinning of the basal lamina of cerebral vessels, as has previously been shown by electron microscopy. Lectin histochemistry with SBA, UEA-I and WGA indicated loss of glycoproteins in the membrane of endothelial cells. The data from the present study show morphological changes of the endothelial cells and of the basal lamina in the brain of individuals with AIDS, and might represent the morphological sequelae of a disturbed blood-brain barrier, or may account for the hypoperfusion seen in SPECT analyses.
