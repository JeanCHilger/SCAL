Older people and attachment to things, places, pets, and ideas. A model of older adult to environment interactions is proposed that moves beyond the perspective of environment as safety hazard to environment as supportive resource the framework encourages health professionals to look for ways to incorporate positive environmental influences into individualized plans of care with older adults. Research is reviewed on the attachments formed by older adults to things, places, companion animals, ideas, and beliefs-which alongside people-to-people attachments comprise the "attachment structure." Research on attachments of older people to environmental objects identifies important sources of security, belonging, and self-identity. Further research is needed to define the nature of environmental connections in later life, their developmental characteristics, and their potential to influence the health of older people.
