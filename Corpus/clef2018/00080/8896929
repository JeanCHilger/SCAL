Muscular uptake of Tc-99m MIBI and TI-201 in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Lack of dystrophin, a protein localized to the inner surface of the sarcolemma of the muscle fiber, is the cause of Duchenne type muscular dystrophy. Plasma membrane damage of the muscular fiber occurs, followed by Ca++ influx into the fibers. There is severe mitochondrial damage in dystrophic but still viable fibers. Five children aged 5-7 years were studied with MRI, TI-201, and Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy of the thighs. These three methods showed that the sartorius is the least damaged muscle in Duchenne type muscular dystrophy. MRI showed mild damage of adductors and quadriceps TI-201 scintigraphy showed a marked reduction of radioactivity in the same muscles
