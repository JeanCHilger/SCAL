Increased mu opioid receptor binding detected by PET in cocaine-dependent men is associated with cocaine craving. The endogenous opioid system has been recently implicated in the reinforcing actions of cocaine and other addictive drugs. In this study we examined mu opioid receptor binding in ten cocaine-dependent men and seven nonaddicted controls using positron emission tomography and [11C] carfentanil. Mu opioid binding was increased in several brain regions of the cocaine addicts studied 1-4 days after their last use of cocaine. Binding was positively correlated with the severity of cocaine craving experienced at the time. The upregulation of mu opioid receptor binding persisted after 4 weeks of monitored cocaine abstinence. These findings demonstrate for the first time the involvement of the endogenous opioid system in cocaine dependence and cocaine craving in living human subjects.
