A quantitative study of regional cerebral blood flow in patients with dementia of Alzheimer type using single photon emission computed tomography--clinical application of the IMP autoradiographic method (IMP ARG method). We quantitatively measured regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 37 patients with dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) to investigate the clinical utilities of the N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine autoradiographic method (IMP ARG method) that is a quantitative method more simplified and less invasive for IMP-SPECT developed by Iida et al. A given standard input function and a given value of distribution volume (Vd) used for the rCBF measurement of this method were calculated from the dynamic study by six normal volunteers. Mean values [SD] of rCBF (ml/ 100 g/min) in the Cerebral Cortex were 49.0 [6.0] in the controls (n = 20), 42.6 [5.9] in mild DAT group (n = 14), 36.7 [5.5] in moderate DAT group (n = 12), and 26.4 [7.5] in severe DAT group (n = 11), respectively. These values were significantly different between each neighboring group. Moreover, the correlations between the score by the Hasegawa dementia scale (HDS-R) and each rCBF were significant in the temporal, parietal, and frontal cortex. These findings suggest that the rCBF measurement in IMP-SPECT using this method is useful for the diagnosis of the clinical severity in patients with DAT.
