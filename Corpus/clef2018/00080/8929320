Oncological applications of positron emission tomography with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose. Positron emission tomography (PET) is now primarily used in oncological indication owing to the successful application of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in an increasing number of clinical indications at different stages of diagnosis, and for staging and follow-up. This review first considers the biological characteristics of FDG and then discusses methodological considerations regarding its use. Clinical indications are considered, and the results achieved in respect of various organs and tumour types are reviewed in depth. The review concludes with a brief consideration of the ways in which clinical PET might be improved.
