Comparative evaluation of [3H]WIN 35428 and [3H]GBR 12935 as markers of dopamine innervation density in brain. WIN 35428 and GBR 12935, two uptake blocker ligands of the membrane transporter for dopamine (DA), were evaluated as quantitative markers of DA innervation density in CNS tissue. From alternate rat brain slices respectively processed for either light microscope or film autoradiography, counts of DA axon terminals (varicosities) labeled by uptake/storage of [3H]DA were matched with densitometric measurements of the specific binding of [3H]WIN 35428 and [3H]GBR 12935 in the same anatomical areas. The relation between the two parameters was examined in 1) the normal cingulate cortex 2) the neostriatum severely DA-denervated by unilateral intramesencephalic injections of 6-hydroxydopamine
