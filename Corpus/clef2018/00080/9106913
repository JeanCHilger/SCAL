In vivo effects on striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding by the novel atypical antipsychotic drug sertindole--a 123I IBZM single photon emission tomography (SPET) study. The novel antipsychotic drug sertindole has an atypical pharmacological profile. We have estimated striatal D2 dopamine binding in schizophrenic patients treated with sertindole using 123I iodobenzamide (IBZM) SPET. Patients were recruited from a clinical trial of sertindole's tolerability and efficacy. Striatal D2 binding in sertindole-treated patients (n = 5), was compared with previously reported data from clozapine (n = 10) olanzapine (n = 6)
