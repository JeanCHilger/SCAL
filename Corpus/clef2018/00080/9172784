High-level expression and purification of a human "mini"-hexokinase. Human hexokinase type I is a 100-kDa enzyme with the catalytic site located in the C-terminal domain. We had previously expressed this domain in Escherichia coli, however only a small amount of the recombinant enzyme was catalytically active. To overcome this problem we have now expressed the "mini"-hexokinase using the pET expression system. An average of 1000 U of enzyme per liter of culture was obtained. The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity by a combination of ion-exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, and dye-ligand chromatography. The enzyme was unstable under ultrafiltration thus, a multicolumn purification procedure was developed in order to avoid the ultrafiltration steps. The recombinant "mini"-hexokinase was found to have the same kinetic properties as the entire enzyme. Using the method described, the enzyme can be obtained in sufficient quantities for biophysical and biochemical investigations.
