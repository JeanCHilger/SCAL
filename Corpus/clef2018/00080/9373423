Brain blood flow in anxiety disorders. OCD, panic disorder with agoraphobia, and post-traumatic stress disorder on 99mTcHMPAO single photon emission tomography (SPET). We compared regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in three groups of patients with DSM-III-R anxiety disorders.Fifteen patients with obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD), 15 with panic disorder with agoraphobia (PA), and 16 with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a similar group of healthy controls were assessed on brain-dedicated high-resolution SPET.MANOVA revealed significant rCBF differences between diagnostic groups (F = 4.4 d.f. = 3, 57Functional rCBF differences in anxiety disorders could relate to repetitive, intrusive, distressing mental activity, prominent in both OCD and PTSD.
