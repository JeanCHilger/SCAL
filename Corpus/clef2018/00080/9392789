Diagnostic usefulness of lung SPET in pulmonary thromboembolism: an outcome study. The lung single photon emission tomographic (SPET) images of 985 consecutive patients referred for suspected pulmonary embolism were correlated with clinical outcome and angiography to evaluate the clinical usefulness of lung SPET compared to conventional planar ventilation/perfusion lung imaging. SPET interpretations followed the revised PIOPED criteria and clinical outcome was determined from referring physicians, hospital records, direct patient contact and county hall records. Patients were deemed to have had no clinically significant pulmonary embolism at the time of the SPET examination if, within the following 3 months: (1) the patient was alive and had no clinical evidence of pulmonary embolism or, (2) if deceased, pulmonary embolism was unlikely to have been the cause of death. Operating characteristics were based on the methods of Choi and of Simel. SPET interpretation was categorized as follows: high probability, 143 (14%) low probability, 840 (82%)
