Is Helicobacter pylori transmitted from cats to humans? Subsequent to the isolation of Helicobacter pylori from domestic cats, it has been suggested that the organism might be transmitted from cats to humans. This hypothesis has already gained considerable media attention.In a previous study of risk factors for H. pylori infection, 447 factory workers from Stoke on Trent in the UK had provided blood samples for H. pylori serological workup. They had also completed a detailed questionnaire concerning their living conditions, including the possession of any household pets, in childhood. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between cat ownership in childhood and H. pylori seropositivity.After adjustment for potential confounders, it was found that subjects who had owned a pet as a child were slightly more likely to be H. pylori seropositive than subjects who had not. There was, however, no difference between subjects who had owned a cat and those with other pets.These data do not support the hypothesis that H. pylori infection might be transmitted from cats to humans.
