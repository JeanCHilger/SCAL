Rapid detection of acute appendicitis with Tc-99m-labeled intact polyvalent human immune globulin. Acute appendicitis remains problematic for emergency clinicians. A rapid and definitive test is needed for detecting acute appendicitis before surgical intervention. The purpose of this clinical trial was to determine the efficacy of Tc-99m-labeled intact polyvalent human immune globulin (Tc-99m IgG) in the evaluation of acute appendicitis.Thirty-five patients with clinically suspected acute appendicitis were evaluated with Tc-99m IgG. After the intravenous injection of 25 mCi (92.5 MBq) of Tc-99m IgG, anterior flow, single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and planar delayed images of the abdomen were obtained. Any abnormal focal uptake of Tc-99m IgG in the right lower quadrant was considered to be a positive scan.Twenty-one patients with a positive Tc-99m IgG scan underwent laparotomy and were found to have acute appendicitis. Of the 14 patients who had negative scans, 7 underwent surgery. In this series, Tc-99m IgG study yielded 21 true-positive, 12 true-negative, and 2 false-negative results with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 91%, 100%, and 94%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 86%, respectively. There were no false-positive results.Tc-99m IgG scintigraphy can provide the clinicians a simple, rapid, and definitive test for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
