Graphical 3D medical image registration and quantification. We present a graphical three-dimensional method that facilitates image registration and fusion, and provides quantitative geometric and volume information. In particular it enhances the use of functional (radiopharmaceutical) imaging (SPECT, PET) which, though a powerful clinical tool, has the disadvantage of low spatial resolution and ill-defined boundaries. Registration between functional images and structural images (MRI, CT) can augment the anatomical context of these functional images.
