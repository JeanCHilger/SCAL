123Iodo-MK-801: a spect agent for imaging the pattern and extent of glutamate (NMDA) receptor activation in Alzheimer's disease. Glutamate, and the NMDA glutamate receptor, may be involved in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Reductions in NMDA receptors are found in AD, possibly contributing to memory deficits. However the NMDA receptor is involved in excitotoxicity, which may play a role in cell death and the production of neurofibrillary tangles in AD although with lower levels of glutamate than occur in cerebral ischaemia. Therefore reductions in the NMDA receptor may worsen memory deficit in AD, but increased stimulation of the receptor may contribute to the progress of the disease. MK-801 has been used to image excessive glutamate activation following ischaemia in rats. However, it is unclear how effective MK-801 is in conditions with lower levels of glutamate release. This study attempts to gain insight into the utility of the tracer in these conditions, exploring glutamatergic mechanisms in AD. It describes the retention and elimination of 123iodo-MK-801 in five AD and five control subjects, comparing this to regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). The initial uptake of 123I-MK-801 is dominated by delivery of the ligand. However, despite significant reductions in rCBF in the AD patients, there is no significant difference in the uptake of 123I-MK-801. This suggests increased retention of 123I-MK-801 in the AD patients. In addition the washout of 123I-MK-801 was less in the AD patients, again suggesting increased retention, although this only reached significance in one region. Theses data hint at possible increases in NMDA activation in AD but ultimately 123I-MK-801 does not provide a sufficiently accurate measurement to demonstrate this conclusively. Further NMDA ligands are now at a late stage of development and may provide more conclusive answers to the role of glutamate in AD.
