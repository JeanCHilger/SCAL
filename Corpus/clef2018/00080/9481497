Hematopoietic cytokine-mediated FDG uptake simulates the appearance of diffuse metastatic disease on whole-body PET imaging. FDG-PET is increasingly being used to assess malignant tumors. However, leukocyte colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), which promote the expansion of hematopoietic bone marrow, have also been demonstrated to cause increased bone-marrow FDG uptake. Three hundred FDG-PET studies conducted over a 1-year period were reviewed for diffuse bone-marrow uptake. Elevated bone-marrow uptake on PET was correlated with pathological findings and courses of granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) therapy. These results demonstrate that G-CSF mediated FDG uptake in bone marrow is often indistinguishable from that caused by disseminated metastatic disease. However, the bone-marrow response to G-CSF decreases rapidly following the last CSF administration. Therefore, FDG-PET in patients receiving G-CSF should be delayed, when possible, until 5 days after the end of G-CSF therapy.
