Imaging of cerebral blood flow with technetium-99m-HMPAO and technetium-99m-ECD: a comparison. Because 99mTc-HMPAO and 99mTc-ECD are both used for SPECT imaging of cerebral blood flow, the question arises whether there are any differences in their respective regional cerebral distribution. For that purpose, visual and semiquantitative comparisons between 99mTc-HMPAO and 99mTc-ECD studies were performed.Seventeen patients (4 women 13 menVisual evaluation demonstrated relatively high 99mTc-ECD uptake in occipital and comparatively low uptake in mediotemporal regions. Calculation of RI revealed significantly higher values in the right cerebellum, brainstem, mediotemporal regions, right basal ganglia and the thalamus in the 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT studies and higher values in the occipital, supratemporal/inferior parietal and parietal cortex in the 99mTc-ECD SPECT studies, respectively.Significant differences in regional tracer distribution between 99mTc-HMPAO and 99mTc-ECD could be detected, probably caused by different tracer kinetics. The results indicate that direct comparisons of studies performed with 99mTc-HMPAO and 99mTc-ECD are not possible and the use of either tracer can be favorable in different clinical questions.
