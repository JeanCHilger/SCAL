Effect of regional myocardial perfusion abnormalities on regional myocardial early diastolic function in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Nonuniform hypertrophy of the left ventricle is an important factor in regional diastolic dysfunction in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, the effect of myocardial perfusion abnormalities on regional diastolic dysfunction has not been established in patients with HCM. We investigated the relationship between regional myocardial perfusion abnormalities and regional early diastolic function in 31 patients with HCM and 8 control patients. Short-axis images of the left ventricle recorded by cine magnetic resonance imaging were divided into ten blocks. The time-to-peak-wall-thickness-thinning rate (TPWR) and the wall thickness were measured in each block. Of the 310 blocks from the patients with HCM, 242 (78%) showed normal thallium-201 uptake (group 1), 40 (13%) showed slightly decreased uptake (group 2), and 28 (9%) showed markedly decreased uptake (group 3). There was no difference in the regional wall thickness among the three groups. The TPWR was longer in patients with HCM than in control patients. It was significantly longer in group 3 (190+/-45ms) than in group 1 (167+/-36 ms) and group 2 (160+/-31 ms). (P < 0.01). The linear regression slope of the relationship between the TPWR and the regional wall thickness was significantly steeper in group 3 than in groups 1 and 2 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, abnormalities in regional myocardial perfusion, in addition to regional hypertrophy, contributed to the regional early diastolic dysfunction in patients with HCM.
