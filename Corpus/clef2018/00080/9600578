Isradipine prevents global and regional cocaine-induced changes in brain blood flow: a preliminary study. The L-type calcium channel antagonist, isradipine, reduces brain ischemia in animal models of ischemic stroke. These effects of isradipine appear more pronounced in dopamine (DA) rich brain regions. These same DA-rich brain regions have also been shown to be the areas most affected by cocaine-induced ischemic changes. Using a novel quantified approach to single photon emission computerized tomography, we demonstrated that isradipine pre-treatment prevented cocaine-induced ischemic changes, especially in these DA-rich brain regions. This is the first demonstration that any medication, including isradipine, can prevent the ischemic effects of cocaine on brain blood flow. Isradipine may, therefore, be a useful therapeutic agent for the prevention of brain ischemia in cocaine addicts.
