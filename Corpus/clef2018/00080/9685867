Thermal control of drug release by a responsive ion track membrane observed by radio tracer flow dialysis. The combination of a responsive hydrogel with a rigid porous supporting structure yield a membrane with high mechanical strength and high on-off-permeability ratio. A membrane consisting of an ion track filter with a thermally responsive lining was prepared by penetrating a 19 micron thick foil of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) with swift heavy ions at a fluence of 5 x 10(5) ions/cm2, followed by etching of the ion tracks to generate an ion track filter with 2.9 micron pore diameter, onto which a thin layer of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (NIPAAm) hydrogel was grafted. It was revealed that the mass flow of various molecules (water, chloride-, choline+, insulin, and albumin) through the membrane could be thermally controlled. The on-off-permeability ratio ranged between 3 and 10 increasing with molecular weight. Over a storage time of 5 months the permeabilities varied up to a factor of 2.6, while the on-off-permeability ratio and temperature sensitivity remained practically constant.
