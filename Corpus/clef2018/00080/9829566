Abnormality of myocardial oxidative metabolism in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this study was to evaluate oxidative metabolism and its response by dobutamine in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) using 11C-acetate PET.We studied 16 patients with NIDDM (9 men, 7 women mean age 53.7 +/- 12.8 yr) and 6 healthy male control subjects (mean age 41.8 +/- 17.2 yr). None of them had an abnormality on stress-perfusion SPECT. The 11C-acetate clearances (Kmono) were compared regionally for five myocardial segments in all subjects at rest and during low-dose dobutamine stress in 13 patients (8 patients with NIDDM, age 51.9 +/- 13.6 yrAt rest, the clearance of 11C-acetate was slightly heterogeneous for both patients with NIDDM and healthy control subjects, with smaller values in the apex and inferior wall in both groups. The difference became significant during dobutamine stress in the patients. The RPP-to-Kmono (average for five segments) ratio at rest was slightly smaller in the patients (1042.7 +/- 559.1 x 0.01) than in the healthy control subjects (1391.4 +/- 209.6 x 0.01, not significant), and those during dobutamine stress were almost the same in the two groups (1457.3 +/- 737.4 x 0.01 and 1486.0 +/- 211.8 x 0.01, respectively). A significant correlation was seen between regional Kmono and RPP in every segment in the healthy control subjects (average r = 0.89Patients with NIDDM showed slight regional heterogeneity in myocardial oxidative metabolism. They also had more scattered correlation between myocardial oxidative metabolism and cardiac work (RPP) than healthy control subjects, with the smallest correlation coefficient observed in the inferior wall. These findings may help the understanding of dynamics in myocardial oxidative metabolism of NIDDM hearts.
