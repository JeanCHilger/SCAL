Changes of endothelin-1 and atrial natriuretic peptide during dobutamine stress echocardiography. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations in patients with ischemic heart disease are related either to myocardial ischemia or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction during dobutamine stress echocardiography. Plasma concentrations of ET-1 and ANP were measured in three patient groups. Group I (n = 21) patients had normal stress echocardiography and a resting LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% or more. Group II (n = 32) had positive stress echocardiography and a resting LVEF of more than 40%. Group III (n = 18) had positive stress echocardiography with a resting LVEF of less than 40%. All three groups were subjected to thallium 201 scintigraphy and coronary angiography studies. The resting LV end-diastolic pressure was significantly higher in groups II and III than in Group I. The LVEF decreased significantly in group III compared to groups I and II. In the resting state, groups II and III had higher ET-1 concentrations than Group I (p = 0.021 and p = 0.039, respectively). The plasma ANP concentration was higher in group III than in groups I and II (p = 0.005 and p = 0.054, respectively). During peak dobutamine infusion, the ET-1 concentration dropped 8.7% from the baseline in group I, 10.2% in group II, and 10.5% in group III. The ANP concentrations were increased in all three groups but only the increase in Group II reached statistical significance. In conclusion, in patients with suspected ischemic heart disease, the concentrations of ET-1 and ANP may predict significant anatomic and functional coronary artery disease. However, ET-1 does not play a pathophysiologic role during an ischemic attack.
