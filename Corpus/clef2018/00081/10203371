Effect of normalization of hematocrit on brain circulation and metabolism in hemodialysis patients. Full correction of anemia with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) has been reported to reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Effects of normalization of hematocrit on cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism were investigated by positron emission tomography. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), cerebral blood volume (rCBV), oxygen extraction ratio (rOER), and metabolic rate for oxygen (rCMRO2) were measured in seven HD patients before and after correction of anemia and compared with those in six healthy control subjects. In addition, blood rheology before and on rhEPO therapy was measured in HD patients, which included blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, erythrocyte fluidity, and erythrocyte aggregability. The results showed that plasma viscosity was high (1.51+/-0.19 mPa x s) and erythrocyte fluidity was low (85.8+/-4.8 Pa(-1) x s(-1)), while whole blood viscosity was within the normal range (3.72+/-0.38 mPa x s) before rhEPO therapy. After treatment, the hematocrit rose significantly from 29.3+/-3.3 to 42.4+/-2.2% (P<0.001), accompanied by a significant increase in the whole blood viscosity to 4.57+/-0.16 mPa x s, nonsignificant decrease in erythrocyte fluidity to 79.9+/-7.4 mPa(-1) x s(-1) and nonsignificant change in plasma viscosity (1.46+/-1.3 mPa x s). Positron emission tomography measurements revealed that by normalization of hematocrit, rCBF significantly decreased from 65+/-11 to 48+/-12 ml/min per 100 cm3 (P<0.05). However, arterial oxygen content (caO2) significantly increased from 5.7+/-0.7 to 8.0+/-0.4 mmol/L (P<0.0001), rOER of the hemispheres significantly increased from 44+/-3 to 51+/-6% (P<0.05) and became significantly higher than healthy control subjects (P<0.05). In addition, rCBV significantly increased from 3.5+/-0.5 to 4.6+/-0.6 ml/100 cc brain tissue. The results showed that oxygen supply to the brain tissue increased with normalization of hematocrit, but it was accompanied by increased oxygen extraction in the brain tissue. This may be assumed to be related to the decrease of erythrocyte velocity in the cerebral capillaries as a result of the decreased blood deformability and the increased plasma viscosity.
