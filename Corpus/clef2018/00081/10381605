Non-chemical inhibition of respiratory motor output during mechanical ventilation in sleeping humans. 1. To determine the magnitude and time course of changes in respiratory motor output caused by non-chemical influences, six sleeping subjects underwent assist-control mechanical ventilation (ACMV) at increased tidal volume (VT). During ACMV, end-tidal PCO2 (PET,CO2) was either held at normocapnic levels (PET,CO2, 0.6-1.1 mmHg > control) by adding CO2 to the inspirate, or it was allowed to fall (hypocapnia). 2. Each sleeping subject underwent several repeat trials of twenty-five ACMV breaths (VT, 1.3 or 2.1 times control peak flow rate, 30-40 l min-1
