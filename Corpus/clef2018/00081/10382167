Coronary MR angiography. Coronary MR angiography has developed rapidly over the past several years. Not only is research being performed at academic centers but industry is also investing in dedicated contrast agents and cardiac MR imaging platforms. Although current coronary MR angiography has limited clinical utility, its place within the assessment of ischemic cardiac disease is evolving. The technology currently under investigation holds much promise, especially when one considers that MR has the potential to provide information currently supplied by the performance of a number of screening tests. It would be far more cost-effective to perform a single MR examination than to perform a stress echo, rest-stress nuclear medicine examination and a conventional coronary angiogram. In addition, clinicians need information about coronary flow and myocardial perfusion. Although some of this information can be currently obtained with an intravascular Doppler flow wire or by positron emission tomography, MR angiography offers the advantages of being both noninvasive and more easily accessible in comparison to either method. The combined information promised by a comprehensive cardiac MR examination that includes coronary MR angiography as a component is an exciting prospect.
