Selective visual and auditory attention toward utterances-a PET study. The purpose of this study was to reveal functional areas of the brain modulating processing of selective auditory or visual attention toward utterances. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured in six normal volunteers using positron emission tomography during two selective attention tasks and a control condition. The auditory task activated the auditory, inferior parietal, prefrontal, and anterior cingulate cortices. The visual task activated the visual association, inferior parietal, and prefrontal cortices. Both conditions activated the same area in the superior temporal sulcus. During the visual task, deactivation was observed in the auditory cortex. These results indicate that there exists a modality-dependent selective attention mechanism which activates or deactivates cortical areas in different ways.
