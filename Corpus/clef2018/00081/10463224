Brain perfusion changes after head trauma assessed by cerebral SPECT with aminophylline test. Tomographic cerebral blood flow SPECT scanning using Tc-99m-HMPAO was performed before and after i.v. administration of aminophylline in 36 patients between 6 months to 11 years after closed head trauma. Asymmetries of brain perfusion were found in 34 patients, normal rCBF distribution in 2 patients. Bi-focused asymmetries on the presumed line: trauma-contra coup were seen in 64% of the patients. In 70.4% of the patients with brain perfusion asymmetries the CT scan was normal. The aminophylline test improved the perfusion in 42% of the patients, indicating preserved perfusion reserve. Persistence of brain perfusion alterations after head trauma exists. Aminophylline test may be useful in the assessment of brain perfusion reserve in post-traumatic focus. Brain perfusion SPECT scans may be useful for medico-legal purposes.
