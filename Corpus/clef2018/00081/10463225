Tc-99m-MIBI and Tc-99m-HMPAO accumulation in primary and metastatic brain tumors assessed by brain SPECT. Imaging of intracranial lesions is frequently difficult in CT/MRI diagnosis. The introduction of the encephalic tracer MIBI seemed to be a promising alternative. We tried to compare the accumulation of Tc-99m-MIBI and HMPAO CT/MRI interpretationeally difficult intracranial lesions. We did SPECT scanning with single-head and triple-head gammacamera after i.v. administration of Tc-99m-HMPAO/MIBI. We performed HMPAO scanning in 34 patients, MIBI scanning in 41 pts. CT and MRI scanning was performed simultaneously. Histological diagnosis was done intra- and/or postoperatively. Increased accumulation of Tc-99m-MIBI was seen in 7/7 meningiomas (100%), 7/9 gliomas (77%), 10/15 brain metastases (66%), 2/4 unverified. In 5 cases with finally non-neoplastic diagnosis (stroke, a-v malformation) no MIBI accumulation was seen. Increased accumulation of HMPAO was seen in 3/11 gliomas, 2/7 meningiomas, 2/8 metastases and 2/4 unverified. In 4 cases non-neoplastic diagnosis was established. Our results seem to be less promising, than reported so far, particularly for heterogeneous accumulation of MIBI in metastatic tumours. The coupled Tc-99m-MIBI/HMPAO scanning may be useful in primary tumour diagnosis, particularly in meningiomas.
