FDG PET can replace bone scintigraphy in primary staging of malignant lymphoma. Recent studies indicated that 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET may be more accurate than CT in staging nodal and extranodal malignant lymphoma. The objective of this study was to compare conventional bone scintigraphy as an established skeletal staging procedure with PET using FDG in the detection of osseous involvement in malignant lymphoma.Whole-body PET-based staging studies of 56 consecutive patients with proven Hodgkin's disease (n = 34) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 22) were compared with the results of bone scintigraphy. Positive PET or bone scintigraphic findings were confirmed, if possible, by biopsy, MRI, CT or radiographic investigations.Of the 56 patients studied, 12 were found to have skeletal involvement on both studies (PET, 30 regions bone scintigraphy, 20 regions). Findings were confirmed in all 12 patients. FDG PET detected an additional 12 involved regions in 5 patients. This was subsequently verified in 3 patients, although the other 2 cases remained unresolved. Conversely, bone scintigraphy revealed five abnormalities compatible with lymphoma in 5 patients. Three of these lesions were found to be erroneousFDG PET is suitable for identifying osseous involvement in malignant lymphoma with a high positive predictive value and is thereby more sensitive and specific than bone scintigraphy.
