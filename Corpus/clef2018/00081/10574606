Influence of polyethylene terephthalate on the release of growth factors by human endothelial cells. The influence of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) on the release of platelet derived growth factor AB (PDGF-AB) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) by in vitro cultured human endothelial cells was assessed by enzyme immunoassay. No significant differences were observed in the production of PDGF-AB with respect to the negative control cultures. A significant increase was observed in the production of bFGF after 48 and 72 h with respect to the negative control cultures. It can be concluded that PET may induce an increase in the production of basic FGF in endothelial cells.
