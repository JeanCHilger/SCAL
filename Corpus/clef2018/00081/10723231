Neurologic complications in Wegener's granulomatosis. Nervous system involvement is relatively frequent in Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). It may be difficult to differentiate between the primary central nervous system involvement and complications secondary to concomitant arterial hypertension, renal insufficiency and iatrogenic effects of immunosuppressive therapy. The crucial role in the assessment of intracranial pathology may be ascribed to the diagnostic imaging techniques: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and cerebral blood flow imaging utilising the single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). SPECT may prove superior sensitivity to MRI. It may be especially useful in differentiating central nervous system involvement in WG with secondary changes of other origin.
