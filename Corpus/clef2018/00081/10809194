Hypofixation and hyperfixation of 99mTc-hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime in subacute cerebral infarction. The relationship between hypofixation and hyperfixation of 99mTc-hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT with regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) imaging using 133Xe inhalation in patients with subacute cerebral infarction and to investigate the behavior of 99mTc-HMPAO in the infarct area using dynamic SPECT.133Xe and consecutive 99mTC-HMPAO SPECT studies, the latter of which consisted of dynamic and static scanning, were performed on 51 patients (22 women, 29 men age range, 40-83 yThe infarct area showed hyperfixation of 99mTc-HMPAO when CBF in the area was 35 mL/100 g/min or less and showed hypofixation when CBF was >45 mL/U100 g/min. The washout rate was usually negative when CBF imaging using 133Xe inhalation was <20 mL/100 g/min but was positive when it was >45 mUL/100 g/min. The washout rate was negative when the infarct area showed hyperfixation of 99mTc-HMPAO but was positive when it showed hypofixation.99mTc-HMPAO SPECT underestimates CBF in high-flow regions and overestimates CBF in low-flow regions of subacute cerebral infarction. 99mTc-HMPAO hypofixation and hyperfixation are associated with backdiffusion from the brain to blood and gradual accumulation of hydrophilic metabolites, respectively. Dynamic images should be useful for discriminating between 99mTc-HMPAO hypofixation and hyperfixation.
