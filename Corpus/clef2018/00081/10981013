The role of transabdominal ultrasonography, helical computed tomography, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in diagnosis and management of pancreatic disease. Many technical advances have offered enhanced capabilities in noninvasive imaging of the pancreas. Although these technical advances are impressive, current studies do not always define clearly the benefits that these advances will confer in patient management. A critical overview of these imaging modalities is offered here, with respect to diagnosis and patient management. Outcomes from various studies are summarized for modalities including transabdominal ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging with and without pancreatography, and positron emission tomography.
