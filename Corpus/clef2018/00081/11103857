Stroke: pathogenesis, investigations, and prognosis--Part II of III. The aim of this review is to present the current knowledge regarding stroke. It will appear in three parts (in part I the epidemiology, clinical picture, and risk factors were discussed, while part III will consist of the management and rehabilitation). In the present part (II) the pathogenetic and pathophysiologic aspects of stroke are described. Regarding the investigations apart from the history and clinical examination and general investigations, the following specialized investigations and their role are discussed in detail: Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), xenon-blood-flow, positron emission tomography (PET), cerebral angiography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), ultrasonography, transcranial Doppler (TCD), echocardiography, Holter monitoring, and biopsies. In addition, taking into account the information from the above-cited modalities a prognosis for the final outcome is presented.
