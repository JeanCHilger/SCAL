Functional neurosurgery for epilepsy. Introduced at the end of the last century, epilepsy surgery is indicated in patients with intractable partial seizures and based on the resection of the epileptogenic cerebral tissue from which ictal discharges originate. Palliative procedures include seizure spread pathways interruption (callosotomy, multiple subpial transections) and chronic stimulation of the vagus nerve. Complete preoperative investigations including seizure observation, clinical tests, video-EEG, MRI and functional MRI, and PET-scan are performed in order to identify the epileptogenic zone. In difficult cases, invasive seizure monitoring through depth electrode implantation (SEEG) is performed. Resections for temporal lobe seizures are associated with favorable outcome: 60 to 90% of patients will be seizure-free after surgery. A less favorable outcome is observed after extra-temporal resections: 40 to 60% seizure-free patients. A better outcome is observed after surgery for epilepsy associated with an image-defined lesion, most often a tumor, rather than for cryptogenic epilepsy. Tumors associated with chronic partial epilepsy are indolent, most of them are dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNET). Outcome after palliative procedures are more variable, depending on the etiology of epilepsy.
