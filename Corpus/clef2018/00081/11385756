A review of high-resolution X-ray computed tomography and other imaging modalities for small animal research. Dedicated high-resolution small animal systems have recently emerged as important new tools for laboratory animal research. These imaging systems permit researchers to noninvasively screen animal models for mutations or pathologies and to monitor disease progression and response to therapy. The authors survey various small animal imaging modalities, including MRI, PET, SPECT, and microCT, and discuss several representative microCT mouse imaging studies.
