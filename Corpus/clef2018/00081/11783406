Surgery of multi-sutured craniosynostosis in childhood. According to own critical experience with the treatment of craniosynostoses (1954-81), using various methods from partial morcellement to total ablation of the cranial vault, the author applied (1982-2000) compound surgical decompression in 40 cases of turricephalic craniostenosis due to multisutural craniosynostosis. The surgical approach to the problem was supported by pre- and postoperative observations of computed three-dimensional bone reconstruction, furthermore by investigation of alterations of SPECT detecting the critical areas of most pronounced intracranial tightness of the skull leading to localized and general cerebral blood flow impairment of the developing brain. The application of newer diagnostic methods contributed to deeper understanding of mechanisms concerning neurodevelopmental retardation and behaviour or defect, disturbances as epilepsy, cranial nerve palsy, spastic paresis, hypothalamic-pituitary insufficiency or poor intelectual performance. This made the possible treatment of preoperative clinical symptoms more efficient. By an early operation we solve the disproportion between the too small skull volume limited by premature ossification of sutures which resulted previously in compression of the growing in size, of the maturing brain. In cases of more complex pathology orbitotomies, with a reconstructive advancement of the orbital rim and maxillas should be performed with multidisciplinary cooperation.
