Assessment of the diagnostic capacity of planar scintigraphy and SPECT with 99mTc-HMPAO-labelled leukocytes in superficial and deep sternal infections after median sternotomy. Sternal infection is a rare complication of median sternotomy but is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly in the case of deep sternal infection (mediastinitis). Successful treatment depends on early diagnosis and on the location (deep or superficial) of the infection. Radiological techniques have many limitations, and although 67Ga scintigraphy is effective, it delays diagnosis by 48 h. We assessed the diagnostic capacity of planar scintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO)-labelled leukocytes in deep sternal infections after median sternotomy. We prospectively studied 41 patients with clinical suspicion of deep sternal infection 4 and 20 h after administration of the tracer. The final diagnosis was deep sternal infection in nine patients and superficial sternal infection in 10, with infection being ruled out in 22 patients. Planar scintigraphy did not detect any of the deep sternal infections at either 4 h or 20 h. SPECT correctly identified eight of the nine deep sternal infections at 4 h and all seven at 20 h, with no false positive results. Planar scintigraphy identified 16 of the 18 superficial sternal infections at 4 h and all of them at 20 h. SPECT identified 17 of these 18 infections at 4 h and all of them at 20 h. Other infections unrelated to the sternotomy were identified in seven patients. Leukocytes labelled with 99mTc-HMPAO are a highly reliable method for the early diagnosis of sternal infections after median sternotomy. Use of SPECT allows determination of the depth of the infection and differentiation of superficial from deep sternal infections. It is also possible to detect other sites of infection, thus providing alternative diagnoses.
