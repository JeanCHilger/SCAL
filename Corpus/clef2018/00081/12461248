Long-term prognostic value of dobutamine stress 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT: single-center experience with 8-year follow-up. To determine the long-term prognostic value of dobutamine stress technetium 99m (99mTc)-labeled sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with limited exercise capacity.Clinical data and SPECT results were analyzed in 531 consecutive patients. Follow-up was successful in 528 (99.4%) patients 55 underwent early revascularization and were excluded. Normal or abnormal findings were considered in the absence or presence of fixed and/or reversible perfusion defects. A summed stress score was calculated to estimate the extent and severity of perfusion defects. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify independent predictors of late cardiac events. The incremental value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy over clinical variables in predicting events was determined according to two models. The probability of survival was calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method.Findings were abnormal in 312 patients. During 8.0 years +/- 1.5 of follow-up (range, 4.5-10.6 years), cardiac death occurred in 67 patients (total deaths, 165) nonfatal myocardial infarction, in 34The incremental prognostic value of dobutamine stress 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT over clinical data was maintained over an 8-year follow-up in patients with limited exercise capacity.
