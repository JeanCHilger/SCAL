Myocardial blood flow in patients with hibernating myocardium. The debate on whether resting myocardial blood flow (MBF) to hibernating myocardium is reduced or not has attracted a lot of interest and has contributed to stimulate new research on heart failure in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Positron emission tomography with oxygen-15 labeled water (H(2)(15)O) or nitrogen-13 labeled ammonia (13NH(3)) has been used for the absolute quantification of regional MBF in human hibernating myocardium. When hibernating myocardium is properly identified, i.e. a dysfunctional segment subtended by a stenotic coronary artery that improves function upon reperfusion, the following conclusions can be reached based on the available literature: (a) in the majority of these studies resting MBF in hibernating myocardium is not different from either flow in remote tissue in the same patient or MBF in normal healthy volunteers (b) a reduction in MBF of approximately 20% compared to MBF in remote myocardium or age matched normal subjects has been demonstrated in a minority of truly hibernating segments
