Diagnostic imaging. Imaging technology continues to advance and simplify the diagnosis of neurotologic pathology. Namely, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging has provided detailed evaluation of the internal auditory canal and membranous labyrinth. Conversely, the role of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging as a screening tool remains controversial. Functional imaging studies, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and single photon emission computed tomography are beginning to find significant roles in the evaluation of patients with cochlear implants. General imaging principles and imaging strategies for specific pathologic conditions of the temporal bone are also discussed.
