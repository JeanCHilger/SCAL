Mechanisms and kinetics of humic acid adsorption onto chitosan-coated granules. Chitosan, a naturally abundant biopolymer, has widely been studied for metal adsorption from various aqueous solutions, but the extension of chitosan as an adsorbent to remove humic substances from water has seldom been explored. In this study, chitosan was coated on the surface of polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) granules through a dip and phase inversion process and was examined for humic acid removal in a series of batch adsorption experiments. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images showed that the PET granules were uniformly covered with a layer of chitosan and the chitosan layer possessed numerous open pores on the surface. Zeta potential study indicated that the chitosan-coated granules had positive zeta potentials at pH < 6.6 and negative zeta potentials at pH > 6.6. Adsorption of humic acid onto the chitosan-coated granules was found to be strongly pH-dependent. Significant amounts of humic acid were adsorbed under acidic and neutral pH conditions, but the adsorption capacity was reduced remarkably with increasing solution pH values. The adsorption isothermal data under various initial humic acid concentrations (at the same solution pH value) can be adequately modeled by the Langmuir and Freundlich models. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that the amino groups of the chitosan layer were protonated due to humic acid adsorption, suggesting the formation of organic complex between the protonated amino groups and humic acid. Kinetic study indicated that the adsorption process was transport-limited at low solution pH values, but became both transport- and attachment-limited at high solution pH values.
