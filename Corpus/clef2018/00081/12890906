Efficacy of iodine-123-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-R, S-methylpentadecanoic acid single photon emission computed tomography imaging in detecting myocardial ischemia in children with Kawasaki disease. To evaluate its efficacy in detecting myocardial ischemia in children, iodine-123-labeled 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-R, S-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging was performed in 16 pediatric patients with Kawasaki disease (KD, 11 male, 5 female mean age and range: 13 years 8 months and 8 years 11 months to 17 years 7 months). Five children with chest pain and no cardiac disease were studied as controls (2 male, 3 female
