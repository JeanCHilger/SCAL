Myocardial glucose uptake after dobutamine stress in chronic hibernating swine myocardium. In patients with hibernating myocardium, regional uptake of the glucose analog 2-fluorine 18-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) is increased under resting conditions. It is unclear whether the degree of increased FDG uptake correlates with the degree of impaired blood flow response and whether chronic changes in the glucose transporters may play a role in the enhanced FDG uptake under fasted conditions.Twelve swine were instrumented with a constrictor on the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Serial echocardiography and positron emission tomography studies were done to assess temporal changes in myocardial function, blood flow, and FDG uptake. One week after surgery (early study), wall thickening, blood flow, and postdobutamine FDG uptake in LAD and remote territories were similar. By approximately 6 weeks (late study), baseline wall thickening in the LAD region was lower than in remote regions (20% +/- 7% and 36% +/- 6%, P <.05), as was dobutamine-stimulated blood flow (0.92 +/- 0.16 mL. min(-1). g(-1) and 1.17 +/- 0.20 mL. min(-1). g(-1) in LAD and remote regions, respectively P <.05). After the dobutamine infusion, FDG uptake in the LAD region during fasted conditions was higher than in remote regions (0.128 +/- 0.053 micromol. min(-1). g(-1) and 0.098 +/- 0.044 micromol. min(-1). g(-1), respectivelyIn hibernating myocardium, regional FDG uptake under fasting conditions is higher than in remote regions, both at rest and after an infusion of dobutamine. The degree of poststress FDG uptake is proportional to the impaired stress-induced blood flow. Total GLUT4 content as well as membrane-bound protein is higher in the hibernating tissue, and these changes may facilitate the observed increase in FDG uptake.
