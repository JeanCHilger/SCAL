Pattern of CBF in the rehabilitation of visuospatial neglect. The CBF was assessed in seven patients before and after rehabilitation for visuospatial neglect. Two months of treatment produced an increased perfusion both in the right posterior and left anterior areas of the brain. However, only the left anterior CBF increase was correlated with the neglect disorders. The left anterior improvement in CBF was inversely correlated with right-left cerebellum asymmetry in pre- and post-treatment. The present data suggest the role of the frontal eye-fields in the mechanism of recovery of visual exploration in patients with severe neglect.
