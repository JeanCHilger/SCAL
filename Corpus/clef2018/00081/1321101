Production of fluorine-18 labeled (3-N-methyl)benperidol for PET investigation of cerebral dopaminergic receptor binding. The multi-millicurie synthesis of the D-2 receptor ligand [18F](3-N-methyl)benperidol (NMB 1-[3-(4'- [18F]fluorobenzoyl)propyl]-4-(2-keto-3-methyl-1- benzimidazolinyl)piperidine) is described. [18F]NMB was produced via a 3-step reaction sequence with an overall radiochemical yield of 5-10% and a specific activity greater than 3000 Ci/mmol within 100 min. In vitro binding assays indicated that NMB has high affinity for D-2 receptors in primate brain (K1 = 3.6 nM), with a receptor specificity exceeding that of spiperone. The technique described here permits the routine production of 10-20 mCi of this promising radiopharmaceutical for PET study of D-2 receptor binding in vivo.
