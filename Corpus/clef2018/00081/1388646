Cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with summer seasonal affective disorder. Positron emission tomography scans of nine patients diagnosed with summer seasonal affective disorder (SSAD) were compared with scans of 45 normal control subjects to investigate differences in brain glucose metabolism. All subjects performed an auditory discrimination task beginning several minutes before injection of F-18-deoxyglucose and continuing for 30 minutes after injection. Regional glucose metabolic rates were extracted from 60 rectangular regions of interest measured in five planes selected as atlas matches from 28 total slices. Statistically significant differences between patients with SSAD and normal control subjects were found in cerebral glucose metabolic rate and also in normalized regional glucose metabolic rates in the orbital frontal cortex and in the left inferior parietal lobule.
