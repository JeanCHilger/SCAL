Myocardial reperfusion in thrombolysis A 99Tcm-Sestamibi SPECT study in patients with acute myocardial infarction. This study presents the outcome of myocardial scintigraphy performed before and after thrombolytic treatment in 16 patients with acute myocardial infarction using 99Tcm-Sestamibi (Cardiolite, Du Pont Scandinavia AB, Kista, Sweden). The patients were given 99Tcm-Sestamibi intravenously as soon as possible after the decision to give thrombolytic treatment. When the patients were in a clinically stable state after the thrombolytic treatment, myocardial perfusion was analysed with the gamma camera using single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). A second 99Tcm-Sestamibi tomography was carried out on the second to fourth day after the myocardial infarction. Data reconstruction was done with the 'Bull's eye technique'. Nine patients received thrombolysis < 3 h from the onset of pain. In this group six patients (66%) improved their myocardial perfusion by > 10% after treatment, while all seven patients who received treatment > or = 3 h after the onset of pain improved their myocardial perfusion by < 10%. This study emphasises the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction in order to salvage myocardium.
