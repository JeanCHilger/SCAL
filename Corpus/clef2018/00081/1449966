Positron emission tomography for tumour assessment. As positron emission tomography (PET) is outside of the main theme of this conference, it is necessary to outline what it offers as a method for assessing tissue function in vivo. This is followed by illustrations of how PET has and is being used to study the physiology and biochemistry of tumours and pharmacokinetics and pharmacology of anticancer agents. Strategies are offered as to how PET may be used for the development of new chemotherapeutic agents.
