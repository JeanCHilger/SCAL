Whole-body positron emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose in patients with metastases of unknown primary tumours (CUP syndrome). The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical performances of whole body 2-[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) imaging for the detection of the primary tumour in patients with metastases of unknown origin. Forty-one patients, without previous history of known cancer (18 women and 23 men average age 64.1 years) with metastasis confirmed by histopathological analysis were included in a retrospective study. Results of PET were compared with those of techniques used in the current conventional diagnostic procedure. All known metastatic lesions were detected by PET. There were 26 true-positive and two false-negative results. Primary tumour remained undetermined in eight patients after conventional investigations and PET. PET was superior to conventional diagnostic procedure in 11 patients and led to modify treatment in 11 patients. Sensitivity of PET was superior than computed tomography in detecting abdominal primary tumours. FDG PET is useful in patients with unknown primary tumour because its sensitivity is good and it could modify the disease management. Otherwise, PET allows the evaluation of the extent of the disease and could be used to monitor treatment efficiency. Its contribution has to be evaluated particularly in patients with primary tumour with a specific treatment.
