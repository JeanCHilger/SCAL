Evaluation of various attenuation corrections in lung SPECT in healthy subjects. The effect of increasingly more sophisticated attenuation correction methods on image homogeneity has been studied in seven healthy subjects. The subjects underwent computed tomography (CT), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and transmission computed tomography (TCT) of the thorax region in the supine position. Density maps were obtained from the CT and TCT studies. Attenuation corrections were performed using five different methods: (1) uniform correction using only the body contour (2) TCT based corrections using the average lung density
