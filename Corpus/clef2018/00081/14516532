The Role of the Practice of Nuclear Pharmacy in Positron Emission Tomography. As nuclear medicine evolved from an obscure research tool to a mainstream clinical diagnostic and therapeutic modality, so has the role of the practice of pharmacy in nuclear medicine also evolved. A similar evolution is unfolding today in the practice of positron emission tomography (PET). The skills of many diverse professionals, including pharmacists, are essential for the safe and efficient operation of a modern PET facility. The importance of the role of pharmacists in PET has been increasing as the use of PET radiopharmaceuticals has matured from research to clinical to commercial arenas. While it is clear that pharmacists can contribute clinical and technical skills to the operation of a PET center, perhaps one of the most important factors influencing the increased role of pharmacists in PET is their expertise and experience in the drug regulatory process. The commercial distribution of PET radiopharmaceuticals, primarily [18F]2-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), is currently being performed by a variety of corporate and institutional facility partnerships, with the likelihood of several new players entering the marketplace in the near future. This factor has served to dramatically increase the role for nuclear pharmacy in PET. The practice of nuclear pharmacy is a well-established component of PET. The role of nuclear pharmacists in PET is complementary to the many other professionals currently practicing in this specialty. With the rapidly increasing clinical demand for FDG imaging, it is likely that the number of facilities and institutions entering into the commercial distribution of PET radiopharmaceuticals will also increase. Such growth will also serve to solidify and expand the role for the practice of nuclear pharmacy in PET.
