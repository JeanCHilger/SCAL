Metabolic changes and electro-clinical patterns in mesio-temporal lobe epilepsy: a correlative study. Interictal hypometabolism is commonly found in mesio-temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), but its pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. We hypothesized that metabolic changes reflect the preferential networks involved by ictal discharges. We analysed the topography of interictal hypometabolism according to electro-clinical patterns in 50 patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and consistent features of MTLE. Based on electro-clinical correlations, we identified four groups: (i) mesial group (13 cases) characterized by mesial seizure onset without evidence of early spread beyond the temporal lobe (ii) anterior mesio-lateral group (AML
