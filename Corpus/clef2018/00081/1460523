Simultaneous acquisition of emission and transmission data for improved thallium-201 cardiac SPECT imaging using a technetium-99m transmission source. Transmission computed tomography (TCT) data provides useful complementary information to single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) reconstructions, especially for cardiac studies. In particular, TCT data has been used to correct for nonuniform attenuation in the chest. Typically the transmission data are acquired in a separate acquisition, but simultaneous acquisition is preferable both to save time and to avoid difficulties involved with registration. In this work, we present a technique for simultaneously acquiring 201Tl SPECT and TCT data using a 99mTc sheet source that requires only minor equipment modifications. The use of these isotopes results in cross-contamination of the emission and transmission data. We present a practical technique to compensate for this contamination using post-acquisition image processing. This technique was evaluated by performing phantom and patient studies. The resulting images compare well with data obtained from separate emission and transmission studies.
