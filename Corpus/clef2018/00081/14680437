A comparison of current neuroblastoma chemotherapeutics. Neuroblastoma is the most common solid tumour in childhood. Modern management includes a biopsy to perform genetic studies. Based on clinical data and Myc-N amplification (MNA), patients are divided in three prognostic groups: the low-risk (Stage 1, 2, 4S without MNA) has an event-free survival (EFS) of > 90% with surgery alone the intermediate-risk (Stage 3, > 1 year of age, without MNA and Stage 3 and 4 infants without MNA) has an EFS of approximately 80% with mild chemotherapy and surgery
