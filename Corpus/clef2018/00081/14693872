Whole-body dual-modality PET/CT and whole-body MRI for tumor staging in oncology. Deciding on the appropriate therapy for patients with malignant diseases mandates accurate tumor staging with whole-body coverage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a combined modality including positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) provide whole-body tumor staging in a single session.To determine the staging accuracies of both whole-body PET/CT and whole-body MRI for different malignant diseases.Prospective, blinded, investigator-initiated study of 98 patients (mean age, 58 years range, 27-94 years) with various oncological diseases who underwent back-to-back whole-body glucose analog [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/CT and whole-body MRI for tumor staging. The study was conducted at a university hospital from December 2001 through October 2002 and had a mean follow-up of 273 days (range, 75-515 days). The images were evaluated by 2 different, blinded reader teams. The diagnostic accuracies of the 2 imaging procedures were compared.Correct classification of the primary tumor, regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis (overall TNM stage) using whole-body PET/CT and whole-body MRI. Secondary outcome measures were accurate assessment of T-stage, N-stage, and M-stage by the 2 imaging procedures.Of 98 patients, the overall TNM stage was correctly determined in 75 with PET/CT (77% 95% confidence interval [CI], 67%-85%) and in 53 with MRI (54%The feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of the whole-body staging strategies of PET/CT and MRI are established. Superior performance in overall TNM staging suggests the use of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/CT as a possible first-line modality for whole-body tumor staging.
