The use of parallel EEL spectral imaging and elemental mapping in the rapid assessment of anti-cancer drug localization. Both electron spectroscopic imaging (ESI) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) have great potential for use in several areas of cancer research. In biologically targeted radiotherapy, cytotoxic drug therapy and boron neutron capture therapy the effectiveness of many drugs is often critically dependent upon the intracellular localization of the agent employed. We describe the use of parallel EEL spectral imaging to assess the penetration and location of the iodine-containing drug meta-iodobenzyl guanidine, of potential value in targeted radiotherapy, and for the rapid detection of boron within borate-adsorbed polystyrene beads, of potential value in boron neutron capture therapy. We also describe elemental mapping of boron following low-temperature embedding. These results show how the techniques could be applied to many forms of cancer research by discussing the validity and limitations of the techniques experimentally. We also provide an outline of other areas in this field which could benefit from the future application of ESI and EELS.
