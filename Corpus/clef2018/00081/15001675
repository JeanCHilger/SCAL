Tumor localization of 16beta-18F-fluoro-5alpha-dihydrotestosterone versus 18F-FDG in patients with progressive, metastatic prostate cancer. This trial was an initial assessment of the feasibility, in vivo targeting, and biokinetics of 16beta-(18)F-fluoro-5alpha-dihydrotestosterone ((18)F-FDHT) PET in patients with metastatic prostate cancer to assess androgen receptor expression.Seven patients with progressive clinically metastatic prostate cancer underwent (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FDHT PET scans in addition to conventional imaging methods. Three patients had their studies repeated 1 mo later, 2 while on testosterone therapy, and the third after treatment with 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). High-pressure liquid radiochromatography was used to separate (18)F-FDHT from radiolabeled metabolites. Lesion-by-lesion comparisons between the (18)F-FDHT, (18)F-FDG, and conventional imaging methods were performed.Metabolism of (18)F-FDHT was rapid, with 80% conversion within 10 min to radiolabeled metabolites that circulated bound to plasma proteins. Tumor uptake was rapid and tumor retention was prolonged. Fifty-nine lesions were identified by conventional imaging methods. (18)F-FDG PET was positive in 57 of 59 lesions (97%), with an average lesion maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) = 5.22. (18)F-FDHT PET was positive in 46 of 59 lesions (78%), with the average positive lesion SUV(max) = 5.28. Treatment with testosterone resulted in diminished (18)F-FDHT uptake at the tumor site.(18)F-FDHT localizes to tumor sites in patients with progressive clinically metastatic prostate cancer and may be a promising agent to analyze antigen receptors and their impact on the clinical management of prostate cancer.
