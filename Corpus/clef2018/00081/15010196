Technetium-99m-Sestamibi SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with complete left bundle branch block. Diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) is considered a challenge in cardiology due to low accuracy of noninvasive methods such as basal and exercise stress test. Recently, myocardial perfusion imaging showed attainment of higher sensitivity and specificity. Scintigraphy with thallium-201 has been widely used in these patients. Few have used technetium-99m-Sestamibi and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic value of Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with complete LBBB.We studied 57 consecutive patients with complete LBBB using Tc-99m-Sestamibi SPECT and treadmill or dipyridamole stress to evaluate CAD. Eighteen patients also underwent coronary angiography. Perfusion defects were classified as fixed or reversible.Prevalence of resting perfusion abnormalities in anterior, septal, and apical regions was 51, 56, and 19%, respectively. Sensitivity for detecting >50% left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis was 67 and 56% for anterior or septal defects, and 56% for specificity. Apical perfusion abnormality showed 21% sensitivity and 89% specificity. Among six patients with reversibility and who underwent coronary angiography, all had >50% LAD stenosis.With Tc-99m-MIBI SPECT imaging, prevalence of anteroseptal perfusion abnormalities was >50% in patients with LBBB. The test has moderate sensitivity and specificity for LAD disease. Absence of apical defect is specific for excluding LAD disease. Reversible changes in anteroseptal wall should be considered as an indicator of ischemia in this territory.
