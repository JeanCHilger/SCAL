Functional neuroimaging in neurology and psychiatry. How can functional neuroimaging be applied to clinical neurology and psychiatry? This article reviews selected contributions of functional neuroimaging to the clinical neurosciences. We review selected technical aspects of positron emission tomography, single photon emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging with a focus on the relative strengths and weaknesses of these techniques. Consumers of functional neuroimaging research are encouraged to consider the limitations of imaging techniques and theoretical pitfalls of cognitive task design when interpreting results of functional imaging studies. Then, we selectively review the contributions of functional neuroimaging to neurology and psychiatry, including the areas of epilepsy, stroke, chronic pain, schizophrenia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Future directions of functional neuroimaging research are offered, with the emphasis that the best conclusions are informed by a convergence of research from functional neuroimaging, neurophysiological, and lesion studies.
