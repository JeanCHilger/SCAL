Synthesis and evaluation of radiolabeled analogs of the antidepressant drug zimelidine as potential SPECT-ligands for the serotonin transporter. Z-3-(4-bromophenyl)-N,N-dimethyl-3-(3-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-amine or zimelidine (ZIM) and its first metabolite nor-zimelidine, were radioiodinated via a nonisotopic exchange, using the Cu(I)-assisted nucleophilic labeling method. To evaluate their potential as SPECT ligands for the serotonin transporter (SERT), the biodistribution of both ligands was determined and pretreatment "blocking" studies performed. Both radioligands demonstrated a good brain penetration of 0.8-1% ID/g, stable after 60 min., p.i., and a brain/blood ratio of up to 3. In vivo brain distribution did not reveal specific binding. Blocking studies by pretreatment with a known SERT ligand, had minor influence on the uptake of [(123)I]I-ZIM, between the several isolated brain regions. It may therefore be concluded that [(123)I]I-ZIM and [(123)I]I-nor-ZIM do not appear to be promising SPECT ligands for the SERT.
