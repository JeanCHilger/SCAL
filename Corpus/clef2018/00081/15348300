Interleukin-6 expression by cultured human endothelial cells in contact with carbon coated polyethylene terephthalate. In order to evaluate if carbon coated polyethylene terephthalate (C-PET) could favor inflammatory reactions, the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells was tested in vitro. The cultures were put in contact with C-PET for 1, 24, 48 and 72 h. The same cells cultured on tissue culture-treated polystyrene without biomaterials were tested as the negative control the same cells incubated with LPS were the positive control. The level of IL-6 in the conditioned medium was tested by enzyme immunoassay
