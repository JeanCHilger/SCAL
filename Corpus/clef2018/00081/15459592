Are exercise stress tests appropriate for assessing myocardial ischemia in patients with major depressive disorder? Major depressive disorder (MDD) disproportionately affects patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Evidence of myocardial ischemia with electrocardiography (ECG) or single-photon-emission-computed-tomography (SPECT) assessments during exercise testing is an important determinant of CAD prognosis. However, many key symptoms of MDD, such as reduced interest in daily activities, lack of energy, and fatigue, may affect exercise performance and the detection of ischemia in patients with MDD. This study evaluated the extent to which MDD and depressive symptomatology moderate exercise test performance and compared the ability of ECG versus SPECT for detecting ischemia in 1367 consecutive patients who underwent exercise testing.All patients underwent a brief, structured psychiatric interview (PRIME-MD) and completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) on the day of their exercise (treadmill) test.A total of 183 patients (13%) met diagnostic criteria for MDD. Patients with MDD achieved a significantly lower percent of maximal predicted heart rate (%MPHR), exhibited lower peak exercise mets, and spent less time exercising compared with patients without MDD (all P values <.05). BDI scores were also negatively correlated with all 3 indices of exercise performance (all P values <.01). There were no differences in rates of SPECT ischemia in patients with MDD (40%) versus patients without MDD (45% P =.23)Results suggest that patients with CAD who have MDD, depressive symptomatology, or both exhibit poor exercise tolerance and performance and that ECG, as compared with SPECT, may not be as reliable in detecting ischemia in patients who are depressed.
