New aspects on the preparation of [11C]Methionine--a simple and fast online approach without preparative HPLC. At present, most data available on PET imaging of brain tumors using amino acids are based on l-[S-methyl-11C]methionine (MET). This radiopharmaceutical accurately delineates tumor extent, sometimes even better than CT. Since MET is playing such an important role for PET, a potent preparation method for this radiotracer allowing frequent syntheses for PET routine is desirable. Therefore, a simple disposable synthesis module was conceived without HPLC purification. Using a solid supported [11C]methylation on Al2O3 leads to the simplification of the preparation requiring only filtration for separation of precursor and MET. The presented method is able to produce high purity MET in excellent yields enough to serve several consecutive patients.
