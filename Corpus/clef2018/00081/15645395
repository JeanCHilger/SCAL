The use of nuclear cardiology in clinical decision making. Extensive data exist to support the role of myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (MPS) in risk stratification. Normal MPS studies usually are associated with very low risk, and patient risk increase significantly as a function of MPS results. Ventricular function measurements from gated single-photon emission computed tomography further augment risk stratification, particularly with respect to identifying patients at risk of cardiac death. Ancillary findings are prognostically important, particularly in the setting of normal or near-normal MPS results. Recent data suggest that MPS results can identify which patients will benefit from revascularization versus medical therapy and have expanded the understanding of how stress MPS is helpful in the identification of risk, enhanced the means of identifying risk, and improved its use as a means to identify optimal posttest treatment.
