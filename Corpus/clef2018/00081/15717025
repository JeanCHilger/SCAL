Neuroimaging in Parkinson's disease. In this review, the potential role of positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography as biological markers for diagnosing and following the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) is discussed. Their value for assessing the efficacy of putative neuroprotective agents in PD and for revealing the pharmacological changes underlying the symptomatology and complications of this disorder is also considered. It is concluded that in the future functional imaging will provide a valuable adjunct to clinical assessment when judging the efficacy of putative neuroprotective approaches to PD.
