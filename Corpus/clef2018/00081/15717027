Using advances in neuroimaging to detect, understand, and monitor disease progression in Huntington's disease. Transgenic mouse models and other screens are being used to identify potential therapeutic agents for use in clinical trials in Huntington's disease (HD). The development of surrogate markers that can be used in clinical therapeutics is an active area of research. Because HD is relatively uncommon and only a portion of available subjects meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, therapeutic trials are limited by the availability of potential subjects as well as the relative insensitivity of the clinical measures used. Neuroimaging methods offer the potential to provide noninvasive, reproducible, and objective methods not only to better understand the disease process but also to follow in clinical studies to determine if a drug is effective in slowing down disease progression or perhaps even in delaying onset. Following is a review of the literature, which highlights the studies that have been published to date.
