Advances in nuclear imaging for preoperative risk assessment. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is frequently utilized for preoperative risk assessment. Results are pertinent for long-term risk. MPI, though most frequently applied in intermediate-risk patients, may also be valuable in selected low- and high-risk individuals. Coronary stenting may alter the timing of noncardiac surgery, which should be considered when performing preoperative risk assessment.
