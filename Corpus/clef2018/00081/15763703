Developments in PET for the detection of endocrine tumours. Positron emission tomography (PET) supplies a range of labelled compounds to be used for the characterization of tumour biochemistry. Some of these have proved to be of value for clinical diagnosis, treatment follow-up, and clinical research. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scanning is now a widely accepted imaging approach in clinical oncology, reflecting increased expression of glucose transporters in cancerous tissue. This tracer, however, does not show sufficient uptake in well-differentiated tumours such as neuroendocrine tumours. Endocrine tumours have the unique characteristics of taking up and decarboxylating amine precursors. These so-called APUD characteristics offer highly specific targets for PET tracers. Using this approach, radiopharmaceuticals such as [(11)C]-5-hydroxytryptophan and [(11)C]-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine for localization of carcinoid and endocrine pancreatic tumours, 6-[(18)F]-fluorodopamine and [(11)C]-hydroxyephedrine for phaeochromocytomas, and [(11)C]-metomidate for adrenal cortical tumours have been developed. Functional imaging with PET using these compounds is now being employed to complement rather than replace other imaging modalities. Development of new PET radiopharmaceuticals may in the future allow in vivo detection of tumour biological properties, such as malignant potential and responsiveness to treatment.
