Simultaneous perfusion and blood-oxygenation-level-dependent measurements using single-shot interleaved z-shim echo-planar imaging. Single-shot interleaved z-shim EPI (SSIZS-EPI) was extended to a simultaneous perfusion and blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) imaging technique that reduces susceptibility-induced signal loss while preserving rapid image acquisition. Experiments on human brains showed that images acquired with this technique had improved signal-to-noise ratio in the inferior prefrontal, meso-, and lateral-temporal lobes compared with a conventional EPI. Perfusion maps obtained from the SSIZS-EPI images at resting state illustrated substantial signal recovery in these brain areas. Perfusion and BOLD images collected with a sensorimotor paradigm demonstrated the feasibility of the technique to simultaneously measure cerebral blood flow and blood oxygenation signals associated with brain activation. Functional experiments with a neuropsychiatric paradigm showed increased brain activities in the periamygdalar regions in both perfusion and BOLD maps, consistent with a previous H(2) (15)O PET study. The proposed technique, with its advantages of reducing susceptibility artifacts and fast scanning speed, would be useful for obtaining more reliable measurements of functional signals, particularly in the brain regions with field inhomogeneities.
