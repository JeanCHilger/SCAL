Principles of tumor imaging. Tumors involving the upper extremity are not uncommon. Although there is a wide variety of lesions that may occur in the hand and wrist, there are certain lesions which have a predilection for this location. This chapter will highlight the spectrum of imaging modalities available for the evaluation of upper extremity tumors, providing imaging guidelines for optimum selection of radiological examinations. It presents an overview of imaging of the hand and wrist, emphasizing the fundamental principles inherent to tumor imaging. Modalities reviewed include nuclear scintigraphy, positron emission tomography, sonography, computed tomography, arteriography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography.
