Clinical analysis of cognitive function in diabetic patients by MMSE and SPECT. We examined the frequency of cognitive impairment using the mini-mental-status examination (MMSE), as well as cerebral perfusion using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in elderly diabetic patients. Written consent was obtained from all patients prior to their inclusion in this study. An MMSE score of 26 or less was adopted as an indication of cognitive impairment. Following an initial study, a 3-month study incorporating the use of MMSE and SPECT was performed in subjects, some of whom were taking donepezil hydrochloride. Of the 92 subjects enrolled in this study, 38% exhibited cognitive functional impairment and 18% earned MMSE scores of 23 or lower that were indicative of dementia. With regard to their cerebral blood flow pattern as determined by SPECT 217, 31.4 and 34.2% of subjects showed parieto-temporal hypoperfusion, asymmetrical hypoperfusion and fronto-temporal hypoperfusion patterns of abnormalities, respectively 11.4% displayed unclassifiable findings and 8.5% showed no detectable abnormalities. No significant differences were seen in patients that were taking donepezil hydrochloride compared to those who were not. The incidence of cognitive functional impairment in elderly, diabetic patients was significantly elevated and was accompanied by a reduction in cerebral blood flow in the fronto-temporal region, as determined by SPECT.
