Performance comparison of two dual-head coincidence cameras of the first and latest generation. This study compares the performance and image quality of two gamma camera based PET systems of the first and latest generation. We investigated two dual head coincidence gamma cameras (PRISM 2000XP and AXIS, manufactured in 1997 and 2001 by Picker/Philips) predominantly in accordance with the NEMA NU2-1994 and NU2-2001 protocols. All performance parameters except for spatial resolution and image quality were determined after measuring a standard cylinder over several half-life periods. Scatter and random fractions were evaluated with the sinogram technique. In order to determine spatial resolution and image quality we used phantoms as described in the NEMA NU2-2001 protocol. The efficiency of the new system was found to be increased. True count rate at activity levels used in clinical conditions is improved and scatter fraction is decreased substantially. Accordingly, improved spatial resolution and image quality were observed with the new system. Altogether, the AXIS represents a further approach to the performance of dedicated positron emission tomographs.
