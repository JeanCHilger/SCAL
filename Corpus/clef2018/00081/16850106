The role of 111indium-octreotide brain scintigraphy in the diagnosis of cranial, dural-based meningiomas. Meningiomas are common brain tumors with somatostatin receptors that bind octreotide. We report the use of (111)indium-octreotide brain scintigraphy (OBS) for the non-invasive differentiation of meningiomas from other cranial dural-based pathology.A retrospective analysis of our experience with OBS for non-invasive identification of meningiomas was performed. Two neuroradiologists, blinded to clinical data, utilized a standardized grading scheme to define the uptake of octreotide at 6 and 24 h post-administration. The correlation between (18) F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and octreotide uptake was assessed.The cohort consisted of 50 patients having a mean age of 62.4 years and a median follow-up time of 24 months. Management consisted of biopsy (n = 4) resection (n = 10)OBS may increase the diagnostic specificity of conventional MRI when differentiating meningioma from other dural-based pathologies, while the addition of FDG-PET differentiates benign from malignant lesions.
