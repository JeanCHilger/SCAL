Hypertensive patients with false-positive thallium-201 scintigraphic results in the infero-posterior wall are in high risk for coronary artery disease development. It has been previously postulated that Thallium-201 (Tl201) scintigraphy is characterized by relatively low specificity in hypertensive patients. This study was undertaken to assess any possible influence of false-positive scintigraphic results on the prognosis of hypertensive patients.The study group comprised 179 consecutive hypertensive patients (128 men and 51 women), aged 50+/-7 years, who underwent exercise Tl(201) scintigraphy and coronary angiography (patients with normal scintigraphic results underwent coronary angiography due to persistent angina-like symptoms). All patients with normal coronary arteries underwent a second Tl201 scintigraphy within 36+/-6 months. Patients with reversible ischemia in the second scintigraphy underwent also a second coronary angiography.Coronary artery disease (CAD) was detected in 78 (44%) patients, while the rest 101 (56%) patients had normal coronary arteries. Abnormal scintigraphic results were revealed in 66 (85%) patients with CAD and in 38 (38%) patients without CAD. Twenty-two (58%) of the 38 hypertensive patients with false-positive scintigraphic results presented reversible ischemia of the infero-posterior wall of the left ventricle. Coronary artery disease was detected in 7 (32%) of these patients during the follow-up period.Hypertensive patients with normal coronary arteries and false-positive scintigraphic results usually present with reversible ischemia of the infero-posterior wall of the left ventricle. This group of patients seems to be at increased risk of developing CAD in a long-term follow-up period.
