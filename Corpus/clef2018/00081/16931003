Synthesis and biological evaluation of technetium-99m-labeled deoxyglucose derivatives as imaging agents for tumor. Three deoxyglucose (DG) derivatives, S-DG, MAG(3)-DG and MAMA-BA-DG, were synthesized and labeled successfully with high labeling yields and high radio-chemical purities. Biodistribution in tumor-bearing mice demonstrated that these three new (99m)Tc-deoxyglucose derivatives showed accumulation in tumor and high tumor-to-muscle ratios. Among them, the (99m)Tc-MAG(3)-DG showed the best characteristics as a potential tumor marker for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
