Imidazoline I(2) receptors as a possible marker for malignancy in human glial cell tumours. To present the experimental data that support the hypothesis that the imidazoline I(2) receptors may be assessed as a biological marker to establish diagnosis and grade of human gliomas.Gliomas constitute the most important group of brain neoplasm in humans. In these tumours accurate histopathologic diagnosis is a first crucial prerequisite for patient treatment. However, current grading schemes are still limited by subjective histologic criteria. Therefore, the search for new molecular and biological markers of gliomas represents a crucial step. In this context, it has been reported a significant increase in I(2) density in human gliomas when compared with normal brain tissue and other intracranial non-glial tumours. Moreover, this increase seems to fit well with the degree of malignancy in human gliomas. Thus, in glioblastomas multiformes the I(2) density is 1.4 times higher than in anaplastic astrocytomas and 2.2 higher than in low-grade astrocytomas.The present results demonstrate that the measurement of the I(2) density by positron emission tomography techniques could be used in the future for grading and prognosis of human gliomas. This could avoid the current need for tumour biopsies in order to obtain a histopathologic diagnosis.
