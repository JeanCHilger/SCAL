Sentinel node biopsy in non-palpable breast cancer and in patients with a previous diagnostic excision. As a means of staging the axilla with minimal surgical trauma, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) has dramatically altered the management of early-stage breast cancer. The aim of this prospective multicentre study was to assess the safety of the method in cases of non-palpable tumours and in cases with an open biopsy prior to SNB.In the period 1999-2001, 57 non-palpable breast cancers and 75 patients with diagnostic biopsy were collected prospectively to the first part of the study. In the second part, 745 patients with non-palpable breast cancers and 86 cases with prior open surgery diagnosed between 2000 and 2005 were followed up till the end of 2005. All patients in the first part of the study had an axillary clearance irrespective of sentinel node status, whereas in the second part axillary clearance was done only if the sentinel node was metastatic.The detection rate was 95% in the group of non-palpable breast cancers, with a false negative rate of 5.6% (1/18), and the corresponding figures for the group with prior intervention were 96% and 10% (2/20). Two axillary recurrences, after a negative SNB at primary surgery, were found in the non-palpable group after 16 and 17 months, respectively. No axillary recurrence has been observed in the group of cancers with a prior open biopsy. Four women in the non-palpable group and two women with a diagnostic operation experienced distant metastases.We conclude that SNB is a safe procedure for women with non-palpable breast cancer, as well as after previous open diagnostic excision.
