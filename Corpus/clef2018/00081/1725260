Properties of an abundant RNA-binding protein in yeast mitochondria. We have previously identified a protein with Mr approximately 40,000 (p40) that binds with high specificity and affinity to the 5'-untranslated leaders of mitochondrial mRNAs in yeast. Here we show that this protein is abundant, comprising about 0.4% of total mitochondrial protein. p40 is present in a cytoplasmic (rho degree) petite mutant that lacks mitochondrial protein synthesis and is therefore nuclear encoded. p40 can be detected by immunological techniques in cell lysates of several different pet mutants, specifically disturbed in the translation of individual mitochondrial mRNAs. It is thus not one of the translation factors defined by any of these mutations. In the case of a pet111 mutant, which is specifically blocked in the translation of COX2 mRNA, extracts still display COX2 mRNA binding activity, indicating that p40 complex formation in vitro is not dependent on the presence of PET111.
