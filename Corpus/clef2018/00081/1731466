Differences in myocardial fluoro-18 2-deoxyglucose uptake in young versus older patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether regional myocardial glucose use in patients diagnosed as having hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) at a younger age differs from that in those diagnosed at middle to old age. Sixteen patients with HC (group 1 aged less than 40 years (n = 8) group 2 aged greater than 40 (n = 8) were studied using positron emission tomography and fluoro-18 2-deoxyglucose (FDG). All patients were diagnosed as having HC within 6 years of the study. Contiguous regions of interest were selected circumferentially on each cross-sectional image of the left ventricular wall. In each region of interest, % FDG fractional uptake was calculated. In each patient, % left ventricular FDG fractional uptake was determined as a mean value of % FDG fractional uptake in each region of interest. Moreover, as a measure of nonhomogeneity, the % interregional coefficient of variation in FDG fractional uptake was calculated in each patient. Whereas % left ventricular FDG fractional uptake did not differ between the 2 groups, the % interregional coefficient of variation in FDG fractional uptake was increased in group 1 compared with that in group 2 (11.5 +/- 3.6 vs 7.4 +/- 1.6%
