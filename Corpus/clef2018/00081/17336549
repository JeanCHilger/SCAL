Positron emission tomography with 18F-FDG in osteoarthritic knee. To evaluate osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee using positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-(18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) as a tracer.Fifteen patients with medial-type knee OA and three healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. After clinical examination and conventional radiography, (18)F-FDG PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. (18)F-FDG uptake was quantified as a standardized uptake value (SUV) and the localization of (18)F-FDG uptake was identified using fusion images created with MRI scans.(18)F-FDG generally accumulated in periarticular lesions and was absent in the articular cartilage. SUVs of the whole knee were higher in OA than in controls, and those in the medial condyle were higher than in the lateral condyle in OA. Prominent (18)F-FDG uptake was found in the intercondylar notch in OA and extended along the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in some cases. Periosteophytic accumulation was found in one-half of cases with definite osteophytes. Accumulation was also found in subchondral lesions and bone marrow, which corresponded with bone edema diagnosed by MRI. No significant correlation was found between SUV and clinical manifestations.(18)F-FDG uptake was upregulated in OA and generally accumulated in periarticular lesions. Increased uptake was found in the intercondylar notch extending along the PCL, periosteophytic lesions, and bone marrow. These results provide in vivo pathognomonic insights into OA.
