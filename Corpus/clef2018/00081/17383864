Study of feline oral squamous cell carcinoma: potential target for cyclooxygenase inhibitor treatment. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. A potential target for OSCC treatment is cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2). Pet cats with naturally occurring OSCC may offer the opportunity to study anticancer activity of cox inhibitors. Cox-2 expression in feline OSCC was determined by immunohistochemistry. High intensity cox-2 immunoreactivity was detected in 6 of 34 (18%) feline OSCC samples. Weak immunoreactivity was noted in 22 OSCCs and in epithelial cells from oral mucosa of clinically normal cats. Pharmacokinetics of a cox inhibitor (piroxicam, 0.3 mg/kg) were studied in carcinoma-bearing cats to confirm a dose for follow-up trials. The average peak serum piroxicam concentration (948 ng/ml, which inhibited cox-2 activity) and serum half-life (15.9 h) were similar to that in normal cats. These results provide information (cox-2 expression as an inclusion criteria, 0.3 mg/kg daily piroxicam) for the design of follow-up trials of cox inhibitor treatment in pet cats with OSCC.
