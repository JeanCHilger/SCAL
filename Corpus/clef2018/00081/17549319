Minimally invasive radio-guided parathyroidectomy on a group of 452 primary hyperparathyroid patients: refinement of preoperative imaging and intraoperative procedure. of this study was to investigate the efficacy of minimally invasive radio-guided parathyroidectomy (MIRP) in primary hyperparathyroid (PHPT) patients.452 consecutive PHPT patients were evaluated. Inclusion criteria for MIRP were (a) evidence at scintigraphy of a solitary parathyroid adenoma (PA) (b) a clear sestamibi uptake in the PA344 out of the 452 patients met the inclusion criteria, and MIRP was successfully performed in 321 of them (93.3%). No major intra-operative complication was recorded. MIRP required a mean operative time of 32 min, and a mean hospital stay of 1.2 d. The parathyroid to background ratio (P/B) calculated by the probe was well correlated with the P/B calculated by sestamibi SPECT (r = 0.91 p < 0.01), while no significant correlation was found between the probe-calculated P/B and the P/B calculated at planar sestamibi scan.In our experience: a) an accurate preoperative localising imaging protocol based on planar and SPECT sestamibi scan, and neck US is effective in selecting PHPT patients for MIRP, b) the P/B calculated by sestamibi SPECT seems able to predict the probe-calculated P/B more accurately than the P/B calculated at planar scan, c) the low 37 MBq sestamibi dose protocol proved to be a safe and effective approach to perform MIRP.
