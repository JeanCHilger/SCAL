Cerebral blood flow sensitivities to CO2 measured with steady-state and modified rebreathing methods. It is well established that the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide (CO(2)) measured by modified rebreathing (Sr(VE)) is closer to that measured by the steady-state method (Ss(VE)) than is the response measured by Read's rebreathing method. It is also known that the value estimated by the steady-state method depends upon the combination of data points used to measure it. The aim of this study was to investigate if these observations were also true for cerebral blood flow (CBF), as measured by steady-state (Ss(CBF)) and modified rebreathing (Sr(CBF)) tests. Six subjects undertook two protocols: (a) steady state: PET(CO2) was held at 1.5 mm Hg above normal (isocapnia) for 10 min, then raised to three levels of hypercapnia, (8 min each 6.5, 11.5 and 16.5 mm Hg above normal, separated by 4 min isocapnia). End-tidal PO2 was held at 300 mm Hg
