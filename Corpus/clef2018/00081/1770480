The efficacy of ultrasonic pest controllers for fleas and ticks. Two ultrasonic pest controllers, a pet-collar unit and a large unit for household use, were tested for their efficacy in repelling fleas and ticks in a choice chamber. Neither unit had any affect on the distribution of fleas or ticks in the choice chamber up to 24 h exposure, and activity of fleas, ticks and cockroaches was unimpaired. The study extends and supports previous findings that ultrasound is ineffective as a means of controlling common pests of households and pets.
