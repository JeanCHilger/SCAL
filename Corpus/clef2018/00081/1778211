Increment of brain temporal perfusion during auditory stimulation. Preliminary study with technetium-99m HMPAO SPET. A study on the dynamic exploration of the auditory pathway is presented, in which technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography (SPET) was used in volunteers with normal hearing. Changes in 99mTc-HMPAO distribution were calculated using a region of interest/whole-brain count ratio. The results showed a temporal perfusion increment of 17% (right) and 19% (left) during tonal supraliminar stimulation, which was significantly different from the control ROI. Sensitivity tests for the method were requested before any clinical application.
