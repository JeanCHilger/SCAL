Variations in 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) late heart mediastinal ratios in chronic heart failure: a need for standardisation and validation. There is lack of validation and standardisation of acquisition parameters for myocardial (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG). This lack of standardisation hampers large scale implementation of (123)I-MIBG parameters in the evaluation of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).In a retrospective multi-centre study (123)I-MIBG planar scintigrams obtained on 290 CHF patients (82% male 58% dilated cardiomyopathyThere was a large variation in acquisition parameters. Multivariate forward stepwise regression showed that a significant proportion (31%, p < 0.001) of the variation in late H/M could be explained by a model containing patient-related variables and acquisition parameters. Left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.001), type of collimation (p < 0.001), acquisition duration (p = 0.001), NYHA class (p = 0.028) and age (p = 0.034) were independent predictors of late H/M.Acquisitions parameters are independent contributors to the variation of semi-quantitative measurements of cardiac (123)I-MIBG uptake. Improved standardisation of cardiac (123)I-MIBG imaging parameters would contribute to increased clinical applicability for this procedure.
