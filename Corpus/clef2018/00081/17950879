Communicating with oncology clients. Empathic, honest, and consistent communications that establish realistic goals and focus on quality of life (during and after therapy) for pets with cancer provide the basis of an excellent client-veterinarian relationship. From this foundation, a client can team up with his or her veterinarian to make the best possible decisions for the pet and for himself or herself regarding care for the companion animal.
