Image reconstruction in positron emission tomography (PET): the 90th anniversary of Radon's solution. This year is the 90th anniversary of Radon's solution of how the values of a function can be reconstructed from measured line integrals. In medical tomography, Radon's method allows the formation of cross-sectional images of a human's body from measurements outside the patient. This paper reviews the use of Radon's method in positron emission tomography (PET) and presents some future trends in PET.
