Current state and future directions of pleural mesothelioma imaging. The diagnosis, staging, and response assessment of mesothelioma pose unique challenges to radiologic imaging. No single, conventional imaging approach captures the information necessary to direct all aspects of patient management. Instead, the complexities of this unique disease demand the integration of elements cleverly adapted from different modalities. Imaging-based studies presented at the 8th International Conference of the International Mesothelioma Interest Group (IMIG) in October 2006 sought to further define the current practice and future potential of radiology for the mesothelioma patient. The imaging studies selected through a peer-review process for presentation at the 2006 IMIG Conference were intended to frame this research in the context of the unique imaging challenges presented by mesothelioma while stimulating dialogue on the future resolution of these challenges. This communication conveys the pitfalls and potential of pleural mesothelioma imaging based on work presented at the Conference. From diagnosis to response, PET/CT to molecular bioprobes, volumetric analysis to computerized tumor assessment, imaging promises to provide valuable insight for patients with mesothelioma and the physicians who treat them.
