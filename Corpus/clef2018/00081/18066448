Coronary artery disease in asymptomatic type-2 diabetic women. A comparative study between exercise test, cardiopulmonary exercise test, and dipyridamole myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in the identification of ischemia. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among diabetic individuals. Myocardial ischemia is frequently asymptomatic, thus leading to a late diagnosis and worse prognosis. Diabetic women are known to have a cardiovascular death risk higher than that in men.To assess the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in asymptomatic diabetic women. To compare the results of exercise test (ET), cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), and dipyridamole myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) with the findings of coronary angiography, (ANGI) in order of identify the most accurate method in the detection of significant CAD.A total of 104 diabetic women were assessed with ET, CPET and MPS in the period within two months from the ANGI. MIBI-99mTc scintigraphy was performed using the gated-SPECT technique. Pearson's chi-square, Student's t tests were used for the statistical analysis and also the logistic regression analysis.The prevalence of CAD in the group studied was 32.7%. For the ET, an effective test (p=0.045), the chronotropic incompetence (p=0.031), and the exercise time performed (p=0.022) showed a significant association with DAC. For CPET, peak VO2 and HR achieved were associated with CAD (p=0.004 and p=0.025, respectively). Most of the MPS variables showed a significant association with CAD (p=0.001, for all).The results obtained may suggest a high prevalence of CAD in diabetic women. Thus, this population should be investigated from the cardiovascular point of view even without cardiac symptom. Of the noninvasive diagnostic methods used, dipyridamole MPS was the one that showed the highest discrimination power in relation to diabetic women with CAD.
