Regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis measured with L-[1-11C]leucine and PET in conscious, young adult men: normal values, variability, and reproducibility. We report regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) measured with the fully quantitative L-[1-(11)C]leucine positron emission tomography (PET) method. The method accounts for the fraction (lambda) of unlabeled amino acids in the precursor pool for protein synthesis derived from arterial plasma the remainder (1-lambda) comes from tissue proteolysis. We determined rCPS and lambda in 18 regions and whole brain in 10 healthy men (21 to 24 years). Subjects underwent two 90-min dynamic PET studies with arterial blood sampling at least 2 weeks apart. Rates of cerebral protein synthesis varied regionally and ranged from 0.97+/-0.70 to 2.25+/-0.20 nmol/g per min. Values of rCPS were in good agreement between the two PET studies. Mean differences in rCPS between studies ranged from 9% in cortical regions to 15% in white matter. The lambda value was comparatively more uniform across regions, ranging from 0.63+/-0.03 to 0.79+/-0.02. Mean differences in lambda between studies were 2% to 8%. Intersubject variability in rCPS was on average 6% in cortical areas, 9% in subcortical regions, and 12% in white matter
