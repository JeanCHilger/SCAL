Invincible, but not invisible: imaging approaches toward in vivo detection of cancer stem cells. With evidence emerging in support of a cancer stem-cell model of carcinogenesis, it is of paramount importance to identify and image these elusive cells in their natural environment. The cancer stem-cell hypothesis has the potential to explain unresolved questions of tumorigenesis, tumor heterogeneity, chemotherapeutic and radiation resistance, and even the metastatic phenotype. Intravital imaging of cancer stem cells could be of great value for determining prognosis, as well as monitoring therapeutic efficacy and influencing therapeutic protocols. Cancer stem cells represent a rare population of cells, as low as 0.1% of cells within a human tumor, and the phenotype of isolated cancer stem cells is easily altered when placed under in vitro conditions. This represents a challenge in studying cancer stem cells without manipulation or extraction from their natural environment. Advanced imaging techniques allow for the in vivo observation of physiological events at cellular resolution. Cancer stem-cell studies must take advantage of such technology to promote a better understanding of the cancer stem-cell model in relation to tumor growth and metastasis, as well as to potentially improve on the principles by which cancers are treated. This review examines the opportunities for in vivo imaging of putative cancer stem cells with regard to currently accepted cancer stem-cell characteristics and advanced imaging technologies.
