Poly(ether imide) membranes: studies on the effect of surface modification and protein pre-adsorption on endothelial cell adhesion, growth and function. Poly(ether imide) (PEI) membranes of which the surface was modified with carboxylic groups were tested in comparison to pure PEI and poly(ethylene terephtalate) (PET) for their ability to support attachment, growth and function of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with respect to endothelization of the above materials. Flat sheet PEI membranes were modified by covalent binding of iminodiacetic acid (IDA) for different periods of time (1 to 30 min) to obtain surfaces with various content of carboxylic groups. In addition, fibronectin (FN) and fibrinogen (FNG) pre-adsorption on the various membranes were studied for their effect on HUVEC behaviour. The results show a decreased protein adsorption and HUVEC adhesion, growth and function in terms of prostacyclin production with an increase in carboxylic groups. Pre-adsorption of the membranes with FN or FNG promoted activity of HUVEC, which became superior to cells on PET. FN-coated membranes were found to be a better substrate for HUVEC adhesion and prostacyclin production, while on FNG-coated membranes cells grew better. Overall it can be concluded that PEI is a promising materials for endothelial cells immobilization as it is needed for improving the haemocompatibility of cardiovascular devices.
