Radiologic evaluation of larynx cancer. The authors present the value of imaging for preoperative evaluation of structures that are not assessed or incompletely assessed on physical and endoscopic examination. Discussed are CT, MRI, and positron emission tomography-CT and the appropriate selection of each method to provide information, including the presence or absence of extent of disease to the pre-epiglottic and paraglottic spaces and the subglottis, cartilage invasion, extralaryngeal spread of disease, nodal metastasis, and tumor volume.
