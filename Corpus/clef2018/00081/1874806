Differentiation of radioligand delivery and binding in the brain: validation of a two-compartment model for [11C]flumazenil. We recently developed a two-compartment, two-parameter tracer kinetic model to estimate the in vivo ligand transport rate (K1) and distribution volume (DV) for the benzodiazepine antagonist [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) as measured by positron emission tomography (PET). The aim of the present study was to validate that this simplified model provides a stable measure of regional benzodiazepine receptor availability even when ligand delivery is altered. Six young normal volunteers underwent two PET studies subsequent to intravenous injections of [11C]FMZ. Each FMZ study was immediately preceded by measurements of CBF following injection of [15O]water. One set of scans (water/FMZ) was acquired under resting conditions and the other set during audiovisual stimulation. Six additional volunteers underwent two FMZ studies under identical resting conditions. Parametric images were analyzed and a comparison of test-retest studies in the stimulation group revealed a significant increase of CBF and K1 of FMZ in the occipital cortex evoked by visual activation, whereas no regional changes were noted for the DV of FMZ. No significant changes were noted for either K1 or DV of FMZ when comparing studies in the rest-rest setting. The results indicate that the use of a simple two-compartment model for the tracer kinetic analysis of [11C]FMZ makes it possible to separate high-affinity binding from altered radio-ligand delivery to the human brain.
