Advanced radiation measurement techniques in diagnostic radiology and molecular imaging. This paper reports some technological advances recently achieved in the fields of micro-CT and small animal PET instrumentation. It highlights a balance between image-quality improvement and dose reduction. Most of the recent accomplishments in these fields are due to the use of novel imaging sensors such as CMOS-based X-ray detectors and silicon photomultipliers (SiPM). Some of the research projects carried out at the University of Pisa for the development of such advanced radiation imaging technology are also described.
