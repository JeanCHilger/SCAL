Metabolic tumor volume of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography predicts short-term outcome to radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy in pharyngeal cancer. This study aimed to investigate whether metabolic tumor volume (MTV) measured from [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) predicts short-term outcome to radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with pharyngeal cancers.The MTVs of primary sites with or without neck nodes were measured in 82 patients. Short-term outcome was assessed using the treatment response evaluation by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and recurrence events during follow-up (complete response/no recurrence or residual disease/recurrence).A total of 64 patients had complete response/no recurrence as of the last follow-up. A cutoff of 40 mL for the MTV was the best discriminative value for predicting treatment response. By univariate analyses, patients with MTV > 40 mL showed a significantly lower number of complete response/no recurrence than did patients with MTV < or =40 mL [68.2% versus 87.8% hazard ratio (HR), 3.34MTV has a potential value in predicting short-term outcome and DFS in patients with pharyngeal cancers.
