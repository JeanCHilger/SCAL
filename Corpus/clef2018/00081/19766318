Sentinel lymph node biopsy for ocular adnexal melanoma: experience in 30 patients. To report the findings on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in 30 patients with ocular adnexal (conjunctival or eyelid) melanomas.Prospective nonrandomized clinical trial.Thirty patients with diagnosis of eyelid or conjunctival melanoma.All patients with ocular adnexal melanoma who underwent SLNB at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between December 2000 and July 2008 are the subject of this report. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed as previously described by our group, and patients were prospectively followed up.Findings on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, SLNB, histopathologic examination of the primary tumor and sentinel lymph nodes (SNL), and nodal recurrence after SLNB.Tumor sites were as follows: bulbar conjunctiva only, 14 patients palpebral conjunctiva only, 8 patientsSentinel lymph node biopsy is effective for identifying nodal micrometastasis in patients with ocular adnexal melanoma and provides important prognostic information. The false-negative event rate in our series improved in the last 4 years, most likely because of a better technique and better patient selection for SLNB. We recommend consideration of SLNB for patients with intermediate-thickness ocular adnexal melanoma and those with ulceration.
