Cross-linking enhances deposition of human endothelial progenitor cells in the rat heart after intracoronary transplantation. Transplantation of human endothelial progenitor cells (hEPCs) may improve vascularization and left ventricular function after myocardial infarction. The scope of this study was to explore, whether cross-linking of EPCs may enhance the deposition of cells in the rat heart after clinical-like, intracoronary transplantation. To this end, (111)In-oxinate-labeled hEPCs were infused by a minimally invasive technique into the coronary arteries of immunosuppressed Wistar rats under control conditions and after ischemia/reperfusion. In a second set of experiments hEPCs were treated with phytohemagglutinin to create small cell clusters prior to transplantation. Continous three-dimensional HiSPECT images for 1 h and after 48 h revealed that cell deposition was significantly higher when hEPCs were cross-linked. Therefore, cross-linking of hEPCs may provide a promising approach to enhance the number of trapped cells also in a clinical setting.
