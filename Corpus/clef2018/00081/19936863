Direct comparison of rest and adenosine stress myocardial perfusion CT with rest and stress SPECT. We have recently described a technique for assessing myocardial perfusion using adenosine-mediated stress imaging (CTP) with dual source computed tomography. SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT-MPI) is a widely utilized and extensively validated method for assessing myocardial perfusion. The aim of this study was to determine the level of agreement between CTP and SPECT-MPI at rest and under stress on a per-segment, per-vessel, and per-patient basis.Forty-seven consecutive patients underwent CTP and SPECT-MPI. Perfusion images were interpreted using the 17 segment AHA model and were scored on a 0 (normal) to 3 (abnormal) scale. Summed rest and stress scores were calculated for each vascular territory and patient by adding corresponding segmental scores.On a per-segment basis (n = 799), CTP and SPECT-MPI demonstrated excellent correlation: Goodman-Kruskall gamma = .59 (P < .0001) for stress and .75 (P < .0001) for rest. On a per-vessel basis (n = 141), CTP and SPECT-MPI summed scores demonstrated good correlation: Pearson r = .56 (P < .0001) for stress and .66 (P < .0001) for rest. On a per-patient basis (n = 47), CTP and SPECT-MPI demonstrated good correlation: Pearson r = .60 (P < .0001) for stress and .76 (P < .0001) for rest.CTP compares favorably with SPECT-MPI for detection, extent, and severity of myocardial perfusion defects at rest and stress.
