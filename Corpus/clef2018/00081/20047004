Synthesis of [F]fallypride in a micro-reactor: rapid optimization and multiple-production in small doses for micro-PET studies. A commercial coiled-tube micro-reactor (NanoTek Advion) was used as a convenient platform for the synthesis of [(18)F]fallypride in small doses (0.5-1.5 mCi) for micro-PET studies of brain dopamine subtype-2 receptors in rodents. Each radiosynthesis used low amounts (20-40 mug
