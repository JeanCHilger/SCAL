Comparison between short-acquisition myocardial perfusion SPECT reconstructed with a new algorithm and conventional acquisition with filtered backprojection processing. To compare a novel reconstruction package (Evolution for Cardiac), used to improve image quality in myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (MPS) and enable shorter scan acquisitions, to filtered backprojection used for conventional time acquisitions.Forty-four patients who underwent 2-day Tc-99m sestamibi MPS had both standard [SD: 14-min scan and filtered backprojection processing] and short (SH: 6-min scan and iterative reconstruction with Evolution for Cardiac) studies. In a 17-segment model of the left ventricle, each segment was automatically scored 0-4 (normal to absent radiotracer activity) summed stress, rest and difference scores (SSS, SRS, SDS) were obtained. Spearman's test assessed the correlation between scores from SD and SH studies, and Bland-Altman plots evaluated absolute and mean differences of scores between these studies.The SSS, SRS, and SDS were not statistically different between SD and SH studies (SSS: 5.9 + or - 6.6 vs. 5.8 + or - 6.5 SRS: 2.6 + or - 3.5 vs. 2.6 + or - 2.9A new reconstruction package (Evolution for Cardiac) enabled short MPS acquisition without changes in quantitative perfusion results when compared with conventional acquisition and processing.
