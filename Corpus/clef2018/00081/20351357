Canine H3N8 influenza virus infection in dogs and mice. An H3N8 influenza virus closely related to equine influenza virus was identified in racing greyhound dogs with respiratory disease in 2004 and subsequently identified in shelter and pet dogs. Pathologic findings in dogs spontaneously infected with canine influenza virus were compared with lesions induced in beagle and mongrel dogs following experimental inoculation with influenza A/canine/Florida/43/2004. BALB/c mice were inoculated with canine influenza virus to assess their suitability as an experimental model for viral pathogenesis studies. All dogs inoculated with virus developed necrotizing and hyperplastic tracheitis and bronchitis with involvement of submucosal glands as well as mild bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Viral antigen was identified in bronchial and tracheal epithelial cells of all dogs and in alveolar macrophages of several dogs. Many dogs that were spontaneously infected with virus also developed bacterial pneumonia, and greyhound dogs with fatal spontaneous infection developed severe pulmonary hemorrhage with hemothorax. Virus-inoculated BALB/c mice developed tracheitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and mild pneumonia in association with viral antigen in airway epithelial cells and in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells. Virus was not detected in extrarespiratory sites in any animals. The results indicate that canine influenza virus infection consistently induces acute tracheitis and bronchitis in dogs. Mice may be a useful model for some pathogenesis studies on canine influenza virus infection.
