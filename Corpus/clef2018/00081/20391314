Diagnostic screening for cancer and coronary heart disease with radiological and nuclear imaging techniques: early diagnosis at any price?. Recently nuclear and radiological imaging techniques such as Glucose-PET, whole body MRI, coronary CT and various laboratory tests are used to screen asymptomatic patients for cancer and coronary heart disease. This review, based on the current relevant publications, including recent Japanese prospective studies, discusses issues arising from this screening approach. Although cases of early cancer are detected using such an approach, this preventive strategy has not been shown to improve quality of life and/or decrease mortality, but leads to additional radiation exposure and a high number of false-positive results with subsequent emotional and medical stress. Epidemiologic considerations and scientific data are discussed in order to suggest to doctors appropriate strategies when counselling patients about imaging screening options.
