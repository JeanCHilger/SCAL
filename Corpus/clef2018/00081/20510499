Prevalence of silent myocardial ischemia in single and multiple lacunar infarcts and large vessel disease stroke. The relationships between single (SLI) and multiple lacunar infarcts (MLI) and occult coronary artery disease (CAD) have not yet been sufficiently evaluated. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of silent CAD in patients with SLI, MLI and large vessel disease (LVD) stroke, and to identify factors associated with its presence.We enrolled 125 patients who had suffered their first non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke but had no documented history of CAD. According to their pathologies, these patients were assigned to one of three groups: MLI (n=21), SLI (n=50) or LVD (n=54). Asymptomatic CAD was detected by myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging.Silent CAD was detected in 40 patients (32% of the total) of those that experienced CAD, 15 (30%) were from the SLI group, 7 (33%) had MLI, and 18 (33%) had an LVD stroke. Differences between the groups were not significant. During a median follow-up of 48 months, the overall stroke recurrence was 8.8%In this exploratory study, SPECT imaging results revealed that the prevalence of abnormal myocardial perfusion was similar in patients with either single or multiple lacunar infarcts and those that had experienced large vessel disease stroke.
