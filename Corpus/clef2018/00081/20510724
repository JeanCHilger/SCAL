Primary hyperparathyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in the outpatient setting. Phenotypically, it has evolved from a disease of overt symptomatology to one of vague complaints and biochemical diagnosis. Preoperative localization and intraoperative parathyroid hormone have revolutionized the surgical management of these patients. Minimally invasive operations are now common worldwide with low morbidity and high patient satisfaction.
