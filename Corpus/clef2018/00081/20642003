 Mucins, such as MUC1, belong to a large group of highly glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are expressed on the surface of most epithelial cells and to a smaller extent on T- and B-lymphocytes, nerve cells, monocytes, and hepatocytes (1). The structure and functions of these glycoproteins have been discussed in detail by Hattrup and Gendler (2). Upregulated gene expression and under-glycosylation of MUC1 have been reported in different cancers, particularly that of the breast, and usually indicate a poor prognosis for the patient (3, 4). Therefore, anti-MUC1 antibodies (Abs) have been used by several investigators to target this glycoprotein for the imaging and treatment of cancers with high expression of MUC1 (5, 6). Recently, a humanized anti-MUC1 Ab, AS1402, was studied to determine its safety, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and maximum tolerated dose in individuals with advanced breast cancer (4). From this study the investigators concluded that the Ab was well tolerated, and 5 of 26 patients showed stable disease lasting from 80 to 119 days, indicating that further investigation of the immunotherapy was necessary. Recently, an anti-MUC1 monoclonal Ab (mAb), PR81, was developed from human breast cancer cell extracts and evaluated for possible use as an immuniscintigraphic agent for the detection of breast cancer (7).
