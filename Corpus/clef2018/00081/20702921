Non-Gaussian space-variant resolution modelling for list-mode reconstruction. Partial volume effect is an important source of bias in PET images that can be lowered by accounting for the point spread function (PSF) of the scanner. We measured such a PSF in various points of a clinical PET scanner and modelled it as a product of matrices acting in image space, taking the asymmetrical, shift-varying and non-Gaussian character of the PSF into account (AMP modelling), and we integrated this accurate image space modelling into a conventional list-mode OSEM algorithm (EM-AMP reconstruction). We showed on the one hand that when a sufficiently high number of iterations are considered, the AMP modelling lead to better recovery coefficients at reduced background noise compared to reconstruction where no or only partial resolution modelling is performed, and on the other hand that for a small number of iterations, a Gaussian modelling gave the best recovery coefficients. Moreover, we have demonstrated that a deconvolution based on the AMP system response model leads to the same recovery coefficients as the corresponding EM-AMP reconstruction, but at the expense of an increased background noise.
