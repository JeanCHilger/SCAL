Rational approach to the synthesis, evaluation, and (68)ga labeling of a novel 4-anilinoquinoline epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor as a new imaging agent that selectively targets the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase. Certain small-molecule inhibitors that target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), such as Gefitinib, Erlotinib, and Lapatinib, provide a new approach for cancer treatment. In accordance with the pharmacophore model for inhibitor competition at EGFR-binding site, this study proposes a rationalized design for a novel 4-anilinoquinoline EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, [6,7-dimethoxyethoxy]-quinolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynylphenyl)-amine (YCU07). This is the first study to apply ring-closing metathesis toward synthesis of the quinoline nucleus for this 4-anilinoquinoline EGFR inhibitor. YCU07 expressed significant inhibitory activity for EGFR tyrosine kinase in A431 cells, as confirmed by an ABTS microwell peroxidase substrate system read colorimetrically at 405 nm. Injection of (68)Ga-labeled glutamic acid polypeptide (GAP)-YCU07 conjugate in nude mice implanted with A431 was imaged by animal PET camera (LabPET8 Gamma Medica-Ideas) and computed tomography (eXplore Locus
