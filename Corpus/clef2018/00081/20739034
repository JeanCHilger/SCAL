The pre-requisite of a second-generation glioma PET biomarker. Since the introduction of FDG into the field of molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) more than three decades ago, FDG has been the tracer of choice for oncology PET imaging. Despite the relative disadvantages of FDG and the relative benefits of its challengers, FDG remains the most commonly used glioma tracer nowadays. The present article surveys the expectations of the field and gives a concise summary of recent developments including the issues pertaining to the continued search for an optimal second-generation PET biomarker for glioma.The present article gives a concise summary of recent developments including the issues pertaining to the continued search for an optimal PET biomarker for glioma.
