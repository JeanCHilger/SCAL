Amyloid imaging using high-field magnetic resonance. The formation of senile plaques followed by deposition of amyloid β peptides (Aβ) are the earliest pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) thus, detection of the plaques remains the most important early diagnostic indicator of AD. Amyloid imaging is a noninvasive technique for visualizing senile plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's using positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Several types of probes have been developed for PET, but few ligands have been developed specifically for MR imaging detection of amyloid plaques. This review presents recent advances in amyloid imaging using MR imaging and includes our studies.
