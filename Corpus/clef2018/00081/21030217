Distribution volume ratio of serotonin and dopamine transporters in euthymic patients with a history of major depression - a dual-isotope SPECT study. Serotonin transporter (SERT) and dopamine transporter (DAT) levels differ in patients with major depression who are in a depressed state in comparison with healthy controls. The aim of this study was to examine the distribution volume ratios (DVRs) of SERT and DAT in drug-free and euthymic patients with a history of major depression. Subjects comprised 13 patients with a history of major depression and 26 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. The euthymic state of depression was defined as a score of 7 or less on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The DVRs of SERT and DAT were approximated using SPECT, with [(123)I] 2-((2-((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl)thio)-5-iodophenylamine (ADAM) and [(99m)Tc] TRODAT-1 as the ligands, respectively. There were no significant differences in the DVRs of SERT or DAT between healthy subjects and euthymic patients with a history of major depression hence, the SERT and DAT DVRs may not therefore be trait markers for patients with major depression, which helps us to understand more about the pathophysiology of depression.
