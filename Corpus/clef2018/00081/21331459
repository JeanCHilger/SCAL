Reduced cardiac 123I-MIBG uptake reflects cardiac sympathetic dysfunction in de novo Parkinson's disease. It remains unclear whether cardiac iodine-123-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) uptake is clinically related to autonomic dysfunction on conventional autonomic function testing in de novo Parkinson's disease (PD). We therefore studied the relation between cardiac (123)I-MIBG uptake and cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in patients with de novo PD. The subjects were 26 patients with de novo PD. The ratio of the average pixel count in the heart to that in the mediastinum was calculated to derive the cardiac (123)I-MIBG uptake. Cardiovascular autonomic function was evaluated on the basis of cardiovascular autonomic response on the Valsalva maneuver (VM), and systolic blood pressure response (SBP) on head-up tilt-table testing (HUT). Patients with de novo PD had significantly reduced cardiac (123)I-MIBG uptake as compared with controls (1.58 ± 0.43 vs. 2.25 ± 0.34, p = 0.0001) and cardiovascular autonomic response on the VM. No significant difference in the fall in SBP on HUT was found between patients with de novo PD and the controls. Cardiac (123)I-MIBG uptake in de novo PD was not significantly related to vasomotor sympathetic function, baroreceptor reflex gain, cardiac parasympathetic function, or the changes in SBP on HUT. Cardiac (123)I-MIBG uptake was, however, significantly related to the blood pressure overshoot in phase IV of the VM (r = 0.648, p = 0.0003). Cardiac (123)I-MIBG uptake began to decrease in association with the reduction in the overshoot of phase IV on the VM. Cardiac (123)I-MIBG uptake clinically reflects cardiac sympathetic dysfunction in de novo PD.
