Nitrogen-rich plasma-polymerized coatings on PET and PTFE surfaces improve endothelial cell attachment and resistance to shear flow. Low seeding efficiency and poor cell retention under flow-induced shear stress limit the effectiveness of in vitro endothelialization strategies for small-diameter vascular grafts. Primary-amine-rich plasma-polymerized coatings (PPE:N) deposited using low- and atmospheric-pressure plasma discharges on PET and PTFE are evaluated for their ability to improve endothelial cells' kinetics and strength of attachment. PPE:N coatings increase cell adhesion and adhesion rate, spreading, focal adhesion, and resistance to flow-induced shear compared with bare and gelatin-coated PET and PTFE. In particular, about 90% of the cells remain on coated surfaces after 1 h exposure to shear. These coatings, therefore, appear as a promising versatile approach to improve cell seeding strategies for vascular grafts.
