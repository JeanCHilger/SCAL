Clinical use of PET/CT in thyroid cancer diagnosis and management. The incidence of thyroid cancer is low, but when it occurs, it is mainly of the papillary histopathological type. Although PET/CT has a limited role in the diagnosis, it plays a significant role in the overall post-surgery management of a patient with thyroid cancer. This follow-up role is important, especially in patients with elevated serum thyroglobulin, but negative radioiodine whole body scans. There is increasing evidence that PET/CT should be a part of routine care in the Tg positive Radioiodine scan negative patient.
