The potential for induction peptide receptor chemoradionuclide therapy to render inoperable pancreatic and duodenal neuroendocrine tumours resectable. To assess the clinical utility of peptide receptor chemoradionuclide therapy (PRCRT) using (177)Lu-octreotate (LuTate) with concurrent 5FU chemotherapy in patients with inoperable primary pancreatic and duodenal neuroendocrine tumours (NETs).Between December 2006 and October 2009, five patients with progressive inoperable pancreatic and duodenal NETs without distant metastatic disease or with a potentially resectable solitary distant metastasis were treated with PRCRT in combination with external beam radiotherapy in one case. Patients were followed up three months post-treatment with somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, radiology, biochemical markers and clinical assessment. Radiological response classification was defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) with the addition of a minor response (MRAt three months post-treatment, all five patients had a scintigraphic response, four had a radiological response and three of the four symptomatic patients responded clinically. All five patients had an ongoing treatment response beyond three months including one where further tumour shrinkage facilitated curative surgery. All five patients are alive with 12-42 months of follow-up post-treatment.PRCRT can be effective in inoperable pancreatic and duodenal neuroendocrine tumours and may play a role as neoadjuvant therapy in this patient group.
