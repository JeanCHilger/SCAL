Detection of metastatic bone lesions in breast cancer patients: fused (18)F-Fluoride-PET/MDCT has higher accuracy than MDCT. Preliminary experience. So far, no studies comparing (18)F-Fluoride-PET/CT and MDCT for the detection of bone metastases are available. We compared the accuracy of (18)F-Fluoride-PET/CT (MDCT: 3.75 mm thickness-image-reconstruction), whole-body Multi-Detector-CT (MDCT: 1.25 mm thickness-image-reconstruction) and (18)F-Fluoride-PET/MDCT (MDCT: 1.25 mm thickness-image-reconstruction) in identifying bone metastases in breast cancer patients.We studied 39 breast cancer patients for bone metastases. Imaging was performed on an integrated PET/MDCT-system CT images were reconstructed at 3.75 mm and 1.25 mm thickness. Two nuclear medicine physicians and one radiologist interpreted blindly (18)F-Fluoride-PET/CT, (18)F-Fluoride-PET/MDCT and MDCT. MDCT at 12 months served as the standard of reference.Overall, 662 bone lesions were detected in our analysis. Of these, 542 were malignant and 120 were benign according to the standard of reference. (18)F-Fluoride-PET/CT detected 491 bone metastases, 114 (23%) of which displayed no clear morphological changes on MDCT, whereas MDCT detected 416 bone metastases, 39 (9.3%) of which showed no (18)F-Fluoride-PET uptake. Overall sensitivity and specificity were: 91% and 91%, respectively, for (18)F-Fluoride-PET/CT, and 77% and 93% for MDCT. The integrated assessment of (18)F-Fluoride-PET/MDCT yielded sensitivity and specificity values of 98% and 93%, respectively.(18)F-Fluoride-PET/MDCT has higher diagnostic accuracy than (18)F-Fluoride-PET/CT and MDCT for the evaluation of bone metastases in breast cancer.
