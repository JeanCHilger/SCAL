F-18 fluorodeoxy glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography findings in a rare case of penile leiomyosarcoma. Penile cancer is a rare entity accounting for only 0.4% all male malignancies. Penile leiomyosarcomas are even rarer with only around 35 cases reported in literature. We report a rare case of penile leiomyosarcoma illustrating F-18 Fluorodeoxy glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) features and histopathology correlation.
