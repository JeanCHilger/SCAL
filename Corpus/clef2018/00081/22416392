Positron emission tomography with 18F-FDG compared with proliferative activity of tumor cells in different subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In the course of this study we determined the ability of positron emission tomography (PET) with the 18F-FDG to detect non-hodgkin lymphoma lesions, assess their proliferative activity and differentiate aggressive tumors from indolent. Tracer uptake in lymphoma was evaluated semiquantitatively by calculation of standardized uptake values (SUV). It was compared with tumor grade and proliferation fraction determined by Ki-67 staining. In patients with indolent lymphoma, mean SUV was 2.5 +/- 0.6. In patients with aggressive lymphoma a significantly higher 18F-FDG uptake was observed (mean SUV was 8.1 +/- 1.3). Linear regression analysis indicated significant correlation of 18F-FDG uptake to biopsy samples proliferation fraction in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r = 0.55, p = 0.05) and indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (r = 0.7, p < 0.05). In this clinical study 18F-FDG uptake correlates with the aggressiveness of malignant lymphomas and with biopsy samples proliferative activity.
