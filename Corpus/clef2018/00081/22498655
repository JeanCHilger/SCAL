Multi-source feature learning for joint analysis of incomplete multiple heterogeneous neuroimaging data. Analysis of incomplete data is a big challenge when integrating large-scale brain imaging datasets from different imaging modalities. In the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), for example, over half of the subjects lack cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements an independent half of the subjects do not have fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans
