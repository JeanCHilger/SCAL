From neuroimaging to clinical setting: what have we learned from migraine pain? In the last 15 years, the neuroimaging of patients suffering from migraine with or without aura has improved our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of the disease. A great number of studies based on modern imaging techniques, such as structural imaging and functional imaging emphasize that in migraine patients suffering from repetitive pain attacks, both significant abnormalities of function and diffuse structural changes of brain white and gray matter become striking features of the disease. The hypothesis that migraine pain is due to a global brain disorder with substantial brainstem involvement leading to secondary blood flow changes in the posterior circulation is reinforced by several elegant studies. Clinical application of functional imaging findings in migraine is yet to be considered, since the specificity of some results has to be determined. Nevertheless, functional MRI techniques have a vast potential for exploring the pathophysiology of pain in migraine patients.
