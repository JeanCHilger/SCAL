Current management of nasopharyngeal cancer. Management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is one of the greatest clinical challenges. Appropriate detection is not easy because of its anatomical location sensitive biomarkers in addition to endoscopic and radiological examinations would be valuable. One useful biomarker (particularly for nonkeratinizing carcinoma) is the plasma level of Epstein-Barr viral deoxyribonucleic acid, and its role as a tool for prognostication and monitoring disease progress is presented. Radiotherapy is the primary treatment modality, and using radiation therapy in combination with chemotherapy is recommended for the treatment of locoregionally advanced tumors. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques with image guidance to ensure setup precision are recommended if resources allow
