Bone SPECT in patients with persistent back pain after lumbar spine surgery. Twenty-five patients with persistent pain after lumbar spine surgery for pain were evaluated by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) bone scanning. The patients were divided into three groups, depending on the type of surgery performed. The data obtained indicates that lumbar spine SPECT is most useful in conditions where there is the greatest likelihood of instability. The study shows that the improved contrast and better three-dimensional patient information gained through lumbar spine SPECT permits more accurate delineation of the level of maximum instability and stress on the vertebra.
