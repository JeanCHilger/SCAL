Quantitative assessment of myocardial viability following coronary artery bypass grafting using exercise thallium-201 myocardial single photon emission computed tomography and left ventricular regional wall motion. Using exercise thallium-201 myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and % radial shortening (%RS), 58 patients were evaluated before and after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to quantitatively assess myocardial viability and the effect of CABG. The patient was classified, according to redistribution pattern, as group I with only complete redistribution (20 cases) and group II with including incomplete redistribution (22 cases) and group III with no redistribution (16 cases). 1. Group I was expected complete improvement of ischemic myocardium after CABG but regional left ventricular wall motion was unchanged (sigma i%RS: 142.5 +/- 54.7----138.4 +/- 39.6, sigma a%RS: 201.2 +/- 51.1----238.2 +/- 68.2). 2. Group II was expected to diminish ischemic size after CABG and left ventricular regional wall motion was significantly improved (sigma i%RS: 68.8 +/- 25.9----154.9 +/- 42.6 p less than 0.01, sigma a%RS: 108.4 +/- 62.3----178.9 +/- 77.6, p less than 0.05). 3. Group III was no significant change of ischemic size and left ventricular wall motion after CABG (sigma i%RS: 67.8 +/- 24.1----83.9 +/- 19.2, sigma a%RS: 86.0 +/- 29.0----94.0 +/- 33.9). The present study suggests that quantitative assessment of myocardial viability using exercise thallium-201 myocardial SPECT and %radial shortening was useful method to determine the indication and to assess the effect of CABG.
