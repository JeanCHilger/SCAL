(-)Deprenyl in perspective: prophylaxis for Parkinson's disease? Idiopathic Parkinson's disease may derive from the action of an environmental 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-like compound. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) B converts MPTP to an actual neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) whilst prior administration of an MAO B inhibitor, (-)deprenyl, prevents the conversion. There is preliminary evidence that this drug can interrupt the pathological process in Parkinson's disease and prolong life expectancy. Thus, markers should be sought to identify the premorbid parkinsonian condition, prior to long-term (-)deprenyl treatment. Possibly approaches are by monitoring putative overactivity of the dopamine degrading enzymes, phenolsulphotransferase and MAO B, narrowing the field down further by PET-scan after administering a positron-emitting dopa analogue, 6-18F-labelled dopa.
