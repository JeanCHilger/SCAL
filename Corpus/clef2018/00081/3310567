Thallium imaging with single photon emission computed tomography. Evaluation of myocardial perfusion with thallium-201 SPECT has advantages over planar images. These advantages are related to better contrast of the images, lack of superimposition of normal and abnormal areas, and a three-dimensional representation of the site and extent of perfusion abnormalities (ischemia, scar, or both). For this reason, rotational tomography is superior to planar imaging in assessing the extent of coronary artery disease, in the detection of small infarcts, and for quantitative measurements. Several techniques have provided accurate quantitative data for infarct sizing both in animals and men. The ability to quantitate infarct size (or ischemia) will be extremely important in studies of myocardial salvage, risk stratification, and longitudinal studies to evaluate the effects of medical and surgical interventions.
