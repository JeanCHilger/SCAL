6-[18F]fluorometaraminol: a radiotracer for in vivo mapping of adrenergic nerves of the heart. The false neurotransmitter metaraminol has been 18F labeled and evaluated as a possible heart imaging agent on the basis of its selective accumulation in adrenergic nerves. Reaction of 6-(acetoxymercurio)-N-t-BOC-metaraminol with acetyl hypofluorite followed by removal of the BOC group provides a regiospecific synthesis of 6-fluorometaraminol (4). Use of acetyl hypo[18F]fluorite gives [18F]-4 in 60 min in 20-42% radiochemical yield. Systemic blockade of the neuronal uptake-1 carrier with desmethylimipramine or systemic destruction of the adrenergic nerves with 6-hydroxydopamine lowers [18F]-4 accumulation greater than or equal to 85% in all four regions of the rat heart. These preliminary findings suggest that [18F]-4 could be used to assess neuronal damage in various heart diseases by positron emission tomography.
