The Aberdeen Mark II single-photon-emission tomographic scanner: specification and some clinical applications. The construction, operation and physical characteristics of a single-section multi-detector single-photon-emission scanner are described. The machine has 24 detectors arranged along the sides of a square. Movements and data collection are under the control of a series of distributed microprocessors. Both head and trunk tomograms can be produced. The spatial resolution at the collimator focus is 9 mm in the transverse plane, and the effective slice thickness is 14 mm. The volume sensitivity is 300 counts/s kBq ml with a 20 cm diameter cylindrical phantom filled with 99Tcm solution. The application of this machine to the examination of the brain, liver and heart has been found to be clinically useful.
