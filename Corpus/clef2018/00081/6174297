A new system for gray-level surface distribution maps of electrical activity. This report describes an integrated anatomical, electrophysiological and data management system for presenting cortical surface distribution maps. Approximately equal area projections (lateral and top) were constructed from a cross-sectional whole head atlas. Anatomical landmarks (major sulcus and gyrus locations) were also located on the outline. The outline and weights for interpolation are stored in the computer, with software for map generation directly from multilead EEG or evoked potential data. Electrode position and number can be easily varied and mapped onto any shaped space using the same program. Data derived from other sources such as xenon blood flow, brain scans or positron emission tomography can similarly be presented. The program uses a laboratory computer and emphasizes simplicity of data management and a mapping algorithm which is applicable to many forms of data.
