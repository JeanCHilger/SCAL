Radiation absorbed dose estimates for positron emission tomography (PET): inert gases 19Ne and 77Kr. Detailed estimates of radiation absorbed dose based on solubility data and the distribution of body water and fat are presented for 19Ne and 77Kr, useful PET rCBF imaging agents. The steady-state inhalation of 75 mCi of 19Ne and the bolus inhalation of 18 mCi of 77Kr should result in comparable imaging statistics for typical protocols and lung radiation absorbed doses less than approx. 0.5 rad. A model for both steady-state and bolus inhalation techniques for soluble gases used for these radiation absorbed dose calculations is also presented.
