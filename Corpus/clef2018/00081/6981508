Experimental study for cancer diagnosis with positron-labeled fluorinated glucose analogs: [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-mannose: a new tracer for cancer detection. 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-mannose (18F-FDM) were tested as tumor diagnostic agents in a transplantable rat tumor and rabbit tumors. Tissue distribution studies in rats showed high tumor uptakes of both radiopharmaceuticals. The tumor uptake reached 2.65 +/- 0.61% dose 18 dose F-FDG/g and 2.65 +/- 0.81% dose 18F-FDM/g at 60 min and remained relatively constant until 120 min. Blood clearance both 18F-FDG and 18F-FDM was very rapid and tumor-to-blood ratios reached 22.1 and 29.4 at 60 min, respectively. Tumor-to-tissue ratios of both radiopharmaceuticals were very high in most organs, especially in the liver, kidney, and pancreas. Positron emission tomography (PET) of rabbit tumor with 18F-FDM clearly delineated the main tumor, central necrosis, and lymph node metastases. These data suggested that 18F-FDM, which is a by-product of 18F-FDG synthesis was also an excellent cancer diagnostic agent as well as 18F-FDG. This is not only a new feature of 18F-FDM, but also an economical improvement on cancer diagnosis by PET.
