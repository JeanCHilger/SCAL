Production of 18F-labelled 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose and preliminary imaging results. To allow an additional approach to the study of brain metabolism in our laboratory, the synthesis of 18F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG) has been adapted by the development of simple, reliable control techniques for routine use. By positron emission computed tomography, it has been established, in the baboon Papio papio, that there was a correlation between an epileptic focus and an increase in glucose incorporation. On the other hand, in man, a comparison between the local glucose utilization, cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption has showed, in patients with ischaemic strokes, a disruption in the normal flow-metabolism couple.
