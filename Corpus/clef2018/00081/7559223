Enhanced cardiac metabolism of plasma glucose in high-altitude natives: adaptation against chronic hypoxia. The metabolism of glucose in mammalian heart is 25-50% more O2 efficient than the metabolism of free fatty acids. To assess the role of substrate preference in adaptations to chronic hypoxia, positron emission tomographic measurements of heart regional glucose uptake rates after an overnight fast were made in volunteer Quechua subjects and in Sherpa subjects, both indigenous to altitudes of over 3,000 m, and in a group of lowlander volunteers. Highest uptake rates were found in the Quechuas on arrival and in the Sherpas after a 3-wk period at low altitude, intermediate rates in Quechuas after a 3-wk period at low altitude and in the lowlanders, and lowest rates in Sherpas on arrival. These low values were probably related to the stress of travel to the site of the experiments. Measured plasma catecholamines, hormones, and substrates indicated that glucose concentrations correlated best with observed variations in glucose uptake, with a negative correlation for the control subjects and a positive correlation for the Quechuas and Sherpas. Uptake values in Quechuas declined significantly after a 3-wk period at low altitude, but the positive correlation with glucose levels persisted. We conclude that an elevated glucose preference in heart is a true metabolic adaptation in humans adapted over generations to chronic hypoxia.
