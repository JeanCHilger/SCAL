Imaging of pituitary tumours. In the neuroradiological study of pituitary tumours, second generation CT, dynamic CT and MRI provide information about the extent of the tumour and its anatomical relations with the surrounding tissues. Sometimes these techniques can distinguish primary anterior pituitary lesions from primary parasellar lesions with presentations in the sellar region. In general, contrast-enhanced MRI and dynamic CT are more sensitive than conventional CT for the diagnosis of pituitary microadenomas, as well as for the precise delineation of the parasellar invasion of macroadenomas. Radiological techniques usually cannot distinguish clinically non-functioning from functioning pituitary adenomas. BSIPSS is used for confirmation of the diagnosis of Cushing's disease as well as for the lateralization of pituitary microadenomas in Cushing's disease and some other anterior pituitary hyperfunctional states. Neurotransmitter-receptor ligand imaging by SPECT with 123I-IBZM and/or 111In-DTPA-octreotide characterizes the dopamine D2 and somatostatin receptor status of pituitary adenomas, respectively. In selected cases, these techniques may be used for the differential diagnosis of pituitary tumours as well as for the differential diagnosis of primary anterior pituitary lesions and primary parasellar lesions with presentations in the sellar region. If medical therapy of these tumours with receptor agonists is being considered, these techniques can help in selecting the first-line treatment. Furthermore, the effects of medical therapy on the tumour can be evaluated. The introduction of newer and more receptor-specific radioligands may expand the clinical use of these techniques in the future. The availability of PET for the clinical diagnosis of pituitary tumours is still limited, but promising results have been described.
