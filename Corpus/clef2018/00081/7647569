Role of octreoscan and correlation with MR imaging in Graves' ophthalmopathy. Since the identification of somatostatin receptors on lymphocytes, orbital infiltration with mononuclear cells in Graves' ophthalmopathy has provided a rationale for receptor imaging with the radiolabeled somatostatin analog Octreotide. In 40 patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy and 10 controls, 110 MBq indium-Octreotide were administered i.v., and scans were performed at 4 and 24 h after injection. An uptake ratio between the orbits and the brain was determined. In 20 ophthalmophathy patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits was performed and the T2 relaxation time was measured within the rectus muscles. Compared to controls (4 h Octreotide uptake: median 6.0 counts/pixel/MBq, orbit/brain ratio 5.6), ophthalmopathy patients showed a 2- to 3-fold increased uptake (15.8 counts/pixel/MBq vs controls p = 0.0032 ratio 12.6, vs controls p = 0.003). When considering patients with active disease only, a higher uptake was registered (16.8 counts/pixel/MBq vs controls p 0.0048, ratio 15.6 vs controls p = 0.0006). Untreated patients showed a markedly higher uptake (23 counts/pixel/MBq) compared to patients receiving steroid therapy (12.6, p = 0.001). MRI of the orbit revealed a correlation between T2 relaxation time of the eye muscles and orbital uptake of Octreotide (p < 0.001).
