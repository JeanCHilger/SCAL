Myocardial and pulmonary uptake of S-1'-[18F]fluorocarazolol in intact rats reflects radioligand binding to beta-adrenoceptors. The biodistribution of S-(-)-4-(2-hydroxy-3-(1'-[18F]fluoroisopropyl)- aminopropoxy)carbazole ([18F]S-fluorocarazolol, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) was studied in rats (60 min after 18F injection when specific binding in peripheral organs was maximal). 18F uptake in brain, erythrocytes, heart and lung appeared to be linked to beta-adrenoceptors. CGP-20712A and ICI-89,406 inhibited 18F uptake in heart (predominantly beta 1-adrenoceptors) more potently than in lungs (predominantly beta 2-adrenoceptors). In contrast, ICI-118,551 and procaterol were more potent in the lungs than in the heart. ICI-118,551 inhibited 18F uptake in cerebellum (predominantly beta 2-adrenoceptors) more potently than in cerebral cortex (predominantly beta 1-adrenoceptors). Stereoselectivity of the in vivo binding was demonstrated since S-(-)-propranolol inhibited uptake in target tissues more effectively than R-(+)-propranolol. Myocardial and cerebral imaging may be hampered by poor heart-to-lung contrast and low signal-to-noise ratios, but [18F]S-fluorocarazolol seems suitable for positron emission tomography (PET) of pulmonary beta-adrenoceptors.
