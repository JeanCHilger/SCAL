Preparation, biodistribution and dosimetry of copper-64-labeled anti-colorectal carcinoma monoclonal antibody fragments 1A3-F(ab')2. Antibody fragments labeled with a radiometal using bifunctional chelates generally undergo renal clearance followed by trapping of the metabolites, leading to high radiation doses to the kidneys. Copper-64-labeled BAT-2IT-1A3-F(ab')2 was recently reported to accumulate in colorectal tumors in an animal model, however, kidney uptake was also high. In this study, the preparation of 64Cu-BAT-2IT-1A3-F(ab')2 was optimized to reduce the renal uptake.The bifunctional chelate 6-bromoacetamidobenzyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane-N,N ',N",N'"-tetraacetic acid (BAT) was conjugated to 1A3-F(ab')2 using the linking agent 2-iminothiolane (2IT). The conjugation reaction produced 20% of a lower molecular weight (molecular wieght) impurity found to be TETA-1A3-Fab'. The conjugation procedure was optimized to include FPLC purification of the BAT-2IT-1A3-F(ab')2 from TETA-1A3-Fab' after conjugation prior to labeling with 64Cu. The biodistribution of 64Cu-labeled FPLC-purified and unpurified conjugates was determined in normal Sprague-Dawley rats and tumor bearing Golden Syrian hamsters. Human absorbed doses were calculated from rat biodistribution data and PET imaging of a baboon.Upon FPLC purification of the BAT-2IT-1A3-F(ab')2, the immunoreactivity of 64Cu-labeled 1A3-F(ab')2 was significantly improved over that of non-FPLC-purified 64Cu-BAT-2IT-1A3-F(ab')2, and the kidney uptake was decreased in normal rats. The biodistribution in hamsters showed some improvement in both tumor uptake and kidney clearance with FPLC-purified 64Cu-BAT-2IT-1A3-F(ab')2.The improved dosimetry of 64Cu-labeled FPLC purified BAT-2IT-1A3-F(ab')2 should more readily allow this agent to be investigated clinically to image colorectal cancer using PET.
