Comparison of ictal SPECT and interictal PET in the presurgical evaluation of temporal lobe epilepsy. We retrospectively compared ictal technetium 99m hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and interictal 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) in 35 patients with well-lateralized temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Based on SPECT scans the two observers correctly lateralized seizure foci with certainty in 89% of patients interobserver agreement was excellent. Both observers incorrectly lateralized the seizure focus on two SPECT scans
