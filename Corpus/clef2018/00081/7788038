Reduction of exercise-induced myocardial perfusion defects by isosorbide-5-nitrate: assessment using quantitative Tc-99m-MIBI-SPECT. Although nitrates were introduced more than 100 years ago and have been used for the treatment of angina pectoris, there are still some open questions concerning the mechanism of their action on myocardial ischemia. There are also insufficient data regarding the influence of any anti-ischemic medication on the results of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy.To assess the influence of a mononitrate, 30 patients with stable angina pectoris, coronary stenosis > or = 70% and normal left ventricular function were examined using quantitative Tc-99m-MIBI exercise-single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). On the same day, 5 h after a randomized double-blind dose of 60 mg sustained-release isosorbide-5-nitrate or placebo, SPECT was repeated with identical stress protocol. The results were analyzed using a semi-automatic polar coordinate program that allows definition of areas with significant decreased blood flow expressed as a percentage of standard vessel area.In the vessel areas with the largest perfusion defects, the mean defect size decreased after isosorbide-5-nitrate from 38.2 +/- 31.0% to 29.1 +/- 33.8% (reduction by 24% P < 0.05) and increased from 35.2 +/- 27.6% to 36.6 +/- 27.4% after placebo (increase by 4%Acute administration of sustained-release isosorbide-5-nitrate significantly reduces the size of exercise-induced perfusion defects as assessed using quantitative Tc-99m-MIBI-SPECT.
