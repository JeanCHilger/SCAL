Age-related decline in striatal dopamine transporter binding with iodine-123-beta-CITSPECT. The effect of age on human striatal dopamine (DA) transporters was investigated with SPECT using the ligand [123I]2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane ([123I]beta-CIT).Iodine-123-beta-CIT binding in the striatum was examined in 28 healthy human subjects (14 men, 14 women) who ranged in age from 18 to 83 yr. Following injection with [123I]beta-CIT (mean +/- s.d. = 9.9 +/- 1.2 mCi), subjects were scanned with the brain-dedicated CERASPECT camera. A reconstructed transaxial slice 13.3-mm thick at the level of maximal striatal activity was used to determine tracer uptake in striatal and occipital regions of interest. The stability of regional uptake on Day 2 (approximately 18-24 hr postinjection) permitted estimation of the specific-to-nondisplaceable equilibrium partition coefficient: V3", calculated as (striatal--occipital)/occipital uptake at equilibrium.Values of V3" ranged from 3.6 to 11.4 for this sample (6.7 +/- 1.9). V3" showed a significant inverse correlation with age (r = -0.73, n = 28, p < 0.0001). Linear regression analysis revealed that V3" declined by 51% over the age range studied or approximately 8% per decade.These findings confirm postmortem reports of dopamine transporter loss with aging. In vivo methodologies may permit the age-related degeneration of dopamine nerve terminals to be studied in relation to the cognitive and motor deficits that occur in normal aging.
