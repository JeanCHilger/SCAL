Synthesis of a [11C]methoxy derivative of alpha-dihydrotetrabenazine: a radioligand for studying the vesicular monoamine transporter. The synthesis of [11C]TBZOMe, a [11C]methoxy derivative at the 2-hydroxy position of alpha-dihydrotetrabenazine, was carried out by an O-[11C]methylation reaction. The product [11C]TBZOMe (100-200 mCi) was obtained in 15-40% radiochemical yield (corrected for decay) within 37 min, and in high specific activity (2000-2500 Ci/mmol) and radiochemical purity (> 97%). [11C]TBZOMe is a potential new radioligand for studying the vesicular monoamine transporter using positron emission tomography.
