Cerebral haemodynamic changes after endovascular treatment of arteriovenous malformations: evaluation by single-photon emission CT. Cerebral haemodynamic changes in 17 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), who showed hypoperfusion on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) before endovascular treatment, were studied after embolization. Nine of them had non-haemorrhagic clinical manifestations and the other eight had a history of intracranial haemorrhage. Obliteration of AVMs was nearly total in six patients and partial in eleven. New low density lesions on X-ray computed tomography (CT) developed in 3 of 6 patients after nearly total obliteration and one of 11 patients after partial obliteration. The first SPECT after embolization showed diminished hypoperfusion in 11 of 13 patients without new low density lesions and one of 4 patients with new low density lesions. Diminution of hypoperfusion was seen even in two patients who underwent SPECT study immediately after the embolization. Cerebral circulation was improved in five of eight patients with low density lesions before embolization and in nine of eleven patients after partial obliteration. Hypoperfused state in the haemorrhagic group tended to remain unchanged compared with that in the non-haemorrhagic group. The hypoperfused area was expanded after embolization in three patients with new cerebral infarction. It is important for improvement of cerebral circulation to reduce the shunt flow without causing new infarction due to the embolization itself. In one of two patients who had a hyperperfused area surrounding the AVM after embolization, an unexpected and abnormal degree of brain swelling and haemorrhage occurred at the end of the surgery 20 days after the embolization. In the other patient, total extirpation was successfully performed after confirming disappearance of hyperperfusion in the follow-up SPECT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
