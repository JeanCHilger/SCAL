Imaging recovery of function following brain injury. The past years have seen significant advances in our understanding of recovery of function after brain lesions. This results from the development of sophisticated methods for exploring the human living brain, especially by using positron emission tomography scans. From the recent literature, it appears that two main mechanisms may participate in the recovery process: recruitment of cortical areas in the undamaged hemisphere and extension of specialized areas adjacent to the lesioned site.
