Kinetics of iodine-123-BMIPP in patients with prior myocardial infarction: assessment with dynamic rest and stress images compared with stress thallium-201 SPECT. Myocardial kinetics of 123I-labeled 15-(p-iodophenyl)3R, S-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) were evaluated with dynamic SPECT, and stress and rest BMIPP images were directly compared in conjunction with stress 201Tl.We studied 26 patients with prior myocardial infarction. Two minutes after injection of BMIPP, dynamic data acquisition with a three-headed SPECT was started and continued for 12 min. Conventional SPECT images were obtained at 20 min and 3 hr after injection. On a separate day, exercise, stress 201Tl SPECT was performed at 10 min and 3 hr after injection. Exercise stress-BMIPP imaging was performed in 15 of the patients, and static SPECT images were obtained.With dynamic SPECT, early clearance of BMIPP from the myocardium was observed in the segments with reversible 201Tl defects, suggesting enhanced contribution of backdiffusion from BMIPP. In myocardial segments with reversible 201Tl defects, 20-min BMIPP images showed a higher frequency of reduced uptake when compared to 3-hr 201Tl (90/163) imaging.With BMIPP dynamic SPECT, an enhanced contribution of backdiffusion in the early phase from ischemic myocardium was suggested. When exercise stress BMIPP images were obtained, a more severe defect was observed than on rest BMIPP and stress 201Tl imaging, possibly due to decreased coronary blood flow and impaired fatty acid uptake induced by ischemia during exercise.
