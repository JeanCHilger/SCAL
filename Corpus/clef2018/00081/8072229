A simple method to obtain semi-quantitative index of brain perfusion using 99mTc-HMPAO. We developed a new noninvasive index (brain uptake ratio, BUR) inferring brain perfusion using 99mTc-HMPAO scintigraphy, and compared with the index (brain perfusion index, BPI) reported by Matsuda, et al. BUR was obtained for 208 cerebral hemispheres from 104 cases as a ratio of radioactivity in a brain against that passing through an aortic arch. BUR correlated well with BPI (r= 0.965, p < 0.01). Information in deep or occipital regions was reflected well to BUR when data of SPECT images were used. BUR can be obtained even with a small field-of-view gamma camera. BUR is easily obtained and thought to be useful as a semi-quantitative index of brain perfusion.
