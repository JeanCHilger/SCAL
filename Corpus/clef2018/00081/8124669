Early and delayed SPECT images of extracerebral fluid collection in infants using 123I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine. Cerebral blood flow in seven infants with extracerebral fluid collections was investigated using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 123I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine. Early and delayed SPECT imaging was carried out. Areas of hypoperfusion were observed in five cases. The watershed zone of the major cerebral arteries or the territory of the anterior cerebral arteries were common areas of low perfusion. The hypoperfusion area was redistributed in two cases with intracranial hypertension. Subduroperitoneal shunts produced improvement of clinical symptoms in these cases. Hypoperfusion without redistribution was observed in three patients. In these areas, permanent tissue damage caused by a primary disease existed. Normal circulation patterns were observed in two patients. They showed normal development and follow-up CT revealed a decrease in the size of the extracerebral fluid collection. Measurement of regional cerebral blood flow may be helpful in considering surgical indications and in following up extracerebral fluid collection in infants.
