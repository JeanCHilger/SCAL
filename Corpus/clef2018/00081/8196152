Simultaneous dual myocardial imaging with iodine-123-beta-methyl iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) and thallium-201 in patients with coronary heart disease. To assess the clinical value of simultaneous dual myocardial imaging with iodine-123-beta-methyl-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid (123I-BMIPP) and thallium-201 (201Tl), myocardial imaging was performed at rest and during exercise in seven patients with coronary heart disease. When 123I-BMIPP and 201Tl images were compared, the initial exercise and resting images agreed 87% and 64%, respectively. In the initial resting images, the regional uptake of 123I-BMIPP was frequently less than that of 201Tl. The incidence of exercise-induced reversible defects by 201Tl in the Tl > BMIPP regions was significantly higher than that in the Tl = BMIPP regions (57% vs 4%, p < 0.01) and the incidence of coronary narrowing of more than 90% in the Tl > BMIPP regions was also significantly higher than that in the Tl = BMIPP regions (91% vs 38%, p < 0.01). In addition, this disparity (Tl > BMIPP) was found more frequently in regions with abnormal wall motion than in regions with normal wall motion (hypokinetic regions 68%, severe hypokinetic or akinetic regions
