Possibilities and limitations of radioimmunoscintigraphy and conventional diagnostic modalities in choroidal melanoma. A prospective clinical study to assess the value of immunoscintigraphy with a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) against high molecular weight melanoma associated antigen (225.28S) was performed in 43 patients with choroidal melanoma in six patients with a lesion suspected of being choroidal melanoma, and in seven patients with a benign lesion simulating a choroidal melanoma. The results of immunoscintigraphy in choroidal melanoma were compared with results of conventional diagnostic modalities like ultrasonography and fluorescein angiography. Planar scintigraphy showed a detection rate of 49% which is comparable with other studies. The detection with scintigraphy was correlated to the size of the choroidal melanoma. The use of single photon computed tomography did not increase the sensitivity of immunoscintigraphy. Ultrasonography yielded a correct diagnosis in 37 of 42 melanomas (88%). With fluorescein angiography a correct diagnosis was obtained in 11 of 30 melanomas (36.6%). The value of immunoscintigraphy with MoAb 225.28S in small choroidal melanomas is limited
