High yield synthesis of high specific activity R-(-)-[11C]epinephrine for routine PET studies in humans. R-(-)-[11C]Epinephrine ([11C]EPI) has been synthesized from R-(-)-norepinephrine by direct methylation with [11C]methyl iodide or [11C]methyl triflate. The total synthesis time including HPLC purification was 35-40 min. The radiochemical yields (EOB) were 5-10% for [11C]methyl iodide and 15-25% for [11C]methyl triflate. Radiochemical purity was > 98% optical purity determined by radio-chiral HPLC was > 97%. The [11C]methyl triflate technique produces R-(-)-[11C]epinephrine in quantities (80-170 mCi) sufficient for multiple positron emission tomography studies in humans. The two synthetic methods are generally applicable to the production of other N-[11C]methyl phenolamines and N-[11C]methyl catecholamines.
