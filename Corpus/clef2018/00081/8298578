Early and delayed distribution of N-isopropyl-[123I]-p-iodoamphetamine in haemorrhagic and ischaemic brain. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was used to study redistribution of N-isopropyl-[123I]-p-iodoamphetamine (IAMP) in 10 patients with intracerebral haemorrhage and 7 with ischaemic stroke. Delayed/early IAMP uptake ratios (D/E) were calculated for four different cerebral zones: haematoma or infarct, perilesional, normal and crossed cerebellar diaschisis areas. Delayed uptake was observed in all areas, but there were no significant differences between the haematoma and infarct results nor between the lesional and perilesional results. Delayed redistribution of IAMP therefore did not seem to be associated with neuronal metabolic activity.
