Ictal 99mTc-HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography in children with temporal lobe epilepsy. Seventeen ictal 99mTc-HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies were performed in 15 children with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) aged 7-14 years (mean 10.3 years). Ictal SPECT was informative in 16 of 17 (94%) studies in 14 of 15 (93%) children, showing unilateral temporal lobe hyperperfusion. In all 16 informative ictal SPECT studies, lateralization was concordant with ictal EEG, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and pathology. In 4 children, ictal SPECT provided additional localizing information that was not apparent from concurrent ictal EEG recording. Blinded interpretation of ictal SPECT studies by two independent investigators showed correct lateralization of the epileptic focus in every child. Results of visual analysis of ictal SPECT images were corroborated by quantitative analysis. Although interictal SPECT studies showed a degree of temporal lobe hypoperfusion in all children, in 9 of 15 hypoperfusion was either minimal, bilateral, contralateral, or associated with extratemporal hypoperfusion. In children with TLE, ictal SPECT provides reliable lateralizing information to corroborate or supplement that obtained from surface EEG and MRI.
