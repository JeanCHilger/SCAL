Correlation of adenosine echocardiography and thallium scintigraphy. Echocardiography and thallium-201 imaging with coronary vasodilators such as dipyridamole have been shown to be useful in detecting the presence and prognostic significance of coronary artery disease. Adenosine, a potent and direct coronary vasodilator, has a shorter physiologic half-life than dipyridamole, which exerts its effect by blocking the cellular uptake of adenosine. Because of the potential advantage of dipyridamole, we undertook this study to determine the correlation of adenosine echocardiography with thallium scintigraphy. Forty-two patients (18 men and 24 women mean age 64) who were unable to undergo treadmill exercise and were known or suspected to have coronary artery disease were studied. A baseline echocardiogram was obtained in four standard views followed by adenosine infusion at a rate of 140 micrograms/kg/min for 6 minutes. Thallium-201 was administered 3 minutes into the infusion while a second echocardiogram was performed. Thallium-201 imaging was begun immediately after the infusion of adenosine and repeated 4 hours later. Sixteen patients underwent coronary angiography within 1 month of the adenosine echocardiogram and thallium-201 study. At the peak infused dose of adenosine there was a significant increase in heart rate (12 beats/min
