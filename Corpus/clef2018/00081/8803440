Regional distribution of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor in the human brain studied with 11C-benztropine and PET using an anatomical standardization technique. We measured regional distribution of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor in the normal human brain with 11C-benztropine (BZT) and positron emission tomography (PET) using an anatomical standardization technique. Seven normal volunteers who gave informed consents were involved in this study. Immediately after intravenous injection of 11C-BZT into the subjects, we started dynamic PET scanning and serial frequent arterial blood sampling. Analyses of plasma metabolites were also performed at selected time points and plasma time activity curves (TAC) of unmetabolized ligand were generated. From these PET and TAC data, we obtained Patlak plot slope calculation images. Using the HBA (human brain atlas) system, the Patlak plot slope calculation image of each subject was transformed into the shape of the standard brain. Mean and standard deviation (SD) calculation images were generated from those anatomically standardized images. On these mean and SD images, we placed regions of interest which were previously outlined on a MR image of the standard brain. From those data, we found the highest receptor distribution in the striatum and occipital cortex, as well as high distribution in the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, which were consistent with previous reports. These results suggested that anatomical standardization of PET receptor images with 11C-BZT will be useful for delineating the physiological or pathological alterations of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor in the human brain.
