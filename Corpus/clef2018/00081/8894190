Performance on neuropsychological tests related to single photon emission computerised tomography findings in frontotemporal dementia. This study examines relations between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and neuropsychological test results, age at onset and duration of disease in patients with frontotemporal-type dementia (FTD).Sixteen patients with a diagnosis of probable FTD were examined using single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc-HMPAO as the tracer. The rCBF of 14 regions of interest relative to cerebellar blood flow was calculated. Psychological tests assessing language, verbal fluency, memory and visuospatial constructive ability were given.Correlations were demonstrated between a global impairment score and relative blood flow in lateral frontal, medial frontal and left orbital frontal areas. Verbal fluency scores correlated with left lateral frontal, medial frontal and left anterior inferior temporal blood flow. No relationships between decrease in CBF and age at onset or duration of disease, or between impaired cognitive function and age at onset or duration of disease were found.The present study demonstrates a close coupling between reduced rCBF and specific neuropsychological deficits in FTD.
