Lenticular system: full-color, limited-angle, autostereoscopic alternative to holography. The microlenticular system is a method of hard copy imaging that provides stereoscopic cues without the use of special glasses or viewing devices. Therefore, it is called an autostereoscopic technique. The microlenticular system consists of a layer of cylindric lenses combined with a photographic emulsion that carries three to seven different two-dimensional views of the same three-dimensional (3D) scene. Since each of the observer's eyes sees a different view, the resulting image is perceived as being 3D. The microlenticular system technique can be traced back to 1908 but was recently revived because of inventions that allow automatic photographic printing of this type of hard copy. The technique has been applied to visualization of medical 3D images obtained with the following modalities: computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, single photon emission CT, ultrasound, scanning electron microscopy, laser scanning, and confocal laser microscopy. Use of this technique results in images suitable for planning complex surgery and for simplifying the communication of complex geometries in science and education.
