Functional imaging of human right hemispheric activation for exploratory movements. We employed positron emission tomography to examine the functional anatomy of the exploratory-motor aspect of spatial attention. Subjects moved their right hand under nonexploratory (control) versus exploratory (active) conditions. Movement architecture and eye movements were matched across conditions. Statistical parametric maps of the exploratory (active) minus nonexploratory (control) tasks in subjects using their right hand in the right hemispace demonstrated activation in right cingulate, premotor and posterior parietal areas. The net activation of multiple right hemisphere cortical areas ipsilateral to the active limb and hemispace strongly supports the predicted, distributed network anatomy and is consistent with possible right hemispheric dominance for exploratory attentional movements.
