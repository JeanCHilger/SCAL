Reduced coronary flow reserve in familial hypercholesterolemia. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) presents the highest risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) among patients with hyperlipidemia. Therefore, early detection of coronary arterial atherosclerosis is important for the treatment of FH patients. The aim of this study was to detect early coronary arterial abnormalities that may relate to future atherosclerosis in asymptomatic FH patients by measuring coronary flow reserve (CFR) using PET and 13N-ammonia.Twenty-five patients with FH (14 men, 11 women) without a history of myocardial ischemia and 14 control subjects (9 men, 5 women) were studied. Total serum cholesterol (mmole/liter) was 5.33 +/- 0.66 in control subjects and 7.90 +/- 0.77 in FH patients (p < 0.01 versus control subjects).Myocardial blood flow (MBF) at rest and during dipyridamole loading was measured using PET, and CFR was calculated. MBF (ml/min/100 g weight heart) at rest in the FH group (79.0 +/- 20.0) was comparable to that in control subjects (70.0 +/- 17.0). However, MBF during dipyridamole loading was significantly lower in FH patients (163.0 +/- 67.0) than in control subjects (286.0 +/- 120.0, p < 0.01). CFR in FH patients (2.09 +/- 0.62) was also significantly lower than that in control subjects (4.13 +/- 1.38, p < 0.01). CFR showed a gender-specific variance in FH patients (1.85 +/- 0.40 in men versus 2.55 +/- 0.74 in women p < 0.05) but not in control subjects. Significant inverse correlations between CFR and the total plasma cholesterol level as well as plasma LDL cholesterol were observed.The CFR was reduced in patients with FH. This abnormality was more prominent in men than in women patients. Noninvasive assessment of CFR by 13N-ammonia PET was useful to detect early abnormalities of the coronary arteries in asymptomatic patients with FH.
