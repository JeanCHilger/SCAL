The intercosto-brachial anastomosis in the treatment of cervical roots avulsions: clinical and neurophysiological considerations. The Authors present their surgical and clinical experience about the intercosto-brachial anastomosis for treating traumatic avulsions of the cervical roots. The most interesting aspect in the postoperative course of these patients in their ability to regain a voluntary elbow flexion independently from the respiratory activity. A dinamic SPECT examination in a small series of cases suggests that some mechanisms of functional reorganization within the brain should be involved.
