Neural control of micturition in man examined with single photon emission computed tomography using 99mTc-HMPAO. THE neural mechanisms of micturition in man were studied using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The areas activated during micturition, relative to the resting state, were the upper pons, the left sensorimotor cortex, the right frontal cortex and the bilateral supplementary motor areas. Some of these regions have been established by clinical and experimental studies as the neural control centre for voiding. We confirmed the neural micturition centre in healthy men using SPECT for the first time.
