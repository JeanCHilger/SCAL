Imaging studies of memory and attention. Functional brain imaging studies of memory and attention with positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging demonstrate involvement of specific regions of the normal human brain. Possible anatomical substrates for different types of memory have been identified. Different aspects of attention mechanisms, such as modulation of early visual areas, shifts of attention, and selection of response, also appear to involve specific anatomic regions revealed by imaging. Many of these studies show activation in regions clinically considered to be "silent" regions.
