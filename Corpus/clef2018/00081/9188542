Functional brain imaging with cerebral perfusion SPECT in cerebrovascular disease, epilepsy, and trauma. Functional brain imaging with cerebral perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has practical and important applications for use by neurosurgeons in the evaluation of cerebrovascular disease, stroke, epilepsy, and trauma. The radiopharmaceuticals used in SPECT enable one to image a "snapshot" of regional cerebral blood flow. The findings on SPECT can be the most sensitive and unique descriptors of dynamic alterations in brain function due to the aforementioned disorders. Used in conjunction with other imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging, CT, and neurodiagnostic tests such as EEG and TCD, the brain blood flow images enhance the ability of the neurosurgeon to determine the perfusion status of the brain.
