Functional magnetic resonance imaging of the somatosensory cortex. Functional magnetic resonance (fMR) imaging, like positron emission tomography (PET), shows regions of activation in the brain resulting from the neuronal activity associated with cognitive, sensory, or motor function. An advantage of fMR imaging is that the functional and the reference anatomic images are acquired simultaneously. Additionally, fMR imaging is generally more available than PET or magnetoencephalography. This article reviews the applications of fMR imaging for studying the sensorimotor cortex prior to craniotomy.
