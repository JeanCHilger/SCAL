Receptor binding radiotracers for the angiotensin II receptor: radioiodinated [Sar1, Ile8]Angiotensin II. The potential for imaging the angiotensin II receptor was evaluated using the radioiodinated peptide antagonist [125I][Sar1, Ile8)angiotensin II. The radioligand provides a receptor-mediated signal in several tissues in rat (kidneys, adrenal and liver). The receptor-mediated signal of 3% ID/g kidney cortex should be sufficient to permit imaging, at least via SPECT. The radiotracer is sensitive to reductions in receptor concentration and can be used to define in vivo dose-occupancy curves of angiotensin II receptor ligands. Receptor-mediated images of [123I][Sar1, Ile8]angiotensin II were obtained in the rat kidney and Rhesus monkey liver.
