A study on non-ulcer dyspepsia patients with electrogastrography and gastric emptying by using SPECT technique. Non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) is very common in community population. However, its pathogenesis was controversial, particularly with respect to motility disorder. In this study electrogastrogram (EGG) and gastric emptying rate (GER) by using SPECT technique (test meal labelled with 99mTc-PHY and 113In-DTPA) were carried out in healthy subjects and 27 NUD patients. In EGG examination, the authors first proposed four parameters, i.e. peak time (PT), return time (RT), degeneration rate (DR) and arrhythemia rate (AR). Comparison of EGG between NUD patients and controls showed that AR, RT, DR in NUD patients were significantly higher or longer than these in the controls (P > 0.05). Solid phase GET in NUD patients were significantly delayed than that in the controls. No significant correlation was found between EGG and GET. A delay gastric emptying cannot be predicted with EGG examination only.
