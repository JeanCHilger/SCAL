Tolerability of endocrine treatment for advanced breast cancer: results of an international survey. In contrast with cytotoxic therapy, the impact of hormonal therapy for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women is poorly documented. Two recent surveys of the impact of hormonal therapy in this patient group found that side-effects had an adverse impact on patients' quality of life which needed to be taken into account when discussing treatment options. Patients were perceived to be more comfortable discussing treatment-related problems with nurses rather than doctors, who tended to underestimate the distress caused to patients by the side-effects of treatment. A need was identified for better lines of communication between patients and medical professionals, and for a simple, more widely applicable tool for assessment of side-effects. As a result of these findings, a simple checklist, Checklist for Patients on Endocrine Therapy (C-PET), has been developed to be completed by patients before a physician appointment, to form a basis for discussion. A pilot study has indicated that C-PET is easy and quick for patients to complete and aids communication between patients and healthcare professionals. C-PET has now been formally launched to nurses, oncologists, and other cancer physicians.
