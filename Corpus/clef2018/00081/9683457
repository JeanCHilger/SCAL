Estimating glucose metabolism using glucose analogs and two tracer kinetic models in isolated rabbit heart. The purpose of this investigation was to 1) evaluate the relative accuracy of the Sokoloff and Patlak tracer kinetic models in estimating glucose metabolic rate (GMR) in the presence and absence of insulin 2) evaluate the effect of nutritional state on the lumped constant (LC)
