Practicability and safety of dipyridamole cardiac imaging in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We tested the practicability of dipyridamole myocardial nitrogen-13 ammonia positron emission tomography (dipyridamole (13)NH(3 )PET) for the perioperative risk assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) in a cohort of patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) undergoing lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). Twenty consecutive LVRS candidates, 13 men and 7 women (mean age 57+/-2 years), without symptoms of CAD were prospectively studied by dipyridamole (13)NH(3 )PET. Side-effects and overall tolerance were assessed by a questionnaire and visual analogue scale. Repeated pulmonary function tests were performed before and 4, 12, 16 and 30 minutes after dipyridamole injection. All dipyridamole (13)NH(3 )PET studies were negative for CAD. Seventeen patients underwent LVRS without cardiac complications three patients did not undergo LVRS for other reasons. Nine patients suffered intolerable dyspnoea requiring i.v. aminophylline. Mean FEV(1) decreased significantly after dipyridamole infusion: in nine patients the reduction in FEV(1)exceeded 15% from baseline. We found that dipyridamole is not well tolerated and causes significant bronchoconstriction in patients with severe COPD. Although all dipyridamole-induced side effects can be promptly reversed by aminophylline, dipyridamole cannot be recommended as a pharmacological stress in this setting.
