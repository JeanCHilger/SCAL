In vivo effects of olanzapine on striatal dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor binding in schizophrenic patients: an iodine-123 iodobenzamide single-photon emission tomography study. Olanzapine is a new atypical antipsychotic agent that belongs to the same chemical class as clozapine. The pharmacological efficacy of olanzapine (in contrast to that of risperidone) has been shown to be comparable to that of clozapine, but olanzapine has the advantage of producing a less pronounced bone marrow depressing effect than clozapine. The specific aims of this study were (a) to assess dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor availability in patients treated with olanzapine by means of iodine-123 iodobenzamide [(123)I]IBZM single-photon emission tomography (SPET), (b) to compare the results with findings of [(123)I]IBZM SPET in patients under treatment with risperidone and (c) to correlate the results with the occurrence of extrapyramidal side-effects (EPMS). Brain SPET scans were performed in 20 schizophrenic patients (DSM III R) at 2 h after i.v. administration of 185 MBq [(123)I]IBZM. Images were acquired using a triple-head gamma camera (Picker Prism 3000 XP). For semiquantitative evaluation of D(2)/D(3) receptor binding, transverse slices corrected for attenuation were used to calculate specific uptake values [STR-BKG]/BKG (STR=striatum BKG=background). The mean daily dose of olanzapine ranged from 0.05 to 0.6 mg/kg body weight. The dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor binding was reduced in all patients treated with olanzapine. Specific IBZM binding [STR-BKG]/BKG ranged from 0.13 to 0.61 (normal controls >0.95). The decreased D(2)/D(3) receptor availability revealed an exponential dose-response relationship (r=-0.85, P<0.001). The slope of the curve was similar to that of risperidone and considerably higher than that of clozapine as compared with the results of a previously published study. EPMS were observed in only one patient, presenting with the lowest D(2)/D(3) availability. The frequency of EPMS induced by olanzapine (5%) was considerably lower than the frequency under risperidone treatment (40%). Our findings suggest an exponential relationship between the daily dose of olanzapine striatal and decreased D(2)/D(3) striatal binding availability. The results are consistent with the findings of in vitro experiments reporting a higher D(2)/D(3) receptor affinity and a similar 5HT(2) receptor affinity of olanzapine as compared with clozapine. Thus, the decreased tendency to induce EPMS at therapeutic doses is not due to the limited occupancy of striatal D(2)/D(3) receptors in vivo. Patients are protected from EPMS by other intrinsic effects of the drug, i.e. the combination of both D(2)/D(3) and 5HT(2) receptor antagonism.
