Similar effect of revascularization on technetium-99m( )sestamibi and 15-(p-iodophenyl)pentadecanoic acid uptake in myocardial infarction patients. To study its usefulness as a tracer for assessment of the perfusion and viability of myocardium, 15-(p-iodophenyl)pentadecanoic acid (IPPA) was compared with technetium-99m sestamibi (MIBI). Dual-tracer single-photon emission tomography rest imaging was performed no more than 2 months before and 3 months after coronary artery bypass grafting in 28 patients with previous anterior (n=13) or inferior (n=15) infarction. The size of MIBI and IPPA defects decreased from 14%+/-12% and 13%+/-9% to 10%+/-11% and 9%+/-7%, respectively (P<0.001 for both). The MIBI uptake increased in the infarct zones from 35%+/-11% to 43%+/-8% (P<0.001), and in the peri-infarct zones from 50%+/-11% to 55%+/-10% (P<0.05). The IPPA uptake increased in the infarct zones from 37%+/-11% to 44%+/-13% (P<0.001), and in the peri-infarct zones from 51%+/-11% to 57%+/-12% (P<0.05). In nine patients with improved regional echocardiographic wall motion score after bypass surgery, the pre-operative uptake values of both MIBI and IPPA in the infarct and peri-infarct zones were on average slightly but not significantly higher than in 19 patients with no observed improvement in regional wall motion score. In patients with improved regional wall motion, the MIBI scans and the IPPA scans showed (non-significant) decreases in defect size and increases in infarct and peri-infarct zone uptake after bypass surgery. Similar (in some cases significant) changes were observed in the patients without improvement in wall motion. Thus IPPA and MIBI provided similar information about perfusion and viability in pre- and postoperative evaluation of patients with clinically evident myocardial infarction and with normal global ejection fraction. Regardless of the tracer used, the resolution capability of the dual-tracer method with a rest imaging protocol was not sufficient to differentiate viable from non-viable infarction defects in unselected individual patients with a normal ejection fraction.
