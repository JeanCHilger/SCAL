Differential uptake of FDG and DG during post-ischaemic reperfusion in the isolated, perfused rat heart. Fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) and 2-deoxyglucose (DG) are widely used as tracers of glucose uptake in the myocardium. Although there is agreement that the two analogues behave similarly to glucose under control conditions, there is growing evidence that some interventions (e.g. insulin stimulation or ischaemia/reperfusion) cause differential changes in their behaviour. The addition of a two-surface coil nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probe and a dual-perfusion cannula to our recently developed PET and NMR dual-acquisition (PANDA) system allows us to collect PET (FDG) images and phosphorus-31 NMR (2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate) spectra simultaneously from each independently perfused coronary bed of the heart. We have used this technique to study the effect of regional ischaemia/reperfusion on FDG and DG uptake in the isolated, perfused rat heart. During control perfusion, FDG uptake was almost identical in both coronary beds. When one coronary bed was made ischaemic, FDG uptake ceased on that side but continued on the control side. Reperfusion failed to restore FDG uptake. In contrast, NMR spectra showed that, during reperfusion, the uptake and phosphorylation of DG did not differ between the two coronary beds. The results thus demonstrate that regional myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion has different effects on the uptake of FDG and DG in the isolated, perfused rat heart.
