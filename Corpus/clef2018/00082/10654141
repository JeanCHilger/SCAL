Evaluation of [11C]GB67, a novel radioligand for imaging myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptors with positron emission tomography. Dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system underlies a number of myocardial disorders. Positron emission tomography (PET) offers a way of assessing receptor function non-invasively in humans, but there are no PET radioligands for assessing myocardial alpha-adrenoceptors. GB67, a structural and pharmacological analogue of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, was labelled with positron-emitting carbon-11 (t1/2 = 20.4 min) by 11C-methylation of N-desmethylamido-GB67 (GB99). [11C]GB67 was injected intravenously into conscious rats. Serial arterial blood samples were taken. Rats were killed and tissues removed to determine radioactivity. The percentages of unchanged [11C]GB67 and its radioactive metabolites in plasma and tissues were assessed by HPLC. Plasma clearance of radioactivity was rapid. Myocardial uptake was maximal at 1-2 min and decreased slowly during 60 min. Predosing with adrenoceptor antagonists demonstrated selectivity for myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptors. GB67 and prazosin blocked uptake of radioactivity the non-selective antagonist, phentolamine, partially blocked uptake
