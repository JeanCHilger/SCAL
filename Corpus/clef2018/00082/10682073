Use of bolus intraperitoneal iron dextran in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis patients receiving recombinant human erythropoietin. Impaired erythropoiesis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) patients receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) is most often secondary to iron deficiency, either as a result of poor intestinal absorption or failure to take oral supplements as prescribed. The inconvenience of giving intravenous (i.v.) iron dextran (ID) to CAPD/CCPD patients precluded its use in this population. We therefore examined the efficacy of bolus intraperitoneal (i.p.) iron dextran (1000 mg) on erythropoiesis in a pilot study of 14 CAPD/CCPD patients. The patients ranged in age from 23-81 years, and all had iron deficiency (transferrin saturation 6%-23% mean: 15.2% +/- 1.34%). Of the 14 patients studied, 13 were receiving rHuEPO. Pre-treatment hematocrit (Hct) ranged from 21%-38% (mean: 30.2% +/- 1.37%). After infusion of 2 L Dianeal (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, Illinois, U.S.A.), 500 mg of undiluted ID was administered directly into the Tenckhoff catheter and subsequently flushed with 30 mm3 normal saline. The peritoneal dialysis (PD) exchange containing ID then dwelled for a period not < 6 hours before standard PD resumed. A second 500 mg dose ID was given to each patient by the same protocol 3-86 days later (mean: 14 days). No complications were seen. No patient complained of abdominal pain or other subjective symptoms during infusion or during the dwell. Repeat iron studies done 1-7 months post ID (mean: 2.8 months) showed a 1.1-fold to 4.9-fold increase (mean: 1.4-fold) in mean iron levels (40.4 +/- 3.9 mg/dL versus 57.5 +/- 5.5 mg/dL, p = 0.036)
