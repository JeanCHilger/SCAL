Positron emission tomography: a first-hand experience. In July 1999, the University of Kansas Hospital installed a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner and added PET to the imaging technologies it offers patients and physicians. The new service is managed by the nuclear medicine section in the department of radiology. Plans are being implemented now to install a cyclotron in March 2000. Prior to installation of the scanner, a radiation area survey was performed in the space being considered for the PET unit. We also needed to address other critical considerations, including the manufacturer's requirements for construction of the scanner room, special electrical needs, and how the system would connect to our existing information network. It is important to work closely with your chief financial officer and chief operations officer from the beginning of the purchasing process so that these administrators have up-to-date, supportive information about PET and the progress of the installation. We made use of a variety of promotional techniques to market the new service, including broadcast e-mail, an open house for potential referring physicians, postings on the nuclear medicine Web site and communication through the local media. We also worked with the major insurance providers that utilize our hospital to educate them about PET and its benefits. In addition, we trained our own billing staff about procedures that optimize reimbursement for PET. In March 2000, University of Kansas Hospital will install the first cyclotron in the state, enabling us to generate the drugs used for PET scanning and potentially to add targets for research PET radiopharmaceuticals.
