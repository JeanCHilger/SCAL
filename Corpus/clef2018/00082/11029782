Clinical and pathologic factors predicting axillary lymph node involvement in breast cancer. The diagnosis of axillary disease remains a challenge in the management of breast cancer and is a subject of controversy. In 1998, the Japanese Breast Cancer Society conducted a study assessing axillary lymph node involvement in breast cancer. The study included (a) clinical assessment by pre-operative imaging modalities, (b) histologic assessment for peritumoral lymphatic invasion, (c) biologic assessment by gelatinolytic activity using film in situ zymography, and (d) sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. Clinical assessments by CT, PET, and US as well as biologic assessment were limited in their ability to detect axillary lymph node disease, although these imaging techniques may be useful to exclude node-positive patients from the need for SLN biopsy. Histologic assessment for peritumoral lymphatic invasion was useful, particularly for detecting false-negative cases by SLN biopsy. Nevertheless, the utility of SLN biopsy in assessing axillary nodal status was confirmed. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be avoided in patients with a small tumor and a negative SLN. However, further studies will be required to investigate the value of SLN biopsy for predicting regional control and survival before it can replace routine ALND as the optimal staging procedure for operable breast cancer.
