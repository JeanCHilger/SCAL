Sestamibi SPECT in the detection of myocardial viability in patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction: comparison between visual and quantitative analysis. Technetium 99m sestamibi cardiac scintigraphy is widely used as a means of predicting myocardial viability in patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. No data are available comparing the results of visual and quantitative analysis of tomographic imaging in the assessment of myocardial viability. The aim of this study was to directly compare visual and quantitative analysis of resting sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography in the identification of viable myocardium in patients with chronic LV dysfunction.Sixty-five patients with an earlier myocardial infarction and LV dysfunction that had occurred within 1 week underwent echocardiography and resting sestamibi SPECT. In each patient, regional tracer distribution was visually assessed and quantitatively measured in 13 segments. Regional LV function was evaluated in corresponding segments by means of echocardiography. All patients underwent revascularization, and echocardiography was repeated 12 months later as a means of assessing the recovery of regional LV function. Among all akinetic or dyskinetic revascularized segments, 66 of 112 viable segments (59%) and 85 of 100 nonviable segments (81%) were identified by means of visual analysis. Eighty-two of 112 viable segments (73% P<.05 vs. visual analysis) and 74 of 100 nonviable segments (74%The results of this study demonstrate that, in patients with chronic myocardial infarction and LV dysfunction, visual and quantitative analysis of sestamibi tomographic images at rest have similar overall accuracy in predicting the recovery of LV function after coronary revascularization procedures.
