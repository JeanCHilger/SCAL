Effectiveness of adenoidectomy and laser tympanic membrane fenestration. Adenoidectomy alone or with tonsillectomy (A+/-T) is an effective surgical intervention in the management of otitis media in children, especially when it is performed in conjunction with insertion of pressure equalization tubes (PETs). Otorrhea and persistent tympanic membrane (TM) perforation are frequent complications. This study evaluates the effectiveness of intermediate duration middle ear ventilation using laser tympanic membrane fenestration (LTMF) without tube insertion and as an adjunct to adenoidectomy in resolving middle ear disease within the first 90 days after surgery.This pilot study was a multicenter, prospective clinical cohort trial. Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. The study involved four tertiary care pediatric otolaryngology departments. Fifty children (96 ears) were treated with LTMF in conjunction with A+/-T from June 1, 1998, through March 30, 1999. Ages ranged from 9 months to 12 years. Patients undergoing A+/-T who would have been recommended for PET insertion instead underwent middle ear ventilation with LTMF using the Oto-LAM device (ESC/Sharplan, Yokneam, Israel). Patients were seen at 30, 60, and 90 days postoperatively. Resolution of otitis media with effusion was determined by clinical examination, which included pneumatic otoscopy, audiometry, and tympanometry.Of the treated ears, 88%, 86%, and 83% had clinical resolution of middle ear disease at 30, 60, and 90 days, respectively. Preoperatively, 45% (n = 85) of ears had normal hearing 92% (n = 49) had normal hearing at 90 days. Eighty-nine percent (n = 92) had type C2 or B tympanograms preoperatively, and 12% (n = 60) had type C2 or B at 90 days.Laser tympanic membrane fenestration in conjunction with adenoidectomy was effective in restoring normal middle ear function at 90 days post-treatment in greater than 80% of children who otherwise may have had placement of PETs.
