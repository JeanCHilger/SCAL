Peritoneal accumulation of advanced glycosylation end-products in diabetic rats on dialysis with icodextrin. To evaluate and compare the effects of glucose-based solutions to those of icodextrin with respect to peritoneal transport characteristics and formation of advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs) in the peritoneal membrane in the diabetic rat model of peritoneal dialysis (PD).Thirty-three male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 275 - 300 g were divided into 5 groups: group C (n = 6), control rats with catheter but not dialyzed group D (n = 5), diabetic rats with catheter but not dialyzedThe level of immunostaining was lowest in group C and highest in group G. Significant differences were seen between group C and groups G, H, and I (p < 0.001, p = 0.001, and p< 0.05 respectively). Significant differences were also found between group G and groups D and I (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05 respectively). Over time, glucose concentration at the end of an exchange versus concentration at instillation (D/D0 glucose) decreased and dialysate-to-plasma ratio (D/P) of urea increased. Significant differences were found between groups C and H for D/D0 glucose (0.40+/-0.01 vs 0.35+/-0.01, p < 0.05) and between groups C and H for D/P urea (0.87+/-0.03 vs 0.97+/-0.02, p < 0.05).These results suggest that AGE formation is lower with the use of peritoneal dialysis solution containing icodextrin than with glucose-based solutions. We conclude that the use of icodextrin may be helpful in slowing the deterioration of the peritoneal membrane, prolonging its use for dialysis.
