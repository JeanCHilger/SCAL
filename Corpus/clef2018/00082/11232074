Scintigraphy in the foot and ankle. Nuclear medicine provides a number of sensitive, although unfortunately not always specific techniques, for the evaluation of foot pain and suspected infection. In most patients the 3 phase bone scan is the initial means of evaluation, with a labeled white cell scan included when osteomyelitis is suspected. Nuclear medicine studies must be interpreted with knowledge of the patient's history and symptoms and with close correlation to plain film findings. Attention to detail when acquiring images, possibly with the addition of SPECT or pinhole images in difficult patients, results in excellent anatomic localization in most patients.
