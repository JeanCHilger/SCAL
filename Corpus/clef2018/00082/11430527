The role of nuclear medicine in monitoring treatment in skeletal malignancy. The nuclear medicine bone scan has historically been one of the most common investigations to stage and monitor skeletal malignancy. Current guidelines for using radiographs to assess the response of skeletal metastases to systemic therapy are limited in their ability to give a timely result. Despite some minor limitations caused by the flare phenomenon, skeletal scintigraphy remains widely used for this purpose, both clinically and in trials of new cancer treatments. Nuclear medicine has also played an important role in the posttherapy evaluation of primary bone tumors, both with bone agents and nonspecific tumor agents, such as 201Tl. In the future, it is possible that positron emission tomography radiopharmaceuticals such as 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose may prove to be superior in predicting and measuring treatment response in primary and metastatic bone and bone marrow disease, but further work is required in this area.
