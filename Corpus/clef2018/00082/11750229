Esophageal cancer: patient evaluation and pre-treatment staging. Improvements in the overall survival of patients with esophageal cancer can in the future only be achieved by tailored therapeutic strategies which are based on the individual histologic tumor type, tumor location, tumor stage at the time of presentation, consideration of established prognostic factors and the physiologic status of the patient. The major aim of every diagnostic strategy is to assess whether a complete macroscopic and microscopic tumor resection (i.e. an R0 resection) can be achieved by primary surgical approach with a high degree of likelihood. This requires histologic classification of the tumor type (squamous cell cancer or adenocarcinoma), the exclusion of distant solid organ metastases, localization of the primary tumor in relation to the tracheobronchial tree, and determination of the T-category and the surrounding structures of the primary tumor. This is currently achieved by a combination of contrast radiography, endoscopy with biopsy, endoscopic ultrasonography and CT scan. PET scanning will in the future be more widely used in esophageal cancer staging because it appears to be superior to current imaging modalities in the exclusion of distant solid organ and lymph node metastases and allows early assessment of response of the primary tumor to neoadjuvant treatment. Systematic risk analysis with a dedicated composite scoring system is essential to assess the physiologic status of the patient and reduce postoperative mortality. Only hospitals with a sufficient case load of esophageal cancer patients ('hospital volume') and a dedicated interest in the management of this disease ('centers of excellence') can provide the required expertise and standards for patient evaluation and tailored therapy.
