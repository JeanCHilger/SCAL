Risk of rabies after mammal bites in Thai children. The data were collected by questionnaire at the Outpatient Department of Chulalongkorn University Hospital, Bangkok Thailand. This study revealed that 52 per cent of children had pet mammals in their home of which 67 per cent were dogs. 23.6 per cent of these children gave at least one history of a mammal bite inside (53.4%) or outside (46.6%) their house. Mammal bites of children could be found at all ages. However, most were in the age group of 10-14 years (42.3%), and 5-9 years (39.7%). The most common site of injury was on the legs (56.6%) and hands (30.7%). 31.7 per cent and 68.3 per cent of the bitten children incurred WHO category II and III potential rabies exposures (moderate and severe). 61.9 per cent had performed wound cleansing on each bite injury site and 34 per cent did not. 72 per cent of the children who had mammal bites received no post-exposure rabies treatment and 85.7 per cent did not make any effort to capture or observe the animal who had bitten them. Only 10.6 per cent observed the animals for 10 days or more. It was concluded that children are at considerable risk of mammal bites and that they are not receiving optimal care in this canine rabies endemic region and that 50 per cent of human rabies cases in Thailand were in children under 15 years of age.
