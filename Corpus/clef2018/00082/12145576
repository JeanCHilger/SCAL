Positron emission-computed tomography in diagnosis and staging of lung neoplasms. Personal experience. Positron emission-computed tomography (PET) scans are obtained from the accumulation of a radiotracer in tissues with altered metabolism, such as malignant neoplasms. The authors present their experience with PET, performed in 50 selected patients with lung neoplasms in the 1998-2000 period.The indications to PET corresponded to those most frequently reported in the literature, that is: diagnosis in solitary pulmonary nodule 8 patients mediastinal lymph node staging, 16 patientsIn 47 patients (94%) diagnostic yield was reached. A false positive (acute inflammatory lesion in solitary pulmonary nodule), a false negative (no demonstration of lymphangitic intrathoracic recurrence) and a non-diagnostic result (then pathologically proved non-neoplastic) were recorded.Thus the authors consider PET extremely useful in the diagnosis and staging of lung neoplasms the high cost of PET may be compensated for the reduced need for invasive diagnostic tools and, avoiding inappropriate surgical options, with favourable cost-effectiveness.Thus, PET may be indicated in most, if not in all, patients with lung neoplasms.
