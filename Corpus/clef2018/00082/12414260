The importance of distributed sampling in blocked functional magnetic resonance imaging designs. In this study we demonstrate the importance of distributed sampling of peristimulus time in blocked design fMRI studies. Distributed sampling ensures all the components of an event-related hemodynamic response are sampled and avoids the bias incurred when stimulus presentation is time-locked to data acquisition. We found that differences in the temporal offset between stimulus presentation and data acquisition had a significant effect on some language-related activations. These effects, induced by simply shifting stimulus presentation by a fraction of the interscan interval, suggest that fixed sampling does indeed bias estimated responses, even in blocked designs.
