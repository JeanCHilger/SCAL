Study on heparin-like materials--sulfonization and blood compatibility of PVA, PET and PEU. In this paper, physical mechanical properties and changes of chemical structures of some heparin-like biomaterials were studied before and after sulfonization of PVA, PET and PEU. The results showed that these materials were easy to be sulfonized, but it was necessary to keep actual sulfonization degree for their mechanical properties. Platelets adhesion experiments demonstrated that the materials adsorbed very few and showed heparin-like anti-coagulant property after sulfonization.
