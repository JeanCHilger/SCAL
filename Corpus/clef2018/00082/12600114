Study on gastric motility and its relevant factors in type 2 diabetes. In this study radionuclide semi-liquid gastric emptying (GE) study was adopted to test the gastric motility in 129 patients with type 2 diabetes. Further study was made to explore the relationship between gastric motility disorder of diabetes and the influential factors.The variables to be measured and analyzed were age, BMI, duration of illness, level of glycemia, HbAlc, plasma insulin, motilin, gastrin, glucagon and Mg2+.Of the 129 cases, 80 had delayed GE with an occurrence of 62.02%, and there was a close correlation between gastric motility disorder and the duration of illness, BMI, FPG, PPG, serum insulin, motilin levels and HbAlc as well.These findings imply that gastric motility disorder of diabetes is influenced by multiple factors. The results also suggest that gastric motiligy disorder is much more common than expected, and radionuclide gastric emptying test is a useful aid for the early detection of this clinical entity.
