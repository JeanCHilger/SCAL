Statistical parametric mapping of brain SPECT perfusion abnormalities in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Brain perfusion in 20 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), 20 patients with moderate AD and 20 control subjects (matched for age, gender and education) were assessed by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime ((99m)Tc-HMPAO). SPECT images were transformed to a standard size and shape for group comparisons by the voxel-based t test of the statistical parametric mapping techniques. Cerebral hypoperfusion in the left lower parietal area was found in mild AD patients. In moderate AD patients, significant cerebral hypoperfusion was located in bilateral posterior parietotemporal cortices, contiguous anterior occipital lobes, posterior cingulate gyri and, to a lesser extent, in frontal areas.
