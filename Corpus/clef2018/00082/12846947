123 I-MIBG myocardial sympathetic innervation scintigraphy and Parkinson's disease. Preliminary results. Cardiac sympathetic function in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is significantly impaired. Cardiac scintigraphy with 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) is used to assess cardiac sympathetic function.A total of 29 consecutive patients with PD and 10 control subjects without neurological disease were studied. Myocardial imaging with 123I-MIBG was performed to evaluate cardiac sympathetic function. Early and delayed images of the anterior view were obtained at 15 min. and 4 h. after injection of 123I-MIBG, respectively. 123I-MIBG uptake was quantified qualitatively and semiquantitatively by calculating a heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratio.The heart/mediastinum ratio was markedly reduced in patients with PD (I to IV on the Hoehn and Yahr scale) when compared to the control subjects (p < 0.05). This finding was independent of the length and severity of the disease or the pharmacological treatment of the patients. None of the control subjects showed decrease in myocardial 123I-MIBG uptake.Our findings indicate that a decrease in myocardial accumulation of 123I-MIBG was observed in the early stages of PD. This suggests that the measurement of 123I-MIBG may help the early diagnosis of PD, and can be used to detect cardiac autonomic dysfunction, especially in patients without typical signs and symptoms.
