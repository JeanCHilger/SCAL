Staging lung carcinoma with a Tc-99m labeled monoclonal antibody. Thirty-three patients with biopsy-proven lung cancer and a total of 150 lesions diagnosed by conventional staging procedures were imaged using a Tc-99m labeled monoclonal Fab fragment of an IgG2B murine monoclonal antibody (MoAb) (NR-LU-10, NeoRx Corporation). Immunoscintigraphy demonstrated 100% of primary and 78% of metastatic lesions. MoAb imaging detected 88% of lesions in 12 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients and 77% of lesions in 21 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Based on initial evaluation by other methods, 29 sites of MoAb activity were not associated with evidence of disease. Eleven of these were subsequently shown to represent sites of metastases 18 remain unconfirmed. Four of ten patients studied with limited NSCLC had eight unsuspected lesions on MoAb imaging. Confirmation of unsuspected lesions in two patients altered initial clinical staging, and surgical therapy was abandoned. This study demonstrates that Tc-99m labeled NR-LU-10 can accurately stage patients with lung cancer.
