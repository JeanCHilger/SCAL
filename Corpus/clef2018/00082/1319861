Detection and staging of small cell lung carcinoma with a technetium-labeled monoclonal antibody. A comparison with standard staging methods. Tumor-associated radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) can detect neoplasms in a variety of settings. The authors conducted a study comparing the ability to detect and stage small cell lung carcinoma by using a Tc-99m labeled monoclonal antibody (NR-LU-10 Fab) (NeoRx Corp, Seattle, WA) with standard staging methods. Standard staging included a physical examination, chest x-ray, a battery of radionuclide scans and/or computerized tomographic studies (head, abdomen, and bone), and bone marrow examination. A total of 22 comparisons were performed in 17 patients (five patients had reevaluations after therapy). Fifty-four (74%) of the 73 lesions defined by standard staging were detected by the radiolabeled MoAb. Seven of eight patients (88%) classified by standard staging as having "limited stage" disease on presentation were concordantly "limited stage" by radioimmunoimaging. One patient deemed "limited stage" by standard staging was correctly upstaged (bone marrow involvement) as a result of the radiolabeled MoAb. Two patients found to have extensive disease at diagnosis were characterized as "limited stage" by the MoAb, for an overall staging accuracy of 0.88. Thirteen of 19 missed lesions were smaller than 2 cm (10 were smaller than 1 cm 3 measured 1 to 2 cm). This comparative study shows that radioimmunoimaging by Tc-99m labeled NR-LU-10 Fab antibody is capable of complementing standard staging methods used in the evaluation of small cell lung carcinoma.
