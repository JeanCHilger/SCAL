Evaluation of hemodynamic parameters by transcranial Doppler in patients with leukoaraiosis. Leukoaraiosis is commonly found in neuroimaging in ancient people. The pathogenic theory that most suitably explains its origin is the vascular one, mainly linked to cerebral hemodynamic abnormalities. The techniques most frequently used in cerebral hemodynamic evaluation (PET and SPECT) are expensive and not widespread. Transcranial Doppler instead is cheaper and much more widespread.Our aim has been to show whether transcranial Doppler is a useful tool for cerebral hemodynamic evaluation in leukoaraiosis.We have prospectively included 116 patients aged 60-90 who came to the Neurology department with unspecific complaints such as dizziness or mild headache. Patients with recent history of stroke or moderate to severe cognitive impairment were excluded.Mean age was 74.4 +/- 6.3 years old. The prevalence of leukoaraiosis was 68.7%. Leukoaraiosis was significantly correlated with older age, lacunar infarctions, past history of stroke, cognitive impairment and to lower systolic and diastolic velocities in middle cerebral artery (MCA) and higher pulsatility index. Multivariate analysis only retained the lower diastolic velocity in MCA in the model.Transcranial Doppler can detect hemodynamic abnormalities in patients with leukoaraiosis and is therefore a very useful technique for the evaluation of this entity.
