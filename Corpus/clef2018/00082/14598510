Use of modern technologies in the diagnosis and combined treatment of brain stem tumors. The latest technologies, introduced into neurosurgery during the last 2 decades of the 20th century, ensured progress in the diagnostics and treatment of brainstem tumors--pathologies that remain until now a most complicated problem in neurooncology. The modern diagnostic tools comprising profound dynamic neurological and neurophysiological examinations (AVP, EEG) visualization techniques (CT, MRT with contrasting, MRT, spectroscopy, PET) provide for detecting not only the initial signs of stem tumors and their sizes but also their topographic interaction with the stem structures it, in its turn, opens up a possibility to choose between the combined surgical treatment and the radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone. The clinical course, diagnosis and combined treatment of 333 children and adults with tumors bordering on the brainstem are analyzed within the case study.
