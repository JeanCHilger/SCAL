Predictors of baseline peritoneal transport status in Australian and New Zealand peritoneal dialysis patients. Factors that predict peritoneal transport status in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are poorly understood. The aim of the present study is to determine these factors in Australian and New Zealand incident PD patients.The study included all patients on the Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry who started PD therapy between April 1, 1991, and March 31, 2002, and underwent a peritoneal equilibration test (PET) within the first 6 months. Predictors of peritoneal transport category and dialysate-plasma creatinine ratio at 4 hours (D-P Cr 4h) were assessed by multivariate ordinal logistic regression and multiple linear regression, respectively.A total of 3,188 patients were studied. Mean D-P Cr 4h was 0.69 +/- 0.13. High transport status was associated with older age (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.08 for each 10 years 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.13), Maori and Pacific Islander racial origin (OR, 1.48In Australian and New Zealand PD patients, higher peritoneal transport status is independently associated with racial origin, older age, and lower BMI. The diversity of peritoneal transport characteristics in different ethnic populations suggests that additional validation of PET measurements in various racial groups and study of their relationship to patient outcomes are warranted.
