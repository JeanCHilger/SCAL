When is spinal pain "neuropathic"? Although one cannot always determine when a patient's persistent pain is neuropathic, the issues are becoming clearer. Patients with spinal pain need to be examined carefully and the persistence of pain should not necessarily be considered to indicate a continuing search for a nociceptive focus. Similarly, continuing pain following successful surgery may be caused by persistent spinal or central neurologic changes. New methods for characterizing the site of neural changes will develop--functional MRI and PET scanning are now characterizing brain activity and will possibly yield results soon that will be helpful in the clinic. Further work needs to be done to identify which clinical features lead to better responses to agents for the treatment of neuropathic pain. New, more specific agents with actions focused on the specific parts of neural transmission are being developed. These include agents (such as growth factors) that will cure, not just suppress, the pathologic pain generators and pathways in patients with persistent pain.
