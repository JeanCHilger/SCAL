The role of FDG-PET in the management of non-small cell lung carcinoma. Positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-2-fluoro-2 deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) has been widely investigated and used in the non-invasive imaging of malignancy. Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is one of the most common and best validated indications for an FDG-PET scan. This review examines the roles of FDG-PET in the management of NSCLC and attempts to identify emerging uses and possible future developments.Literature review of English language literature indexed on Medline.There is strong evidence to support the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of FDG-PET in the characterisation of solitary pulmonary nodules and in the staging of NSCLC. In addition, there are emerging uses in radiotherapy planning, monitoring of treatment response and prognostication.FDG-PET plays an integral role in the management of NSCLC and it is likely to expand as evidence supporting additional roles in the management of NSCLC becomes available.
