Positron emission tomography in the diagnosis of lung cancer. Lung cancer is a common malignancy. Positron emission tomography (PET) has become an important tool in the staging of the disease with regard to operability and in order to determine radiation volume when surgery is not indicated.We have assessed and discuss results recently published in major international journals.In approximately 60% of the patients, the planning of treatment is modified after a PET investigation.In contrast to the state the art in most industrialised countries, dedicated PET is not available in Norway. Hence lung cancer is suboptimally treated.
