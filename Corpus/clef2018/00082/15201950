18F-FDG PET for detecting recurrent head and neck cancer, local lymph node involvement and distant metastases. Comparison of qualitative visual and semiquantitative analysis. Assessment of the clinical value of (18)F-FDG-PET for detection of recurrent head and neck cancer, local lymph node involvement and distant metastases comparing a qualitative visual with a semiquantitative analysis (SUV values).Retrospective evaluation of 73 (18)F-FDG PET studies in 55 patients by use of a four-step qualitative visual grading system and calculation of standard uptake values in pathological lesions. Calculation of SUV values in normal regions for generating a map of physiological (18)F-FDG distribution. Correlation to histopathological findings and clinical follow-up.1. Qualitative visual analysis of (18)F-FDG PET studies: a) local recurrence sensitivity 79%, specificity 97%, positive predictive value 95%, negative predictive value 85%, and diagnostic accuracy 89% b) local metastatic lymph nodes 100%, 95%, 85%, 100%, 96%(18)F-FDG PET is an effective tool for re-staging of patients with suspected recurrence after therapy for head and neck cancer.
