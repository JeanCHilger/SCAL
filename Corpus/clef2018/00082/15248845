Compliance of asthmatic families with a primary prevention programme of asthma and effectiveness of measures to reduce inhalant allergens--a randomized trial. Compliance to and the effect of pre- and post-natal exposure reduction measures to prevent asthma in high-risk children from asthmatic families were studied.Families were randomized to a special care group (n=222) and a control group (n=221). Educational advice on measures to reduce their newborn's exposure to allergens and smoke was provided to the special care group during three visits (two pre-natal and one post-natal). The control group (n=221) received usual care.After the intervention, the special care group differed significantly (P<0.01) from the usual care group in: use of anti-mite encasings (parental: 88% vs. 14% baby: 98% vs. 10%)High compliance was found for the use of anti-mite encasings substantial compliance for using hypoallergenic formula, solid food postponement, keeping pets outside and reported post-natal maternal smoking. There was no compliance for sanitary measures and the reduction of maternal pre-natal passive smoking. Mite and pet allergens on mattresses were strongly reduced by anti-mite encasings.
