A prospective analysis of positron emission tomography and conventional imaging for detection of stage IV metastatic melanoma in patients undergoing metastasectomy. Positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG-PET) is available for evaluation of patients with melanoma. This study evaluates the potential of FDG-PET to improve on conventional imaging (CI) in patients with stage IV melanoma undergoing metastasectomy.This was a prospective study comparing radiological evaluation of patients who underwent metastasectomy for palliation or cure. Patients underwent preoperative evaluation by physical examination, CI by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging, and FDG-PET. Independent observers performed three separate analyses of CI alone, FDG-PET alone, or FDG-PET read with knowledge of CI (FDG-PET + CI). Abnormalities were reported as benign or malignant and assessed by pathologic analysis or by clinical outcome determined by disease progression detected on serial evaluations.Ninety-four lesions were noted in 18 patients who underwent preoperative assessment, metastasectomy, and long-term follow up (median, 24 months). Lesion-by-lesion analysis for CI demonstrated a sensitivity of 76%, a specificity of 87%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 86%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 76%. FDG-PET demonstrated a sensitivity of 79%, a specificity of 87%, a PPV of 86%, and an NPV of 80%. For FDG-PET + CI, the sensitivity was 88%, specificity was 91%, and PPV and NPV were 91% and 88%, respectively.Combined use of FDG-PET and CI may be an accurate strategy to identify sites of disease in patients with stage IV melanoma being considered for metastasectomy. Interpreted independently, FDG-PET and CI seemed to be equivalent modalities. FDG-PET + CI had both the highest sensitivity on lesion-by-lesion analysis and the best accuracy on patient-by-patient analysis.
