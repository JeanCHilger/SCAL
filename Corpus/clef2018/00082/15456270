2-(2-(dimethylaminomethyl)phenoxy)-5-iodophenylamine: an improved serotonin transporter imaging agent. Imaging serotonin transporters (SERT) is an emerging research tool potentially useful to cast light on the mechanisms of drug action as well as to monitor the treatment of depressed patients. We have prepared two new derivatives of 3, 2-(2-(dimethylaminomethyl)phenoxy)-5-iodophenylamine (4) and 2-(2-(dimethylaminomethyl)benzyl)-5-iodophenylamine (5) (K(i) for SERT = 0.37 and 48.6 nM, respectively). Both [(125)I]4 and [(125)I]5 displayed excellent brain uptakes in rats, and they showed a highest uptake in hypothalamus (between 60 and 240 min), a region populated with the highest density of SERT. The specific uptake of [(125)I]4 in the hypothalamus resulted in a target to nontarget ratio ([hypothalamus-cerebellum]/cerebellum) of 4.3 at 2 h. Autoradiography of rat brain sections (ex vivo at 2 h) of [(125)I]4 showed an excellent regional distribution pattern consistent with known SERT localization. These data suggest that [(123)I]4 may be useful for imaging SERT binding sites in the brain by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
