N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide predicts extent of coronary artery disease and ischemia in patients with stable angina pectoris. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its N-terminal fragment (NT-proBNP) are elevated in patients with acute coronary syndromes and are closely linked to prognosis. Because there is only a small amount of data available concerning NT-proBNP in patients with stable angina pectoris, we aimed to determine whether NT-proBNP is of additional diagnostic value in these patients.Ninety-four patients with stable angina pectoris were prospectively included. All patients underwent exercise testing and coronary angiography, and 91 patients received thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial scintigraphy. NT-proBNP was analyzed at rest and after exercise testing. NT-proBNP was elevated in patients with inducible myocardial ischemia shown by single-photon emission computed tomography (396 +/- 80 pg/mL vs 160 +/- 101 pg/mL P <.01) closely linked to the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD) (no CAD, 148 +/- 29 pg/mLNT-proBNP is elevated in patients with stable angina pectoris and has a close correlation to disease severity. Combining the measurement of NT-proBNP with exercise testing, the test accuracy for predicting severe CAD can be improved. Our data show an incremental value of NT-proBNP in the diagnostic process of stable angina pectoris.
