Imaging for primary hyperparathyroidism--what beginners should know. For patients with primary hyperparathyroidism surgical removal of the hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland is curative. With advances in minimally invasive surgery, accurate pre-operative localization of the hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue is essential to aid successful surgical treatment. The onus of identifying this hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue therefore falls on imaging techniques such as high-resolution ultrasound, radionuclide imaging, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. This article is not an exhaustive review, and its main aim is to familiarize the general radiologist, trainee radiologists and clinicians with the basics of various imaging techniques and their roles in practical management of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.
