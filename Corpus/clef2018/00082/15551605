Implementation of an accelerated iterative algorithm for cone-beam SPECT. In this paper we describe the implementation of an accelerated iterative reconstruction algorithm (AIRA) for cone-beam (CB) projections using a single circular orbit in single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT). This algorithm is a modified maximum-likelihood-expectation-maximization (ML-EM) algorithm and several approaches have been used to accelerate the reconstruction process. These approaches include: (i) the use of ordered subsets (ii) the use of active areas and volumes
