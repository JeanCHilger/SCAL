Comparison between Tc-99m N-NOET and Tl-201 in the assessment of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. Technetium 99m N-ethoxy-N-ethyl dithiocarbamate (N-NOET) is a new radionuclide tracer for cardiac single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. It combines the advantageous properties of a Tc-99m agent with the redistribution characteristics of thallium 201. We directly compared the two agents in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.Fifty patients underwent treadmill exercise Tc-99m N-NOET and Tl-201 SPECT studies. Images were acquired at stress, redistribution, and reinjection. Segmental analysis was carried out, and direct comparisons were made with corresponding segments. A stress score index was calculated and compared with the degree of lung uptake for each patient. From the 50 patients, 2657 of 2664 exercise, redistribution, and reinjection segments (99%) were interpreted. There was excellent agreement between the two modalities (weighted kappa = 0.83). Of the patients, 24 demonstrated reversible ischemia by Tl-201 SPECT reinjection imaging, of which Tc-99m N-NOET stress-redistribution imaging correctly identified 14 (58%) this improved significantly to 20 patients (83%) ( P = .03) when a reinjection protocol was used. A higher stress score index was seen in those patients with significant lung uptake (lung-heart ratio > or =0.6) after Tc-99m N-NOET stress imaging (1.6 vs 1.3, P = .03).SPECT imaging with Tc-99m N-NOET is comparable to Tl-201 for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Significant lung uptake with stress Tc-99m N-NOET may also indicate the severity of disease.
