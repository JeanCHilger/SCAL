Whole-body (11)C-5-hydroxytryptophan positron emission tomography as a universal imaging technique for neuroendocrine tumors: comparison with somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and computed tomography. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) can be small and situated almost anywhere throughout the body. Our objective was to investigate whether whole-body (WB) positron emission tomography (PET) with (11)C-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) can be used as a universal imaging technique for NETs and to compare this technique with established imaging methods. Forty-two consecutive patients with evidence of NET and a detected lesion on any conventional imaging (six bronchial, two foregut, 16 midgut, and two thymic carcinoids one ectopic Cushing's syndrome
