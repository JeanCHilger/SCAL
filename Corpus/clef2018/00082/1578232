Positron emission tomography (PET) in "pure akinesia". Positron emission tomography (PET) studies on regional cerebral glucose metabolism and [18F]fluorodopa uptake were performed on 3 patients with "pure akinesia without rigidity and tremors", 3 progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients, and 5 patients with Parkinson's disease. The "pure akinesia" and PSP patients showed a marked decrease in glucose metabolism in the frontal cortex and striatum, and a decreased uptake of [18F]fluorodopa in the striatum. While the Parkinson's disease patients had a decreased uptake of [18F]fluorodopa in the striatum but no abnormality in the glucose metabolism. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed atrophy of the pretectum and dorsal pons in "pure akinesia" and PSP patients, but there was no such abnormality in the Parkinson's disease patients. As described above, patients with "pure akinesia" and PSP patients revealed similar findings on PET and MRI studies, while Parkinson's disease patients showed substantially different results.
