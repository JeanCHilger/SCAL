Factors affecting quality control of [18F]FDG injection: bacterial endotoxins test, aluminum ions test and HPLC analysis for FDG and CIDG. High concentrations of citrates and phosphates which are often used in the manufacturing of [18F] fluro-D-glucose (FDG) preparations and wide deviation in the pH value from the neutral level often disturb the detection of endotoxins and aluminum ions using the turbidimetric and aluminum ion paper test method. The column temperature was found to be a major factor influencing the sensitivity of ClDG detection with the HPAEC/PAD method.
