System integration and DICOM image creation for PET-MR fusion. This article demonstrates a gateway system for converting image fusion results to digital imaging and communication in medicine (DICOM) objects. For the purpose of standardization and integration, we have followed the guidelines of the Integrated Healthcare Enterprise technical framework and developed a DICOM gateway. The gateway system combines data from hospital information system, image fusion results, and the information generated itself to constitute new DICOM objects. All the mandatory tags defined in standard DICOM object were generated in the gateway system. The gateway system will generate two series of SOP instances of each PET-MR fusion result SOP (Service Object Pair) one for the reconstructed magnetic resonance (MR) images and the other for position emission tomography (PET) images. The size, resolution, spatial coordinates, and number of frames are the same in both series of SOP instances. Every new generated MR image exactly fits with one of the reconstructed PET images. Those DICOM images are stored to the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) server by means of standard DICOM protocols. When those images are retrieved and viewed by standard DICOM viewing systems, both images can be viewed at the same anatomy location. This system is useful for precise diagnosis and therapy.
