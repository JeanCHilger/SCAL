Dissemination of triactinomyxons (Myxozoa) via oligochaetes used as live food for aquarium fishes. Freshwater 'tubifex' oligochaetes sold as live food for aquarium fishes were purchased from several pet shops in Munich, Germany, over a 1 yr period (March 2001 to February 2002). These samples were screened for parasitic infections of actinosporean myxozoans to gauge the possibility of parasite dispersal via this route. Of 7 samples, 6 contained infected oligochaetes waterborne spores were present in 5 samples at the time of purchase. In the laboratory, 12 different types of actinosporeans were released by the oligochaetes. These could be assigned to 4 collective groups: triactinomyxon, aurantiactinomyxon, raabeia and hexactinomyxon
