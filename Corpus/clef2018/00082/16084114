Concurrent CBF and CMRGlc changes during human brain activation by combined fMRI-PET scanning. A novel approach for concurrent measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose consumption (CMRGlc) in humans is proposed and validated in normal subjects during visual stimulation. 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose was administered during the measurement of CBF by continuous arterial spin labeled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Subsequent positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning demonstrated the distribution of labeled deoxyglucose during the MRI acquisition. An excellent concordance between regional CBF and regional CMRGlc during visual stimulation was found, consistent with previously published PET findings. Although initially validated using a brief, non-quantitative protocol, this approach can provide quantitative CBF and CMRGlc, with a broad range of potential applications in functional physiology and pathophysiology.
