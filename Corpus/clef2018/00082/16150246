Changing concepts in the management of differentiated thyroid cancer. The management of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer has changed significantly over the last few decades. Mortality has decreased as the result of earlier detection, refined surgical approaches, subsequent radioiodine ablation, and the development of more sensitive methods for detecting and monitoring disease recurrence. The latter has been facilitated by serum thyroglobulin measurements, the use of recombinant human thyrotropin, and the use of 18F-deoxyglucose/positron emission tomography in selected instances where radioiodine imaging fails to locate known or suspected recurrent or metastatic disease.
