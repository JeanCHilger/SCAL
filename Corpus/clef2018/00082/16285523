High expression of mirobial transglutaminase gene from Streptoverticillium mobaraense in Escherichia coli. The microbial transglutamunase (MTG) gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of Streptoverticillium mobaraensea by using PCR and inserted into pET vector to construct the expression plasmid called pET-MTG. The pET-MTG was transfected into E. coli (Rosetta DE3) and the MTG protein was found to be highly expressed as inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were isolated and subjected to denaturation and re-naturation, followed by strong cation ion-exchange chromatography to purify the expressed MTG. The specific activity of purified MTG was close to that of native MTG. Taken together, this study might provide a base for the industrial production of microbial transglutaminase.
