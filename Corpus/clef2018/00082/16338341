Modulation of tracer accumulation in malignant tumors: gene expression, gene transfer, and phage display. Assessment of gene function following the completion of human genome sequencing may be done using radionuclide imaging procedures. These procedures are needed for the evaluation of genetically manipulated animals or new designed biomolecules which requires a thorough understanding of physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology. The experimental approaches will involve many new technologies including in vivo imaging with SPECT and PET. Nuclear medicine procedures may be applied for the determination of gene function and regulation using established and new tracers or using in vivo reporter genes such as genes encoding enzymes, receptors, antigens or transporters. Visualization of in vivo reporter gene expression can be done using radiolabeled substrates, antibodies or ligands. Combinations of specific promoters and in vivo reporter genes may deliver information about the regulation of the corresponding genes. Furthermore, protein-protein interactions and activation of signal transduction pathways may be visualized non-invasively. The role of radiolabeled antisense molecules for the analysis of mRNA content has to be investigated. However, possible applications are therapeutic intervention using triplex oligonucleotides with therapeutic isotopes which can be brought near to specific DNA sequences to induce DNA strand breaks at selected loci. Imaging of labeled siRNA's makes sense if these are used for therapeutic purposes in order to assess the delivery of these new drugs to their target tissue. Finally, new biomolecules will be developed by bioengineering methods which may be used for isotope-based diagnosis and treatment of disease.
