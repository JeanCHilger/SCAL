Facile synthesis of enantiopure chiral molecular rectangles exhibiting induced circular dichroism. [structure: see text] The facile syntheses of enantiopure molecular rectangles using 1,8-bis(trans-Pt(PEt(3))(2)(NO(3)))anthracene and optically pure d- or l-tartrate are reported in high yields. These self-assembled macrocycles are unique examples where the phenomenon of induced chiral dichroism (ICD) has been observed in chiral metallosupramolecular assemblies.
