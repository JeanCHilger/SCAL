Role of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in follow-up of differentiated thyroid cancer. To assess the diagnostic utility of [(18)F]flu-orodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) in the follow-up of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).In this study, we used strict definitions of presence and absence of the disease and performed all FDG PET scans while the patients were not taking levothyroxine (LT4). We report the results of conventional FDG PET scans obtained during the follow-up of 50 nonselected patients with DTC (34 female and 16 male patients median age, 40.5 yearsFDG PET scans were positive in 27 patients (54%) and negative in 23 (46%). FDG PET results were true-positive in 26 cases, false-positive in 1, true-negative in 7, and false-negative in 16. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 61.9%, 87.5%, 96.3%, and 30.4%, respectively.FDG PET scanning is moderately sensitive and specific for detection of persistent or recurrent DTC.
