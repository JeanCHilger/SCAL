Diagnostic value of 18F-fDG Pet/CT in the detection of the cervical lymph nodes metastasis. To explore the diagnostic value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the detection of the cervical lymph nodes metastasis.According to the pathological result, the data of neck PET, CT, PET/CT of 20 patients with head and neck tumors were analyzed retrospectively.The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of PET, CT and PET/CT in detection cervical lymph nodes metastasis were (92.3%, 85.7%, 90.0%), (77.0%, 57.1%, 70.0%), (92.3%, 100.0%, 95.0%) respectively, the accuracy of PET/CT was better than that of CT alone (P < 0.05) and a little better than that of PET alone. Among 13 cases after irradiation,the correct diagnose was found in seven cases by CT and in 12 cases by PET/CT. Four cases were found with cervical lymph node metastasis in the seven clinical N0 (cN0) patients after functional neck dissection (FND). The preoperative diagnose of PET/CT was completely consistent with the postoperative pathological result.18F-FDG PET/CT is better than CT alone and PET alone for the detection of cervical lymph nodes metastasis, especially for the recurrent tumors. It may be served as the indication of neck dissection in the head and neck cancers.
