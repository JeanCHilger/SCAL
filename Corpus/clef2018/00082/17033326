Esophageal carcinoma: surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Several new developments in the potentially curative therapy of esophageal cancer have drawn attention over the past year. There is a potential benefit of centralization of esophagectomies in dedicated centers. Early mucosal lesions are increasingly treated by local ablative therapy. Tumors invading the submucosa are preferably treated by surgical resection. There is ongoing controversy about the optimal surgical approach. Positron emission tomography scanning is a promising tool in the preoperative work-up but needs critical evaluation. The question of whether chemoradiation with voice preservation (followed by salvage surgery in case of tumor recurrence) can replace pharyngolaryngectomy in patients with cervical esophageal cancer is still unanswered. A review of eight randomized trials demonstrated that chemoradiation as primary treatment of esophageal cancer provides an absolute reduction of mortality. The addition of new drugs like paclitaxel and irinotecan into induction regimens for the treatment of advanced disease results in higher response rates but also in increased toxicity. Preoperative radiotherapy as single modality treatment does not improve overall survival, whereas the benefit of preoperative chemotherapy and chemoradiation has not been proven unequivocally. Several retrospective studies with a small number of patients suggest that local response parameters like pathologic complete response and downstaging of regional lymph node (N) status are correlated with longer survival.
