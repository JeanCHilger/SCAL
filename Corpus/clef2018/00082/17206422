Molecular cardiovascular imaging using scintigraphic methods. Molecular cardiovascular imaging plays an increasingly important role both in basic research and in clinical diagnosis. Scintigraphic methods have long been used to study pathophysiological changes on a cellular and molecular level, and they are likely to remain important molecular imaging modalities in the foreseeable future. This article provides an overview over current developments in cardiovascular molecular imaging using scintigraphic methods. The focus lies on imaging of cardiac innervation, plaque instability, hypoxia and angiogenesis, gene expression and stem and progenitor cell migration and proliferation.
