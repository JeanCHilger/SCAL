Poststress left ventricular ejection fraction is an independent predictor of major cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease and impaired left ventricular function. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of myocardial perfusion and function SPECT imaging in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and poor left ventricular (LV) function.We studied 261 patients (231 men, age 66+/-10 years) with CAD and a resting LV ejection fraction (LVEF) <or= 40% assessed during myocardial gated SPECT. Perfusion defect extent was calculated using 4D-MSPECT software (Michigan University). Ischemia scoring was performed visually. Considered end points were: 1) major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or late revascularization), 2) MACE or the need for hospitalization due to heart failure (MACE-HF) and 3) cardiac death or non-fatal myocardial infarction.During a median follow-up of 31 months, 52 patients (20%) died (35 cardiac deaths), 50 (19%) developed a MACE and 69 (26%) a MACE-HF. In a clinical model, diabetes and angina status were the only predictors of MACE (chi-squared=19.3 P<0.001). By multivariate analysis, poststress LVEF (chi-squared-gain of 6.4In patients with impaired LV function and CAD, poststress LVEF is an independent predictor of future cardiac events.
