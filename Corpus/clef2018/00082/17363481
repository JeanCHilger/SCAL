High-resolution single-photon emission computed tomography and X-ray computed tomography imaging of Tc-99m-labeled anti-DR5 antibody in breast tumor xenografts. A murine, apoptosis-inducing monoclonal antibody (mTRA-8) targeting human DR5 was radiolabeled with Tc-99m. The binding affinity (K(d)) and the number of DR5 receptors were measured in MD MBA-231-derived 2LMP cell lines that were "sensitive" or "resistant" to mTRA-8 killing. Single-photon emission computed tomography and X-ray computed tomography (SPECT/CT) evaluated the Tc-99m-mTRA-8 retention and distribution within xenograft tumors biodistribution analyses confirmed the levels. Scatchard assays showed specific and high binding affinity of Tc-99m-mTRA-8 to DR5
