Chest wall recurrence of breast cancer demonstrated on 99mTc-MIBI scintimammography. The mastectomy site is usually assessed by clinical examination and ultrasonography for recurrence of breast cancer, although post-surgical and radiotherapy changes limit the accuracy of these methods. MRI has been used successfully but it remains an expensive modality and may not be readily available. Scintimammography is an alternative method which has the advantage of not being affected by post-operative morphological changes.To evaluate the usefulness of planar Tc-MIBI scintimammography and supine Tc-MIBI SPECT in the detection of chest wall recurrence post-mastectomy.The study population comprised of 26 patients (mean age, 47.15 years median age 47 yearsFor the 26 patients, planar scintimammography was found true positive in 14 and true negative in seven. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were 78%, 87.5%, 93%, 64% and 81%, respectively (P<0.001). SPECT showed a significantly higher overall sensitivity than planar imaging (89% vs. 78% P<0.001). SPECT and planar imaging showed the same specificity (87.5%). SPECT showed a significantly higher negative predictive value and accuracy than planar imaging (78% vs. 64% and 88% vs. 81%, respectivelyScintimammography is a reliable diagnostic tool and appears accurate in the detection of chest wall recurrence. SPECT shows high positive predictive value and aids in the diagnosis of the chest wall recurrence with greater confidence.
