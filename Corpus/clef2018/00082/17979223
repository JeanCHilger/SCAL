A radioiodinated MIBG-octreotate conjugate exhibiting enhanced uptake and retention in SSTR2-expressing tumor cells. Several neuroendocrine tumors are known to express both the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), and radiopharmaceuticals directed toward both these targets such as MIBG and octreotide derivatives are routinely used in the clinic. To investigate the possibility of targeting both NET and SSTR2 conjointly, a conjugate of radioiodinated MIBG and octreotate was synthesized. Attempts to synthesize the radioiodinated target compound (MIBG-octreotate [ (131)I] 12a) from a tin precursor were futile
