Dynamic monitoring of [11C]diprenorphine in rat brain using a prototype positron imaging device. The present work tests the feasibility of using the most recently developed positron emission tomograph detector technology to image positron-emitting radioligands in small experimental animals. A prototype imaging device, using two opposing multicrystal, high-resolution (approximately 4 mm) block detectors of bismuth germanate to produce a 2-dimensional image in the centre of the field of view, is described. To evaluate the probe's potential as a non-invasive experimental tool, the dynamic regional distribution of the established opiate receptor ligand, [11C]diprenorphine was determined in rat brain following intravenous injection. The distribution of counts in the images was consistent with the localisation of diprenorphine binding sites and the specificity of the signal obtained was confirmed by administration of non-radioactive diprenorphine and naloxone. Although the signal-to-noise ratio was reduced compared with data obtained by post mortem dissection, the dynamic data acquisition capabilities of the system demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring the kinetics of ligand binding in individual animals and encourages further design of a small-diameter detector system with tomographic capabilities.
