Bevacizumab and albumin-bound paclitaxel treatment in metastatic breast cancer. Miller et al demonstrated that the combination of bevacizumab and paclitaxel has significant activity in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Because albumin-bound paclitaxel has been shown to have less toxicity, a better tumor delivery, and possibly better response for MBC, we combined it with bevacizumab to treat women with MBC.This is a retrospective analysis. Billing records from March 2005 through December 2006 were reviewed to identify all patients treated with a combination of albumin-bound paclitaxel/bevacizumab. A total of 40 women were identified. They received a minimum of 2 courses. Patients with measurable disease were monitored for response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Women with bone-only disease were monitored with positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging and tumor markers. All response data were confirmed by independent review.Of 33 women with measurable disease, 16 had objective responses to the albumin-bound paclitaxel/bevacizumab regimen (3 complete responses and 13 partial responses) for an overall response rate (ORR) of 48.5%. Median time to progression for responders was 128 days. Another 5 women had stable disease (SD) with a median duration of 135 days. Of 7 patients with bone-only disease, 2 had almost complete resolution of PET activity and 4 had SD (median, 148 days). Toxicity was acceptable with fatigue, neuropathy, pain, and hypertension being the most common complaints.In our limited series of women with advanced, heavily pretreated MBC treated with albumin-bound paclitaxel/bevacizumab, we saw a 48.5% ORR. The regimen was well tolerated. Randomized studies are needed to confirm efficacy and safety of this combination in treating breast cancer.
