Performance profile of FDG-PET and PET/CT for cancer screening on the basis of a Japanese Nationwide Survey. The aim of this study is to survey the situation of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) cancer screening in Japan and to describe its performance profile."FDG-PET for cancer screening" was defined as FDG-PET or positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) scan with or without other tests performed for cancer screening of healthy subjects. We sent questionnaires regarding FDG-PET cancer screening to 99 facilities in which FDG-PET tests were performed during the fiscal year 2005. Replies were obtained from 68 of the 99 facilities, of which 46 facilities performed FDG-PET cancer screening. The total number of subjects who underwent FDG-PET cancer screening was 50 558. From 38 of 46 facilities, reliable results of thorough examinations were obtained for the subjects who were positive by FDG-PET and/or one or more of the combined screening tests was performed and were referred for further evaluation. The total number of subjects in these 38 facilities amounted to 43 996.A total of 50,558 healthy subjects underwent FDG-PET (including PET/CT) scanning with or without other tests for cancer screening in 46 PET centers during the fiscal year of 2005 in Japan. Thorough examination was indicated for 9.8% of the cases as a result of positive findings suggesting possible cancer. On analyzing 43 996 cases from 38 PET centers from which detailed information was obtained, 500 cases of cancers (1.14%) were found, of which 0.90% were PET positive and 0.24% were PET negative, resulting in the relative sensitivity of PET being 79.0%. Cancers of the thyroid, colon/rectum, lung, and breast were most frequently found (107, 102, 79, and 35 cases, respectively) with high PET sensitivity (88%, 90%, 80%, and 92%). PET showed an overall positive predictive value of 29.0%. PET/CT had a better detection rate, sensitivity, and positive predictive value than dedicated PET (P < 0.01).We were able to clarify the performance profile of "FDG-PET for cancer screening" on the basis of a Japanese nationwide survey. The number of facilities possessing PET is increasing steadily, highlighting the necessity of evaluating the usefulness of "FDG-PET cancer screening" as soon as possible by undertaking long-term investigations of large series of subjects.
