Single-photon emission computed tomography in the evaluation of brain tumors and the diagnosis of relapse vs radiation necrosis. Morphologic characterization of brain tumors by magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography is well established. However, functional metabolic imaging by single-photon emission tomography (SPET) and positron emission tomography are also increasingly important imaging tools for noninvasive assessment of brain tumors. Brain SPET is useful in the differentiation of tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis, in the non-invasive assessment of gliomas and meningiomas aggressiveness, in differentiating neoplastic from non neoplastic intracerebral haemorrhage, in monitoring therapy response and in the evaluation of other types of brain tumors. Our own experience is presented supporting the above.
