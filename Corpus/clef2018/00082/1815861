Radionuclide bone scan using single-photon emission-computed tomography in detecting oral and maxillofacial tumor infiltrating to the jaws. 83 cases (including 53 cases of patients and 30 cases of normal volunteer) of SPECT bone scan had been studied for detecting oral and maxillofacial tumor infiltrating to the jaws. The results was contrasted with X-ray, operation and pathology, and indicated that SPECT bone scan could reveal the early tumor infiltrating to the jaws and accurate extent of tumor lesions, more accurate than X-ray. SPECT provided us more important information about the preservation of the jaw and extent of bone resection.
