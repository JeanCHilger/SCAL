Synthesis, radiolabeling and baboon SPECT imaging of 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(3'-[(123)I]iodophenyl)tropane ([(123)I]YP256) as a serotonin transporter radiotracer. To develop a potential SPECT probe to evaluate the integrity of the serotoninergic system (5-HTT) whose dysfunction is linked to several disease conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and depression, we report the synthesis, radiolabeling and in vivo baboon imaging of 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(3'-[(123)I]iodophenyl) tropane (YP256, 6). The radiolabeling was performed by iododestannylation using sodium [(123)I]iodide and peracetic acid. Although the ligand displayed high selectivity for 5-HTT over dopamine transporter in vitro, SPECT imaging in baboons did not reveal selective 5-HTT accumulation in brain in vivo.
