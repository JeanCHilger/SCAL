The role of 3D fusion imaging in sentinel lymphadenectomy for vulvar cancer. To evaluate the feasibility of fusion imaging compound tomography (FICT) of CT/MRI and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) versus planar scintigraphy only (plSc) in pre-surgical staging for vulvar cancer.Analysis of consecutive patients with vulvar cancer who preoperatively underwent sentinel scintigraphy (planar and 3D-SPECT imaging) and CT or MRI. Body markers were used for exact anatomical co-registration and fusion datasets were reconstructed using SPECT and CT/MRI. The number and localisation of all intraoperatively identified and resected sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) were compared between planar and 3D fusion imaging.Twenty six SLN were localized on planar scintigraphy. Twelve additional SLN were identified after SPECT and CT/MRI reconstruction, all of them were confirmed intraoperatively. In seven cases where single foci were identified at plSc, fusion imaging revealed grouped individual nodes and five additional localisations were discovered at fusion imaging. In seven patients both methods identified SLN contra lateral to the primary tumor site, but only fusion imaging allowed to localise iliac SLN in four patients. All SLN predicted on fusion imaging could be localised and resected during surgery.Fusion imaging using SPECT and CT/MRI can detect SLN in vulvar cancer more precisely than planar imaging regarding number and anatomical localisation. FICT revealed additional information in seven out of ten cases (70%).
