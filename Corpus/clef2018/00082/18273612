EANM-ESR white paper on multimodality imaging. The introduction of hybrid imaging modalities such as combined positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) has altered image analysis and reporting as well as the expectations of the referring physicians. The training in multimodality imaging is unsatisfactory at the moment because no specialisation is adequate for full analysis of the resulting image data. In the recent "White paper of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) and the European Society of Radiology (ESR) on multimodality imaging", ways to adjust training opportunities and, thus, to improve the situation were proposed. We think that action is urgently required in order to provide optimal training in multimodality imaging.Training in both nuclear medicine and diagnostic radiology should be restructured to allow for optional integrated training in multimodality imaging while maintaining the depth and detail of the individual specialties.We propose criteria for the training in multimodality imaging that can be implemented locally and fast without precluding a yet to be defined regulatory framework.
