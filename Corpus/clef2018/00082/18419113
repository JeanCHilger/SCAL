Effects of targeting moiety, linker, bifunctional chelator, and molecular charge on biological properties of 64Cu-labeled triphenylphosphonium cations. In this report, we present the synthesis and evaluation of six new 64Cu-labeled triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cations. Biodistribution studies were performed using the athymic nude mice bearing U87MG human glioma xenografts to explore the impact of TPP moieties, linkers, bifunctional chelators (BFCs), and molecular charge on biological properties of 64Cu radiotracers. On the basis of the results from this study, it is concluded that (1) mTPP (tris(4-methoxyphenyl)phosphonium) is a better mitochondrion-targeting molecule than TPP and 3mTPP (tris(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)phosphonium) (2) DO3A (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-4,7,10-triacetic acid) and DO2A (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-4,7-diacetic acid) are suitable BFCs for the 64Cu-labeling of TPP cations
