Chemotherapy response assessment in stage IV melanoma patients-comparison of 18F-FDG-PET/CT, CT, brain MRI, and tumormarker S-100B. This study aims to compare the use of 18F-FDG-PET/CT, CT, brain MRI, and tumormarker S-100B in chemotherapy response assessment of stage IV melanoma patients.In 25 patients with stage IV melanoma, FDG-PET/CT and S-100B after 2-3 months (three cycles) of chemotherapy was compared with baseline PET/CT and baseline S-100B. Retrospectively, the response was correlated with the outcome. In patients with clinical suspicion for brain metastases, MRI or CCT was performed.There was agreement between FDG-PET/CT and CT regarding response to chemotherapy in all patients. There was a clear trend to a longer OS of PET/CT responders (n=10) compared with PET/CT non-responders (n=15 p=0.072) with remarkably better 1-year OS of 80% compared to 40% (p=0.048). There was a significant longer PFS of PET/CT responders compared with PET/CT non-responders (p=0.002). S-100B was normal at baseline in eight of 22 patients where it was available. Chemotherapy response assessment with S-100B failed to show correlation with OS or PFS. Eleven patients developed brain metastases during treatment, first detected by PET/CT in two and by MRI or CCT in nine of 11 patients. Appearance of brain metastases was associated with a poor survival.18F-FDG-PET/CT and CT alone are equally suitable for chemotherapy response assessment in melanoma patients and clearly superior to S-100B. PET/CT responders have better early survival, but this is shortlived due to late therapy failure--often with brain recurrence. Additional brain MRI for therapy response assessment in such high-risk patients is mandatory to detect brain metastases missed by PET/CT.
