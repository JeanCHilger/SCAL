Value of nuclear medicine in preventive cardiology: the metabolic syndrome example. Metabolic syndrome represents a grouping of risk factors closely linked to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. At first, nuclear medicine has no direct application in cardiology at the level of primary prevention, but positron emission tomography is a non invasive imaging technique that can assess myocardial perfusion as well as the endothelium-dependent coronary vasomotion--a surrogate marker of cardiovascular event rate--thus finding an application in studying coronary physiopathology. As the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is still unknown in Switzerland, we will estimate it from data available in the frame of a health promotion program. Based on the deleterious effect on the endothelium already observed with two components, we will estimate the number of persons at risk in Switzerland.
