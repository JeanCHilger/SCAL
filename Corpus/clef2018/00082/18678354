(11)C]Choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography for staging and restaging of patients with advanced prostate cance. To evaluate [(11)C]Choline positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) for staging and restaging of patients with advanced prostate cancer and to compare the diagnostic performance of PET, CT and PET/CT.Forty-five consecutive patients with advanced prostate cancer underwent [(11)C]Choline-PET/CT between 5/2004 and 2/2006.Overall, 295 lesions were detected: PET alone, 178 lesions diagnostic CT, 221 lesionsStaging and restaging with [(11)C]Choline PET/CT in patients with advanced prostate cancer improve the assessment of local and regional recurrent as well as metastatic disease including skeletal manifestations. [(11)C]Choline PET/CT (with a low-dose CT) results in improved localization and lesion characterization. [(11)C]Choline PET/CT provides an added value for skeletal manifestations. [(11)C]Choline PET/CT changed disease management in 11 (24%) of 45 patients with advanced prostate cancer.
