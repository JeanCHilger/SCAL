Clinical value of thallium-201 reinjection after delayed imaging in patient showing incomplete or no redistribution. To asses clinical value of Tl-201 (Tl) reinjection after delayed imaging, 30 patients who showed incomplete or no redistribution in stress-delayed Tl myocardial scintigraphy were studied. Of 76 myocardial segments with incomplete or no redistribution on the delayed images, 29 segments (38%) showed improvement of Tl uptake after Tl reinjection. Reinjection was considered effective in 24 segments (32%) where no or little redistribution were observed on the delayed images but improved after reinjection. The contrast ventriculography showed less wall motion abnormality in the segments with improvement after reinjection than that without improvement after reinjection (regional wall motion score: 2.55 +/- 0.50 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.97 p less than 0.01). History of myocardial infarction was also significantly less in the former (p less than 0.05). We conclude that Tl reinjection is useful in cases showing no or equivocal redistribution on the delayed images.
