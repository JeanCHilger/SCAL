Clinical symptoms and pathophysiology of migraine. Understanding of the pathophysiology of migraine attacks requires consideration of both symptoms and paraclinical investigations. During the aura phase, characteristic changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) can be observed. The headache is most likely a form of neurovascular pain. Nausea, photo- and phonophobia are probably elicited from the central nervous system. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans reveal specific changes in the brain stem. Allodynia, most likely caused by central sensitization, often develops during the attack. In conclusion, the migraine attack is a complex neurobiological and neurovascular process.
