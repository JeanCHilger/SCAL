Expression of centromere protein F (CENP-F) associated with higher FDG uptake on PET/CT, detected by cDNA microarray, predicts high-risk patients with primary breast cancer. Higher standardized uptake value (SUV) detected by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) correlates with proliferation of primary breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to identify specific molecules upregulated in primary breast cancers with a high SUV and to examine their clinical significance.We compared mRNA expression profiles between 14 tumors with low SUVs and 24 tumors with high SUVs by cDNA microarray. We identified centromere protein F (CENP-F) and CDC6 were upregulated in tumors with high SUVs. RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to validate these data. Clinical implication of CENP-F and CDC6 was examined for 253 archival breast cancers by the tissue microarray.The relative ratios of CENP-F and CDC6 expression levels to beta-actin were confirmed to be significantly higher in high SUV tumors than in low SUV tumors (p = 0.027 and 0.025, respectively) by RT-PCR. In immunohistochemical analysis of 47 node-negative tumors, the CENP-F expression was significantly higher in the high SUV tumors (74%) than the low SUV tumors (45%) (p = 0.04), but membranous and cytoplasmic CDC6 expressions did not significantly differ between both groups (p = 0.9 each). By the tissue microarray, CENP-F (HR = 2.94) as well as tumor size (HR = 4.49), nodal positivity (HR = 4.1), and Ki67 (HR = 2.05) showed independent impact on the patients' prognosis.High CENP-F expression, correlated with high SUV, was the prognostic indicators of primary breast cancer. Tumoral SUV levels may serve as a pretherapeutic indicator of aggressiveness of breast cancer.
