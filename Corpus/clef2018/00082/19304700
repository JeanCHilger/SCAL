PET/CT for the characterization of adrenal masses in patients with cancer: qualitative versus quantitative accuracy in 150 consecutive patients. The objective of our study was to evaluate a large cohort of patients with PET/CT to determine whether qualitative (visual) assessment, quantitative standardized uptake value (SUV), or standardized uptake ratio (SUR) techniques should be used when attempting to characterize adrenal masses in patients with cancer.The study group was composed of 150 consecutive patients (78 men, 72 women mean age, 60 yearsOf the 139 benign lesions, 109 were considered benign by CT densitometry measurements and 135 by qualitative PET data. Qualitative PET characterized 28 of 30 benign lesions that were considered indeterminate by unenhanced CT. All 26 malignant lesions were characterized by PET: All showed qualitative and quantitative signal intensity greater than the liver. By combining unenhanced and qualitative CT data with the retrospective PET data, the analysis yielded a sensitivity of 100% for the detection of malignancy, a specificity of 99%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 93%, a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%, and an accuracy of 99% (Table 1). Conversely, for the detection of benignity, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 99%, 100%, 100%, 93%, and 99%, respectively.PET/CT is a highly accurate method for differentiating benign from malignant adrenal masses particularly when using qualitative, rather than quantitative, PET data. The routine use of quantitative mean or maximal SUV or SUR data may be unnecessary. Occasional benign lesions do show mild to moderate increased FDG uptake compared with that of the liver and may mimic some malignant lesions. Without evidence that these lesions are benign by unenhanced CT densitometry or adrenal mass stability or growth from previous CT scans, we recommend that these lesions be characterized using contrast-enhanced washout tests and that if those tests are inconclusive, using percutaneous biopsy if early lesion characterization is mandatory.
