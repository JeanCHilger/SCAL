Psychosocial quality of life in patients after total laryngectomy. To examine Psychosocial Quality-of Life (PSQL) changes occurring over time among patients treated for laryngeal carcinoma by total laryngectomy.A retrospective, observational transversal study was performed on PSQL changes over time in laryngeal carcinoma patients having undergone total laryngectomy. Patients were interviewed using a questionnaire developed by two sociologists and a head and neck surgeon. Changes over time were assessed according to information with regards to smoking, alcohol consumption, psychological well-being, social life, family support, occupation and medical and demographic data regarding age, gender, verbal communication and patient appearance.150 patients completed the questionnaire. All were aged over 50 years at the time of surgery (total laryngectomy). Eighty-five percent of patients were smokers and 81% drinkers. On average, the questionnaires were completed by patients 6 years after surgery.Before and after total laryngectomy, no statistical differences were noted for marital status (p = 1.000), frequency of dining at home with friends (p = 0.175), frequency of weekend outings (p = 0.092) or frequency of holidays (p = 0.565). A significant decrease was noted for smoking and drinking (p < 0.001), frequency of going to a cafÃ© (p < 0.001), frequency of dinner outings at friends' homes (p = 0.032) and frequency of going out to a restaurant (p < 0.001). A significant increase was observed in: owning a pet (p = 0.02) and time spent watching television (p < 0.001).The two latter results are indicative of feelings of solitude among total laryngectomees. Tracheostoma and voice deprivation are limiting factors in social relationships, hence pushing individuals into withdrawal.
