First results of PET / CT-guided secondary lymph node surgery on patients with a PSA relapse after radical prostatectomy. CT and MRT are not applicable for the early detection of lymph node (LN) recurrence in prostate cancer. The PET / CT ((11)C-, (18)F-choline) technique can detect lesions >or= 5 mm and allows their topographic localisation. We have analysed positive (11)C-choline PET / CT LN findings in the case of a PSA increase after radical prostatectomy (RPE) histologicaly and documented the developing of PSA.8 patients with PSA relapse after RPE and lymphadenedtomy (LA) were diagnosed as having LNM by means of (11)C-choline PET / CT. Using PET / CT, metastasis suspicious and nearby LN were openly dissected. Histological and PET / CT results were compared and the postoperative PSA-development was examined.Of the metastasis suspicious LN (11) 9 were histologically reconfirmed. All additionally removed LN (12) were correct negative. LNM were mostly (7 of 9) located in the iliaca interna area and pararectal. 6 of 7 patients with histological metastasis detection showed a PSA response. 3 of 6 patients with single metastasis had complete PSA remission (< 0.01 ng / ml, maximum follow-up: 28 months) without adjuvant therapy.(11)C-choline PET / CT could detect LNM with high specificity in our collective. These often lie beyond standard LA area, where they were primarily only resected by use of extended or sentinel LA. Because 3 patients with single LNM reached a complete PSA remission (< 0.01 ng / ml) without adjuvant therapy, the selected collective seems to benefit from secondary LN surgery. Whether or not individual patients can be cured by this surgery has to be demonstrated in a longitudinal study. However, an optimal imaging and experience in LN surgery have to be assured.
