Psychosocial modulators of angina response to myocardial ischemia. Although angina is often caused by atherosclerotic obstruction of the coronary arteries, patients with similar amounts of myocardial ischemia may vary widely in their symptoms. We sought to compare clinical and psychosocial characteristics associated with more frequent angina after adjusting for the amount of inducible ischemia.From 2004 to 2006, 788 consecutive patients undergoing single-photon emission computed tomography stress perfusion imaging at 2 Seattle hospitals were assessed for their frequency of angina over the previous 4 weeks with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire and for a broad range of psychosocial characteristics. Among patients with demonstrable ischemia on single-photon emission computed tomography (summed difference score >or=2 n=191), angina frequency was categorized as none (Seattle Angina Questionnaire score=100Among patients with a similar burden of inducible ischemia, a history of coronary revascularization and current anxiety and depressive symptoms were associated with more frequent angina. These results support the study of angina treatment strategies that aim to reduce psychosocial distress in conjunction with efforts to lessen myocardial ischemia.
