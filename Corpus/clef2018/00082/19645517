PET lesion segmentation using automated iso-intensity contouring in head and neck cancer. To improve the objectivity of the integration of positron emission tomography (PET), we used the conformality index (CI) to measure the goodness of fit of a given PET iso-SUV (standardized uptake value) level with the GTV defined on PET (GTV(PET)) and CT (GTV(CT)). Twenty-two datasets involving 20 head and neck cancer patients were identified. GTV(PET) and GTV(CT) were delineated manually.An iso-intensity method was developed to automatically segment GTV(PET-ISO) using (a) SUV and (b) maximum intensity thresholding (% Max), over a range of intensities. For each intensity, GTV(PET-ISO) was compared to GTV(PET) using the conformality index CI(PET) (and, similarly, to GTV(CT) using CICT). Comparing GTV(PET) to GTV(PET-ISO) vs comparing GTV(CT) to GTV(PET-ISO), the average peak CI was 0.68 +/- 0.09 vs 0.49 +/- 0.12 (p < 0.001), the optimum iso-SUV was 2.7 +/- 0.7 vs 2.9 +/- 1.0 (p=0. 253), and the % Max SUV was 21.8% +/- 7.6% vs 23.8% +/- 8.6% (p=0. 310), respectively. The radiation oncologist's volumes corresponded to a lower iso-SUV (3.02 +/- 0.58 vs 4.36 +/- 0.77, p< 0.001) and lower % Max SUV (24.1 +/- 9.1% vs 34.3 +/- 11.2%, p<0.001) than those drawn by the nuclear medicine physician. Though manual editing may still be necessary, PET iso-contouring is one method to improve the objectivity of GTV definition in head and neck cancer patients. Iso-SUV's can also be used to study the differences between PET's role as a nuclear medicine diagnostic test versus a radiation oncology treatment planning tool.
