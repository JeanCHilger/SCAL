Labeling monoclonal antibodies with halogen nuclides. Most studies with radiohalogenated monoclonal antibodies have involved the use of the iodine nuclides 131I and 123I. Methods are being developed for labeling antibodies with radioiodine that result in a decreased loss of the nuclide from the protein in vivo. In addition, the labeling of antibodies with nuclides of fluorine, bromine and astatine could provide reagents of potential utility for positron emission tomography and radioimmunotherapy.
