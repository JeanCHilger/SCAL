Molecular imaging: 18F-FDG PET and a whole lot more. The intention of this review is to provide information about the rapidly evolving field of molecular imaging and its potential impact on the clinical practice of nuclear medicine. On completing this article the reader should be able to define molecular imaging, describe the ways in which molecular imaging can be used, identify some of the biologic processes that can be targeted with molecular imaging agents, and list the modalities that can be used for molecular imaging, along with the strengths and weaknesses of each.
