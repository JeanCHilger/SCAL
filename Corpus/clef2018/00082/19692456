Practical Aspects of 18F-FDG PET When Receiving 18F-FDG from a Distant Supplier. With PET becoming more widely used, there is an increase in the number of imaging centers being forced to rely on distant suppliers of (18)F-FDG. Because of the large distances between major urban centers, this is particularly true for PET centers in Canada.Our PET center, located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, currently purchases (18)F-FDG from a commercial vendor located more than 1,000 km from Winnipeg, necessitating transport by commercial airline cargo. This dependence on air transport and a distant supplier creates a situation in which our (18)F-FDG supply is less reliable than it would be with onsite production. In this article, we offer insight into the obstacles we have encountered in imaging with a distant supplier of (18)F-FDG and the solutions we have implemented to minimize the disruption to our patients and maximize the number of scans performed each year.The development of contingency plans and protocols designed to suit our operating environment has allowed us to increase the number of patient scans obtained from 659 in year 1 to 993 in year 3, an increase of 51%, despite an increase in our actual number of scan days of only 24%. (18)F-FDG injection timetables are presented for a variety of scenarios including normal delivery, low shipped activity, and delayed delivery.Through the careful establishment of contingency protocols and management of (18)F-FDG shipments, patient throughput can be increased and disruptions minimized.
