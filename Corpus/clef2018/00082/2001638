201Thallium reinjection after exertion-redistribution myocardial scintigraphy. A new method for distinguishing between scars and vital myocardium. In a prospective study 38 patients (35 men, 3 women median age 56 [37-71] years) with known coronary heart disease in whom conventional thallium-201 exercise-redistribution myocardial scintigraphy (ERMS) had demonstrated segments with diminished activity, thallium-201 was again injected ("reinjection scintigraphy"). Its purpose was to test whether in myocardial segments with persisting diminished radioactivity improved activity after reinjection provided evidence for still viable myocardium. Seven myocardial segments were evaluated in each patient, i.e. a total of 266 segments. Activity in the conventional ERMS was diminished in 94 of the 166 abnormal segments, but improved on reinjection in 21 of the 94 segments (22.3%). Nine of the 38 patients (23.7%) benefitted from the reinjection: only scar tissue without any viable myocardium would have been diagnosed by conventional ERMS in four patients, while extent and spread of ischaemic myocardium was better visualized in five.
