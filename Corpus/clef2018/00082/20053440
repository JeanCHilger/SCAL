Cu2+-labeled, SPION loaded porous silica nanoparticles for cell labeling and multifunctional imaging probes. We have developed an ion-sensing nanoparticle that is comprised of a superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) core encapsulated with a porous silica shell. The latter can be readily anchored with ligands capable of coordinating with positron-emitting metal. Evidently, this nanoparticle has a great potential for use in cell tracking with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and positron emission tomography (PET). Herein we report the synthesis, surface functionalization and characterization of the magnetic nanoparticle-based probes and evaluate their cell-labeling efficacy, cytotoxicity and relaxivity in comparison to one of the most commonly utilized MRI contrast agents, Feridex.
