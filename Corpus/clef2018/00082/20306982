Correlation of positron emission tomography with fine needle aspiration biopsies in head and neck malignancy. To investigate whether a correlation between fine needle aspiration cytology and positron emission tomography (PET) exists in the preoperative screening, staging and diagnosis of head and neck cancer.We retrospectively correlated fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and PET scan in patients with head and neck lesions.There were 92 FNABs with corresponding PET scan in 83 patients. Mean standard uptake value (SUV) for benign lymph nodes was 5.05 (SD, 5.79), and 13.56 (SD, 6.38) and 16.99 (SD, 19.04) for squamous carcinoma and other malignancies, respectively. Ideal SUV cutoff value was determined to be 6.0. Of 66 malignant FNABs, 52 had an SUV > or = 6, 8 had an SUV < 6, and 6 were interpreted as "hypermetabolic." Of 26 benign FNAB (SUV was available for 17), 8 were interpreted as "hypermetabolic" and 1 as "not hypermetabolic." Of those with SUVs reported, 15 were < 6 while 2 were > or = 6.Lesions with SUV 6 are more likely to harbor malignancy, while lesions with repeatedly negative FNAB in the context of SUV > 6 should be considered for open biopsy. Further, lesions with SUV < 6 may harbor malignancy and therefore fine needle aspiration biopsy is also recommended.
