Dual-targeted molecular probes for cancer imaging. Molecular imaging provides a powerful tool for early disease detection, characterization, and real-time monitoring of therapeutic responses. Central to molecular imaging is the development of imaging probes. Receptors that are overexpressed in tumors have been potential targets for cancer imaging using targeted molecular probes. Since many cancer types simultaneously overexpress several receptors, the design of dual receptor-targeted molecular imaging probes has recently been proposed. Peptide heterodimers, and microbubble-based dual-targeted probes have shown especially good performance for in vivo cancer imaging. The success of these molecular probes demonstrates that the dual-targeting strategy is generally a good approach for developing molecular probes. In this review, we will introduce the current state of development of dual-targeted molecular imaging probes and summarize the various dual-targeted molecular probes for in vivo cancer imaging.
