Peritoneal protein transport during the baseline peritoneal equilibration test is an accurate predictor of the outcome of peritoneal dialysis patients. Peritoneal protein excretion (PPE) is a potential marker of the outcome in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.Observational study of a cohort of 269 patients starting PD in a single unit.total PPE during a baseline peritoneal equilibration test (PET PET-PPE) and 24-hour PPE. Control variables: essential baseline demographic, laboratory and adequacy markers.mortality, cardiovascular events and risk of peritonitis. We applied univariate and multivariate strategies of survival analysis.PET-PPE sustained a significant, yet limited correlation with 24-hour PPE (r = 0.46, p < 0.0005). At baseline, the main study variables showed an independent correlation with peritoneal transport characteristics (D/P(240') creatinine) and cardiovascular comorbidity. PET-PPE (p < 0.0005, model global χ(2) 59.4) was a more accurate predictor of overall mortality than 24-hour PPE (p = 0.04, χ(2) 50.5). Moreover, PPE during PET, but not 24-hour PPE, was an independent predictor of the risks of cardiovascular and infectious mortality, and of peritonitis.Baseline PPE represents a strong independent marker of survival of PD patients. Estimation of PPE during PET is more accurate than 24-hour PPE for this purpose, sustains a definite independent association with cardiovascular and infectious mortality, and shows a significant correlation with the risk of peritonitis.
