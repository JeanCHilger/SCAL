. A neoplastic tumor is the result of an altered expression of the proteins that regulate the survival and proliferation of a cell. The molecular changes associated with the development of tumors such as changed expression (up- or downregulation) of certain receptors or metabolic regulatory components in the cell are often used for the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of cancers or other pathological conditions. The molecular changes are usually detected with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) developed against specific targets, and early detection of the cancer may result in the development of a suitable treatment and favorable outcome for the patient. To this end, mAbs may be labeled with radionuclides for noninvasive
