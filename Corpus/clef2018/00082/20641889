 Benzodiazepines are potent psychoactive drugs used for their sedative and anxiolytic properties (1, 2). There are two types of benzodiazepine receptors, which have been designated as central benzodiazepine receptors (CBRs) and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs). CBRs are found exclusively in the central nervous system on the membranes of neurons and are coupled to the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor/chloride channel (3). In contrast, PBRs are mitochondrial proteins found in the brain and peripheral tissues (adrenal gland, heart, lung, kidney, and testis) (4) the brain has lower levels of PBR than do the peripheral tissues, and both glial cells and macrophages contain high levels of PBR (5-7). Increased PBR expression after brain injury or neuroinflammation is associated with microglial activation, such as occurs with the neuronal damage that accompanies several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. PBRs have been studied
