Preclinical and clinical evidence that Deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography is a reliable tool for the detection of early molecular responses to erlotinib in head and neck cancer. There is a clinical need to identify predictive markers of the responses to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI). Deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography ((18)FDG-PET/CT) could be a tool of choice for monitoring the early effects of this class of agent on tumor activity.Using models of human head and neck carcinoma (CAL33 and CAL166 cell lines), we first tested in vitro and in vivo whether the in vivo changes in (18)FDG-PET/CT uptake were associated with the molecular and cellular effects of the EGFR-TKI erlotinib. Then, the pathologic and morphologic changes and the (18)FDG-PET/CT uptake before and after erlotinib exposure in patients were analyzed.Erlotinib strongly inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK-1/2) phosphorylation both in the preclinical models and in patients. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry showed that erlotinib did not modify Glut-1 expression at the protein level either in cell line models or in tumor tissue from mouse xenografts or in patients. Phospho-ERK-1/2 inhibition was associated with a reduction in (18)FDG uptake in animal and human tumors. The biological volume was more accurate than the standardized uptake value for the evaluation of the molecular responses.These results show that the (18)FDG-PET/CT response is a reliable surrogate marker of the effects of erlotinib in head and neck carcinoma.
