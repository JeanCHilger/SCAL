Lymph node imaging in gynecologic malignancy. The accurate identification and characterization of lymph nodes is essential in staging gynecologic malignancies. The presence of nodal metastases carries important prognostic and therapeutic significance. Identification of metastatic lymph nodes on imaging can help in treatment planning, disease response, and detection of disease recurrence. In this article, the strengths and weakness of the currently available imaging modalities will be discussed. Evolving techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetic resonance lymphography with nanoparticles, 18-flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography, lymphoscintigraphy, and more novel techniques will also be reviewed.
