Molecular mechanisms of bone 18F-NaF deposition. There is renewed interest in (18)F-NaF bone imaging with PET or PET/CT. The current brief discussion focuses on the molecular mechanisms of (18)F-NaF deposition in bone and presents model-based approaches to quantifying bone perfusion and metabolism in the context of preclinical and clinical applications of bone imaging with PET.
