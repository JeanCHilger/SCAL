Molecular imaging of the kidneys. Radionuclide imaging of the kidneys with gamma cameras involves the use of labeled molecules seeking functionally critical molecular mechanisms to detect the pathophysiology of the diseased kidneys and achieve an early, sensitive, and accurate diagnosis. The most recent imaging technology, positron emission tomography, permits quantitative imaging of the kidney at a spatial resolution appropriate for the organ. H(2)(15)O, (82)RbCl, and [(64)Cu] ETS are the most important radiopharmaceuticals for measuring renal blood flow. The renin angiotensin system is the most important regulator of renal blood flow this role is being interrogated by detecting angiotensin receptor subtype angiotensin subtype 1 receptor by the use of in vivo positron emission tomography. Membrane organic anion transporters are important for the function of the tubular epithelium
