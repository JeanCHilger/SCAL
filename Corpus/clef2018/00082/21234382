PET Response-Guided Treatment of Hodgkin's Lymphoma: A Review of the Evidence and Active Clinical Trials. Risk-adaptive therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma focuses on treatment modifications based on assessment of response. [(18)F]Fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) performed during or after completion of chemotherapy is a strong prognostic factor for eventual treatment outcome. Conceptually, this strategy seeks to increase efficacy and minimize toxicity through the appropriate selection of patients for either therapy escalation (high-risk, PET positive) or de-escalation (low-risk, PET negative). Preliminary evidence with tailoring both chemotherapy (drug selection, number of cycles, and dose) and radiotherapy (omission or inclusion) is varied however, numerous clinical trials seeking to validate this approach are ongoing. This paper summarizes the available evidence and active protocols involving PET response-adapted therapy for adult (early and advanced stages) Hodgkin's lymphoma.
