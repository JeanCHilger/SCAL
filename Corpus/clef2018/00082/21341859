Characterization of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Emim][Tf2N])∕TX-100∕cyclohexane ternary microemulsion: investigation of photoinduced electron transfer in this RTIL containing microemulsion. In this study we have characterized a ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethyl- sulfonyl)imide containing ternary nonaqueous microemulsion ([Emim][Tf(2)N]∕∕TX-100∕cyclo- hexane). The phase behavior and dynamic light scattering study show that the [Emim][Tf(2)N]∕TX-100∕cyclohexane three component system can form microemulsion with [Emim][Tf(2)N] as polar core at suitable condition. We have investigated photoinduced electron transfer (PET) using dimethyl aniline as electron donor and several Coumarin dyes as electron acceptor molecules at two different R values (R = [ionic liquid]∕[surfactant]) to observe how the dynamics of the PET rate is affected in this type of confined microenvironment compared to that of the PET dynamics in neat ionic liquid and other pure solvent media. The plot of observed k(q) values with the free energy change (ΔG(0)) for electron transfer reaction shows an apparent inversion in the observed rate as predicted by the Marcus theory.
