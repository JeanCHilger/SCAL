DOI-based reconstruction algorithms for a compact breast PET scanner. The authors discuss the design and evaluate the performance of combined event estimation and image reconstruction algorithms designed for a proposed high-resolution rectangular breast PET scanner (PETX). The PETX scanner will be capable of measuring the depth of interaction by utilizing detector modules composed of depth-of-interaction microcrystal element (dMiCE) crystal pairs. This design allows a unique combination of event estimation and fast projection methods.The authors implemented a Monte Carlo simulator to model the PETX system using only true coincident events. The performance of the dMiCE crystal pairs was determined experimentally over a range of depths of interaction. This distribution was used to simulate the noisy dMiCE detector signals and to estimate the line of response for each decay. Three different statistical methods were implemented to determine photon event positioning. Images were reconstructed from these line of response estimators with the exact planogram frequency distance rebinning algorithm, which is an exact analytical reconstruction algorithm for planar systems. Reconstructed images were analyzed with contrast, noise, and spatial resolution metrics.The authors' simulations demonstrate the ability for the PETX system to produce quantitatively accurate images from true coincident events with a contrast recovery coefficient of greater than 0.8 for 5 mm spheres at the axial center of the scanner and a spatial resolution (FWHM) of 3 mm throughout most of the imaging field of view.The authors' proposed positioning and reconstruction algorithms for the PETX system show the potential for creating high-quality, high-resolution, and quantitatively accurate images within a clinically feasible reconstruction time.
