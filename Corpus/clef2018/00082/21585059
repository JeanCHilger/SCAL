Characteristics of PET cerebral functional imaging during "Deqi" of acupuncture in healthy volunteers. To observe the characteristics of needling sensation of "Deqi" (feelings of soreness, numbness, distending and heaviness, SNDH) by using positron emission tomography (PET) based on changes of glucose metabolism in different functional brain areas.Eighteen normal volunteers [9 men and 9 women, mean age (23.23-1- 3. 32) years] were randomly divided into control, Waiguan (SJ 5) and non-acupoint groups (n=6 in each group). SJ 5 and non-acupoint (the midpoint between SJ 5 and the running course of the Small Intestine Meridian on the right forearm) were punctured by using a sterilized filiform needle. PET scan of the brain began 40 min after intravenous 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) injection (0. 11 mCi/kg body weight, left opisthenar vein). Needling sensations including "Deqi"(n= 5), tingling (n 5) and no-apparently-specific-feeling (NASF) were acquired by acupuncture stimulation and grouped. The needling sensations were evaluated by using Visual Analog Scale(VAS). The acquired image data of different needling-sensation groups were analyzed using SPM 2. 0 software in the Matlab Platform.After receiving acupuncture stimulation of SJ 5, 5 volunteers in the Waiguan (SJ 5) group experienced fee- lings of SNDH, with the mean VAS score being 4.23 +/- 1. 50, and 5 volunteers of the non-acupoint group had a tingling feeling, with the mean VAS score being 5.73 2.40. The VAS score of the tingling group was significantly higher than that of SNDH group (P<0. 05). Compared with the NASF control group, the activated cerebral areas were Brodmann area (BA) 7, 13, 20, 22, 39, 42 and BA 45 in the SNDH group, mainly involving the left temporal lobe, superior temporal gyrus, etc. and being obviously different to those of the control group (P<0. 001,k>10 voxels). The activated cerebral areas in the tingling group were BA 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, 32, 36, 40 and BA 45, predominantly involving the left limbic lobe, hippocampal gyrus, etc. and being apparently different to those of the control group (P<0. 001,k> 10 voxels).Acupuncture of Waiguan (SJ 5) mainly produces feelings of soreness, numbness, distending and heaviness, and the activated cerebral areas mainly involve the left temporal lobe, superior temporal gyrus, etc.  while acupuncture of its neighboring non-acupoint chiefly induces a feeling of tingling in the healthy subjects, and the activated regions predominately involve the left limbic lobe, hippocampal gyrus, etc.
