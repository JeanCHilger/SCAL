Three-dimensional comparison of peripheral benzodiazepine binding and histological findings in rat brain tumor. Experiments were undertaken to determine the in vivo utility of the mixed benzodiazepine ligand [3H]flunitrazepam and the selective peripheral benzodiazepine ligand [3H]PK 11195 [1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide] to outline the borders of rat C6 glial tumors in three dimensions. Intravenous injection of [3H]flunitrazepam resulted in a tumor/cortex ratio of radioactive densities between 2.7 and 1.5 within the first 60 minutes after injection. [3H]PK 11195 demonstrated a higher tumor/cortex ratio (5.3) than [3H]flunitrazepam. For three-dimensional studies, images were generated from thionin-stained histological sections and autoradiograms. The mixed type benzodiazepine ligand [3H]flunitrazepam was superior in showing some of the normal anatomical structures surrounding the tumor, whereas [3H]PK 11195, a specific peripheral ligand, demonstrated higher tumor/brain contrast and superior topographical correlation between histological and autoradiographic images. Implications of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands for positron emission tomography are discussed.
