Fugue associated with migraine. Fugue states are characterised by a complete loss of memory for all personal details. Although often witnessed on stage and screen, real-life fugue states are rare. They are often psychogenic and rarely organic in origin. Here a case of fugue in a patient with migraines is reported. It is possible that cerebral vasoconstriction in this case caused the memory impairment this is supported by cerebral hypo-perfusion demonstrated on SPECT scanning. The patient's fugue resolved after treatment for migraine.
