Automated radiosynthesis of [18F]PBR111 and [18F]PBR102 using the Tracerlab FXFN and Tracerlab MXFDG module for imaging the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor with PET. [(18)F]PBR111 and [(18)F]PBR102 are selective radioligands for imaging of the Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptor (PBR). We have developed a fully automated method for the radiosynthesis of [(18)F]PBR111 and [(18)F]PBR102 in the Tracerlab FX(FN) (30±2% radiochemical yield non-decay-corrected for both tracers) and Tracerlab MX(FDG) (25±2% radiochemical yield non-decay-corrected for both tracers) from the corresponding p-toluenesulfonyl precursors. For all tracers, radiochemical purity was >99% and specific activity was >150GBq/μmol after less than 60min of preparation time.
