I-131-MIBG therapies. Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a tracer that selectively targets neuroendocrine cells. On this basis, radiolabeled iodinated-MIBG (I-131-MIBG) has been introduced as a molecular nuclear therapy in the management of neuroendocrine tumors, including neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, neuroendocrine carcinomas, and other rare neuroendocrine tumors. Extensive work has been addressed to develop I-131-MIBG therapy: doses, therapeutic schemes, and efficiency. In this paper, we present an overview on I-131-MIBG therapy, with main focus on different aspects how to perform this treatment.
