Differentiation of histological subtypes in lung cancer with 18F-FDG-PET 3-point imaging and kinetic analysis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in histological subtypes of lung cancer using (18)F-FDG-PET 3-point imaging and kinetic analysis. Subjects comprised 44 patients with histologically proven lung cancer (squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), n=18 well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (WDA), n=9
