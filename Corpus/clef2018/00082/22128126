DSRCT primarily occurs in adolescents and young adults between the ages of 15 and 25 years and has a male predominance. DSRCT is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis timely diagnosis is therefore critical to the management of these patients. Although their radiographic appearances overlap with other aggressive malignancies, there are certain imaging features that can suggest the diagnosis and expedite the initiation of appropriate therapy.
