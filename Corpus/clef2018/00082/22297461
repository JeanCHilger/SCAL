Positron emission tomography imaging in neurological disorders. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful tool for in vivo imaging investigations of human brain function. It provides non-invasive quantification of brain metabolism, receptor binding of various neurotransmitter systems, and alterations in regional blood flow. The use of PET in a clinical setting is still limited due to the high costs of cyclotrons and radiochemical laboratories. However, once these limitations can be bypassed, PET could aid clinical practice by providing a useful imaging technique for the diagnosis, the planning of treatment, and the prediction outcome in various neurological diseases.This review aims to explain the PET imaging technique and its applications in neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and dementias.
