Synthesis of [(11)C]dehydropravastatin, a PET probe potentially useful for studying OATP1B1 and MRP2 transporters in the liver. Drug transporters mediate the uptake and elimination of drugs in various organs therefore, having knowledge of how a transporter functions in the body would play a key role in ensuring drug efficacy in in vivo systems. In this context, we designed and synthesized [(11)C]dehydropravastatin, a novel PET probe that would be potentially useful for evaluation of the functions of the OATP1B1 and MRP2 transporters, based on the use of palladium(0)-mediated rapid C-[(11)C]methylation (viz., the rapid cross-coupling between [(11)C]methyl iodide and a boron intermediate).
