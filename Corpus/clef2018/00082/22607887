Inflammatory and thrombotic markers in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated with thrombolysis and early PCI: a NORDISTEMI substudy. Both pharmacological and invasive treatment might influence the inflammatory and pro-thrombotic responses observed in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We aimed to study whether circulating levels of inflammatory and pro-thrombotic markers differ in STEMI patients treated with early angioplasty compared to standard therapy following thrombolysis. Furthermore, we wanted to study if levels of markers were related to infarct size.This was a substudy of the NORwegian study on DIstrict treatment of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NORDISTEMI), in which STEMI patients treated with thrombolysis were randomized to early invasive or standard therapy. Fasting blood samples were collected in the morning 3 days and 3 months after onset of STEMI. Commercially available ELISA methods were used for determination of inflammatory and pro-thrombotic markers. Infarct size was assessed by SPECT after 3 months.246 patients were included in this substudy. At 3 days, levels of prothrombin fragment 1+2 and D-dimer were higher in the early invasive compared to the standard treatment group, whereas levels of soluble CD40 ligand were lower (p<0.01 for all). No other differences between groups were found in any of the measured markers. Significant, although weak correlations were found between Day 3 levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, prothrombin fragment 1+2 and D-dimer, and infarct size assessed by SPECT after 3 months.An early invasive strategy following thrombolysis for STEMI was associated with higher subacute levels of D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1+2, and lower levels of soluble CD40 ligand than standard treatment. Further studies are needed to establish the relation between these changes and clinical outcome. The NORDISTEMI was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00161005.
