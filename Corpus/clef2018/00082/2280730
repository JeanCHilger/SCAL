Improved quantification of radionuclide uptake using deconvolution and windowed subtraction techniques for scatter compensation in single photon emission computed tomography. A comparison of two methods of scatter compensation in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging is made on the basis of improvements in quantification. The methods, scatter-window subtraction and constrained deconvolution of an average point source response function (PSRF), are described the theoretical basis of each method is also briefly assessed. Improvements in relative quantification offered by each method are measured by examining ratios of counts in hot cylinders to counts in a slightly radioactive background. The cylinder/background concentration ratio was varied by a factor of five
