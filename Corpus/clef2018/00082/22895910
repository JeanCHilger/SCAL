Whole body biodistribution and radiation dosimetry in humans of a new PET ligand, [(18)F]-FEPPA, to image translocator protein (18 kDa). [(18)F]-FEPPA is a translocator protein (18 kDa, TSPO) positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer. Radiation dosimetry was estimated from the whole body biodistribution, taking into consideration TSPO rs6971 (Ala147Thr) polymorphism.[(18)F]-FEPPA whole body PET scans were acquired for six healthy subjects. Time-activity curves were generated from regions of interest of nine organs, from which normalized accumulated activities were calculated and thus internal dose, using OLINDA/EXM 1.1. Genotyping of rs6971, associated with high- and low-affinity [(18)F]-FEPPA binding (high-affinity binder (HAB) and low-affinity binder (LAB)), was performed.Five subjects exhibited the C/C (HAB) allele, and the other carried the minor allele T/T (LAB). The LAB whole body biodistribution showed highest radioactivity accumulation in bladder, whereas in HABs, the spleen received the highest dose. The effective dose of the single LAB (16.3 μSv/MBq) was 23 % less than the mean of the HABs (21.0 ± 2.9 μSv/MBq). When including all subjects, the effective dose was 20.2 ± 3.0 μSv/MBq.[(18)F]-FEPPA radiation dose is consistent with other (18)F-labeled radioligands and the Ala147Thr genotype agreed with [(18)F]-FEPPA distribution.
