Single-photon emission computed tomography of brain perfusion: analysis of 60 paediatric cases. Sixty-nine brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans were performed on 60 paediatric patients with various neurological diagnoses. SPECT was abnormal more frequently in degenerative brain diseases (82 per cent), than in epilepsy (63 per cent), encephalitis (62 per cent), cerebrovascular disease (43 per cent), or other brain disorders (43 per cent). SPECT was more sensitive than EEG, CT and MRI results. SPECT was of considerable value for diagnosis in many cases. It was a decisive aid in two cases, but misleading in another two, so SPECT must be related to findings obtained by clinical and other laboratory methods.
