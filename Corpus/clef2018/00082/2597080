Measurement of regional cerebral blood flow and accentuation of the primary auditory cortex with single photon emission computed tomography. Conventional brain scanning uses polar tracers which do not penetrate the normal blood-brain barrier. Radiolabeled amines like 123-iodoamphetamine (IMP) cross the barrier to inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine in synaptosomes. Studies of cerebral perfusion and function seem to be successful with such labeling. We advance the hypothesis for an increased IMP uptake in the stimulated primary auditory cortex. The method of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is described. We have also been able to demonstrate marking of the primary auditory cortex by an increased amphetamine input in 6 out of 15 cases during stimulation by white noise.
