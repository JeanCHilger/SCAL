Influence of acupuncture on human nasal mucociliary transport. The effect of acupuncture on human nasal mucociliary transport was studied by using both 99mTc tagged-particle method (detected by SPECT) and the saccharin method. Results showed that acupuncture on the Yingxiang and Hegu could increase the velocity of the mucociliary transport in chronic rhinitis patients, but not in normal persons.
