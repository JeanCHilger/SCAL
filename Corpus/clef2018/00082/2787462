PET--new ways inside the body. Using positron-emitting short-lived radionuclide tracers, a wide range of substances can now be labelled without their biological properties being affected. Positron emission tomography (PET) enables the distribution and metabolism of the labelled substance to be studied in different organs. By providing quantitative, locational, functional and biochemical information difficult to obtain by other means, PET opens up new possibilities, both diagnostic, pathophysiological and therapeutic, in a broad spectrum of medical practice. The development of the technique is described, with particular reference to its use at Uppsala.
