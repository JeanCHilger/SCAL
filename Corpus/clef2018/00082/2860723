Positron emission tomography: human brain function and biochemistry. Positron emission tomography (PET) is an analytical imaging technique that provides a way of making in vivo measurements of the anatomical distribution and rates of specific biochemical reactions. This ability of PET to measure and image dynamic biochemistry builds a bridge between the basic and clinical neurosciences founded on the commonality of the types of measurements made. Clinical findings with PET in humans are suggesting hypotheses that can be tested rigorously in the basic science laboratory.
