Adrenal gland scintigraphy. The exact localization of adrenal lesions can be achieved by noninvasive procedures. Whereas radiological methods reflect morphological changes, scintigraphy of adrenal cortex and medulla depends on function. - Radiolabeled 6 beta-methyl-19-norcholesterol is used for adrenocortical scintigraphy in primary aldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome and hyperandrogenism. By dexamethasone suppression a correct classification of adrenocortical lesions by scintigraphy can be observed in about 89% with a specificity of 86%. 123-I- and 131-I-metaiodobenzylguanidine is used for specific scintigraphy of the adrenal medulla. This method is a safe and reliable method for localization of adrenal and extraadrenal pheochromocytomas.
