Intercorrelations of regional cerebral glucose metabolic rates in Alzheimer's disease. Patterns of cerebral metabolic correlations were compared between 21 Alzheimer's disease patients and 21 healthy age-matched controls in the resting state. Cerebral metabolic rates for glucose were determined by positron emission tomography using [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. Partial correlation coefficients, controlling for whole brain glucose metabolism, were evaluated between pairs of regional glucose metabolic rates in 59 brain regions. Reliable correlation coefficients were obtained with the 'jackknife' and 'bootstrap' statistical procedures. Compared with healthy controls, the Alzheimer patients had significantly fewer reliable partial correlation coefficients between frontal and parietal lobe regions, and more reliable correlations between the cerebellum and temporal lobe. The number of reliable correlations between many bilaterally symmetric brain regions was reduced in the Alzheimer patients, as compared with controls. These results suggest that in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease there is a breakdown of the organized functional activity between the two cerebral hemispheres, and between parietal and frontal lobe structures.
