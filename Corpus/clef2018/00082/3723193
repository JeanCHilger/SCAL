Dual tracer autoradiographic study of beta-methyl-(1-14C) heptadecanoic acid and 15-p-(131I)-iodophenyl-beta-methylpentadecanoic acid in normotensive and hypertensive rats. The myocardial distribution of 15-p-[131I]iodophenyl-3-(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMPDA) and 1[14C]-3-(R,S)-methylheptadecanoic acid (BMHDA) was compared in normotensive and hypertensive rats using quantitative dual tracer autoradiographic techniques. The myocardial distribution of carbon-14 [14C] BMHDA and iodine-131 [131I] BMPDA was nearly homogeneous in the normotensive rats, while both tracers showed similar, though very heterogeneous, distribution in hypertensive hearts with decreased uptake in the endocardial region. Our data demonstrate that myocardial distribution of [131I]BMPDA was essentially the same as [14C]BMHDA, and thus single photon emission computed tomographic imaging with 123I-labeled BMPDA could be useful for the detection of regional changes of myocardial fatty acid uptake in patients with prolonged and severe hypertension.
