Isolation and characterization of circulating feline leukemia virus-immune complexes from plasma of persistently infected pet cats removed by ex vivo immunosorption. IgG and circulating IgG immune complexes (CIC) were purified from plasma of three pet cats persistently infected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) by adsorption to, and elution from, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I. CIC were then separated from free IgG by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and were analyzed for the presence of FeLV structural proteins and corresponding specific antibodies. Radioimmunoprecipitation analysis indicated that FeLV envelope (gp70) and major core (p30) proteins, along with cat IgG heavy and light chains, were present in the CIC from all three cats. Further analysis of the CIC from one of the cats also revealed the presence of FeLV core proteins p15 and p12. IgG purified from isolated CIC was also shown to bind specifically to purified FeLV gp70, p30, and p15. These data provide direct evidence for FeLV-specific CIC in the plasma of persistently viremic pet cats, and suggest these animals are immunologically response to the virus even though free antibodies against the major structural proteins cannot be demonstrated in standard assays.
