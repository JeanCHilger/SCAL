Measurement of blood-brain barrier permeability with positron emission tomography and [68Ga]EDTA. Positron emission tomography (PET) was employed to examine time-dependent changes in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability to [68Ga]ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) in the rhesus monkey, following reversible barrier opening by intracarotid infusion of a hypertonic mannitol solution. The PET technique, when combined with measurements of plasma radioactivity, provided a quantitative measure of the cerebrovascular permeability-area product (PA) at different times following mannitol infusion. Hypertonic mannitol treatment reversibly increased PA to [68Ga]EDTA more than 10-fold much of the barrier effect was over by 10 min after mannitol treatment. The results show that PET can be used to measure transient changes in BBB integrity in specific brain regions, under in vivo, noninvasive conditions.
