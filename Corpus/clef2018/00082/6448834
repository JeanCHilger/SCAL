Migration of ethylene glycol from polyethylene terephthalate bottles into 3% acetic acid. Migration of ethylene glycol (EG) from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles into the food simulate 3% acetic acid was studied using 32 fluid oz PET bottles filled with 3% acetic acid and stored at 32 degrees C for 6 months. Final concentration of EG in the 3% acetic acid migration solution was about 100 ppb, which is equivalent to about 94 microgram EG/bottle. A gas-liquid chromatographic procedure for quantitating EG was developed which is capable of measuring EG levels as low as 50 ppb in the migration solution.
