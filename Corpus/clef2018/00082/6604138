Detection of severe cornary heart disease with TI-201: comparison of resting single photon emission tomography with invasive arteriography. To investigate the application of TI-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) at rest in the confirmation of coronary heart disease (CHD), we studied 95 patients who had all undergone coronary angiography and cineventriculography. We separated three groups, patients with (a) prior myocardial infarction (MI) (n = 45), (b) no history of MI (n = 40), and (c) no abnormality of coronary angiogram (n = 23). The results of planar imaging with computer-assisted evaluation (scintimetry, SCM) and of SPECT with a three-plane reconstruction (transverse, sagittal, frontal) were compared with the invasive, arteriographic findings. SPECT yielded a higher sensitivity (93%) than SCM (68%) in the detection of defects in both infarcted and noninfarcted groups. The specificity was found to be almost equal in the two imaging modalities. A significant (p less than or equal to 0.01) increase in accuracy was found in SPECT in the assessment of the posterior wall (54% compared with 88%) as well as in the general detection of defects (68% compared with 88%). Applying the SPECT imaging technique increases both the diagnostic accuracy of TI-201 myocardial imaging and the anatomical association of CHD.
