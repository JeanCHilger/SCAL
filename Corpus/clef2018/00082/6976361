Technical note. Computer assisted analysis of tomographic images of the brain. A computer system for the analysis of computed tomography and positron emission tomography scans of the brain is described. The system, called TOAP (Tomographic Overlay and Analysis Program), permits the registration of user specified slices from a digital brain atlas with the tomographic images. Regions of interest can then be defined with respect to the atlas. The system thus affords an objective and reproducible means for the analysis of tomographic images.
