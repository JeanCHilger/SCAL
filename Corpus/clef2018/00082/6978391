A contiguous-slice design for single-photon emission tomography (SPECT). Recent multislice, single-photon emission tomographic systems produce nonoverlapping transverse-section images, requiring repositioning of the patient and repeated studies to obtain a complete set of cross-sectional data. A complete, overlapping set of transverse-section images can be obtained by designing a collimator with alternating, staggered centerlines that are offset in the slice dimension.
