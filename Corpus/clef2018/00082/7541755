Three-phase bone scintigraphy of hydroxyapatite ocular implants. Hydroxyapatite ocular implants are replicas of lamellar bone tissue derived from the exoskeleton of a reef-building coral by a hydrothermal chemical exchange reaction. Attached to the eye muscles, they act as a passive framework for fibrovascular ingrowth and can be drilled to hold the visible part of the artificial eye and allow synchronous eye movement. Fibrovascular ingrowth has to be confirmed by bone scintigraphy before the drilling procedure. This study monitored the vascular ingrowth into the implant in ten patients over 12 months to establish a clinically feasible imaging protocol. Tracer accumulation was monitored visually and quantitatively in dynamic and single-photon emission tomography (SPET) scans after the intravenous administration of 600 MBq of 99mTc-DPD. The implants showed no tracer accumulation in the arterial or blood pool phase. Accordingly, dynamic scintigraphy can be omitted from the imaging protocol. Delayed tracer accumulation appeared no earlier than 2 and no later than 6 months after surgery. Planar scintigraphy is not recommended as high-resolution SPET is necessary to separate the implant from the surrounding bone. We conclude that imaging can be confined to high-resolution SPET 3 h after tracer injection, no earlier than 3 months after surgery. The vascularized hydroxyapatite orbital implant is an important in vivo model for bone-seeking agents to study their uptake kinetics independently of any soft tissue and bone disease. Our results provide evidence that in normal bones the chemical absorption of 99mTc-DPD into the crystalline structure of hydroxyapatite is the only quantitatively relevant uptake mechanism.
