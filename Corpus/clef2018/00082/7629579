Technetium-99m-sulfur colloid SPECT imaging in infants with suspected heterotaxy syndrome. For the evaluation of a variety of hepatosplenic disorders, SPECT complements planar 99mTc-sulfur colloid liver/spleen imaging. By isolating small, ectopic or poorly functioning spleen(s) from overlying or adjacent liver, SPECT imaging should facilitate identification of splenic tissue in infants with suspected heterotaxy syndrome.During a 10-yr period, 10 planar-only and 9 planar-plus-SPECT liver/spleen scans were obtained from 15 infants, 13 of whom were less than 1 mo of age at first examination. Four of the planar-only group had follow-up planar-plus-SPECT imaging. Scintigraphic diagnosis regarding presence of splenic tissue was correlated with clinical diagnosis.Thirteen infants had splenic tissue two were asplenic. Planar-only imaging provided correct diagnoses in six [four with, two without spleen(s)] but was negative or equivocal in four infants. Planar-plus-SPECT imaging was positive in all in whom it was performedParticularly when planar views are inconclusive, SPECT imaging is invaluable for identification and localization of functioning splenic tissue in infants with suspected heterotaxy syndrome.
