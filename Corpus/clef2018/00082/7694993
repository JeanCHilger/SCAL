Assessment of local cerebral blood flow in neonates with N-isopropyl-P-[123I]iodoamphetamine and single photon emission computed tomography. Local cerebral blood flow was measured in 10 high-risk infants with neonatal episodic neurological events at 41-44 post-conceptional weeks using N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (IMP) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In 5 of the 7 infants with normal neurological outcome, prominent cerebral perfusion was found in the basal ganglia, brainstem, cerebellum, parietal white matter, and sensory motor cortex. The frontal lobes showed poor relative perfusion. In 3 infants with severe neurological deficits, SPECT demonstrated severe hypoperfusion of all parts of the brain except the basal ganglia, brainstem and sensorimotor cortex. However, MRI revealed non-specific changes, such as poor myelination and ventricular dilatation. SPECT, when performed in the first weeks of life, can be useful and may be more sensitive than MRI in predicting the occurrence of major neurological handicaps. However, because of the relatively invasive character and high cost of SPECT, SPECT should not necessarily be performed in all high-risk neonates.
