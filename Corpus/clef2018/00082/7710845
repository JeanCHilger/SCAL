Application of short-lived radionuclides in neutron activation analysis of biological and environmental samples. The application of short-lived nuclides, especially in connection with the 6LiD-converter, in biological and environmental samples is demonstrated on I and Br determination in human urine, on I in pet food, and on the analysis of all the halogens in volcanic gases in a single activation. Trace element determination in lichens indicates polluted and unpolluted areas. The use of the .74-s 38mCl enables the rapid screening of great number of samples.
