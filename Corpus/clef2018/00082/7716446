Parasitology and human medical preventive importance of Toxoplasma gondii. Present knowledge of the biology and distribution of Toxoplasma gondii allows to provide recommendations for primary prevention of infection with the parasite. The recommendations are chiefly designed for "seronegative" pregnant women without specific serum anti-T.-gondii-IgG and for persons with continuous or temporary immune deficiencies. Prevention should focus on 3 main sources of infection risk: Meat: meat should only be eaten when well cooked or when it has been frozen prior to preparation do not prepare raw food in the same place and with the same utensils as for raw meat preparationfruit and vegetables should be carefully washed prior to consumption (also including fruit and vegetables from the consumer's own garden or orchard). Cats: household cats should be preferably fed with canned food rather than with raw meat contact with any utensil which may have been contaminated by cat's feces, as well as with the cat's litter, must be strictly avoided. If cleaning the cat's toilet is inevitable, plastic gloves must be worn. Disinfect the cat's toilet daily with boiling water. All primary prevention measures apply also to the areas of agriculture, veterinary practices, pet shops and gastronomy. Secondary prevention by means of serological monitoring of seronegative pregnant women can only be envisaged when associated with precise primary prevention recommendations.
