Ovarian cancer: comparison of findings with perfluorocarbon-enhanced MR imaging, In-111-CYT-103 immunoscintigraphy, and CT. To determine the accuracy of breath-hold gadolinium- and perflubron-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, immunoscintigraphy with indium-111-CYT-103 (planar and single photon emission computed tomography [CT]), and contrast material-enhanced CT for the detection of ovarian cancer prior to laparotomy.Sixteen patients with primary (n = 3) or treated (n = 13) ovarian cancer underwent imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with each modality. All images were reviewed prospectively for tumor location, and results were compared with findings at surgery.With CT or MR imaging, tumor was detected in 11 of 13 (85%) patients compared with 11 of 12 patients (92%) with immunoscintigraphy. Per patient accuracy for CT was 81% compared with 75% for MR imaging and 86% for immunoscintigraphy. For detection of individual sites of tumor, the sensitivity of MR imaging was highest (81%) compared with CT (51%, P < .001) and immunoscintigraphy (50%, P < .01). The combination of MR imaging and immunoscintigraphy depicted 89% of sites of tumor involvement confirmed at laparotomy.MR imaging and immunoscintigraphy show promise for the evaluation of patients with ovarian cancer.
