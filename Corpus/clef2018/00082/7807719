Comparison between 123I-BMIPP and 201TlCl myocardial imaging by circumferential profile analysis in patients with myocardial infarction--evaluation of effects of vascular reconstruction in patients with myocardial infarction. We quantitatively evaluated the effects of vascular reconstruction according to the stage by 123I-BMIPP and 201TlCl using circumferential profile (CP) curve method in patients with myocardial infarction. (1) Comparison of the CP curves for the two nuclides in normal volunteers (n = 9) showed no difference in distribution. (2) In patient with myocardial infarction (n = 32) the severity score was evaluated using the CP curves obtained in the normal volunteers. Type B (marked decrease in 123I-BMIPP accumulation) accounted for 83% in the group in whom vascular reconstruction was performed in the acute stage (Group I) and 91% in the group in whom vascular reconstruction was performed in the chronic stage (Group II). On the other hand, type E (similar accumulation between the two nuclides) accounted for 79% in the group in whom vascular reconstruction was unsuccessful or was not performed (Group III). The severity score for each nuclide did not significantly differ among Group I, II and III. The 123I-BMIPP/201TlCl ratio was the highest in Group II, followed in order by Group I and Group III (p < 0.05). The assessment of the ratio of "severity scores" for both nuclides is considered to be useful for evaluation of the surviving myocardium, rather than the assessment of a single nuclide.
