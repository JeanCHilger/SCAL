Bone mineral densitometry in dialyzed patients: quantitative computed tomography versus dual photon absorptiometry. Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) increases risk of fractures, thus making it necessary to monitor patients suffering from chronic renal failure and consecutive disturbance of bone metabolism. In order to evaluate the reliability of available methods, bone mineral density of the lumbar spine assessed with single energy computed tomography (QCT) was compared with bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, Ward's triangle and trochanteric region measured by dual energy photon absorptiometry (DPA) in 45 hemodialyzed patients with a mean hemodialysis duration of 35 +/- 26 months (SD). Depending on the measurement site and method 4-34% of dialyzed patients suffered from reduced BMD (z-score < -2). The highest correlation (r = 0.61, p < 0.01) was found between QCT of the spine, trabecular bone, and DPA of Ward's triangle. One year after baseline measurement bone mineral density was reassessed after randomization to either QCT or DPA in 14 and 18 patients, respectively. Whereas lumbar spine and femoral neck did not change, mean BMD showed a decrease at the measurement sites of Ward's triangle (DPA), trochanteric region (DPA) and trabecular bone of the spine (QCT), which, however, was statistically not significant. Cortical BMD of the spine assessed with QCT showed an increase. Although there is some reduction in bone density at most sites in hemodialyzed patients, no significant bone loss could be demonstrated over the course of 1 year.
