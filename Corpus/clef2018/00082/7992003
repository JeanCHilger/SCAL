Neurohumoral relations in neurological and psychiatric patients. Sixteen patients-epileptics, alcoholics, psychotics and post-contusion cases-were subjected to neurological, psychiatric, psychological, morphological (X-ray, CT, NMR), physiological (EEG, polysomnography, evoked potentials), immunological and SPECT examination. Most had CT and SPECT signs of focal brain damage. The results were but exceptionally due to injury, most were of unknown etiology. This tallied with EEG focal abnormalities, mainly sleep disorders, sometimes subjective ones, but invariably detectable objectively. In each case there was REM, in some also NONREM sleep deficiency. Half of the cases were tested immunologically, each time with positive results: increased levels of acute-phase protein and stress-reaction proteins. As copious literature and our experience show, the above pathological condition, rather than being accidental, constitute regardless of etiology, an integrated entity which could be called "programme cerebropathy". The primary role is played there by the epileptic focus and its properties, in particular, the speed of discharge and localization and brain stem humoroergic systems, i.e., their performance and mutual balance. There is a program sequence of events, first, and epileptic focus acting on the neighborhood, the rise of secondary and tertiary foci, and influence over the thalamocortical system. Soon afterwards, epileptic activity begins to act on brain-stem structures. This results in changes in sleep, mood, psychic output, immunity, endosecretion, and in paroxysms.
