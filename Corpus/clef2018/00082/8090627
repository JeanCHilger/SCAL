A method of correlating and merging cerebral morphology and function by a special head holder. A method is introduced which records and correlates topographically identical morphological and functional image data by means of a special head holder system which is adaptable to different modalities (MRI, PET, SPECT). It is based on a commercially available thermoplastic headmask. A thermoplastic form is used to mold an individual headmask (time required: 7 min) for all modalities providing a fixation of the patient during acquisition. This method guarantees an exact repositioning and therefore the same slice orientation of the images. The in-plane correlation is performed by adapting standard offset parameters determined with a homogeneous head phantom. By fusion (merging) of the brain outline contours or images themselves the accuracy was tested in MRI vs. PET resp. SPECT (transaxial accuracy: < or = 2.0 mm, axial: < or = 3.0 mm in patients with MRI-slice thickness of 6.0 mm).
