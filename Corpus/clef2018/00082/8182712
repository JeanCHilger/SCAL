Synthesis and characterization of radioiodinated N-(3-iodopropen-1-yl)-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl)tropanes: potential dopamine reuptake site imaging agents. Methods have been developed for the preparation of radioiodinated N-substituted 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl)tropanes. The syntheses, physical properties, radiolabeling, and characterization of the pharmacological properties of N-(3(Z)-iodopropen-1-yl)-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl)tropane (12) and N-(3(E)-iodopropen-1-yl)-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl)tropane (13) are described. 2 beta-Carbomethoxy-3 beta-(p-substituted-phenyl)tropanes are potent ligands for the dopamine transporter. The radioiodinated derivatives are of interest because of the high uptake and prolonged striatal retention that may result from specific binding to low-capacity, high-affinity, dopamine reuptake sites. Radioiodine was introduced into the 3Z and 3E-position of N-(3-iodopropen-1-yl)-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl)tropane by iododemetalation of the corresponding 3-(tri-n-butylstannyl) derivatives. Competition binding data of various dopamine reuptake ligands with rat striatal tissue preparation for either [125I]-12 or [125I]-13 exhibited the following order of potency: E-13 > Z-12 > GBR 12909 > mazindol > (-)-cocaine. Tissue distribution studies in rats showed that the E-13 was the best analogue. E-13 showed high striatal uptake (60 min, 1.23% dose/g 120 min, 0.61% dose/g) and high striatal to cerebellum ratios (60 min, 15.9/1
