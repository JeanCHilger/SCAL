Use of permethrin as a miticide in the African hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris). The African hedgehog, Atelerix albiventris (also known as Erinaceous albiventris 1,2) has recently undergone an increase in popularity as an exotic pet. This popularity (Beatrix Potter not withstanding) is due in part to the small size of the African hedgehog (adults are 4-6 in in length, weighing approximately 1 lb), its lack of hibernation or aestivation if reared under controlled light and temperature, and its general good nature and accommodation to handling.
