The gallium scan predicts relapse in patients with Hodgkin's disease treated with combined modality therapy. The gallium scan (GS) is an important indicator of disease activity in untreated Hodgkin's disease, especially in the upper torso, and may be an important predictor of results for patients who have completed chemotherapy and radiotherapy (XRT). To better define the importance of the GS in predicting treatment results in a group of patients treated with uniform therapy, we performed GS prior to treatment in 46 patients with pathologically or clinically staged I-III Hodgkin's disease who received three cycles of NOVP (Novantrone, vincristine, vinblastine, prednisone) followed by XRT. Staging methods included computerized tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, lymphangiogram, and the GS, using 8 to 10 millicuries with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the upper and lower torso. Only 3 patients had negative GS before chemotherapy. After three cycles of NOVP and prior to XRT, the other 43 had repeat GS performed. Complete remission (CR) was judged by disappearance of disease after all therapy without considering GS results. The CR for those with initial positive GS was 93%. The three-year freedom from progression result for stage I-II was 94%, and the three-year overall survival was 96% corresponding results for stage III were 86% and 100%, respectively. None of the prognostic factors for analysis, including bulky adenopathy, hilar involvement, or B symptoms, was an important predictor of results. However, only 1 of the 33 with a negative GS after these NOVP has had progressive disease compared to 3 of the 10 with a GS that remained positive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
