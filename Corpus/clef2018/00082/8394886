Three-dimensional dosimetry for radioimmunotherapy treatment planning. Absorbed-dose calculations for radioimmunotherapy are generally based on tracer imaging studies of the labeled antibody. Such calculations yield estimates of the average dose to normal and target tissues assuming idealized geometries for both the radioactivity source volume and the target volume. This work describes a methodology that integrates functional information obtained from SPECT or PET with anatomical information from CT or MRI. These imaging modalities are used to define the actual shape and position of the radioactivity source volume relative to the patient's anatomy. This information is then used to calculate the spatially varying absorbed dose, depicted in "colorwash" superimposed on the anatomical imaging study. By accounting for individual uptake characteristics of a particular tumor and/or normal tissue volume and superimposing resulting absorbed-dose distribution over patient anatomy, this approach provides a patient-specific assessment of the target-to-surrounding normal tissue absorbed-dose ratio. Such information is particularly important in a treatment planning approach to radioimmunotherapy, wherein a therapeutic administration of antibody is preceded by a tracer imaging study to assess therapeutic benefit.
