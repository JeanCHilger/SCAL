Effect of hypertriglyceridemia correction by omega-3 fatty acids on peritoneal transport in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients. Lipid abnormalities, both hypercholesterolemia and particularly hypertriglyceridemia (hyperTg), are common in long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Hyperviscosity and rheological alterations have been proposed as major hemodynamic problems in hyperTg patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a hyperTg correction by employing omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3) affects peritoneal transport. Six hyperTg (> 700 mg/dL) CAPD patients were treated with 2-3 g/day of omega-3 until normal Tg values were achieved. The assessment of peritoneal dialysis efficacy was performed by evaluating the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) before omega-3 supplementation, when normal Tg levels were reached, and 3 weeks after stopping therapy when hyperTg returned. When normal Tg levels were reached, a small but significant improvement of urea and creatinine D/P was noted: 0.85 +/- 0.05 versus 0.93 +/- 0.03 (p < 0.05) and 0.78 +/- 0.03 versus 0.86 +/- 0.05 (p < 0.05), respectively, with negative correlation between D/P of urea and Tg. These preliminary data demonstrate that a hyperTg correction with omega-3 may induce an increase in peritoneal transport of small molecules in CAPD.
