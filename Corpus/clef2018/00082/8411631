Safety and accuracy of dipyridamole thallium myocardial scintigraphy in elderly patients. This study examined mainly the adverse effects of 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy with dipyridamole (D-Tl) in 73 elderly patients over 70 years old in comparison with those in 65 younger patients. Fifty-five of 73 elderly patients (75%) and 49 of 65 younger patients (75%) had a persistent or dipyridamole-induced perfusion defect on D-Tl. The hemodynamic changes induced by dipyridamole as well as the incidence of cardiac and noncardiac adverse effects were similar in both groups and no serious adverse effect occurred in either group. Secondly, we examined the procedure's usefulness for detecting ischemic heart disease in elderly and younger patients. Dipyridamole induced perfusion defect was noted in 21 elderly patients and in 24 younger patients (N.S.). Among the patients in whom coronary angiography was performed, significant coronary artery stenosis was found in 5 of 8 elderly patients and 17 of 20 young patients (N.S.). In patients with one or two-vessel disease, the area with dipyridamole induced ischemia was concordant with the stenotic area seen on coronary angiography in 3 of 3 elderly patients and 12 of 13 younger patients (N.S.). Thus, the safety and usefulness of D-Tl for detecting myocardial ischemia were comparable in elderly and young patients.
