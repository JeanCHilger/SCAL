The role of thallium-201 single photon emission tomography in the investigation and characterisation of brain tumours in man and their response to treatment. The aim of this study was to characterise brain tumour type and treatment response in relation to the uptake of thallium-201. 201T1 single photon emission tomography (SPET) was performed in 58 patients with brain tumours. Fifty-six patients were utilised for the statistical comparison of the early and delayed 201T1 indices expressed as the ratio of tumour to contralateral cerebral hemisphere uptake. The retention index of 201T1 in the tumour tissue calculated from the early and delayed scans was also analysed. Furthermore, in 56 patients with 58 brain tumours, a comparison was made of the diagnostic value of high 201T1 uptake and gadolinium diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA) enhancement on MRI scans. Although high 201T1 uptake was observed in viable malignant gliomas, brain metastases, meningiomas and malignant teratoma, the viable malignant gliomas could not be differentiated from brain metastases and extracerebral tumours by means of 201T1 indices. 201T1 SPET failed to diagnose a viable ring-enhanced tumour with a thin rim and small tumours of less than 1.5 cm in diameter visualised by Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI. In spite of this, 201T1 SPET appears to be effective for determination of the malignant viability of tumours.
