Postoperative assessment of cerebral blood flow in subarachnoid haemorrhage by means of 99mTc-HMPAO tomography. Regional hypoperfusion is a very frequent complication of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), being related to vasospasm in the majority of cases. Twenty-six patients who were admitted for SAH underwent follow-up with technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime single photon emission tomography (SPECT) 3 and 8 days after surgery. Fifteen patients of these had one more examination 15 days after surgery. The degree of hypoperfusion was quantified using an index of asymmetry which allow the comparison of two symmetrical regions of interest (ROIs) on the transaxial slice which presented the greatest perfusion defect. Comparison of CT data, transcranial Doppler data and clinical signs with the perfusion as quantified by 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT indicates that a difference in counts of less than 10% between the two symmetrical ROIs is of no diagnostic value. Follow-up of the brain perfusion clearly shows that the most pronounced hypoperfusion was observed just after surgery, with progressive normalization at 8 and 15 days after surgery. 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT performed 8 days after surgery allows prediction of the clinical outcome. For these reasons, 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT, which is the only method for follow-up of cerebral perfusion in routine clinical practice, should be the first examination to be performed after surgery in patients with SAH.
