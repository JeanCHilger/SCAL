Static stabilometry, transcranial Doppler, and single photon emission computed tomography in patients with central dizziness. Previous studies have found that transcranial doppler (TCD) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are effective means of diagnosing cerebral blood flow disorders in patients with central dizziness whose etiology was unknown by standard audiologic and/or vestibular assessment techniques. Also, static stabilometry, which measures a person's standing center of pressure (COP) movements, has been used to distinguish between patients with central neurologic and peripheral vestibular disorders. The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine the relation between TCD, SPECT, and stabilometry in patients with central dizziness attributable to cerebral blood flow disorders. Stabilometry testing was conducted on 50 normal subjects and 31 subjects with dizziness, the latter group consisting of persons with cerebral dysautoregulation, migraines, and unknown etiology with negative or positive SPECT results. The results indicated that patients with cerebral dysautoregulation were not significantly different from normal subjects or the other three groups in their COP movements. The other three groups exhibited significantly higher COP movements than the normal subjects, particularly when visual inputs were compromised. Patients with negative SPECT results were significantly different in their COP movements from the other three groups of subjects with dizziness. These results suggest that the pattern of COP movements may be useful in identifying patients with postural dysfunctions whose etiology may then be detected by TCD and SPECT.
