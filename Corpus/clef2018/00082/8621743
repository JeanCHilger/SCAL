The metabolic topography of normal aging. Normal aging is associated with the degeneration of specific neural systems. We used [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)/positron emission tomography (PET) and a statistical model of regional covariation to explore the metabolic topography of this process. We calculated global and regional metabolic rates for glucose (GMR and rCMRglc) in two groups of normal subjects studied independently on different tomographs: Group 1--130 normal subjects (62 men and 68 women range 21-90 years)
