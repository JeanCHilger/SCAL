The role of FDG-PET in the preoperative assessment of N-staging in head and neck cancer. This prospective study based on 48 patients showed that FDG-PET has a significantly higher sensitivity for the detection of lymph node metastases compared with palpation and it appears that FDG-PET has a similar sensitivity to CT-scanning. According to our data, FDG-PET is a highly specific method in the evaluation of neck nodes. This new imaging technique allows a tridimensional study and is easy to interpret. Therefore, FDG-PET seems to be a valuable imaging technique for the detection of cervical lymph node metastasis.
