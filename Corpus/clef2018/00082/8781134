Is image subtraction necessary in the clinical interpretation of single-day split-dose stress cerebral perfusion single-photon emission tomography using technetium-99m compounds? The aim of this study was to validate a simplified semiquantitative method of evaluating a single-day stress cerebral perfusion test to obtain cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVRC) for routine clinical uses. A split-dose protocol was tested in 36 pairs of technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amino oxime baseline (low dose) and acetazolamide (high dose) stress brain single-photon emission tomographic (SPET) studies from 16 patients with cerebrovascular disease. The images were displayed on a semiquantitative color scale with (corrected) and without (uncorrected) image subtraction, dose adjustment, and decay correction. The representative CVRC was determined by placing 3x3 pixel regions of interest on midthalamic and midcerebellar slices. The corrected and uncorrected relative changes in CVRC were correlated using linear regression. The relative changes of corrected (x) and uncorrected (y) CVRC by quantitative analysis were highly correlated in a linear fashion (y=0.67x+0.002, r=0.998, P<0.0005). As predicted by theory, the slope was related to the ratio of split dose and independent of ROI sampling. Single-day split-dose stress brain SPET can be accurately performed without image subtraction and complicated dose adjustment or decay correction for clinical studies.
