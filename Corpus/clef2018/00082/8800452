Myocardial defect detected by 123I-BMIPP scintigraphy and left ventricular dysfunction in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The present study examined the role of myocardial fatty acid in patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathy (DCM) by means of 123I-beta-methyl-p-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (123I-BMIPP) scintigraphy. Thirteen patients underwent 123I-BMIPP imaging, 201Tl imaging and echocardiography. All patients showed defective myocardial uptake of 123I-BMIPP and 201Tl. The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (64.1 +/- 7.3 mm vs. 55.6 +/- 1.5 mm, p < 0.05) and end-systolic dimension (52.4 +/- 8.0 mm vs. 40.6 +/- 2.1 mm, p < 0.01) were significantly large in the defect group (123I-BMIPP defect score (DS) > 8) than the small defect group (DS < 7). The % fractional shortening (%FS) was also significantly smaller (18.6 +/- 3.8% vs. 27.0 +/- 3.3%, p < 0.01) in the large defect group. The 123I-BMIPP DS correlated statistically with %FS (r = 0.75, p < 0.01), while the 201Tl DS did not (r = 0.41, ns). We conclude that the patients with DCM revealed a 123I-BMIPP uptake defect and the defect reflected the degree of left ventricular dysfunction.
