Epidemiological, genetic, pharmacological, kinesiological, nuclear medical (IBZM-SPECT), standard and functional MRI studies on Parkinson's disease and related disorders and economic evaluation of Parkinson's disease therapy--clinical projects in the BMFT-research program Munich: "Parkinson's disease and other basal ganglia disorders". The results of selected clinical research projects related to epidemiological, genetic, pharmacological, kinesiological, and neuroimaging aspects (SPECT, PET, MRI, functional MRI) of basal ganglia disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Multiple System Atrophy and Wilson's disease are summarized.
