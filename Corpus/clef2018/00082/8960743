Nigrostriatal dopaminergic function in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with and without copper/zinc superoxide dismutase mutations. Some cases of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) are associated with copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) mutations, which are implicated in the death of motor neurons. Because Cu/Zn-SOD is present in high amounts in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, we considered the possibility that FALS may be associated with subclinical nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction. We used [18F]fluorodopa (FDOPA) and PET to study 14 FALS patients (50 +/- 11 years [mean +/- SD]): seven with (FALS-1) and seven without (FALS-0) Cu/Zn-SOD mutations. Fourteen age-matched normal volunteers (48 +/- 18 years) served as controls. Striato-occipital ratios (SORs) for the caudate and the putamen were calculated. Five of the 14 FALS patients had reduced striatal FDOPA uptake in the caudate nucleus, putamen, or both. Mean caudate SOR did not differ among FALS-1, FALS-0, and control subjects. Mean putamen SOR was significantly abnormal in FALS-0 but not in FALS-1 patients. These findings indicate that subclinical nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction is present in some FALS patients and that FDOPA/PET abnormalities are more likely to be associated with FALS-0 status. This suggests that SOD mutations are less cytotoxic to dopaminergic than to motor neurons.
