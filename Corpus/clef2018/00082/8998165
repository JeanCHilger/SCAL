Fluorine-18-FPCT: a PET radiotracer for imaging dopamine transporters. Fluorine-18-labeled 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-[-3-fluoropropyl) nortropane (FPCT) has been synthesized as a new dopamine transporter imaging agent.Fluorine-18 was introduced into 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-[-3-fluoropropyl) nortropane by preparation of 1-[18F]fluoro-3-iodopropane followed by alkylation of 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl)nortropane.Tissue distribution studies in rats with [18F]FPCT showed high striatal uptake (0.70% dose/g at 60 min 0.38% dose/g at 120 min) and good striatal-to-cerebellum ratios (5.5 at 60 minThese results suggest that [18F]FPCT is an excellent candidate for PET imaging of dopamine transporters.
