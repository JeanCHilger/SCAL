Brainvox: an interactive, multimodal visualization and analysis system for neuroanatomical imaging. A study of cognition emerging from a neurobiological perspective, as opposed to one emerging from a purely computational or psychological perspective, begins with observations of the human brain in normal and pathological states and is furthered by the investigation of hypotheses which are articulated using neuroanatomical nomenclature. Brainvox is an interactive three-dimensional brain imaging software package designed to permit such research through the support of the description and quantification of brain pathology in magnetic resonance images and of the experimental investigation of human cognition in lesion and functional imaging studies. Important general features of Brainvox, for these purposes, are: (1) adaptation of volume rendering for brain lesions and for corendered datasets (2) shared memory architecture, which enables the user to identify and label anatomical structures, while inspecting the brain in multiple views simultaneously
