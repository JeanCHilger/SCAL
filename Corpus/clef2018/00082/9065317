History of brain imaging in psychiatry. This is a brief history of the use of brain imaging in neuropsychology and psychiatry. There are two main parts. The first concerns brain imaging using regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements with xenon clearance. The 2-dimensional rCBF techniques have been used since 1961. The second concerns application of PET techniques starting in the early 80s. Brain imaging has yielded new information on consciousness, cortical localization, language, emotions and will. In psychiatry, brain imaging has revealed regional cerebral abnormalities in schizophrenia, affective disorders, DAMP, as well as following alcohol intake.
