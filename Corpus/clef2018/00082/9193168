Cerebellar somatotopic representation and cerebro-cerebellar interconnections in ataxic patients. Different methods of functional neuroimaging were used for studying somatotopic encoding of function in the cerebellum and for investigating cerebro-cerebellar interconnections in patients with cerebellar degeneration. fMRI showed, that the center of activation for hand function was located in the intermediate hemispheric portion of Larsell lobules H IV-V. Foot movements activated areas medial and anterior to the corresponding hand areas within Larsell lobules II-III. Changed function in motor cortices could be demonstrated in patients with cerebellar degeneration as compared to normal controls by recording movement-related cortical potentials (BP). In patients the motor potential was almost lacking and transcranial magnetic stimulation demonstrated enhancement of inhibitory mechanisms (prolonged postexcitatory inhibition) in the motor cortex. PET-findings suggested, that both effects are correlated to increased activity of inhibitory interneurons. Cerebellar patients showed increased activation in relation to movements in the SMA and basal ganglia and reduced activation in the cerebellum and lateral premotor areas. It could be speculated, that compensatory mechanisms are the reason for a stronger activation of the medial premotor system, including SMA, in patients with cerebellar degeneration. On the basis of our results it appears, that the cerebellum facilitates the lateral premotor system areas much more than it does the medial areas.
