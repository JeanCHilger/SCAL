Efficacy of enrofloxacin or doxycycline for treatment of Bartonella henselae or Bartonella clarridgeiae infection in cats. Enrofloxacin and doxycycline are antimicrobial agents used to treat bacterial diseases of cats. In vitro susceptibility data indicate that either drug should be effective against Bartonella species. In vivo efficacies of these drugs for eradication of chronic Bartonella henselae or Bartonella clarridgeiae infections were examined in 18 experimentally infected cats and 25 naturally exposed cats treated with enrofloxacin (22.7 mg given orally [PO] every 12 h [q12h] [14 days, n = 10 28 days, n = 13]) or with doxycycline (25 mg PO q12h [14 days, n = 9
