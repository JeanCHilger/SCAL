A PET study of axis orientation discrimination. We examined the cortical areas showing increased activation related to axis orientation discrimination in hand movement and perception by positron emission tomography (PET) in right-handed normal human subjects while they performed a hand orientation (HO) task and an orientation discrimination (OD) task. In the OD task, fields in the parietal cortex and a field in the inferior frontal gyrus showed increased activation relative to the control task. In the HO task, fields in the intraparietal sulcus, the inferior and middle frontal gyri, the fusiform gyrus and the middle temporal gyrus showed increased activation relative to the control task. The results indicate that areas involved in axis orientation discrimination seemed to be segregated in the parietal cortex, with one field in the left intraparietal sulcus related to hand movement and another field in the right intraparietal sulcus related to perception.
