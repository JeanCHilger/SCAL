Regional cerebral blood flow in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus: a prospective SPECT study. Single photon emission computed tomography. Using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) we evaluated the presence and evolution of changes in brain perfusion in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE).SPECT was performed in 14 patients with active JSLE divided in 2 groups: the first included 7 patients without central nervous system (CNS) involvement and the second 7 patients with minor neuropsychiatric symptoms (headache, reactive depression, cognitive impairment, mood swing). SPECT findings were compared to seroimmunological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. After 6 month followup, a second SPECT scan was performed in 12 of 14 patients.At baseline, SPECT showed perfusion defects in 2 patients without neuropsychiatric symptoms and in 5 patients with CNS involvement. In one of the 7 patients with altered SPECT, MRI showed focal hyperintensities. MRI alterations were observed in another patient who had a normal SPECT scan. Cortical atrophy was present in 5 of 14 patients. Correlation between neuropsychiatric manifestations and SPECT findings was not clearly evident because the major part of JSLE patients with CNS involvement and with SPECT alterations had multiple symptoms, but showed focal hypoperfusion on SPECT imaging. No significant association was found between seroimmunological data and SPECT findings. At followup, improvement of perfusion alterations was observed in 6 of 7 patients with altered SPECT and, in 3 of them, findings might be attributed to changes in steroid treatment.Perfusion abnormalities in SLE may represent reversible lesions or subclinical CNS involvement. Moreover, SPECT imaging appears to be useful in detecting and monitoring CNS involvement in SLE.
