Worker dose analysis based on real time dosimetry. Real time dosimetry was used to analyze nuclear medicine technologist dose from performing positron emission tomography clinical imaging procedures. The purpose was to identify which tasks in the procedure were the greatest contributors to dose. Results identified the patient positioning task as the single largest source of technologist dose, followed by measurement and administration of the radioactive drug. The dosimetry method appears suitable for any work situation where it is not clear whether task modification or installation of shielding will better reduce worker dose.
