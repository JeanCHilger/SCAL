Phase I/II radioimmunotherapy trial with iodine-131-labeled monoclonal antibody G250 in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This Phase I/II radioimmunotherapy study was carried out to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and therapeutic potential of 131I-G250. Thirty-three patients with measurable metastatic renal cell carcinoma were treated. Groups of at least three patients received escalating amounts of 1311I (30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 mCi/m2) labeled to 10 mg of mouse monoclonal antibody G250, administered as a single i.v. infusion. Fifteen patients were studied at the MTD of activity. No patient had received prior significant radiotherapy one had received prior G250. Whole-body scintigrams and single-photon emission computed tomography images were obtained in all patients. There was targeting of radioactivity to all known tumor sites that were > or =2 cm. Reversible liver function test abnormalities were observed in the majority of patients (27 of 33 patients). There was no correlation between the amount of 131I administered or hepatic absorbed radiation dose (median, 0.073 Gy/mCi) and the extent or nature of hepatic toxicity. Two of the first six patients at 90 mCi/m2 had grade > or =3 thrombocytopenia
