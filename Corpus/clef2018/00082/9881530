High prevalence of bihemispheric structural and functional defects in Sturge-Weber syndrome. Abnormal cerebral venous drainage is associated with hypoxia and glucose deprivation, which can account for progressive neurologic deterioration in Sturge-Weber syndrome. Although developmental delay is common in Sturge-Weber syndrome, bihemispheric calcification is uncommon. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to study the neuroanatomy, while single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was used concurrently to evaluate perfusion and glucose metabolism using 99mTc hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), respectively. Ten patients (10 to 22 years of age) with previously diagnosed Sturge-Weber syndrome, port-wine nevi, and clinical evidence of seizures or stroke-like episodes were studied. Five children with onset of seizures in the first year of life had overall clinical severity comparable to that of children with later-onset seizures. Calcification was present in both hemispheres in one patient six additional patients had other radiologic evidence of bihemispheric disease
