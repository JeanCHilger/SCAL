Radioimmunoscintigraphy of colorectal cancer using the anti-CEA monoclonal antibody BW 431/26. Final results. The anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) antibody, BW 431/26 (Scintimun CEA, Behringwerke, Marburg, Germany ) labeled with technetium pertechnectate (99mTc), is an intact immunoglobulin G1, monoclonal antibody that has been used to image colorectal cancer. Planar and SPECT images of chest, abdomen and pelvis were performed at 10 minutes, 4-6 and 18-24 hours after the intravenous antibody injection. 44 patients were studied and the pathological antibody concentration localization by radioimmunoimaging (RI) were correlated with surgical, clinical and other imaging modality findings to validate the RI. The RI was positive in 29 patients and negative in the other 15 patients. The CEA and CA 19.9 were elevated in the serum of some patients with primary tumors or recurrence. The HAMA were determined in all the patients before and after the RI.
