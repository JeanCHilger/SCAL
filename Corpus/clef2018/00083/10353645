Bonelike apatite coating on organic polymers: novel nucleation process using sodium silicate solution. A bonelike apatite layer was formed on organic polymers when sodium silicate was used as a catalyst for the apatite nucleation, and modified simulated body fluid was used as a medium for the apatite growth. The apatite-forming ability was the highest when the SiO2 concentration and SiO2/Na2O mole ratio of the sodium silicate solution were above 2.0 M and 1.0-1.5, respectively. It is assumed that particular silicate oligomers with structures such as dimer, linear trimer and cyclic tetramer contribute to the apatite nucleation the most. The apatite layer was formed not only on limited surfaces but also on the whole surfaces of fine PET fibers constituting a fabric. This method is expected to enable the bonelike apatite coating on various kinds of materials with complex shapes.
