Dynamic SPET parameters of 123I-MIBG cardiac imaging. Early dynamic and late 123I-MIBG SPET studies were performed to investigate several parameters used to distinguish the characteristics of various cardiac disorders. Forty-six individuals (34 non-diabetic, 12 diabetic) with or without heart disease were included in the study. Early dynamic and late static SPET images were acquired using a triple-headed gamma camera. After selecting mid-sections from vertical (VLA) and horizontal (HLA) long-axis images, regions of interest were created over the apex, whole heart and anterior, inferior, septal and lateral walls of the heart. Various uptake ratios at 3, 11 and 19 min and 4 h after injection (HU3, HU11, HU19, DUP) and clearances (Kse: between HU3 and HU11 Ke: between HU11 and HU19
