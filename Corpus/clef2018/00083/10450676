Reproducibility of regional metabolic covariance patterns: comparison of four populations. In a previous [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET study we analyzed regional metabolic data from a combined group of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and healthy volunteers (N), using network analysis. By this method, we identified a unique pattern of regional metabolic covariation with an expression which accurately discriminated patients from healthy volunteers. To assess the reproducibility of this pattern as a potential marker for PD, we compared the pattern's topography with that of the disease-related covariance patterns identified in three other independent populations of patients with PD and healthy individuals studied in different PET laboratories.The following patient populations were studied: group A (original cohort: 22 PD, 20 N resolution: 7.5 mm full width at half maximum [FWHM])The PDRP topography identified in group A was highly correlated with each of the corresponding topographies identified in the other populations (r2 approximately 0.60, P < 0.0001). Prospectively computed subject scores for the group A PDRP significantly discriminated PD from N in each population (P < 0.004).The PDRP topography identified previously in Group A is highly reproducible across patient populations and tomographs. Prospectively computed PDRP scores can accurately discriminate patients from controls in multiple populations studied with different tomographs. Brain network imaging with FDG PET can provide robust metabolic markers for the diagnosis of PD.
