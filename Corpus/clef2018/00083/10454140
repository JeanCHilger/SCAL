Imaging functional activation of the auditory cortex during focal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex in normal subjects. Positron emission tomography (PET) during focal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has emerged as a promising approach to study cortical connectivity in awake humans. However, the noise caused by the discharging magnetic coil might have confounding effects on the rTMS-related cortical activation pattern. In twelve healthy volunteers, 18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG) PET was employed to visualize the functional activation of the primary auditory cortex (PAC) during 2 Hz rTMS of the left primary sensorimotor hand area. Magnetic stimuli (1800) were applied at an intensity of 140% of motor resting threshold during the uptake period of 18FDG. Though all subjects wore earplugs, rTMS-related noise induced a consistent bilateral increase of regional glucose utilization in the PAC (P < 0.05, corrected). Thus, rTMS-related acoustic input needs to be taken into account in combined rTMS/PET studies.
