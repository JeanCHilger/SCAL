Methods of detection of Chlamydia psittaci in domesticated and wild birds. To study the occurrence of Chlamydia psittaci in domesticated and wild birds and compare the sensitivity of molecular detection with cell culture isolation.Study of cell culture isolation and PCR detection of C psittaci in avian samples.Samples were obtained from 485 birds. Domesticated birds were selected at random from pet shops, private aviaries and zoos, while wild birds were captured locally, sampled, and immediately released. Swabs were collected from choanal slit, conjunctiva and cloaca of each bird and pooled. Samples were divided into equal portions for use in PCR dot-blot and cell culture detection. PCR and dot-blot detection was based on the ompB gene.Prevalence of infection varied markedly between flocks of captive birds. It was highest where there were frequent changes in the flock members or where there were many birds confined in small areas. C psittaci was not detected in wild birds or water birds. The sensitivity of cell culture compared to PCR dot-blot detection was 68%. All samples positive by cell culture were also positive by PCR.PCR-dot blot detection of C psittaci in birds appears to be more sensitive than cell culture isolation in this study. C psittaci infection of birds may occur in clinically normal captive birds.
