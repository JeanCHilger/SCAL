Infections associated with pets. Domestic pets can transmit numerous infections, including bacterial, parasitic, fungal, and viral diseases. This paper reports the epidemiologic, clinical, therapeutic and prophylactic data of these zoonoses.The routes of transmission are various. Bites and scratches are the most common health hazards and result in localized infections. Pasteurellosis, various aerobic and anaerobic infections, and cat-scratch disease are predominant. Bites are treated by cleaning the wound, rabies and tetanus prophylaxis, and the appropriate use of antibiotics. Other infections are transmitted through cutaneous, mucous, digestive or respiratory routes, by direct contact with the pets, excreta, or by arthropods. The most common are gastrointestinal (campylobacter, salmonella, yersinia, parasites, etc), dermatologic (dermatophytoses, scabies, cutaneous larva migraines, etc.), respiratory (psittacosis, etc.), and multisystemic (toxoplasmosis, toxocariasis, leishmaniosis). Certain people are at high risk for diverse diseases: small children (toxocariasis, helminthiasis), pregnant women (toxoplasmosis), and immunodeficient patients (cryptosporidiosis, salmonellosis, systemic pasteurellosis). These infectious diseases can be partly prevented by avoiding contact with diseased animals, and by washing the hands following exposure to pets or pet-derived excreta. Specific vaccines for humans and pets, as well as worming pets regularly, form an important part of the prevention. Veterinarians must discourage the keeping of wild or exotic animals as pets.National health survey institutions and new communication systems can improve our knowledge about the real epidemiology of pet-transmitted zoonoses.
