Long-term methamphetamine-induced decreases of [(11)C]WIN 35,428 binding in striatum are reduced by GDNF: PET studies in the vervet monkey. The effects of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) pretreatment on methamphetamine (METH)-induced striatal dopamine system deficits in the vervet monkey were characterized with [(11)C]WIN 35,428 (WIN)-positron emission tomography (PET). WIN, a cocaine analog that binds to the dopamine transporter (DAT), was used to provide an index of striatal dopamine terminal integrity. In two subjects, GDNF (200 microg/40 microl) was injected into the caudate and putamen unilaterally vs. saline contralaterally. After 1-2 weeks, + and -GDNF striatal WIN-PET binding values were equivalent as calculated by multiple time graphic analysis, suggestive of an absence of unilateral DAT up-regulation. Three other subjects (n = 3) received GDNF injections into the caudate and putamen unilaterally and one week later, were administered METH HCl (2 x 2 mg/kg i.m., 24 hours apart
