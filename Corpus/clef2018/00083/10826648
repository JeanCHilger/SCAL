Hydrogen-ion binding of polycytidylic acid immobilized between Langmuir layers of dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DODA) in thin multilayer films. The report describes the study of hydrogen-ion binding of Langmuir-Blodgett films contained with polycytidylic acid. A variety of multilayer films are analyzed and their UV absorption spectra are recorded. Poly (C) molecules established between dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DODA) layers are shown to exist in double stranded and semiprotonated form, independent of the pH value of the solution from which the films were made. A large hysteresis was found between forward and back proton titration of poly(C) immobilized in the LB films. This hysteresis points to a marked transference of both types of molecules during the film titration. This behavior also depends upon the types of molecules from which the films were made.
