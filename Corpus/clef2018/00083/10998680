A Review of Functional Imaging of the Brain and Pain. Functional imaging of the brain is a current reality using positron emission tomography and functional magnetic imaging. This article reviews many of the reports that have emerged in the past several years using these techniques in the analysis of pain experience. The areas of the brain that appear to be functioning during the experience of pain are discussed, and the variances in findings between studies are described. The implications of the findings are noted. Although much has been learned through these techniques, it is clear that further research is needed before clinicians can use these diagnostic studies for therapeutic purposes.
