Factors playing a role in the increase of localized perfusion observed by single-photon emission-computed tomography during an epileptic seizure. Ictal SPECT is a valuable method for the presurgical exploration of partial epilepsy. (99m)Tc Ethyl Cysteinate Dimer stable during 6h has contributed to develop ictal studies to evaluate the location of partial seizure. The aim of this study was to investigate some factors playing a possible role on the regional increase of cerebral blood flow (rCBF) Twenty-three patients with refractory partial epilepsy (temporal epilepsy n=16, extratemporal epilepsy n=7) were included. All the patients underwent a presurgical evaluation (phase I) during a week with detailed clinical history, cranial magnetic resonance imaging, monitoring EEG and video. Ictal and interictal SPECT were performed using a fast rotating brain dedicated camera (TOMOMATIC 564) in a quiet and normally illuminated room with controlled EEG (interictal) or video EEG (ictal) Scanning was started one hour after injection of ECD Tc administered in IV a few seconds after the electrical onset seizure. Slices parallel to the long axis of the temporal lobe were reconstructed. SPECT images were evaluated after normalisation. This study shows that
