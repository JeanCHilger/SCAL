Isotope tracer-techniques in rolandic epilepsy and its variants. For ethical and practical reasons there are few studies on brain metabolism in rolandic epilepsy and it's variants. Most studies are performed in Landau-Kleffner syndrome or epilepsy with continuous spikes and waves during slow wave sleep (CSWS) which are considered to be included within the spectrum of rolandic epilepsy. The results of studies using isotope tracer-techniques in rolandic epilepsy and its variants are summarized.
