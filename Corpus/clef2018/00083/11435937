Metabolic and electrophysiological alterations in an animal model of neocortical neuronal migration disorder. Cortical migration disorders are a major cause for intractable epilepsy syndromes. High resolution MRI and PET are increasingly capable to identify cortical dysgenesis. In this study we used the rat freeze lesion model to investigate cortical morphological and functional changes in adult rats after induction of a cortical freeze lesion at postnatal day (p) 0. Autoradiographic measurements of basic cortical [14C]deoxyglucose metabolism showed a significant reduction up to 1 mm lateral to the lesion but no remote changes. Electrophysiological in vitro recordings revealed a significant reduction in the amplitude of stimulus-evoked field potential responses recorded lateral to the lesion as compared to medial recording sites. Our data provide further evidence that spatially restricted developmental alterations of cortical morphology cause functional changes in surrounding and histologically normal areas that need to be considered for a better understanding of the resulting pathophysiology.
