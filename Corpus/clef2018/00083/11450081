Changes in cerebral blood flow as measured by HMPAO SPECT in patients following spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage. Lack of an effective treatment for spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is partly because the mechanism of neuronal damage in ICH is not fully understood. Animal experiments have shown that there is a zone of ischaemia and oedema around the haematoma which can be reduced by early evacuation of the mass lesion. We set out to study Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) changes in patients with ICH. We present data on 13 patients (mean age 60). SPECT scans were performed within 48 hours of ictus and 4-7 days later. Four patients had surgical evacuation of the clot 9 were managed conservatively. The ratio of uptake of the isotope in the cerebral hemisphere containing the haematoma to the isotope uptake in the contra-lateral (un-affected) cerebral hemisphere was taken as an index of perfusion of the affected cerebral hemisphere. The perfusion index of the affected hemisphere improved between the first and the second scans in all the surgically treated patients
