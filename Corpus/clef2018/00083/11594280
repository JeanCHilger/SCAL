Clinical value of positron emission tomography (PET) in the diagnosis of bone and soft tissue tumors. 3rd Interdisciplinary Consensus Conference "PET in Oncology": results of the Bone and Soft Tissue Study Group. In the framework of the 3rd Consensus Conference "PET in Oncology" the bone and soft-tissue tumors study group evaluated the present position of PET for these tumor entities on the basis of international publications.After a systematic review of the literature, publications were evaluated according to previously defined quality criteria. For various indications the clinical usefulness of PET was assessed using a classification system.Most studies had been performed with a small number of patients (n < 35). Therefore, only 8 of 46 publications were judged relevant. On the basis of these literature data, use of FDG-PET for grading was classified 1b (literature results predominantly show clinical usefulness). As before (1995/97), all other indications were categorized with 3 (assessment not yet possible, literature data inadequate).According to the opinion of experts, the detection of osseous metastases of Ewing's sarcoma, therapy monitoring and the diagnosis of recurrences are potentially useful clinical indications for FDG-PET. Therefore, prospective studies with large patient groups are essential to further evaluate the benefit of FDG-PET in these indications.
