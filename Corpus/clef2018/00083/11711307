IBOX(2-(4'-dimethylaminophenyl)-6-iodobenzoxazole): a ligand for imaging amyloid plaques in the brain. It is well known that overproduction and accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in the brain is a key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously it was demonstrated that [125I]TZDM, 2-(4'-dimethylaminophenyl)-6-iodobenzothiazole, a thioflavin derivative, was an effective ligand with good in vitro and in vivo binding characteristics. To further improve the initial uptake and washout rate from the brain, important properties for in vivo imaging agents, a novel radioiodinated ligand, 2-(4'-dimethylaminophenyl)-6-iodobenzoxazole ([125I]IBOX, 3), for detecting Abeta plaques in the brain, was synthesized and evaluated. The new iodinated ligand, IBOX, is based on an isosteric replacement of a sulfur atom of TZDM by an oxygen, by which the molecular weight is reduced while the lipophilicity of the iodinated ligand is increased. Partition coefficients (P.C.) of these two ligands were 70 and 124 for TZDM and IBOX, respectively. In vitro binding study indicated that the isosteric displacement yielded a new ligand with equal binding potency to Abeta(1-40) aggregates (K(i) = 1.9 and 0.8 nM for TZDM and IBOX, respectively). Autoradiography of postmortem brain sections of a confirmed AD patient by [125I]IBOX showed excellent labeling of plaques similar to that observed with [125I]TZDM. More importantly, in vivo biodistribution of [125I]IBOX in normal mice displayed superior peak brain uptake (2.08% at 30 min vs 1.57% at 60 min dose/brain for [125I]IBOX and [125I]TZDM, respectively). In addition, the washout from the brain was much faster for [125I]IBOX as compared to [125I]TZDM. Based on the data presented for [125I]IBOX, it is predicted that the brain trapping of this new radioiodinated ligand in the Abeta containing regions will be more favorable than that of the parent compound, [125I]TZDM. Further evaluation of [125I]IBOX is warranted to confirm the Abeta plaque labeling properties in vivo.
