It was significantly higher in 5-14 year old than in other age groups and in males than in females (p <0.0009). Cases occurred round the year. Almost 96 percent cases (206/215) gave history of animal exposure, 13 days to 10 years (median 60 days) before hospitalization. Majority (195/206) had class III exposure. Animals involved were stray dog (193/206 = 90 percent), pet dog, cat, jackal, mongoose, monkey and fox. Most of cases were never vaccinated (78 percent) or inadequately vaccinated (22 percent) only 1 percent each received appropriate wound treatment, or rabies immunoglobulin.Rabies is a major public health problem in Delhi.
