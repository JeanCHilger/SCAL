Gender differences in cerebral glucose metabolism: a PET study. Some studies have examined gender differences in brain function based on cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolism by using positron emission tomography (PET). However, the findings of these studies are controversial and most of them were analyzed by the regions of interest (ROIs) method. Here, we evaluated gender differences of cerebral glucose metabolism under the resting state in a voxel-based analysis.We studied 44 healthy volunteers (22 females, 63.0+/-6.3 years, and 22 males, 63.1+/-8.4 years). Cerebral glucose metabolic images were obtained with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and PET. All individual data were transformed to standard brain space and the male and female groups were compared using statistical parametric mapping (SPM).The males had significantly higher glucose metabolism in the right insula, middle temporal gyrus, and medial frontal lobe than the females. Glucose metabolism in the hypothalamus was significantly higher in females than in males. There was a significant correlation between aging and glucose metabolism in the left thalamus in males and in the left caudate nucleus and hypothalamus in females. In males, but not females, there was a significant asymmetry between the bilateral hemispheres.We found that there were obvious gender differences in regional cerebral glucose metabolism and this is the first report of higher glucose metabolism in the hypothalamus in females than in males.
