Motor recovery after stroke: lessons from functional brain imaging. Several theories have been proposed to explain recovery from stroke. Functional brain imaging offers an opportunity to evaluate these theories and visualize recovery after stroke. Functional brain imaging has proven to be an effective tool to map brain areas activated during a specific task. This paradigm can extend our understanding of the mechanisms of motor recovery after stroke. Functional brain imaging tools such as functional MRI, PET, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, and transcranial magnetic stimulation can be used to evaluate motor activation after stroke. Functional imaging is proving useful in identifying areas, pathways and mechanisms involved in motor recovery after stroke. Studies have shown changes in motor organization with rehabilitation. Functional brain imaging may assist in the selection of rehabilitation methods that best foster recovery.
