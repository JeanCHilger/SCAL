Determination of bisphenol A in canned pet foods. Bisphenol A (BPA) contamination of canned foods for human use has been studied, but there are no reports concerning BPA contamination of canned pet foods. The purpose of this study was to identify the levels of BPA in canned pet foods. A total of 26 samples (15 samples of cat food and 11 samples of dog food) were prepared for analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography. BPA in the samples was extracted with acetonitrile and fat in the sample extract was removed with hexane. Solid-phase extraction was used for sample clean-up prior to final analysis. The concentration of BPA ranged from 13 to 136 ng/g in canned cat food and from 11 to 206 ng/g in dog food. Also, to confirm that the BPA had originated from the can coating, distilled water was added to each washed empty can and the cans were autoclaved at 121 degrees C for 30 min. The concentration of BPA leached from empty cans was between 7 and 31 ng/ml.
