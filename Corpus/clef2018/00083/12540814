Multimodality image fusion in dose escalation studies of brain tumors. This article examines the utility of integrating images from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for radiation treatment planning of brain tumors for dose escalation studies. The information obtained from these imaging modalities is complementary to each other and could provide anatomic (through CT and MRI) and metabolic (through SPECT) information of the target. This anato-metabolic target localization could be expected to facilitate precise radiation therapy planning for brain tumors by delineating the boundary between the tumor, edema, and the normal brain parenchyma and identify the viable tumor nidus with greater degree of certainty. This could in turn lead to minimize dose to the normal tissue and permit dose escalation to the region of interest. The utility of these anato-metabolic imaging modalities for defining the clinical target volumes along with planning target volumes for different phases of the radiation therapy is illustrated.
