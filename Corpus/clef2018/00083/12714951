Gallium scan in adolescents and children with Hodgkin's disease (HD). Treatment response assessment and prognostic value. The aim of the present paper is to describe the accuracy of gallium ((67)Ga) scintigraphy in adolescents and children with Hodgkin's disease (HD). We have studied the diagnostic value of this nuclear imaging technique at disease presentation (staging) and its prognostic value based on changes in (67)Ga uptake observed after treatment (response assessment).From April 1985 to July 1999 74 consecutive untreated patients with a median age of 13 y underwent (67)Ga scans 48-72 h after injection of 37-111 MBq of (67)Ga-citrate. Planar whole-body scintigraphy was performed, supplemented with single photon emission tomography (SPET) of the mediastinum from 1996 onwards. Three patients did not undergo further scintigraphic examination because they were treated with radical surgery. After the 1st examination 71 of the 74 patients were monitored by 1-3 (67)Ga scans during the course of their disease. All of them had at least one (67)Ga scintigraphy at the end of the induction phase of chemotherapy, before any other therapeutic regimens were planned.At disease presentation (67)Ga scintigraphy was positive in all patients, detecting 285 of 335 (85.0%) lymph nodal sites of disease. The best sensitivity was observed in the mediastinum (100% 63/63) and the laterocervical supraclavicular region (85.6%Our data demonstrate the high value of (67)Ga scintigraphy in HD staging in paediatric patients. In addition, evaluation of the (67)Ga uptake is very useful as a prognostic parameter changes in (67)Ga uptake after therapy indicate a favourable prognosis, whereas children still positive on post-treatment (67)Ga scintigrams should be given more aggressive treatment.
