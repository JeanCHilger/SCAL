Association of myocardial viability on nitrate-augmented technetium-99m hexakis-2-methoxylisobutyl isonitrile myocardial tomography and intermediate-term outcome in patients with prior myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction. Seventy-eight patients with prior myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction who underwent nitrate-augmented myocardial tomography were followed for 23 +/- 14 months. Event-free survival was 100% in 34 patients with myocardial viability who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and 53% in those who received medical therapy (p = 0.0008). Of the 44 patients without myocardial viability, event-free survival was not significantly different between patients who underwent CABG and those who received medical therapy (96% vs 90%, p = NS).
