Multicenter study of occipital lobe epilepsy in childhood: clinical characteristics. We investigated the clinical characteristics of 54 patients with childhood onset occipital lobe epilepsy (OLE). There were 25 patients of symptomatic OLE (cortical dysplasia, post encephalitis or encephalopathy, brain tumor and so on), and 29 cases of cryptogenic OLE. Eighteen patients had positive visual symptoms such as flash light, bright spots and sparks of light, 23 patients had negative ones such as scotoma, hemianopia and amaurosis and 10 patients had other complicated visual symptoms such as change of the shape or colors. Young children complained of simple visual phenomena. The youngest patient who could explain visual symptom was 3 years old. All 3 patients with visual field defects had cortical dysplasia in occipital lobe. Ictal SPECT study showed wide hyperperfusion areas in the temporo-parieto-occipital lobe in most of patients with abnormal MRI findings. CBZ and VPA were prescribed in most cases, and were effective in 65% and 60% of the patients, respectively. Seizure prognosis was relatively good. Seizures disappeared in 56% of the patients with symptomatic OLE and 79% of those with cryptogenic OLE.
