Anxiety, emotion and cerebral blood flow. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by the xenon inhalation technique using a DSPECT system, during neutral and emotional auditory stimulations. Subjects were 10 high and 10 low trait anxiety, right-handed females. State anxiety was retrospectively assessed. Results indicated a lower rCBF in the high trait or state anxiety subjects who presented also a global rCBF asymmetry in the right > left direction. Additionally, the emotional content of the stimuli interacted significantly with the side of the brain in the thalamic area.
