The influence of acetazolamide on cerebral low-flow regions in migraine--an interictal 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT study. Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, has proved to be useful in the assessment of "vasodilatory capacity" in cerebrovascular disease. To obtain further information on the nature of interictal low-flow regions in migraine, we reinvestigated 20 asymptomatic patients suffering from migraine with aura (n = 15) or without aura (n = 5) and who had either minor (n = 12) or marked (n = 8) regional hypoperfusion when examined in a previous 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT investigation. These patients received acetazolamide IV prior to tracer application. In 14/20 cases regional hypoperfusion resolved. Three patients with migraine with aura had less pronounced regional hypoperfusion compared to baseline. No change in baseline hypoperfusion was detectable in three older patients. No further decreases in flow were measured. In contrast to patients with cerebrovascular ischemia, in whom acetazolamide usually enhances low-flow regions, vasodilatory capacity appears intact in most migraine patients with interictal regional hypoperfusion. Thus, the "acetazolamide test" might be useful in the differential diagnosis of migraine with aura from transient cerebrovascular ischemia.
