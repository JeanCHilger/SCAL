Fundic accommodation assessed by SPECT scanning: comparison with the gastric barostat. Recently, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning was described as a non-invasive technique to assess fundic accommodation. However, in contrast with the barostat, no intragastric distending force is applied during SPECT scanning. We hypothesised that in the absence of a barostat balloon, SPECT scanning largely detects the volume effect of the ingested meal and is a rather insensitive tool to detect fundic relaxation.After an overnight fast, healthy volunteers underwent a barostat study and SPECT scanning on two separate days to assess: (1) meal induced fundic accommodation (Nutridrink, 200 ml, 300 kcal) and (2) gastric relaxation to 1 mg intravenous glucagon.Fasting fundic volumes (145 (8) v 280 (32) ml p=0.001) and average postprandial volume (329 (10) v 571 (53) mlSPECT scanning detects changes in postprandial volume but is less suitable than the gastric barostat in detecting changes in gastric tone. Our study therefore questions its role as a tool to detect impaired accommodation and warrants further validation of this technique.
