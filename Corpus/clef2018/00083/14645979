Metabolic significance of the pattern, intensity and kinetics of 18F-FDG uptake in malignant pleural mesothelioma. Malignant pleural mesothelioma is an aggressive neoplasm with a highly variable course. This pilot study evaluated the significance of the pattern, intensity and kinetics of 18F-FDG uptake in mesothelioma in the context of histopathology and surgical staging.Sixteen consecutive patients with pleural disease on CT scan underwent 18F-FDG imaging. Imaging was performed with a dual detector gamma camera operating in coincidence mode. Semiquantitative image analysis was performed by obtaining lesion-to-background ratios (18F-FDG uptake index) and calculating the increment of 18F-FDG lesion uptake over time (malignant metabolic potential index (MMPi)).Twelve patients had histologically proven malignant mesotheliomas (10 epithelial, two sarcomatoid). Thirty two lesions were positive for tumour. Patterns of uptake matched the extent of pleural and parenchymal involvement observed on CT scanning and surgery. Mean (SD) 18F-FDG uptake index for malignant lesions was 3.99 (1.92), range 1.5-9.46. Extrathoracic spread and metastases had higher 18F-FDG uptake indices (5.17 (2)) than primary (3.42 (1.52)) or nodal lesions (2.99 (1)). No correlation was found between histological grade and stage. The intensity of lesion uptake had poor correlation with histological grade but good correlation with surgical stage. 18F-FDG lesion uptake increased over time at a higher rate in patients with more advanced disease. The MMPi was a better predictor of disease aggressiveness than the histological grade.This pilot study suggests that the pattern, intensity, and kinetics of 18F-FDG uptake in mesothelioma are good indicators of tumour aggressiveness and are superior to the histological grade in this regard.
