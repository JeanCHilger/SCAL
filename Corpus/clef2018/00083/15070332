Fabrication and characterization of thin films of single-walled carbon nanotube bundles on flexible plastic substrates. A convenient method to obtain patterns of films of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) bundles on flexible plastic is described. Using the Line Patterning method SWNT films of thickness ranging from approximately 300-1500 nm can be obtained from aqueous surfactant-supported dispersions of chemically purified SWNT bundles synthesized by the pulsed-laser ablation method. These films are strongly adherent and are competitive in performance with commercially available films of indium-tin-oxide (ITO) on plastics. For example, an approximately 1500 thick film of SWNT on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) shows a surface resisitvity of approximately 80 Omega/sq, optical transparency >80%, and robust flexibility. Unlike ITO/PET, films of SWNT/PET can be folded and bent to a crease without cracking. The simple techniques involoved in obtaining these films (i.e., those without requiring lithography or ink-jet printing) could help facilitate the rapid fabrication of transparent, flexible electronic devices, heralding what promises to be a new approach towards the development of next-generation optoelectronic devices.
