Diagnostic imaging for pancreatic cancer: computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) are sophisticated modalities typically used in the second-line diagnosis following routine clinical practice. Among them, CT is regarded as the standard imaging in diagnosing pancreatic cancer at present in Japan due to its popularity and reasonable reliability in wide-ranging diagnostic ability. However, even with multidetector row CT (MDCT), the demonstration of pancreatic cancer less than 1 cm in size remains nearly impossible. CT staging is considered accurate in one-half to two-thirds of patients, but limitations in the imaging of peripancreatic microinvasion and nodal or hepatic micrometastases still have a tendency to underestimate tumor extension. With recent advancement in imaging techniques, MRI has proven to be equal or superior to other imaging modalities in diagnosing pancreatic cancer. Most of all, it is expected that MRCP will become as effective an instrument as ultra-sonography (US) in the screening of pancreatic cancer. Functional imaging with PET using the glucose analog FDG can be used in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, but systemic or local disturbance of glucose metabolism may result in an incorrect diagnosis. The usefulness of PET is now considered in assessing tumor viability, monitoring tumor response to treatment, and detecting distant metastases.
