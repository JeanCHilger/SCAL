Childhood adrenocortical tumours. Childhood adrenocortical tumours (ACT) constitute only about 0.2% of all paediatric malignancies. However, the incidence of ACT varies across geographic regions and is remarkably high in southern Brazil. At presentation, most children show signs and symptoms of virilisation, which may be accompanied by manifestations of the hypersecretion of other adrenal cortical hormones. Fewer than 10% of patients with ACT show no endocrine syndrome at presentation these are often older children and adolescents. ACT is commonly associated with constitutional genetic abnormalities, particularly mutations of the P53 gene. Histological features are used to classify the tumours as adenomas or carcinomas
