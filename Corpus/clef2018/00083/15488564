PET imaging in gynecologic malignancies. FDG-PET has a definite role in detecting lymph node involvement and distant metastases. It has also shown encouraging results in assessing tumor recurrence and restaging, but further studies are required before FDG-PET can be incorporated in routine clinical practice for diagnosis of recurrence. In ovarian cancer, FDG-PET has high sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients with recurrent tumor, but lesion localization is difficult with PET. Normal FDG activity in the gastrointestinal tract and bladder may obscure some lesions. Combined PET/CT can help in localizing lesions and differentiating between pathologic and physiologic uptake in the pelvis and abdomen.
