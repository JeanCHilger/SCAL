The way to a man's heart is through his stomach: much 'diaphragmatic' attenuation is likely gastric, and effervescent granules enhance cardiac imaging. Avoidance of falsely positive results depends on distinguishing reality from artifact, in turn depending on images of highest quality. In radionuclide cardiac imaging, an inferior wall artifactual defect, so called "diaphragmatic attenuation", is particularly common and vexing. Despite the historically held view, analysis and review of the literature suggest the defect is likely not diaphragmatic but rather primarily due to attenuation by nearby stomach wall. The explanation is based on gravity and anatomy. With this improved understanding, effervescent granules were given as a clinical, nonresearch measure to nine patients during myocardial scanning. It was observed that two-thirds demonstrated moderate or marked lessening of attenuation. An additional benefit is lessening of artifact by extracardiac activity. These benefits may also apply to other sorts of cardiac radionuclide imaging. The significance of this new imaging method is discussed and various avenues of research are proposed.
