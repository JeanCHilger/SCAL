Biochemical diagnosis, localization and management of pheochromocytoma: focus on multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 in relation to other hereditary syndromes and sporadic forms of the tumour. Approximately 50% of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A or 2B develop pheochromocytoma. These tumours are almost exclusively benign and localized in the adrenal glands. About one-third are bilateral at initial diagnosis. Amongst patients with pheochromocytoma, those with MEN 2A have subtler symptoms compared to those with sporadic disease. Since pheochromocytomas in patients with MEN 2 often secrete catecholamines episodically (but metabolize them continuously to metanephrines), the first choice for biochemical diagnosis is the measurement of free metanephrines in plasma, with urinary fractionated metanephrines being the second choice. In patients with pheochromocytomas that produce exclusively normetanephrine, MEN 2 can be excluded. In patients with biochemically proven MEN 2-related pheochromocytoma, anatomical imaging of the adrenals (with either computerized tomography or magnetic resonance) should be obtained next. Functional imaging with specific ligands (e.g. scintigraphy with [(123)I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine or, if available, positron emission tomography with [(18)F]-fluorodopamine, [(18)F]-dihydroxyphenylalanine, [(11)C]-adrenaline or [(11)C]-hydroxyephedrine) may then be particularly useful in patients with distorted anatomy from previous surgery, in cases of equivocal biochemical data despite high clinical suspicion for a tumour, to rule out multifocal disease, or where there is suspicion of metastatic disease (e.g. tumours larger than 5 cm). Laparoscopic surgery is the treatment of choice and subtotal (cortical-sparing) adrenalectomy is the procedure of choice in bilateral pheochromocytomas.
