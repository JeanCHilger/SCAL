Improving 3D PET imaging by restoration: a phantom study. The main objective of our work is to improve 3D PET imaging. Compared with 2D PET, 3D PET imaging has slightly worse axial resolution and a significantly higher contribution of scatter and randoms, but 3D PET has much better sensitivity than 2D PET imaging. A Jaszczak deluxe phantom was acquired in 3D mode on our GE Advance PET system. Activity of 333 MBq of 18F was uniformly distributed. Prior to the emission scan, blank and transmission scans had been acquired. They were used for attenuation correction. The duration of the emission scan was 20 min, transmission 10 min, and blank 20 min. Standard FBP reconstruction software provided by the vendor was used to obtain slice images. Point spread function was also acquired in a 21 cm diameter cylinder phantom filled with water 6.0 cm from the center and used to create restoration filters. Two restoration filters were applied, medium and sharp. Results showed significant improvement in resolution, contrast and detectability of the cold rods. The artifacts outside the phantom were also significantly reduced. For 11.1 mm rods, average contrast was 0.49+/-0.02 in the original image, 0.52+/-0.04 in the medium restored image, and in the sharply restored image 0.75+/-0.05. For 7.9 mm rods, average contrast was 0.07+/-0.01 in the original image, 0.21+/-0.03 in the medium restored image, and 0.50+/-0.04 in the sharply restored image. The amount of noise in the uniform slices, measured as the coefficient of variation (COV), was 5.5, 7.1 and 10.8% in the original image and in the images restored with medium and sharp filters, respectively. In conclusion, restoration can significantly improve the resolution and contrast of 3D PET imaging.
