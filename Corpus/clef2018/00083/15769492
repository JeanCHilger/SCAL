Activation in the MT-complex during visual perception of apparent motion and temporal succession. Previous studies have shown that MT (i.e., the MT-complex) is activated during visual perception of apparent motion. To further explore the function of MT, we measured activation in MT by positron emission tomography (PET) using a broad range of stroboscopic stimulus events in which (a) the frame rate was so fast that observers perceived stimulus frames as simultaneous, (b) the frame rate was slower and generated compelling impressions of apparent motion, or (c) the frame rate was so slow that observers perceived temporal succession (successive views of the same objects at different locations) instead of motion. As expected, the simultaneity condition showed no activation (reliable increase in regional cerebral blood flow, rCBF) in MT whereas the motion condition showed activation in both left and right MT. However, the succession condition showed even stronger activation in left and right MT than did the motion condition. MT seems implicated in perception of retinal stimuli as successive views of the same object at different locations whether or not the views are connected by apparent motion.
