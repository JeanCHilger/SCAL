Low back pain in physical education teachers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors related to occupational low back pain (LBP) occurring in male physical education teachers (PET). The location was set in Athens and we used questionnaires to collect information. Analysis revealed that the prevalence of LBP during the survey was 63%. The correlation of personal factors and LBP showed that the prevalence of LBP was significantly higher in those PET (odds ratio, 2.5) who answered yes to the item "no personal training" than in the PET who did not. Moreover, many occupational factors are related to LBP. These were the items "lifting gym instruments" (odds ratio, 2.6) and "helping students into flexing posture" (odds ratio, 3.0). From the working conditions it was confirmed that the PET (odds ratio, 2.5) who "spent more than 35 hours per week in teaching physical education" were correlated with LBP. Our results suggest that PET, under the current working condition, are vulnerable to low back pain. An improvement of these conditions must be taken into account in order to prevent LBP.
