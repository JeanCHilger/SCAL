Positron-emitting isotopes produced on biomedical cyclotrons. This review will discuss the production and applications of positron-emitting radionuclides for use in Positron Emission Tomography (PET), with emphasis on radionuclides that can be produced onsite with a biomedical cyclotron. In PET the traditional radionuclides of choice are (11)C, (113)N, (15)O and (18)F and although they will be briefly discussed in this article, the emphasis of this review will be on 'non-standard' PET radionuclides that are generating increased interest by the medical research community.
