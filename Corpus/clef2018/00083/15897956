Neuroimaging and therapeutics in movement disorders. In this review, we discuss the role of neuroimaging in assessing treatment options for movement disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD). Imaging methods to assess dopaminergic function have recently been applied in trials of potential neuroprotective agents. Other imaging methods using regional metabolism and/or cerebral perfusion have been recently introduced to quantify the modulation of network activity as an objective marker of the treatment response. Both imaging strategies have provided novel insights into the mechanisms underlying a variety of pharmacological and stereotaxic surgical treatment strategies for PD and other movement disorders.
