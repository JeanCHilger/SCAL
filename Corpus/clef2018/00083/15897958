Neuroimaging of epilepsy: therapeutic implications. Neuroimaging has important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with seizures and epilepsy. Having replaced computed tomography (CT) in many situations, MRI is the preferred imaging technique for patients with epilepsy. Advances in radionuclide-based techniques such as single-photon emission CT/positron emission tomography and electromagnetic source imaging with magnetoencephalography are providing new insights into the pathophysiology of epilepsy. In addition, techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy are beginning to impact treatment. In this review, I discuss how these techniques are used in clinical practice but more importantly, how imaging findings play an increasing role in neurotherapeutics.
