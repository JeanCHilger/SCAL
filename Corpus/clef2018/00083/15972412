Lung cancer screening experience: a retrospective review of PET in 22 non-small cell lung carcinomas detected on screening chest CT in a high-risk population. The objective of our study was to retrospectively review the PET results of non-small cell lung carcinomas detected on screening chest CT in a high-risk population.PET findings were negative in 32% of the cases of non-small cell carcinomas that were detected on screening CT in a high-risk patient population. These tumors were small, low-grade, or both. The most common histology was bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma. The role of PET in evaluating screening-detected indeterminate nodules in a high-risk population may be more limited than in a general population.
