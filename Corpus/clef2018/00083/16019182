Significance of fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging in the diagnosis of malignancies in patients with biliary stricture. This study was performed to evaluate the significance of positron emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) in diagnosing malignancy in patients with biliary stricture by comparing the sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET with those of CT scans and cytological examination of the bile.Thirty patients who underwent FDG-PET for differential diagnosis of the disease causing biliary stricture were included in this study. The sites of the strictures were as follows: in the intrahepatic bile duct in five patients, in the peripheral extrahepatic bile duct in 17 patients, and in the distal extrahepatic bile duct in eight patients. The sensitivity and specificity (%) of FDG-PET in diagnosing malignancies were evaluated and compared with those of CT scans and cytological examination using obtained bile. Final diagnoses were based on surgical or biopsy findings. Data was collected and analysed in a retrospective fashion.Malignant diseases were diagnosed in 21 patients, as follows: cholangiocarcinoma including Klatskin tumour in 10 patients, gallbladder cancer in eight, duodenal and ampulla cancer in two, and pancreatic cancer in one. In diagnosing malignancy in patients with biliary stricture, overall sensitivity and specificity were 85.7 (18/21) and 55.6 (5/9), respectively, for CT, 64.7 (11/17) and 100 (7/7), respectively, for cytological examination of the bile, and 90.5 (19/21) and 77.8 (7/9), respectively, for FDG-PET.In diagnosing malignant diseases in patients with biliary stricture, FDG-PET was superior to CT examination in both sensitivity and specificity, and superior to cytological examination of the bile in sensitivity. However, in patients with inflammatory disease, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholecystitis, false positive rates were found. Therefore, a multidisciplinary diagnostic approach using FDG-PET in conjunction with conventional modalities seems essential to a precise differential diagnosis.
