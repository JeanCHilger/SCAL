A pre-task resting condition neither 'baseline' nor 'zero'. This study introduce the comparison of a 'reference state' versus a resting condition (zero), defined upon normative developmental equations. We compared pre-task 'resting' data from healthy individuals with the Normative Cuban digital resting EEG-database recently calculated for VARETA (qEEG/VARETA). The results allowed us to state that a 'pre-task resting conditions' exists as a state beyond the 'zero' or 'baseline' condition. The pre-task 'resting' condition is never truly 'at rest', however most of the previous published fMRI/PET studies assumed such a pre-task condition as reference/baseline condition. By defining different 'resting states' by qEEG/VARETA analyses, we have a potential methodology which can define resting state conditions and to be sure that they are consistent when comparing within group analyses across tasks or between groups either void of task or for task specific conditions.
