Pelvic malignancy: integrating form and function. Despite the essential role morphological imaging plays in the management of patients with malignancy, anatomical techniques are limited in their ability to report on tumour biology and behaviour. It has therefore been necessary to develop imaging techniques that integrate form and function to probe the micro and molecular environments of cancers. The role of clinical functional and molecular magnetic resonance imaging is discussed with an emphasis on pelvic malignancy. It is argued that the radiological sciences need to take a lead in translating molecular and functional imaging techniques into man. Imaging in support of drug development is suggested as a focus for that development.
