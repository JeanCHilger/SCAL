Effects of fenoverine on biliary kinetics evaluated by hepatobiliary scintigraphy with 99mTc-Br-IDA. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy was used to evaluate the action of fenoverine in 16 patients suffering from dyskinesia of the biliary tract the drug was administered in doses of 300 mg per day per os for 20 days, the patients being subjected to hepatobiliary scintigraphy before and after treatment. The following parameters--accurate indicators of the motor coordination of the biliary tract--were evaluated: tracer appearance time in the gallbladder (Tc) and in the intestine (Ti). After treatment there was a normalization of these two parameters which initially were extended. Statistical analysis showed a highly significant reduction in these times. Stress is laid on the importance of hepatobiliary scintigraphy in the diagnosis of biliary dyskinesia and on the effectiveness of fenoverine in the treatment of this conditions.
