Improved separation methods for the recovery of (82)Sr from irradiated targets. (82)Rb is a short-lived positron-emitting isotope (T(1/2)=75 s) that is increasingly being used in PET to study blood flow through the heart and brain. This isotope is supplied to physicians in the form of a generator where the parent isotope, (82)Sr, is immobilized onto an ion exchange column allowing the (82)Rb to be eluted with isotonic saline as required. (82)Sr is manufactured by the proton irradiation of molybdenum, rubidium chloride or rubidium metal targets followed by complex separations to recover the (82)Sr. A number of inorganic ion exchange materials were evaluated for their ability to remove (82)Sr from simulated target solutions and compared with currently used organic ion exchange resins. Sodium nonatitanate was identified as a replacement for current resins as a potential material that would simplify target processing and improve the yield of (82)Sr from each target.
