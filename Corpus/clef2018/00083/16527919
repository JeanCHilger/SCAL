Use of inhaled medications to treat respiratory diseases in dogs and cats. Noninfectious disorders of the respiratory tract, including laryngitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, and asthma are common problems in dogs and cats. Traditional therapies have often included corticosteroids and bronchodilators given by mouth or injection. Side effects of this form of treatment can be severe and can result in cessation of therapy. Inhaled corticosteroid drugs are not as absorbed into the systemic circulation, do not result in significant side effects, and are now the standard of care for dogs and cats with respiratory diseases that would otherwise be treated with systemic medications.
