Peritoneal transport properties for glucose and creatinine in Polish children and adolescents on chronic peritoneal dialysis. The mode of PD treatment is dependent on the individual transport properties of the peritoneal membrane. Two multicentre trials performed in the U.S. (PPDSC) and Europe (MEPPS) have established reference curves for solute equilibration in children performed with the use of 1100 ml/m2 fill volume in the former and 1000 ml/m2 in the latter study.Assessment of basal peritoneal membrane equilibration based on PET tests in polish children and adolescents treated with chronic peritoneal dialysis.58 PET tests from patients treated at 8 Polish PD centres were analysed. The mean time of performing PET test was 6,5 months after the start of PD therapy. All of the patients had been peritonitis free from onset. The mean fill volume was 1021 (906-1170) ml/m2.Based on the results of creatinine and glucose equilibration we established basal peritoneal solute transport curves for polish PD children using an average fill volume of 1020 ml/m2. The following values were obtained at 4hrs of dwell time for 2.27% glucose solution: D/P for creatinine = 0.68 +/- 0.15 and D/Do for glucose = 0.39 +/- 0.12.The DIP creatinine equilibration curves were similar to the previously published reference curves for children, whereas those for glucose was significantly lower. Using a fill volume scaled to body surface area of 1020 ml/m2 equilibration curves for glucose and creatinine are similar in children over 1 year of age and adults.
