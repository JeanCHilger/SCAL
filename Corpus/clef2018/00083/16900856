Clinical guidelines for the management of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) has been revolutioned by the recently discovered molecular mechanism responsible for the oncogenesis of this disease. In addition, due to the rapid progress at molecular and clinical level observed in the last few years, there is a need to review the current state of the art in order to delineate appropriate guidelines for the optimal management of these tumors. A panel of experts from several specialities, including medical oncology, surgery, pathology, molecular biology and imaging, were invited to participate in a meeting to present and discuss a number of pre-selected questions, and to achieve a consensus according to the categories of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the Standard Options Recommandations (SOR) of the French Federation of Cancer Centers. Generally, consensus points were from categories 2A of the NCCN and B2 of the SOR. Conventional histologic examination with immunohistochemistry for CD117, CD34, SMA, S-100 and desmin is considered standard. Molecular analysis for the identification of KIT and PDGFRA mutation may be indicated in CD117-negative GIST. Complete tumor resection with negative margins is the optimal surgical treatment. Adjuvant imatinib should be considered an experimental approach. Neoadjuvant imatinib is also experimental, although its use may be justified in unresectable or marginally resectable GIST. Imatinib should be started in metastatic or recurrent disease, and should be continued until progressive disease or drug intolerance. In these cases, sunitinib can be used. The optimal criteria for the assessment and monitoring of GIST undergoing imatinib therapy are not well known, but they should include reduction in tumor size and disease stabilization, as well as reduction of tumor density on CT scan and metabolic activity on PET scan.
