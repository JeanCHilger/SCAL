Lung cancer: is there a place for elective nodal irradiation?. The use of conformal radiotherapy in lung cancer has considerably evolved with the advent of improved staging technologies and methods of radiation delivery. Patients with limited disease, inoperable for medical reasons, may be treated with conformal radiotherapy alone patients with more advanced disease are treated with combined chemo-radiotherapy. If local control may be improved by radiotherapy dose escalation according to several studies, toxicity and more particularly pulmonary toxicity seems to be related to radiation volume. Thus the use of elective nodal irradiation is being questioned. Data for early stage (stage I) non-small-cell lung cancer treated with conformal radiotherapy or stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy strongly supports the use of smaller fields that do not incorporate elective nodal regions
