Promoting evidence-based practice: an internship for staff nurses. Implementing evidence-based practice is a complex but valued process that requires support for nurses to make it a reality in care delivery. To address this, an Evidence-Based Practice Staff Nurse Internship was developed at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in the United States.The objective of this internship is to promote use of evidence by staff nurses to improve patient outcomes. Through a competitive application process, six nurses are accepted in each cohort. The program provides didactic content and dedicated work time on topics interns select (e.g., family pet visitation, sedation management, bowel sounds assessment, guided imagery, family transition to pediatric floor). Interns receive paid clinical release time for participating.Teams include the staff nurse, the nurse manager, and an advanced practice nurse. Responsibilities for each step are assigned to the person with the appropriate expertise.Interns report understanding the process, appreciate the opportunity for professional growth, and report their objectives are being met. Participants evaluated the program very positively and also provided recommendations for revision (e.g., revising class content). The program resulted in improved quality of care such as increased patient and family satisfaction, decreased length of stay, and cost savings.Programs that support practitioners through the evidence-based practice process are needed for use in a variety of settings internationally. This unique program supports staff nurses in making evidence-based practice a reality for their work and patients and might be transferable across settings.
