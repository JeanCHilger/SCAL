Photoinduced-electron-transfer chemistry: from studies on PET processes to applications in natural product synthesis. The application of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) for the construction of heterocyclic ring systems is an appealing route in synthetic organic photochemistry. Electronically excited carbonyl chromophors in ketones, aldehydes, amides, or imides are strong electron acceptors that oxidize alkenes, amines, thioethers, or carboxylates. In subsequent steps, the radical anions formed thereof either are operating as secondary electron donors and initiate a photon-driven chain reaction or combine with electrophilic species and form products. These reactions are applied in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. The basic structures of these target molecules are bicyclic tertiary amines from the pyrrolizidine, benzopyrrolizidine, and indolizidine families, cyclic oligopeptides, macrocyclic ring systems, and many more.
