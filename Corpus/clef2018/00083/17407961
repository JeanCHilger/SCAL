The thyroid volume and methods determination. to work-out method of the determination the volume of functioning thyroid tissue on the base of experimental investigations and to appreciate its accuracy. To analyze the clinical results of determination of the volume of the thyroid volume for different clinical groups with the use I123.experimental investigations of the phantoms of different sizes were conducted, and also there were conducted the investigations of the phantoms with different diameters spheres which were inside the phantoms. On the base of conducted investigations there was suggested a method of the determination of the volume functioning thyroid tissue paying attention to the organ sizes and the microtexture of the picture. Summary error of this method with taking into consideration different factors was 7.02%. There were examined 36 patients with different kinds of thyroid diseases and patients of conditionally control group. Every patient was made planar method and SPECT with the use I123.the experimental investigations showed that for the determination of the volume of functioning tissue according SPECT data it should use the variable level of cut out of the background during analyzing the data paying attention to the organ sizes. The clinical investigations pointed out that there were trustworthy differences between signs indices among different clinical groups. Some signs are specifically for cancer, adenoma, Graves' disease. The most volume of nonfunctioning thyroid tissue is at cancer patients.there was worked out the method of determination of volume functioning thyroid tissue according to SPECT data. On the base of the received results there were offered integral indices which can be used for differential diagnose of the thyroid diseases.
