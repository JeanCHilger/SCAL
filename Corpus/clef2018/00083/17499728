Pre vivo, ex vivo and in vivo evaluations of [68Ga]-EDTMP. The objectives of this study were to develop a simple preparation method for [68Ga]-EDTMP and to evaluate the applicability of [68Ga]-EDTMP as a potential positron emission tomography (PET) bone imaging agent using pre vivo, ex vivo and in vivo models.[68Ga]-EDTMP was prepared using 68Ga]-gallium chloride eluted from the 68Ge/68Ga generator and commercially available Multibone kits. Binding affinity to bone compartments was evaluated using a recently established pre vivo model. In vivo (microPET) and ex vivo experiments were performed in mice, and the results of which were compared with those obtained with [18F]-fluoride.[68Ga]-EDTMP was accessible via simple kit preparation and predominantly accumulated in bone tissue in vivo, ex vivo and pre vivo. Binding to mineral bone was irreversible, and low binding was observed in organic bone. In vivo microPET evaluation revealed predominant uptake in bone with renal excretion. Compared with [18F]-fluoride, the uptake was lower and the PET image quality was reduced.From the present evaluation, apart from the autonomy for PET centers without an onsite cyclotron, the advantage of [68Ga]-EDTMP over [18F]-fluoride is not apparent and the future clinical prospect of [68Ga]-EDTMP remains speculative.
