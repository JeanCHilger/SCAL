Positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose in patients with uterine sarcoma. Describe our experience with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), in patients with uterine sarcomas, under suspicion of recurrence and in tumour staging after hysterectomy as an incidental pathology finding.A retrospective review, between april 2002 and january 2006, of FDG-PET performed in 10 patients with clinical diagnosis of uterine sarcoma was made (7 patients under recurrence suspicion and three under initial staging). Mean age was 52.2 yrs. Evolution time after initial diagnosis vary from one month to 15 yrs (median time: 14 months). Lesions were classified as 8 leiomyosarcomas and 2 carcinosarcomas. FIGO staging were establish resulting 5 patients stage I, 1 patient stage III, and 4 patients stage IV.4 of 7 patients under suspicion of recurrence showed discrepancies between positron emission tomography (PET) and conventional imaging techniques (CIT) information. FDG-PET was negative in three cases of non-conclusive CT. PET was negative in one case with pulmonary metastases. The 3 staging studies were concordant both FDG-PET and CIT images. Pathological information was obtained in 5 cases, and a mean time of 14 months of clinical follow up was made.FDG-PET can be useful in the follow up of uterine sarcoma patients, and also when it is an incidental finding in other causes hysterectomy.
