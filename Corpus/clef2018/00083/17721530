Multimodality Chamber for coregistered anatomical and molecular imaging of small animals. Modern imaging methods are applied extensively in translational animal research, and combined analysis of anatomical and functional imaging results is of increasing importance. Many imaging centers handle multiple independent animal colonies and use several imaging modalities, often in combination. The authors have developed and successfully tested a two-piece acrylic Multimodality Chamber that enables investigators to coregister images from two or more modalities, including microMR, microCT, microPET and optical imaging.
