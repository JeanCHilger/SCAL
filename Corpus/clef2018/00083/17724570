Sestamibi scan-directed, minimally invasive video-assisted parathyroidectomy: an effective treatment for solitary parathyroid adenoma. Solitary adenomas have been shown to be responsible for almost 90% of cases of primary hyperparathyroidism.The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of sestamibi scanning pre-operatively to guide minimally invasive video-assisted (MIVA) parathyroidectomy.We reviewed 40 patients who underwent parathyroidectomy between 2003 and 2004. All patients underwent a pre-operative sestamibi scan.Thirty-three (82%) patients had a localized solitary adenoma on sestamibi scan. Of these patients 29 underwent attempted MIVA parathyroidectomy. MIVA parathyroidectomy was successful in 22 patients. When pre-operative sestamibi scanning was correlated with pathological diagnosis it was shown to have a sensitivity of 82% and positive predictive value of 94%.Pre-operative sestamibi scan localization of a parathyroid adenoma offers a 94% positive predictive value for adenoma location. This facilitates MIVA parathyroidectomy to be used effectively to treat primary hyperparathyroidism in the majority of patients.
