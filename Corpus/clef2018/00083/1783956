An exploratory study on the viability and efficacy of a pet-facilitated therapy project within a hospice. In this exploratory study an attempt was made to determine what attitudinal, behavioral, and interactive changes were exhibited by terminally ill patients and their caregivers when a miniature poodle was introduced as a resident at a hospice. Pre-test, post-test, and follow-up phases were conducted, where interviews, observations, and videotape were used to collect data. Over the three phases, 14 patients and 15 staff members were sampled. The resident poodle appeared to facilitate staff-patient interactions, ease patient-visitor relations, and improve staff and patient morale on a situational basis. Patients who felt isolated or alone appeared to have no particular affection for the poodle, contrary to current Pet-Facilitated Therapy theory. Also, it appears that the longest and most frequent behaviors exhibited by both dog and human were those that had a relaxing or comforting effect on the human.
