Linear EUS: the clinical impact of N staging in esophageal carcinoma. This review article focuses on nodal staging of esophageal cancer. Transesophageal endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the most accurate technique for preoperative local-regional staging of esophageal carcinoma (TN staging), once the CT and/or the PET scan have excluded the presence of distant metastasis. EUS guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) helps improve diagnostic accuracy in esophageal cancer lymph node staging. In certain subgroup of patients who present with a number of EUS lymph node criteria, EUS FNA may be avoided without affecting diagnostic accuracy. In tumors of the distal esophagus detection and biopsy of celiac lymph nodes may be successfully performed by EUS and EUS FNA, and important therapeutic decissions may be derived from such a practice.
