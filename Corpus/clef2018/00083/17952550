Relationships among regional diastolic impairment, elongation of global time to peak filling rate, and global diastolic function using ECG-gated myocardial perfusion SPECT in heart failure. The relationships among regional diastolic impairment, the elongation of global time to peak filling rate (g-TPF), and global diastolic function were examined by a novel program using electrocardiography-gated myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (GMPS) in heart failure (HF).Fifteen control subjects and 70 HF patients, New York Heart Association functional classification I (N-1) 41 cases, classification II (N-II) 15 cases, and classification III (N-III) 14 cases, were examined by GMPS. Using the reference mean +2 SD (standard deviation) of g-TPF derived from control group (CG), HF patients were divided into a normal g-TPF group (NG) and elongated g-TPF group (EG). The distributions of g-TPF and regional (r-) TPF were estimated by histograms. The extension of regional diastolic impairment was estimated by the number of r-TPF elongated segments (NES).g-TPF and r-TPF mainly distributed from 100 ms to 220 ms and demonstrated a peak around 150 ms in CG and NG. g-TPF distributed from 240 ms to 560 ms, but r-TPF distributed from 90 ms to 690 ms and demonstrated two peaks around 150 ms and 350 ms in EG. NES significantly correlated with g-TPF (r=0.79, P=6x10(-10) in N-I r=0.69 and P<0.005 in N-IIThe development of regional early diastolic impairment makes g-TPF elongation and induces global dysfunction in early diastole.
