Imaging techniques in multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is an incurable malignancy characterized by the accumulation of neoplastic plasma cells in the bone marrow and osteolytic bone destruction. The imaging techniques play an essential role in the assessment of skeletal involvement, the detection of extramedullary diseases, and the characterization of organ complications. Plain X-rays are routinely used for skeletal surveys however, the sensitivity is not sufficient to detect early osteolytic lesions. New imaging techniques such as multislice computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and whole body positron emission tomography (PET) offer advanced diagnostic accuracy. These imaging modalities allow for more precise staging and contribute to further improvement in the management of this disease.
