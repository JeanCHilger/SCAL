Nuclear medical methods for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer: positron emission tomography. The functional imaging approach of nuclear medicine offers important information for the characterization of a tumor's pathobiology. In oncology, positron emission tomography (PET) especially has had great impact on the staging of tumor patients and the assessment of therapy. Both the development of new, tumor-specific, tracers and the introduction of by software- and hardware-driven image fusion emphasize the potential of this modality for an all-embracing diagnostic modality.
