The use of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for the diagnosis and management of invasive mould infections. There is limited information on the utility of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) for the diagnosis and management of invasive mould infections (IMIs). We retrospectively evaluated patients with IMIs who underwent FDG-PET in our institution (n = 13 December 1999 to April 2004), and reviewed the available literature (n = 9). In 16 non-neutropenic patients with available FDG-PET imaging studies (11 from our institution), FDG-PET revealed an occult IMI site (n = 3
