Synthesis of new carbon-11-labeled carboxamide derivatives as potential PET dopamine D3 receptor radioligands. Carbon-11-labeled carboxamide derivatives, (E)-4-fluoro-N-(4-(4-(2-[(11)C]methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)cinnamoylamide, ([(11)C]3a), (E)-4-chloro-N-(4-(4-(2-[(11)C]methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)cinnamoylamide ([(11)C]3b), (E)-4-bromo-N-(4-(4-(2-[(11)C]methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)cinnamoylamide, ([(11)C]3c), (E)-4-methoxy-N-(4-(4-(2-[(11)C]methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)cinnamoylamide ([(11)C]3d), N-(4-(4-(2-[(11)C]methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)naphthyl-2-carboxamide ([(11)C]BP897, [(11)C]3e), and N-(4-(4-(2-[(11)C]methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)biphenyl-4-carboxamide ([(11)C]3f), have been synthesized as new potential PET radioligands for imaging of dopamine D(3) receptors. The target tracers were prepared by O-[(11)C]methylation of their corresponding precursors using [(11)C]CH(3)OTf and isolated by a simplified solid-phase extraction (SPE) purification procedure in 50-65% radiochemical yields decay corrected to end of bombardment (EOB), 20 min overall synthesis time, and 111-148GBq/micromol specific activity at end of synthesis (EOS).
