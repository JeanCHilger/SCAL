Imaging of abdominal lymphoma. This article discusses the radiologic appearances of solid organ involvement with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the abdominopelvic region. The most common radiologic patterns of involvement are illustrated. The imaging characteristics of lymphomatous involvement of abdominal organs overlap with several other disorders and the specific features pertaining to lymphoma are highlighted. In patients who have known lymphomas, other important management considerations, such as staging, response to therapy, malignant transformation, and identification of recurrent disease, are also discussed. The emerging role of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is briefly outlined.
