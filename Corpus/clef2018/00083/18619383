Imaging of pediatric lymphomas. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) represent 10% to 15% of all malignancies occurring in children younger than 20 years of age. Advances in cross-sectional imaging and the availability of positron emission tomography (PET) and PET-CT have had a major impact on imaging and management of pediatric patients. This article reviews the clinical features of lymphoma, focusing on the spectrum of imaging findings seen in diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of HL and NHL. Pediatric NHL has four major histologic subtypes: Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and lymphoblastic lymphoma. The most important subtype of HL is nodular sclerosis.
