Whole body diffusion weighted imaging: a new era of oncological radiology. Cancer has become the leading cause of mortality in the urban area of China. Whole body diffusion weighted imaging (WB-DWI), also known as virtual positron emission tomography, has gradually become accepted as an image tool in tumor localization, characterization, staging and monitoring response to therapy or tumor recurrence. Our article aimed to summarize the limited initial clinical use of WB-DWI in the referred area, and to analyze the most potential advantage of WB-DWI in therapeutic monitoring and tumor staging. WB-DWI as a highly sensitive, completely non-invasive, well-tolerated and low price technique has a promising furture in tumor assessment. Profound clinical study is necessary for its further application improvement.
