Clinical value of CT guided radiofrequency ablation in treatment of post-operational resectable liver metastatic tumor from colorectal carcinoma. To explore the value of CT guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treatment of post-operational resectable liver metastatic tumors from colorectal carcinoma.Thirty-seven patients with 52 resectable liver metastatic tumors from colorectal carcinoma underwent CT guided RFA. CT, MRI, ultrasonography, and/or PET/CT were conducted after RFA every 2 months. Results of this study were compared with data from literatures about surgical resection applied in liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma.Abdominal bleeding and abdominal infection occurred in 1 patient respectively (2.7%, 1/37). No treatment-induced death occurred. The total complication rate was 5.4%. The median survival time of the patients treated by RFA was 39.8 months. The 3-year survival rate was 42.6%.With the clinical value similar to that of surgical resection, CT guided RFA can be one of the first choices for post-operational resectable liver metastatic tumors from colorectal carcinoma thanks to minimal invasion and low complication rate.
