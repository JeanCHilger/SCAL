The underlying mechanisms of verbal fluency deficit in frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia. Verbal fluency tasks are commonly used to explore semantic memory and executive functions. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying verbal fluency impairment in the frontal variant of frontotemporal dementia (fv-FTD) and in semantic dementia (SD). Semantic and phonemic fluency tasks were performed by 36 fv-FTD and SD patients and 18 elderly controls. We also carried out a neuropsychological investigation of semantic memory, working memory and shifting and updating processes. We performed correlative and regression analyses of fluency scores and neuropsychological data. In addition, patients underwent a resting positron emission tomography examination, and statistical parametric mapping was used to establish correlations between resting-state FDG uptake in the whole brain and fluency scores for each patient group. Both patient groups displayed impaired performances on both fluency tasks compared with controls, but with different patterns. While fv-FTD patients scored higher than SD patients on semantic fluency, their performances on the phonemic task did not differ. Correlation and regression analyses clearly demonstrated that the fv-FTD patients' performances on both fluency tasks depended on their executive abilities, while those of the SD patients were hampered by the impairment of their semantic memory store. Correlations with resting FDG uptake were consistent with the results of the cognitive study. In fv-FTD, both fluency performances were related to the metabolism of the frontal lobes, while we observed significant correlations between performances on both fluency tasks and the left temporal lobe metabolism in SD.
