Spontaneous recovery of myocardial function after ligation of Ameroid-stenosed coronary artery. We aimed to assess the spontaneous healing of myocardial function after occlusion of a chronically stenosed coronary vessel in a porcine model.Ischemia and infarction was produced by Ameroid constrictor placement and a subsequent ligation of the left circumflex artery. Cardiac MRI and 18FDG-PET were performed one and five weeks later. Ki67 staining was used to identify proliferating cells.Restoration of perfusion defect was detected by MRI (p=0.0065), reduced systolic function of the lateral segment spontaneously recovered (p=0.03). There was also a suggestive raise in impaired ejection fraction (p=0.06). Left ventricular early diastolic filling and peak filling rate were substantially improved (p=0.039 and p=0.0078). Scar size reduced (p=0.03). On the 18FDG-PET, deranged metabolism was alleviated (p=0.03). Cardiomyocytes with positive Ki-67 staining were located principally in the non-infarcted myocardium as compared to the infarction or border areas (p=0.037).We demonstrated spontaneous functional healing of ischemic and infarcted left ventricle, suggesting border zone perfusion recovery. Scar reduction was detected. Different pattern of myocyte proliferation between infarction and non-ischemic myocardium was seen.
