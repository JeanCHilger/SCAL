The clinical and imaging characteristics of breast cancers in patients with interstitial mammoplasty. The aims of this study are to demonstrate the clinical characteristics and various imaging findings of breast cancers in patients with interstitial mammoplasty.A total of six patients, who had breast cancer and had received liquid silicone or paraffin injection for augmentation, were included in this study. Mammography, ultrasonography, dynamic breast MRI, and PET/CT were performed for 5, 3, 6, and 2 patients, respectively. The clinical course was reviewed, and the imaging findings were retrospectively evaluated according to the ACR BI-RADS atlas.The mean maximal diameter of the detected breast cancers on enhanced breast MRI was 5.5 cm (range 4.8-7.1 cm). Although the breast cancers were all of a large size, subjective breast symptoms exhibited in only four of six patients. Mammographic examinations exhibited variable associate findings such as skin thickening, ipsilateral volume increase, and increase densities, but could not demonstrate main breast masses. A few sonographic examinations exhibited masses with associate findings such as skin thickening. On breast MRI, enhancing breast cancers with associate findings were detected in all the patients. On PET-CT, breast cancers and distant metastases were detected.Breast cancers in these patients were detected at the advanced stage. Dynamic breast MRI was useful for detecting breast cancer in these patients. Mammography failed to demonstrate the breast cancer, but cancer detection was facilitated by associated findings: skin thickening, asymmetric volume increase, and increased density.
