Visual stimulation increases technetium-99m-HMPAO distribution in human visual cortex. The ability of changes in the distribution of technetium-99m-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) to reflect physiologic changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was evaluated using photic stimulation, a procedure known to increase rCBF in the striate cortex. Seven healthy subjects were injected with 740 MBq 99mTc-HMPAO on two separate days. On one day, the injection was performed following closure of the eyes and patching for 5 min. On the other day, subjects were exposed to a stroboscopic light to produce photic simulation. Images of distribution of 99mTc-HMPAO were obtained using a Strichman 810X single-photon emission computed tomogram (SPECT) brain scanner. Comparison of images obtained during light occluded versus stimulation conditions revealed a significant increase in distribution of radiopharmaceutical in visual cortex relative to whole brain (peak increase corrected for radiopharmaceutical backdiffusion 36.7% +/- 6.6%). HMPAO appears to provide a useful method for detecting relative rCBF increases with SPECT.
