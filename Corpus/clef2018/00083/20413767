Squamous cell carcinoma of the palatine tonsils: FDG standardized uptake value ratio as a biomarker to differentiate tonsillar carcinoma from physiologic uptake. To quantify fluorine 18 ((18)F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the palatine tonsils to identify a sensitive and specific metric for distinguishing physiologic asymmetric uptake from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).This HIPAA-compliant retrospective study was approved by institutional review board. Informed consent requirements were waived. Twenty-six patients (seven female, 19 male mean age, 53.46 years + or - 10.45 [standard deviation]) with tonsillar SCC were included. Twenty-six patients (seven female, 19 maleThe mean maximum SUV (SUV(max)) of tonsil tumors was 9.36 + or - 4.54, which was significantly higher than that of contralateral cancer-free tonsils (2.54 + or - 0.88 P < .0001) and tonsils in control subjects (2.98 + or - 1.08The SUV(max) ratio represents an accurate imaging biomarker for differentiating tonsillar SCC from physiologic (18)F-FDG uptake.
