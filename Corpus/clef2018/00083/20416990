Vasculitis assessment with [18F]FDG positron emission tomography. [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive metabolic imaging modality that is well-suited to the assessment of activity and extent of large vessel vasculitis. PET imaging has demonstrated its usefulness in diagnosing giant cell arteritis (notably in its silent form), Takayasu's arteritis, and unclassified aortitis. PET imaging could be more effective than magnetic resonance imaging in detecting the earliest stages of vascular wall inflammation. The visual grading of vascular [18F]FDG uptake makes it possible to discriminate arteritis from active atherosclerosis, providing therefore high specificity. High sensitivity can also be achieved provided scanning is performed during active inflammatory phase, preferably before starting corticosteroid treatment. Prospective studies are needed to determine the exact value of PET imaging in assessing other vasculitis subsets, infectious aortitis, and large vessel vasculitis outcome and response to immunosuppressive treatment.
