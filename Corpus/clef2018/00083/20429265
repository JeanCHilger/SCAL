A wide range of diagnostic imaging modalities are available today: conventional radiography, conventional myelography, computed tomography (CT), CT myelography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MR or CT artrography, spinal cord angiography, ultrasound and scintigraphy, and combined radiological methods and scintigraphy (PET-CT). Each of the above methods has its own importance, advantages and limitations. Sometimes a method excludes the other, and often support each another in setting the final diagnosis.
