. Synthetic oral glucocorticoids (GC) mediate their effects through GC receptors (GR) that are located in cytoplasm of the cell and are known to be widely distributed in all tissues. GCs such as dexamethesone and prednisolone are effective anti-inflammatory agents and are often used to treat inflammation of the muscular, intestinal, dermatological, and respiratory systems (1, 2). GCs are also used for the treatment of neuropsychodepression mediated through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis because GRs are believed to play a major role in the development of anxiety and depression (3). Also, it is well established that these tissues have a very high concentration of GRs however, because these drugs have many undesirable side effects on the lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, such as development of osteoporosis, water retention, etc., investigators are constantly searching for new GCs (4). It has also been reported that GR levels in the HPA are increased during episodes of anxiety or depression, and the concentration of this receptor is reduced when the individual returns to normal or low-anxiety behavior (5). To understand the regulation and functioning of the HPA axis, investigators have developed and evaluated steroid GC radiotracers labeled with fluoride (
