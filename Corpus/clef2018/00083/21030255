Synthesis, biological evaluation and radiolabelling by 18F-fluoroarylation of a dopamine D3-selective ligand as prospective imaging probe for PET. Radical (18)F-fluoroarylation with fluorine-18-labelled arenediazonium chlorides has been successfully applied to the radiochemical synthesis of the dopamine D(3)-selective ligand SH 317 ([(18)F]8). SH 317 has been evaluated as a new PET ligand candidate by in vivo experiments.
