Triaryl (Z)-olefins suitable for radiolabeling with iodine-124 or fluorine-18 radionuclides for positron emission tomography imaging of estrogen positive breast tumors. A group of (Z)-1,2-diphenyl-1-[4-[2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)ethoxy]phenyl]but-1-enes were synthesized using methodologies that will allow incorporation of a [(124)I]iodine substituent at the para-position of either the C-1 phenyl ring or the C-2 phenyl ring, or a [(18)F]OCH(2)CH(2)F substituent at the para-position of the C-2 phenyl ring. These [(124)I] and [(18)F] radiotracers are designed as potential radiopharmaceuticals to image estrogen positive breast tumors using positron emission tomography (PET).
