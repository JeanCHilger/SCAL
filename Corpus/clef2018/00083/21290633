 The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II membrane glycoprotein that is present primarily in the prostate and is overexpressed during all stages of the androgen-insensitive or the metastatic cancer of this organ (1). In addition, PSMA is expressed at lower levels (compared to the prostate) in the neovasculature of some solid tumors (for details, see Elsasser-Beile et al. (1)). Because of its high expression during the development and progression of a malignancy, PSMA is considered to be a good target for the imaging and treatment of prostate cancer (2). Several investigators have reported the use of radio-halogenated (e.g.,
