Association of harm avoidance with dopamine D2/3 receptor availability in striatal subdivisions: a high resolution PET study. We examined the relationship between the personality trait of harm avoidance (HA) and the dopamine D(2/3) receptor availability in striatal subdivisions using high resolution positron emission tomography (PET) with [(11)C]raclopride. Twenty-one healthy subjects completed 3T magnetic resonance imaging and high resolution PET scans with [(11)C]raclopride in order to measure D(2/3) receptor availability in subregions of the striatum. The D(2/3) receptor availability was obtained on the basis of the Logan graphical method. The Temperament and Character Inventory was used to measure the biogenetic temperament of HA. The analysis revealed that the HA score had significant negative correlations with D(2/3) receptor availability in the pre-commissural dorsal caudate and post-commissural putamen, suggesting that HA is associated with D(2/3) receptor availability in the associative and sensorimotor subdivisions of the striatum, which are mainly involved in cognition and locomotion. Further research is required to determine if pathological states have similar dopaminergic mechanisms in specific striatal subdivisions.
