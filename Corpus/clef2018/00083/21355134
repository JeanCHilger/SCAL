Tomographic methods in the assessment of myocardial perfusion. Myocardium visualization using the most up-to-date tomographic techniques is extremely important in clinical cardiology. Myocardial viability assessment is of particular importance in management of patients with Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD). Although rest echocardiography is the most common in assessment of heart function, nuclear cardiology (SPECT and PET), and recently cardiac computed tomography and magnetic resonance become playing important clinical roles. Determining and understanding of real capabilities of these methods is of great necessity in this regard. This review examines the current abilities of current cardiac tomographic modalities for the assessment of myocardial perfusion in patients with known IHD.
