90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan as consolidation therapy after autologous stem cell transplantation in aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Targeted radioimmunotherapy with (90)Y-labeled ibritumomab tiuxetan is a novel therapeutic approach for CD20-positive relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).Seven consecutive patients with CD20-positive aggressive NHL who did not fully respond to prior myeloablative chemotherapy were enrolled. A 14.8 MBq (0.4 mCi)/kg dose of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan was administered to all patients, and approximately 100 d afterward (18)F-FDG PET/CT was performed to assess response.PET/CT showed a complete response in 5 of 7 patients. Of the 2 nonresponsive patients, 1 showed persistent disease and the other progression. Toxicity included thrombocytopenia in all 7 patients and grade IV neutropenic fever in 1 patient.Despite the small series studied, we suggest that radioimmunotherapy is safe for consolidation in patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy for aggressive NHL and may provide clinical benefit in extensively pretreated patients.
