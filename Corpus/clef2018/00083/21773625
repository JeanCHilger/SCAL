Synthesis of a [2]rotaxane operated in basic environment. A tight [2]rotaxane with two chromophores as stoppers is described, in which the macrocycle is able to reversibly move by tuning of base. This moving process can result in intramolecular photo-induced electron transfer (PET), changing the photo-physical properties.
