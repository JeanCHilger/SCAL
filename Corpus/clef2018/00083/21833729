18F-FDG positron emission tomography: potential utility in the assessment of Crohn's disease. Computed Tomography Enterography (CTE) and Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) are currently the dominant imaging tests used in the assessment of patients with Crohn's disease. More recently, the possibility of utilizing F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) or PET/CT has been explored in several preliminary studies. 18F-FDG PET appears to enable reliable detection of moderate to severe inflammation in bowel segments involved by Crohn's disease. Perhaps more importantly, 18F-FDG PET has the potential to provide a noninvasive, quantitative measure of inflammation that dynamically reflects changes in Crohn's disease activity. If 18F-FDG PET proves useful in monitoring responses to medical therapy within a few days of therapy initiation, an important new role for imaging in the management of patients with Crohn's disease could emerge.
