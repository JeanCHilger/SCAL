Reversible delayed neuropsychiatric syndrome following acute carbon monoxide exposure. A 40-year-old male presented with acutely oncoming neuropsychiatric symptoms in the form of extrapyramidal disturbances, personality change, behavior changes and urinary incontinence. One month prior to this symptomatology, he had been found unconscious in his closed room where a coal fire was burning overnight. He recovered completely in two days with supportive therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging during this presentation showed bilateral white matter changes suggestive of demyelination. Tc99m-ECD SPECT study revealed hypoperfusion in bilateral frontal region. He was managed conservatively and eventually made a nearly complete recovery. Repeat SPECT study revealed marked improvement in tracer uptake correlating with his improvement. Delayed neuropsychiatric syndrome after acute carbonmonoxide poisoning is a rare and distinct entity. This case report discusses the various aspects of this disease entity.
