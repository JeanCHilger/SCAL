Automated synthesis of [18F]gefitinib on a modular system. In recent years, [(18)F]gefitinib PET has successfully been employed for a number of applications ranging from oncology to in vivo studies of drug transporter proteins. We here report a reliable, automated procedure for routine synthesis of this radiotracer on an Eckert and Ziegler modular system. The 3-step radiosynthesis followed by preparative HPLC-purification provided [(18)F]gefitinib in 17.2Â±3.3% (n=22) overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield with radiochemical purity >99% in a total synthesis time of about 2.5h.
