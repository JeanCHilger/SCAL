Flavour exposures after conditioned aversion or preference trigger different brain processes in anaesthetised pigs. We describe the behavioural consequences of conditioned flavour aversion and preference in pigs and have investigated the brain circuits involved in the representation of flavours with different hedonic values. The study was performed on eight 30-kg pigs. (i) Animals were negatively conditioned to an F- flavour added to a meal followed by LiCl intraduodenal (i.d.) injection, and positively conditioned to an F+ flavour added to a meal followed by NaCl i.d. injection. F+ and F- were thyme or cinnamon flavours. After each conditioning, the behavioural activities were recorded (ii) One and 5â€ƒweeks later, animals were subjected to three two-choice food tests to investigate their preferences between F+, F- and a novel flavour (O)
