Laser-targeted photosensitizer-induced lung injury: noninvasive rat model of pulmonary infarction. Pulmonary infarction is a life-threatening lung injury that requires rapid and accurate diagnosis for proper treatment. Targetable and reproducible small-animal models that would allow experimental development and preclinical evaluation of diagnostic methods for detecting pulmonary infarction are critically missing. The authors report here a novel procedure to selectively induce pulmonary infarction by photodestructive laser-light irradiation in a targeted location within a specific lung compartment after administration of a photosensitizer. Histopathological analysis of the illuminated lung tissue revealed massive hemorrhage and vascular occlusion after acute injury localized to the site of irradiation. Collapse of alveolar structure, neutrophil influx, and necrosis were subsequently observed. Computed tomography (CT) scans showed evidence of abnormal density and airspace consolidation in the irradiated area of the lung, but not elsewhere in the lung compartment. Perfusion imaging using 99mTc-labeled macroaggregated albumin by single-photon emission computed tomography revealed diminished scintigraphic signal in the opaque area of infarcted lung tissue. The histological changes, CT findings, and perfusion characteristics of pulmonary infarction are mimicked using laser-irradiated, photosensitizer-mediated photodestruction to selectively induce chronic lung injury in a localized area. This small-animal model can be easily and readily used for targeted induction of pulmonary infarction in a designated area of lung compartment and offers the potential for use in evaluating novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods.
