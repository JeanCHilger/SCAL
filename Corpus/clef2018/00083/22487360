Brain processing of duodenal and portal glucose sensing. Peripheral and central glucose sensing play a major role in the regulation of food intake. Peripheral sensing occurs at duodenal and portal levels, although the importance of these sensing sites is still controversial. The present study aimed to compare the respective influence of these sensing pathways on the eating patterns plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
