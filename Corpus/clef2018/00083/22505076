Measurement of residual stress for ITO/PET substrates by the double beam shadow moiré interferometer. This study constructed a measurement system that can quickly and accurately analyze the residual stress of flexible electronics. A double beam shadow moiré interferometer was set up to measure and evaluate the residual stress of tin-doped indium oxide films on a polyethylene terephthalate substrate. However, this system required only two symmetrical fringes to evaluate the residual stress of transparent conductive oxide films on flexible substrate. Applying the grating translation techniques to the double beam shadow moiré interferometer greatly improved the measurement resolution and accuracy, and the relative error was reduced to 1.2%.
