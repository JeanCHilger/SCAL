Lead, cadmium and other metals in serum of pet dogs from an urban area of NW Poland. This study was designed to evaluate the degree of exposure of pet dogs from an urban area of NW Poland to selected metals, including toxic Cd and Pb. The study was conducted on a group of 48 healthy dogs. The serum concentration of the analysed elements followed the order Fe > Al > Zn > Cu > Mn > As > Sr > Pb > Cd > Cr > Ni > V. The presence of cadmium and lead was found in all the serum samples tested. The average contents of these elements were 0.309 and 0.489 Î¼g/mL. The factors that played the greatest role in the intake of the analysed elements were diet and breed-dependent size of dogs. Small-sized dogs had higher concentrations of all elements compared with large dogs, with statistically significant differences noted for Cu, Pb, Cd and Sr. It was also found that dogs receiving commercial and mixed food had more metals in serum compared with dogs on homemade food (except strontium). The present study showed elevated concentrations of some heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Fe and Cu) in serum of pet dogs, which is probably due to the excess elemental load of this area. Given that no information is available on the concentrations of strontium, vanadium and aluminium in dogs, further research is necessary to determine certain reference values which would allow for an easier interpretation of results and evaluation of exposure to these elements.
