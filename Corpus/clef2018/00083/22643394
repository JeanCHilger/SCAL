Imaging of spine neoplasm. Although most often back pain is of benign origin, it can occasionally be a harbinger of a more serious spinal condition, including spine neoplasm. Knowledge of the typical clinical history of spinal tumors and an understanding of the innervation of the spine and surrounding supporting structures may allow us to better understand when to pursue advanced imaging in the evaluation of spinal pain syndromes. Many radiologists have divided the differential diagnosis of neoplasms of the spine into compartments. These compartments include the extradural compartment, intradural/extramedullary compartment, and the intramedullary compartment.
