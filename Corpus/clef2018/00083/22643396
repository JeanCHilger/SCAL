Imaging of stress fractures of the spine. Back pain caused by stress fractures, fatigue, or insufficiency, affects varied patient populations based on the level of physical activity and bone mineral density. Stress fractures may involve the vertebral body, pars interarticularis, and the pedicle often overlooked are stress fractures of the sacrum or bony pelvis, which can mimic pain of spinal origin and delay diagnosis. The choice of optimal imaging (radiographs, nuclear medicine, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography) also depends on the patient population under study and the clinically suspected diagnosis. The diagnosis typically determines which imaging modality is best to follow healing or progression.
