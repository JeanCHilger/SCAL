Diagnostics and treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer using nuclear medicine. Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is a rare cancer with excellent prognosis for most patients. Primary treatment is surgery. Adjuvant radioiodine is used after surgery and in case of residual radioiodine positive disease. Measurements of serum thyroglobulin levels and neck ultrasound (US) are the primary follow-up procedures. For suspected recurrence, US, computed tomography (CT), radioiodine single photon emission computed tomography/CT, and FDG positron emission tomography/CT will be appropriate choices for restaging and further treatment planning. Multidisciplinary collaboration is crucial for optimal management of patients with DTC.
