Exploring copy number variation in the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) genome by array comparative genome hybridization. The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is relevant in a large spectrum of fields: it is a livestock, a pet, a biomedical model and a biotechnology tool, a wild resource and a pest. The sequencing of the rabbit genome has opened new perspectives to study this lagomorph at the genome level. We herein investigated for the first time the O. cuniculus genome by array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) and established a first copy number variation (CNV) genome map in this species comprising 155 copy number variation regions (CNVRs 95 gains, 59 losses, 1 with both gain and loss) covering ~0.3% of the OryCun2.0 version. About 50% of the 155 CNVRs identified spanned 139 different protein coding genes, 110 genes of which were annotated or partially annotated (including Major Histocompatibility Complex genes) with 277 different gene ontology terms. Many rabbit CNVRs might have a functional relevance that should be further investigated.
