FDG PET imaging in the staging and management of gastric cancer. Gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Complete resection offers the only chance for permanent control, and accurate staging and evaluation of treatment response are crucial for appropriate management. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is increasingly used to complement anatomic imaging in cancer management. PET use in gastric cancer has been limited by 1) some gastric histologies are not PET avid, 2) spatial resolution limits the ability to distinguish between primary tumor and compartment I or II lymph nodes, and 3) the lack of a unified criteria in how to interpret PET for management decisions. New criteria have been proposed establishing response metrics in the utilization of PET. More study is needed to support these criteria in routine practice and establish the place of PET in the staging and management of gastric cancer.
