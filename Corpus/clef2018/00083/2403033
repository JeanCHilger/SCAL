In vivo metabolism and UTP-depleting action of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-galactose. The metabolism of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-galactose (dGalF) was studied in rodents using HPLC, enzymatic methods, and 19F-NMR spectroscopy in vivo and in vitro. The liver took up the major part of the administered dose of the 14C-labeled D-galactose analog. This was confirmed in vivo by use of the 18F-labeled sugar (1.5 mCi/kg 25 mumol/kg) and examination by positron emission tomography. After a dose of 1 mmol/kg, dGalF-1-phosphate accumulated rapidly (5.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/kg after 30 min), followed by formation of UDP-dGalF and UDP-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (0.7 +/- 0.1 and 1.8 +/- 0.1 mmol/kg, respectively, after 5 hr). Good quantitative agreement was obtained between the measurements by HPLC and enzymatic analyses and by 19F-NMR. The noninvasive in vivo 19F-NMR technique is particularly advantageous, since it allows the simultaneous analysis of all dGalF metabolites. The diversion of uridylate, due to the accumulation of UDP-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-hexoses, was associated with a rapid depletion of hepatic UTP, UDP-glucose, and UDP-galactose. The UTP content was decreased to 11 +/- 6% of normal within 15 min after administration of dGalF at a dose of 1 mmol/kg. The UTP-depleting action was minimal, however, at a dose of 25 mumol/kg or less, indicating that interference in uridylate metabolism will be negligible at the doses required for positron emission tomography of the liver using the 18F-labeled compound. At higher doses the UTP deficiency induced by dGalF may be useful in the chemotherapy of D-galactose-metabolizing tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma. At moderate doses of dGalF, 19F-NMR spectroscopy in vivo or in vitro could be used to pinpoint defects of the enzymes that cause galactosemia, i.e. of galactokinase, uridyltransferase, or 4-epimerase.
