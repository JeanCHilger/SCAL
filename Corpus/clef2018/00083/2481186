Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and regional cerebral blood flow in acute stroke. The effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was studied in 12 patients within 5 days after their first acute stroke. rCBF was studied by xenon-133 inhalation and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan before and 1 h after oral administration of 25 mg captopril. No increase in rCBF was observed in any of the 12 patients included in the study. In only one patient was there a slight redistribution of blood flow in favor of the low-flow area, but the absolute flow value did not increase. Captopril did not cause any significant change in mean hemispheric blood flow, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), or end-expiratory CO2 fraction (FECO2). The assumption that ACE inhibition might increase cerebral blood flow in the periinfarct zone and preserve some still viable brain tissue could not be verified in the present study.
