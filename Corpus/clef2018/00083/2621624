Respiratory responses to sustained isometric muscle contractions in man: the effect of muscle mass. 1. Respiratory responses to sustained isometric contractions of a small mass of muscle (the finger flexors) during handgripping, and of a larger mass of muscle (the quadriceps) during extension of the leg at the knee, have been studied in man. 2. For both masses of muscle the increases of ventilation and of oxygen consumption were greater for contractions at 40% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) than for contractions at 20% MVC. 3. The increase of ventilation was not related to the mass of muscle involved. 4. At 20% MVC oxygen consumption during contraction of the quadriceps was greater than that during handgripping. At 40% MVC the oxygen consumptions were similar. The oxygen debts following both handgrip and knee extensor contractions at 20% MVC were negligible. Following 40% MVC contractions of the quadriceps a significant oxygen debt was recorded but no debt was apparent following 40% MVC contractions of the finger flexors. 5. The increases of ventilation during isometric exercise were generally inappropriately high for the increases of gas exchange. This led to reductions of the end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PET,CO2), especially towards the end of exercise. 6. Following 40% MVC handgripping hyperventilation continued despite the reduced alveolar PCO2. By contrast, following 40% MVC knee extension PET,CO2 transiently rose above the resting level, but did not stimulate ventilation. 7. It appears that following fatiguing isometric contractions hyperventilation continues and appears to be independent of alveolar PCO2. It is suggested that stimuli which increase ventilation during exercise may continue to act during the early phase of recovery.
