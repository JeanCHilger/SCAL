Positron emission tomography--a new approach to brain chemistry. Council on Scientific Affairs. Report of the Positron Emission Tomography Panel. Positron emission tomography permits examination of the chemistry of the brain in living human beings. Until recently, positron emission tomography had been considered a research tool, but it is rapidly moving into clinical practice. This report describes the uses and applications of positron emission tomography in examinations of patients with strokes, epilepsy, malignancies, dementias, and schizophrenia and in basic studies of synaptic neurotransmission.
