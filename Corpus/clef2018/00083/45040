The effect of dietary vitamin E on indomethacin stimulated chemiluminescense in rat liver microsomes. Peroxidation of endogenous lipid by rat liver microsomes, coupled with oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) was markedly stimulated in the presence of indomethacin [1-(p-chlorobenzyl)-5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-indole acetic acid], a potent anti-inflammatory drug. This system also generated a rapidly developed chemiluminescense (CL), the intensity and rate of development of which were related to indomethacin concentration and the amount of peroxidation in the sample. Microsomes from rats fed a liquid diet based on Sego diet drink (Pet Incorporated) failed to chemiluminesce with or without added indomethacin. Supplementation of the Sego diet with a polyunsaturated fatty acid (C18:3) did not restore the chemiluminescense. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that vitamin E (a component of the Sego liquid diet) inhibited the microsomal chemiluminescense reaction in a dose related manner.
