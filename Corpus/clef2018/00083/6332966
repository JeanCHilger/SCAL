76Br-bromospiroperidol: a new tool for quantitative in-vivo imaging of neuroleptic receptors. Bromine-76 labeled bromospiperone has been prepared with a very high specific activity (greater than 1 Ci/mumole). In-vivo studies in rat corroborated by PET studies in baboon have shown that the regional concentration of this radioligand parallels the morphologic distribution of dopamine receptors and that its binding in the striatum is saturable and displaceable. Tomographic images show a clear delineation of the striatal region 2.5 hours after administration of the radioligand.
