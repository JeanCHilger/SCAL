Evaluation of the performance characteristics of the PC 4600 positron emission tomograph. The sensitivity, resolution, linearity, and count rate capability for the PC 4600 positron emission tomograph (PET), a neurological PET with five rings of 96 bismuth germanate crystals, are reported along with details of the design of this system. Phantom studies and preliminary human images demonstrate the clinical potential of this new instrument.
