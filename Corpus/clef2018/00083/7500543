Clinical usefulness of 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy in diabetic patients with cardiac sympathetic nerve dysfunction. To assess the clinical utility of 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy in evaluating cardiac sympathetic nerve disturbance in diabetic patients, we performed MIBG scintigraphy in 18 diabetic patients and 11 normal controls. Diabetic patients with symptomatic neuropathy (DM2) had a significantly lower heart to mediastinum uptake ratio than did those without neuropathy or normal controls in initial and delayed images (initial image, 1.90 +/- 0.27 vs 2.32 +/- 0.38, 2.41 +/- 0.40, p< 0.01 delayed image, 1.80 +/- 0.31 vs 2.48 +/- 0.35 2.56 +/- 0.28, p < 001, respectively). Defect score, assessed visually, were higher in DM2 patients than in patients in the other two groups (initial image, 7 +/- 2.6 vs 1.5 +/- 1.9, 0.7 +/- 0.9
