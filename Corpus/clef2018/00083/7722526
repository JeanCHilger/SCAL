The role of the basal ganglia in motor control: contributions from PET. This article reviews PET activation data on basal ganglia function that have been reported in association with performance of different motor tasks by normal subjects and movement disorder patients. PET findings are contrasted with electrophysiological observations both in man and in non-human primates and with observations on clinical and cognitive function of movement disorder patients. Possible roles that the basal ganglia may play in motor control are discussed in the light of these data.
