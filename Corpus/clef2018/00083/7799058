Comparison of radiolabeled octreotide and meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy in malignant pheochromocytoma. The results of in vivo somatostatin scintigraphy were correlated with those of MIBG from 14 patients, aged 22-66 yr, with metastatic pheochromocytoma (10 patients), malignant paraganglioma (3 patients) and metastatic ganglioneuroblastoma (1 patient). Twelve patients had elevated catecholamine excretion. A dynamic study and serial whole-body scans (4-48 hr) were obtained after injection of 130-187 MBq of 111In-DTPA-Phe-1-octreotide. When indicated, SPECT imaging was done. The results were compared to MIBG scans obtained after a diagnostic or a therapeutic dose.Three patients with more than 20 tumor sites on MIBG scans had only 1-9 sites on 111In-octreotide scintigraphy. Two patients had no MIBG uptake but one had lung uptake on octreotide scintigraphy. In the other 9 patients with a total of 41 foci of MIBG uptake, 33 sites of 111In-octreotide uptake are found. All positive images with octreotide scintigraphy were seen at or before 4 hr, but the contrast improved at 24 hr. Uptake intensity was lower with 111In-octreotide than MIBG and the number of tumor sites was higher with MIBG. However, seven foci were positive only on octreotide scintigraphy and six of them could not be confirmed by other imaging modalities.Use of octreotide to identify somatostatin receptors seems promising, especially when results from MIBG scans are negative. Moreover octreotide images could aid in determining a treatment regimen as well as establishing the extent of disease and prognosis.
