Prognostic implications of normal exercise tomographic thallium images in patients with angiographic evidence of significant coronary artery disease. This study examines the prognostic implications of normal exercise tomographic thallium images in medically treated patients with angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD). There were 97 patients aged 60 +/- 10 years 52 had 1-, 30 had 2-, and 15 had 3-vessel CAD (> or = 50% diameter stenosis). The exercise test was submaximal in 51 patients (53%)
