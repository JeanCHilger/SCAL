The relationship among the quantitative perfusion-defect indices in Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT, IQ test, and involved extremities in children with cerebral palsy due to perinatal asphyxia. Brain SPECT imaging was performed in 13 children with cerebral palsy (6 girls, 7 boys age, 7-17 years) due to perinatal asphyxia with mental retardation and involved limbs were studied. The involved coronal slices were summated to a picture for the calculation of the perfusion defect indices as the quantitative and objective estimation of the perfusion defects in each brain. The records of IQ tests were scored from severe to mild mental retardation. Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians analyzed the results of the Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECTs by visual interpretation. The involved limbs were judged by two pediatricians to be either the right or left side. The relationship among the Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECTs, IQ test, and physical examinations of the extremities were established. The results showed that two cases of mild mental retardation had the smaller perfusion defect indices (< 0.1), six cases of severe mental retardation had the larger perfusion defect indices (> 0.30), and the other group was between the first two groups. Two cases of mild mental retardation did not have significant perfusion defects in the brain and involved limbs, and two cases with decreased visual acuity had definite perfusion defects in the occipital regions. The other cases had the matched perfusion defects of the brain with the involved limbs. The authors encourage the potential use of Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECTs to predict the outcome of mental development and limb involvement.
