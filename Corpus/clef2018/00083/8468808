The indications for the use of gallium-67 scintigraphy. 67Ga citrate scanning has been widely used for imaging a variety of neoplasms and inflammatory lesions. In this review, indications and limitations of 67Ga scanning were briefly discussed, and four diseases, that is, sarcoidosis, malignant melanoma, malignant lymphoma and opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS, were mentioned as the indications for 67Ga scanning in the clinical evaluation. Especially 67Ga scanning is helpful in the early detection and differential diagnosis of opportunistic infections in AIDS patients. I am convinced that 67Ga scanning will continue to be used for the future in view of its rich experience, simplicity and safety, although the exact role of 67Ga scanning should be defined.
