A survey of patent nematode infestations in dogs. A survey of faecal samples taken from 1000 suburban dogs revealed an infestation of 7-2 per cent Toxocara canis, 2-7 per cent Toxascaris leonina, 1-3 per cent Trichuris vulpis and 1-3 per cent Uncinaria stenocephala. The faecal material examined was obtained per rectum from well cared-for pet dogs resident in an area of north-west suburban London. The age of the dogs examined, both male and female, ranged from three weeks to 18 years. The clinical picture of the dogs affected by ascariasis and in particular Toxocara canis is described and some advice on treatment is included.
