Effects of exercise and CO2 inhalation on intersubject variability in ventilatory and heart rate responses to progressive hypoxia. Although the ventilatory and heart rate responses to hypoxia are known to vary widely among subjects, it is not known how exercise or hypercapnia influence the intersubject variability of these responses. If the intersubject variability increases under such conditions, the inherent response of individuals will have more impact on ventilation and heart rate under a variety of hypoxic conditions during exercise or with hypercapnia than at rest or with normocapnia. Seventeen healthy male volunteers underwent tests to measure ventilatory response to isocapnic progressive hypoxia three times respectively: at rest during CO2 inhalation (end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PET,CO2) raised by 5 torr from the baseline level)
