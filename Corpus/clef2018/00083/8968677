Incremental value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in prognosis and outcomes of patients with coronary artery disease. The concept of incremental value in prognosis and outcome of patients with coronary artery disease is important to the field of noninvasive imaging. Because these tests are expensive, they should be held to the standard of demonstrating a statistical improvement over the information provided by clinical assessment and treadmill testing. Responding to the demand for cost-effective applications of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, a large amount of research has recently been devoted to defining specific patient subsets in which incremental value exists for scintigraphy. Subsets thus far demonstrated to benefit incrementally include those men and women referred for possible coronary artery disease, with known coronary artery disease, and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting, unstable angina, or recent infarction. Incremental cost savings also apply to these subsets except for patients with normal ECGs at rest and less than 15% likelihood for significant coronary artery disease.
