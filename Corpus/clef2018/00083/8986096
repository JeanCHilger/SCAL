Cerebral cortical dysplasia associated with epilepsy: MRI and clinical aspects. Clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) studies were performed in nine patients with cerebral cortical dysplasia (CD). Interictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using 99mTc-hexamethyl propylene amine oxime were studied in four patients. A patient with hemimegalencephaly and agyria had poor outcome in both developmental and epileptic aspects. The prognoses of clinical seizures were generally related to the severity, location and size of CD. The size of the lesion was not always correlated with the clinical seizure outcome. Four patients had focal pachygyria. Clinical pictures were diverse in these patients. One patient underwent callosotomy for the control of intractable seizures. The others had no clinical seizures despite of the appearance of paradoxical discharges in the area of pachygyria. The distribution of CD detected by MRI did not always correlate with that of paradoxical discharges in EEG and/or hypoperfusional areas seen in SPECT. These findings suggest that a detailed neuroimaging study is useful to elucidate the epileptogenesis in patients with CD, and that all the cortical abnormalities in patients with intractable epilepsy are not detected by MRI.
