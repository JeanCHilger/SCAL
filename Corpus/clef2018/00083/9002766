The role of 111In-octreotide scintigraphy in the detection of APUD tumours: our experience in eighteen patients. 111In-Octreotide scintigraphy has been recently proposed as a sensitive technique for the detection of neuroendocrine tumours, based on the high radiotracer affinity towards the somatostatin receptors expressed by the APUD-system cells. In the present study, a group of 18 patients with carcinoid tumours and gastrointestinal (GI) apudomas was investigated to assess the accuracy of Octreotide scintigraphy in localizing primitive, recurrent or metastatic lesions. Both planar and SPECT studies were obtained 4 hours after the i.v. injection of 111In-Octreotide (111 MBq) planar images were also carried out 24 hours later. In accordance with other authors, the sensitivity of the method was found to be very high (94%) in our group of patients
