Visual pathways for object-oriented action and object recognition: functional anatomy with PET. The purpose of this study was to identify the functional anatomy of the mechanisms involved in visually guided prehension and in object recognition in humans. The cerebral blood flow of seven subjects was investigated by positron emission tomography. Three conditions were performed using the same set of stimuli. In the 'grasping' condition, subjects were instructed to accurately grasp the objects. In the 'matching' condition, subjects were requested to compare the shape of the presented object with that of the previous one. In the 'pointing' condition (control), subjects pointed towards the objects. The comparison between grasping and pointing showed a regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) increase in the anterior part of the inferior parietal cortex and part of the posterior parietal cortex. The comparison between grasping and matching showed an rCBF increase in the cerebellum, the left frontal cortex around the central sulcus, the mesial frontal cortex and the left inferior parietal cortex. Finally, the comparison between matching and pointing showed an rCBF increase in the right temporal cortex and the right posterior parietal cortex. Thus object-oriented action and object recognition activate a common posterior parietal area, suggesting that some kind of within-object spatial analysis was processed by this area whatever the goal of the task.
