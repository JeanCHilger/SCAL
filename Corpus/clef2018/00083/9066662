Hyperbaric oxygen enhances the effects of meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) on energy metabolism and lipid peroxidation in the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE(2C). In this paper we report the effects of the combination of MIBG (a structural analogue of norepinephrine, used in its radio iodinated form for the diagnosis and therapy of neuroblastoma) and hyperbaric oxygen on the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE(2c). Exposure of the neuroblastoma cells to hyperbaric oxygen conditions enhanced the effects of MIBG on cell proliferation, lipid peroxidation and energy metabolism of the cell line. Cell proliferation and energy metabolism were further decreased and lipid peroxidation further increased. Enhancement of the effects of MIBG by HBO may provide an explanation for the positive effects on the cumulative survival curve observed when stage IV neuroblastoma patients were treated with the combination of [131I] MIBG and HBO.
