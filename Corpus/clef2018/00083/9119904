L-arginine infusion increases basal but not activated cerebral blood flow in humans. Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator. Infusion of its precursor, L-arginine, results in increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in experimental animals. We examined the effects of L-arginine infusion on CBF in humans using positron emission tomography and the quantitative H2(15)O method. Six subjects received 500 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution, and six subjects received an infusion of L-arginine (16.7 mg/kg/min 500 mg/kg). Before and after the i.v. infusion, paired CBF measurements were performed at baseline and with vibrotactile stimulation of the right hand. In scans performed without vibrotactile stimulation, mean whole-brain CBF increased from 34.9 +/- 3.7 ml 100 g-1 min-1 to 38.2 +/- 4.4 ml 100 g-1 min-1. (9.5%
