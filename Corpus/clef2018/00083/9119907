Parametric images of benzodiazepine receptor concentration using a partial-saturation injection. The in vivo quantification of the benzodiazepine receptor concentration in human brain using positron emission tomography (PET) and 11C-flumazenil (11C-FMZ), is usually based on a three-compartment model and on PET curves measured in a small number of large regions of interest however, it should be interesting to estimate the receptor concentration for each pixel and to build quantified images of the receptor concentration. The main advantage is to allow screening of the receptor site localization and visual observation of the possible abnormalities. Up to now, all the methods described include complex experimental protocols, difficult to use in routine examinations. In this paper, we propose the partial-saturation approach to obtain parametric images of benzodiazepine receptor concentration and FMZ affinity. It consists of a single FMZ injection with a low specific activity, followed by Scatchard analysis. Like other parametric imaging methods, this partial-saturation approach can lead to a small percentage (< 1%) of unrealistic values in receptor-poor regions
