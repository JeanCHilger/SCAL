Nutritional management of osteoarthritis. Nutrition can influence developmental orthopedic diseases and the inflammatory process of arthritis. Developmental skeletal disease is a group of skeletal abnormalities that primarily affect fast-growing, large-breed dogs. Nutrient excesses (calcium and energy) and rapid growth (overfeeding and excess energy) are known risk factors. Inflammation can be directly or indirectly affected by nutritional influences. A direct effect can be achieved by modulating the immune response and inflammatory process with fatty acids. Weight control can indirectly influence the degenerative joint disease process by reducing the stresses on the joint.
