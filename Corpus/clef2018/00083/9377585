Effects of fasudil hydrochloride on cerebral blood flow in patients with chronic cerebral infarction. To evaluate the effect of the novel intracellular calcium antagonist fasudil hydrochloride, cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured quantitatively with positron emission tomography following the intravenous administration of fasudil in five patients with chronic cerebral infarction. The hemispheric mean CBF increased significantly on both hemispheres 30, 60, and 90 min after the administration of fasudil when the CBF values were corrected according to PaCO2 level, although there was no significant change in raw CBF data. A significant increase of CBF was seen in the cerebellar hemisphere and thalamus at 30 min and in the occipital cortex at 90 min. There was no significant fall in the systemic blood pressure after the administration of fasudil.
