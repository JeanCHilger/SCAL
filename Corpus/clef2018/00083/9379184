Technetium-99m-MIBI myocardial SPECT: supine versus right lateral imaging and comparison with coronary arteriography. Myocardial perfusion SPECT using the prone position improves inferior wall counts and decreases motion problems as compared with the usual supine position. Nonetheless, it is not suitable for women. In addition, it is associated with artifactual anteroseptal defects and hot spots.The right lateral (RL) position was evaluated instead of the prone position in 72 patients (26 women). RL imaging was performed immediately after the supine imaging during a routine 2-day 99mTc-sestamibi exercise protocol. The SPECT images were scored semiquantitatively by three physicians. Moreover, regional myocardial counts, as well as extent and severity of defects, were assessed by quantitative polar map analysis.All patients tolerated the RL position well and there was no significant patient movement in either position. Higher inferior myocardial counts per pixel were observed in the RL than in supine images. Inferior wall defects (especially mild ones) were more common in the supine than the RL images, whereas defects in other regions were not different. Quantitative analysis confirmed these findings. Analysis of 34 patients with recent coronary arteriography revealed an overall coronary artery disease (CAD) supine- and RL-imaging specificity of 50% and 75%, respectively, and the sensitivities of both were 93%. Right CAD sensitivity, specificity and normalcy rates for the supine position were 100%, 44% and 55%, whereas those of the RL position were 94%, 75% and 90%, respectively.The RL position improves CAD diagnostic accuracy, particularly right CAD, without significant artifacts in other myocardial regions. Unlike the prone position, the RL position is well tolerated by both women and men.
