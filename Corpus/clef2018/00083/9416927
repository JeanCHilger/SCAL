Utility of stress single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion imaging in predicting outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting. Previous studies have examined the predictors of outcome in medically treated patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). There is limited information on predictors of outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). This study examined the predictors of outcome of 255 patients with CAD, at a mean time of 5 years after CABG for angina pectoris. The 255 patients underwent coronary angiography and stress single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging after CABG. During a mean follow-up of 41 +/- 28 months after stress testing, there were 34 hard events (24 cardiac deaths and 10 nonfatal myocardial infarctions). The hemodynamics during stress testing, and age and gender were not predictors of events. The SPECT variables of multivessel perfusion abnormality, perfusion deficit size, and increased lung thallium uptake were predictors of death and total events by uni- and multivariate survival analysis. There were 14 events in 45 patients (31%) with multivessel abnormality and increased lung thallium uptake, 14 events in 101 patients (14%) with either multivessel abnormality or increased lung uptake, and 6 events in 109 patients (6%) with neither of these 2 variables (p = 0.0001). The annual mortality and total event rates were 7.5% and 9.5% with both variables, 3.4% and 4.3% with either variable, and 0.6% and 1.7% with neither of the variables (p = 0.01). Thus, stress SPECT perfusion imaging is useful to stratify patients after CABG into low, intermediate, and high risk groups for future cardiac events.
