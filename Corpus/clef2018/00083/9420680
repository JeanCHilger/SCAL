Myocardial single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging with technetium 99m tetrofosmin: stress-rest imaging with same-day and separate-day rest imaging. Technetium 99m tetrofosmin is a new ethylene diphosphine ligand for myocardial perfusion imaging and has unique properties. We have compared stress-rest single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging with 99mTc tetrofosmin with same-day and separate-day rest imaging to detect myocardial perfusion defects.Myocardial SPECT imaging was performed in 22 patients with coronary artery disease who had undergone planar thallium 201 imaging and coronary angiography. Single-day (stress-rest) and separate-day rest 99mTc tetrofosmin SPECT protocols were compared in the same patient. Images were assessed by a blinded panel to identify myocardial infarction, ischemia, or normal scans. Overall sensitivity for identification of patients with coronary artery disease was 86% (19/22) by both same-day stress-rest and separate-day rest protocols with 99mTc tetrofosmin (p = NS). Of a total of 396 segments studied, 107 abnormal segments were identified at exercise and 76 and 81 at the same-day and separate-day rest tests, respectively (p = NS). Same-day stress-rest and separate-day rest 99mTc tetrofosmin SPECT protocols were also useful for detecting individual coronary stenosis with a greater than 50% lesion: 80% of the left anterior descending, 93% of the right coronary, and 75% of the left circumflex coronary arteries were detected.Excellent images were obtained with 99mTc tetrofosmin during both stress and rest. 99mTc tetrofosmin imaging with the same-day stress-rest and separate-day rest imaging protocols have similar diagnostic sensitivities for detection of coronary heart disease.
