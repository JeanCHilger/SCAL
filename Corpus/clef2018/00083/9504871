Do beta-blockers affect the diagnostic sensitivity of dobutamine stress thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomographic imaging? The effects of beta-blockers on dobutamine stress 201Tl tomographic imaging are not known. This study was undertaken to examine whether beta-blockers affect the sensitivity of dobutamine stress 201Tl imaging.One hundred ten patients without previous myocardial infarction underwent dobutamine stress 201Tl single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and coronary arteriography, both studies within a 1-week period. Dobutamine was infused at rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 microg/kg/min in 3-minute stages. Atropine (as much as 1 mg) was injected intravenously when the patient's heart rate was <100 beats/min. Patients in group 1 (n = 72) were receiving beta-blockers and patients in group 2 (n = 38) were not. The SPECT images in group 1 showed perfusion abnormalities in 62%, 87%, and 94% of patients with one-, two-, and three-vessel coronary artery disease (> or = 50% diameter stenosis), respectively, compared with 75%, 71% and 100% in group 2 (p not significant). The overall sensitivities were 82% (37 of 45) in group 1 and 80% (16 of 20) in group 2 (p not significant). The specificities were 81% (22 of 27) in group 1 and 83% (15 of 18) in group 2 (p not significant). The overall accuracies were the same for both groups (82%). Atropine was added more often in group 1 than in group 2 (37/72 vs 5/38, p < 0.001).Our results suggest that beta-blockers do not affect the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of dobutamine stress 201Tl SPECT imaging for detecting coronary artery disease if atropine is given when the chronotropic response is inadequate. In patients receiving beta-blockers, however, the addition of atropine to dobutamine stress is more frequently required.
