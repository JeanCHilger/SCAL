Future developments in nuclear medicine instrumentation: a review. This review article forecasts developments in nuclear medicine instrumentation which are on the horizon. Special attention is paid to the physical properties of detectors and multiple-processor parallel processing systems needed for fast and high-quality imaging in emission tomography. Advances in detector technology will improve imaging resolution below 5 mm and will increase sensitivity and quantitative accuracy. In addition, high count rate list-mode acquisition enables 'true' four-dimensional data-sets. A sandwich-like construction of two different crystals allows the simultaneous use of conventional tracers and positron tracers (multiple emission tomography, MET). Transmission-based attenuation and scatter compensation with fast iterative reconstruction methods will further improve image quality. The clinical and scientific importance of improved images and the limits on advances in instrumentation are also reviewed.
