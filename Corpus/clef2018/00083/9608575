Abnormalities in the distributed network of sustained attention predict neuroleptic treatment response in schizophrenia. The regional cerebral metabolic rates of 19 male medication-withdrawn schizophrenic patients were determined by positron emission tomography (PET) while performing an auditory discrimination task (CPT). Regardless of the accuracy of their CPT performance, the schizophrenic patients had lower metabolic rates in their prefrontal cortex and higher rates in their posterior putamen compared to 41 healthy males. Abnormally low right anterior midprefrontal cortex metabolic rates predicted better clinical response while high basal ganglia rates and low mid-cingulate rates predicted poor treatment response to neuroleptics. The findings imply that the sustained attention pathway and its distributed network of brain structures are likely to play an important role in the expression of psychotic symptoms and the mediation of their response to antipsychotics.
