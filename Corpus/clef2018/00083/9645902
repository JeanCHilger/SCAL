Impact of exercise single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging on appropriateness of coronary revascularization. This study examined the predictors of early coronary revascularization in 816 patients with chest pain syndromes who had coronary artery disease by angiography and exercise single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) thallium imaging. Multivariate analysis of clinical, stress, nuclear, and catheterization variables revealed the presence of SPECT reversibility as the most powerful predictor (chi-square = 43) of early revascularization.
