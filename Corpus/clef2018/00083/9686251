Strategy of evaluation and surgical results in medial temporal lobe epilepsy. To analyse the presurgical evaluation process of mediotemporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) in relation to electroclinical characteristics of the patients, we reviewed the presurgical data (clinical, EEG, neuropsychological, MRI, FDG-PET and sometimes intracranial EEG) and the post-operative results of 53 consecutive cases treated by antero-medial temporal resection for MTLE (without lesion other than mediotemporal sclerosis). Forty one patients (77 p. 100) had a typical and well-lateralised presentation and were operated without invasive procedure. Twelve patients (23 p. 100) presented less pure data: unusual or absent auras, divergent scalp EEG features (bitemporal, widespread or extratemporal) or absence of MRI-based hippocampal sclerosis or FDG-PET hypometabolism. They were explored by invasive monitoring which confirmed the medial temporal origin of seizures. Outcome (follow-up: 30 months) was excellent in 88 p. 100 of the pure cases (Engel's class I) and less favorable in the more difficult ones (50 p. 100 of class I). In conclusion, the diagnosis and surgical treatment of MTLE can be performed without invasive investigations in the majority of cases owing to the strong contribution of brain imaging and video EEG monitoring. Some patients however present a less pure presentation suggesting more complex epileptogenic networks and associated to relatively less favorable postsurgical results.
