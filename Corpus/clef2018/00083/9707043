Role of p53 tumor suppressor gene in pancreatic endocrine tumors of Chinese patients. The molecular genetic of pancreatic endocrine tumor (PET) has rarely been studied in depth because of its rarity. The aim of this study is to determine if there is any implication of p53 overexpression on the pathogenesis and clinicopathological parameters of PET.This study examines the immunohistochemical expression of the p53 gene product in 52 PETs (32 insulinomas, three gastrinomas, two glucagonomas, one carcinoid, and 14 nonfunctional tumors) from Chinese patients (27 men, 25 women) collected over a 23-yr period. Of these, 21% were malignant.Irrespective of their demographic data, clinical behavior, hormonal status, or pathological features, none of the 52 PETs showed p53 overexpression.This observation, together with an analysis of the literature, suggests that p53 gene aberrations may not be important in the pathogenesis of PET.
