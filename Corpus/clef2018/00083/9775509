Antiepileptic drug therapy. Successful treatment of seizure disorders in small animals requires proper patient assessment, understanding the principles of antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, designing a strategy for pharmacotherapy, and plans for emergency treatment. Several levels of assessment are needed in managing an epileptic patient to include the diagnosis, effectiveness of therapy, and health-related quality of life assessments. Three levels of diagnosis are important in determining the appropriate AED therapy: 1) confirmation that an epileptic seizure has occurred, and if so, the seizure type(s) manifested 2) diagnosis of the seizure etiology
