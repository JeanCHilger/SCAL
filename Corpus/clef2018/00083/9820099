Correlation of SPECT myocardial stress scintigraphy with coronary angiography. The sensitivity and specificity of a myocardial perfusion single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) for the detection of the coronary artery disease (CAD) was investigated. As a gold standard the coronary angiography was used--the stenosis of the artery by 50% and more was considered as significant for CAD. After performing SPECT studies patients were examined by coronary angiography according to the attending physician's judgement. In the retrospectively created group of 123 subjects (94 males and 29 females, mean age 53 years, range 30-69 years) 55 patients underwent myocardial infarction (MI). The stress was performed using a bicycle ergometer or, in case of patient's inability, an intravenous dipyridamole infusion. Before december 1995 201T1 was used in all patients, after this date only in patients with prior MI with regard to the advantage of this radionuclide for the detection of the ischemic but viable myocardium. Other patients were administered 99mTc-tetrofosmin. In our group of patients we found the high sensitivity of myocardial SPECT of 94.5% 86 (from 91), specificity of 84.4% (27 from 32) corresponding to usually values and the high diagnostic accuracy of 91.9% (113 from 123). Specificity can be impaired by marked attentuation of gamma-rays by overlying soft-tissue structures such as the breast or diaphragm. The artificial imaging of the inferior wall due to the infradiaphragmatic structures represents the most serious problem-there were four false positive findings in our group further ones in our 99mTc-tetrofosmin studies were avoided by the routine use of the prone position recommended in the literature. The validity of SPECT myocardial perfusion findings should be verified by coronary angiography
