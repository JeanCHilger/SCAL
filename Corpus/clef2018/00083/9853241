Positron emission tomography as a diagnostic tool in oncology. Early diagnosis in oncology is important for treatment by surgical intervention, which generally has the highest curative potential. For higher stages of disease involvement, initiation of rapid treatment is indicated to provide the patient with the optimal therapy regimen. Although this may not improve the prognosis, it will maintain the quality of life. Anatomic imaging modalities, such as CT, MR imaging, and US, are clinically important high-resolution imaging techniques that are well suited to reveal structural abnormalities. However, the differentiation of lesions as being benign or malignant is still problematic. Metabolic imaging modalities in nuclear medicine (NM), i.e., single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), can reveal biochemical parameters of the lesions such as glucose, oxygen, or amino acid metabolism, or measure the receptor density status. These parameters may allow a completely new clinical perspective in the management and understanding of diseases such as cancer. Although PET has been around since the early 1960s, it has only recently emerged as a powerful diagnostic tool in oncology. Society has great difficulty accepting this clinical imaging modality because of its high cost and complexity. Current applications of PET in oncology have been in characterizing lesions, differentiating recurrent disease from treatment effects, staging tumors, evaluating the extent of disease, and therapy monitoring. Here, the role of PET in diagnosis, staging, and restaging of cancer is reviewed and compared with the other tumor imaging modalities. We cover articles published in the past 3 years. We utilize the typical radiology format, in which the contribution in each body area is reviewed (topographic orientation), instead of the more organ-based approach used in internal medicine.
