Rapid synthesis of a 5'-fluorinated oligodeoxy-nucleotide: a model antisense probe for use in imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). 5'-Deoxy-5'-fluoro-O4-methylthymidine was synthesized by the reaction of the corresponding 5'-O-tosylate with KF in the presence of Kryptofix [222] and coupled to a 5'-phosphoramidite-activated CPG-bound oligodeoxynucleotide. The sequence of reactions and purifications were accomplished within 4 h, a necessary condition of the development of radiofluorinated antisense oligodeoxynucleotide probe for use with PET.
