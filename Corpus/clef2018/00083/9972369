123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy in diabetic patients: relationship with 201Tl uptake and cardiac autonomic function. To investigate the influence of diabetic myocardial damage (suspected myocardial damage SMD) diagnosed by 201Tl-SPECT and diabetic cardiac autonomic neuropathy (AN) on myocardial MIBG uptake in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).Eighty-seven diabetic patients divided into four subgroups: 23 with SMD (+) AN (+) 19 with SMD (+) AN (-)On both early and delayed planar images, the mean H/M value in the subgroups of diabetic patients was significantly lower in the SMD (+) AN (+) group than in the control group, but among those subgroups, there was statistically significant difference between the SMD (+) AN (+) and SMD (-) AN (-) groups only on the delayed images. Regarding the WR value, there was no statistically significant difference among subjects. On SPECT image analysis, the diabetic subgroup with AN or SMD had statistically significant lower values for TUS than those of the control group. Among diabetics, there was a statistically significant differences between SMD [+] AN [+] and SMD [-] AN [-] on both early and delayed images. Similarly, the SMD [+] AN [-] group also had significantly lower values than those of SMD [-] AN [-] on early images. Regarding delta TUS, there was a statistically significant differences between AN [+] subgroups and controls. Similarly, the mean value for delta TUS was much higher in AN [+] subgroups than in AN [-] subgroups with or without SMD in diabetes mellitus.123I-MIBG myocardial uptake is affected by both SMD and cardiac autonomic neuropathy. Based on the finding that delta TUS was much higher in AN [+] subgroups and there was no statistically significant difference between SMD [+] AN [+] and SMD [-] AN [+] subgroups, a decrease in myocardial 123I-MIBG uptake might progress independently of SMD.
