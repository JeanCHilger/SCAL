Positron emission tomography neuroreceptor imaging as a tool in drug discovery, research and development. Improved communication and cooperation between research-driven drug companies and academic positron emission tomography (PET) centers, coupled with improvements in PET camera resolution, the availability of small animal PET cameras and a growing list of neuroreceptor-specific PET tracers, have all contributed to a substantial increase in the use and value of PET as a tool in central nervous system drug discovery and development.
