Consecutive brain SPECT surface three-dimensional displays show progression of cerebral cortical abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease PURPOSE: To monitor progression of cerebral blood flow deterioration, this study used consecutive surface SPECT to evaluate the feasibility of brain surface displays (BSD) to follow Alzheimer's disease (AD) to determine whether overtime is a consistent feature of the disease. METHODS: Eighteen men (mean age, 75.7 years) with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), with moderate to profound dementia indicated by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE median score, 10
