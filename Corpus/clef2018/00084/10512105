Giant splenic hemangioma: confirmation of diagnosis with labeled erythrocyte scintigraphy PURPOSE: To assess the use of a Tc-99m erythrocyte-labeled SPECT scan to characterize a giant splenic hemangioma. METHODS: A patient clinically mistaken to have a myelodysplastic disorder underwent a contrast-enhanced CT followed by a Tc-99m erythrocyte-labeled SPECT scan. RESULTS: CT showed a heterogeneous vascular lesion arising in the spleen. Percutaneous biopsy was nondiagnostic. A Tc-99m erythrocyte-labeled SPECT study revealed findings consistent with a giant splenic hemangioma, which was subsequently confirmed at surgery. CONCLUSION: A Tc-99m erythrocyte-labeled SPECT scan may be very useful in confirming the diagnosis of a large or giant splenic hemangioma.
