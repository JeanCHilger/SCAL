Significance of segmentary reversal defects in the myocardial SPECT with 99mTC-tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT. To evaluate segmentary reverse defects (RD) (uptake higher in exercise than in rest) in 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT.1,124 consecutive SPECT studies were reviewed and 80 (7%) segmentary RD were identified. Thirty-eight patients with RD attributed to artifact (extra cardiac uptake) were excluded. Thus, 42 patients (3.6%), 21 with and 21 without previous infarct, were studied. Thirteen out of 21 RD in patients without previous infarct corresponded to inferior region and 8 to the anterior region. In three out of 8 patients in whom the coronary angiography was performed, the coronary arteries were angiographically normal and 5 had stenosis of between 50% to 70% of coronary arteries corresponding to RD. Of the 21 RD in patients with previous infarct, the RD site corresponded to the same region of the necrosis (15 inferior and 6 anterior). All had viability criteria (uptake higher than 40% in more than 50% of the region) in rest uptake SPECT quantification. In nine out of 11 patients in whom a coronary angiography was carried out, patency of the artery responsible for the infarct was verified.3.6% of segmentary RD, which were not attributed to the artifact, were observed in myocardial perfusion 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT studies. Half of these cases corresponded to regions without previous infarct and with normal coronary arteries or non-severe coronary stenosis. The remaining corresponded to regions with previous infarct and with viability criteria.
