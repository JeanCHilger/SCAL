Myocardial perfusion and oxygen consumption in reperfused noninfarcted dysfunctional myocardium after unstable angina: direct evidence for myocardial stunning in humans. To positively establish the diagnosis of myocardial stunning in patients with unstable angina and persistent wall motion abnormalities after reperfusion by coronary angioplasty.Although myocardial stunning is thought to occur in several clinical conditions, definite proof of its existence in humans is still lacking, owing to the difficulty of measuring myocardial blood flow (MBF) in absolute terms.We studied 14 patients with unstable angina due to proximal left anterior descending coronary artery disease who presented persistent anterior wall motion abnormalities despite revascularization of the culprit lesion by percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and who did not have clinical evidence of necrosis. Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) with [13N]-ammonia and [11C]-acetate was performed 48 h after PTCA to determine absolute MBF and oxygen consumption (MVO2). Regional wall thickening and regional cardiac work were determined using two-dimensional echocardiography. Improvement of segmental wall motion abnormalities was followed for a median of 4 months (1.5 to 14 months).As judged from the changes in segmental wall motion score, regional dysfunction was spontaneously reversible in 12/14 patients and improved from 2.2 +/- 0.3 to 1.2 +/- 0.3 at late follow-up (p < 0.001). With PET, [13N]-ammonia MBF was similar among dysfunctional and remote normally contracting segments (85 +/- 29 vs. 99 +/- 20 ml x min (-1) x 100g(-1), p = not significant [n.s.]), thus demonstrating a perfusion-contraction mismatch. Despite the reduced contractile function, dysfunctional myocardium presented near normal levels of MVO2 (6.5 +/- 4.2 vs. 8.0 +/- 1.9 ml x min (-1)x 100g(-1), p = n.s.). Consequently, the regional myocardial efficiency (regional work divided by MVO2) of the dysfunctional myocardium was found to be markedly decreased as compared with normally contracting myocardium (6 +/- 6% vs. 26 +/- 6%, p < 0.001).This study demonstrates that human dysfunctional myocardium capable of spontaneously recovering contractile function after unstable angina endures a state of perfusion-contraction mismatch. These data for the first time provide unequivocal direct evidence for the existence of acute myocardial stunning in humans.
