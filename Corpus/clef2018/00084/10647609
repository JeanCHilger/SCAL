FDG PET measurement of the proliferative potential of non-small cell lung cancer. The goals of this study were to correlate FDG uptake with cell proliferation and cellular density in non-small cell lung cancer.Thirty-one patients with 32 non-small cell lung cancers were examined with FDG PET. For semiquantitative analysis, standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated. All patients underwent thoracotomy within 4 wk after the FDG PET study. Cell proliferation was immunohistochemically assessed as the relative number of cells expressing the proliferating cell nuclear antigen ([PCNA] labeling index). Cellular density was also evaluated using light microscopy.SUVs correlated significantly with PCNA labeling index (r = 0.740 P < 0.0001) but only weakly with cellular density (r = 0.392FDG uptake is related to cell proliferation rather than to the cellular density of non-small cell lung cancer.
