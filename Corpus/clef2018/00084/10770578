Characteristics of myocardial 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography in dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocardial 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has been used to assess myocardial ischemia and viability, but few studies have conducted on FDG-PET for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We investigated myocardial FDG uptake in patients with DCM in comparison with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). Twenty-four patients with heart failure were included in this study. Fourteen of them were diagnosed as DCM and the other 10 were ICM. All of them underwent myocardial FDG-PET at fasting and after glucose loading the same day. FDG uptake was quantified by the ratio of the counts at the heart to those at the liver (H/L ratio). Left ventricular (LV) function was measured by echocardiography. We classified FDG distribution patterns in the myocardium in the fasting state into 3 types (faint uptake, regional uptake and diffuse uptake). In DCM patients, 5 had faint uptake, 7 had regional uptake, and the other 2 had diffuse uptake. On the other hand, all ICM patient had regional uptake (p < 0.05). In DCM, there were no significant relationships between the patterns and LV functions. On the other hand, there were close correlation between the H/L ratio after glucose loading and the left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.680, p < 0.01). The changes in PET images caused by glucose loading were classified into 2 types (non-reversing and reversing patterns). DCM significantly showed a non-reversing pattern (86%, 12 of 14 patients) whereas ICM showed mainly a reversing pattern (70%, 7 of 10 patients p < 0.05). In conclusion, myocardial FDG uptake after glucose loading may indicate a myocardial viable mass although FDG uptake at fasting was not evidently related to LV function. The change in the pattern of the FDG image from fasting to glucose loading may be useful in differentiating DCM from ICM.
