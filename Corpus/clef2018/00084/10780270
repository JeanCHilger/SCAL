The dopamine D2 receptor 5'-flanking variant, -141C Ins/Del, is not associated with reduced dopamine D2 receptor density in vivo. The Del allele of the -141C (Ins/Del) polymorphism located in the immediate 5'-flanking region of the human dopamine D2 receptor gene has been reported to be associated with reduced promoter activity in vitro. However, genetic association studies of the -141C (Ins/Del) polymorphism with schizophrenia and alcoholism have yielded conflicting results. In this report, we explored the effect of the Del allele on the D2 receptor binding characteristics in vivo in healthy volunteers using positron emission tomography and D2 receptor antagonist, [11C]raclopride. No difference in D2 receptor density was observed between the Del allele carriers compared to the individuals with the Ins/Ins genotype, indicating that the genetic variation at the -141C (Ins/Del) site does not affect D2 receptor expression level in vivo.
