Improvement of cardiac neuronal function after carvedilol treatment in dilated cardiomyopathy: a 123I-MIBG scintigraphic study. Carvedilol can induce important clinical and hemodynamic improvements in patients with chronic heart failure resulting from severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. This study examines the impact of carvedilol on cardiac neuronal function using 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy in dilated cardiomyopathy.Twenty-two patients with chronic heart failure (19 men, 3 women mean age, 54 yResting heart rate decreased from 81 +/- 13 to 71 +/- 9 bpm (P = 0.003). After carvedilol therapy NYHA functional classification for these patients improved from 2.6 +/- 0.5 to 2.3 +/-0.5 (P = 0.04), LVEF improved from 22% +/- 9% to 30% +/- 13% (P = 0.005), and HMR improved from 145% +/- 23% to 170% +/- 25% (P = 0.0001).Carvedilol induces improvements of clinical symptoms and cardiac neuronal and systolic functions in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and chronic optimal treatment.
