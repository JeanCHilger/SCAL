Gated 99mTC-MIBI SPECT in assessment of left ventricle global contractility. The complex radiodiagnostic study (synchronized 99mTc-MIBI SPECT and equilibrum ventriculography) has been made in 30 pts. The opportunity of use synchronized tomoscintigraphy for an estimation of a global left ventricle ejection fraction was shown.
