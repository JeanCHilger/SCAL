A novel ubiquitous family of putative efflux transporters. We describe a novel family of putative efflux transporters (PET) found in bacteria, yeast and plants. None of the members of the PET family has been functionally characterized. The bacterial and yeast proteins display a duplicated internal repeat element consisting of an N-terminal hydrophobic sequence of about 170 residues, exhibiting six putative transmembrane alpha-helical spanners (TMSs), followed by a large (230 residue), C-terminal, hydrophilic, cytoplasmic domain. The plant proteins exhibit only one such unit, but they have a larger C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Arabidopsis thaliana encodes at least seven paralogues of the PET family. The gram-negative bacterial proteins are sometimes encoded by genes that are found in operons that also contain genes that encode membrane fusion proteins. This fact strongly suggests that PET family proteins are efflux pumps. The sequence, topological and phylogenetic characteristics of these proteins as well as the operonic structures of their encoded genes when relevant are described.
