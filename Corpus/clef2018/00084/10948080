Can serum carnitine levels distinguish hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from hypertensive hearts? Although echocardiography is a useful diagnostic tool in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), it is sometimes difficult to differentiate it from hypertensive heart disease (HHD): some patients with HCM show symmetrical hypertrophy, whereas patients with HHD sometimes show asymmetrical septal hypertrophy. We used a radioiodinated long-chain fatty acid tracer to visualize the altered myocardial fatty acid metabolism of HCM and HHD. Carnitine is the essential substance for the beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. We recently reported that serum free carnitine levels in HCM were elevated and that they were significantly correlated with the severity of myocardial fatty acid metabolic disorder. Therefore, we investigated serum carnitine levels in patients with HCM and HHD, which can contribute to the differentiation of each other. We studied 56 patients with HCM and 20 patients with essential hypertension. Serum free carnitine levels were significantly higher in patients with HCM than those with HHD (HCM 52.5+/-9.5 nmol/mL, HHD 46.6+/-6.4 nmol/mL, P<0.01), but they showed no statistical difference between patients with HHD and normal subjects. Serum acylcarnitine levels were significantly lower in patients with HCM than those with HHD (HCM 10.1+/-4.0 nmol/mL, HHD 14.5+/-4.9 nmol/mL, P<0.0005), although they did not differ between patients with HHD and normal subjects. Scintigraphic analyses with a long-chain fatty acid analog revealed that myocardial tracer uptake was much reduced in patients with HCM compared with that in patients with HHD (quantitative analysis: HCM 2.11+/-0.12, HHD 2.22+/-0.17, P<0.05 semiquantitative analysis: HCM 13.6+/-6.3, HHD 2.0+/-1.5, P<0.0001). In conclusion, the differences in serum carnitine levels between HCM and HHD reflect altered myocardial fatty acid metabolic impairment, and the levels can help to distinguish these 2 diseases.
