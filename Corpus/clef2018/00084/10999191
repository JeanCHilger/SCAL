PET: activation of cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism. Functional brain mapping based on the PET CBF and glucose metabolic methods remains an exceptionally productive approach for localizing brain function. The imaging techniques are remarkably standardized, and localization remains stable with a variety of data analysis methods (140,141). The methods are suitable for identifying functional reorganization in the setting of neurodegeneration, stroke, trauma, and the effects of epilepsy on cognition.
