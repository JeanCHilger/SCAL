PET: cholinergic neuroreceptor mapping. The application of PET with NMPB has provided useful information toward understanding the pathogenesis of mesial TLE, and can be used as a tool in the presurgical evaluation. Many other patient populations have yet to be studied with cholinergic neuroreceptor imaging. The use of NAChR radioligands in the study of ADNFLE may be especially rewarding.
