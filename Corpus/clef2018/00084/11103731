Provocative testing for chest pain. Since the first Chest Pain Center (CPC) was set up in 1981 to speed up the evaluation and treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction, the original concept has been expanded to include rapid evaluation of chest pain patients with the appropriate streamlining of care and incorporation of the latest in technology. It has also been established that among patients presenting with acute chest pain, a very low-risk group with less than 5% probability of a coronary event can be identified. The recognition of this group could prevent unnecessary admissions, affording more appropriate patient care and improved cost-effectiveness. The efficient management of these chest pain patients requires that there be reductions in: (1) delays in therapy, (2) "soft" admissions, (3) inappropriate dispositions, and (4) cost. With time, provocative testing (PT) for chest pain patients has been brought forward to the frontline. PT methods are now being studied in hundreds of emergency department (ED) patients, followed up over several months to ascertain the predictive value of both positive and negative test results. More and more CPCs are now using PT as part of their management protocol, in terms of decision-making pertaining to prognostification, treatment and disposition. This could be in the form of the ECG graded exercise test (GXT), stress echocardiography (SE) and stress single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) radionuclide perfusion imaging. The GXT is fairly widely used currently, SE is gaining popularity and stress radionuclide perfusion imaging will perhaps gain more acceptance as the experience with its use as well as the number of randomized controlled studies increase. As we move into the new millennium, the emergency physicians must familiarize themselves with the latest in the state-of-the-art concepts and technology to render improved, up-to-date and more cost-effective patient care.
