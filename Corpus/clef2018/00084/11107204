Diagnosis of coronary artery disease in patients with permanent cardiac pacemaker by dobutamine stress echocardiography or exercise thallium-201 myocardial tomography. This study evaluated the use of dobutamine stress echocardiography and exercise thallium-201 myocardial computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with permanent transvenous pacemaker with the electrode implanted in the right ventricle (RV). Twenty-nine consecutive patients with pacemaker underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography, exercise thallium-201 myocardial CT, and coronary arteriography over a period of 8 +/- 1 days. None of these patients had suffered a myocardial infarction (MI). The cardiac rhythm of every patient was electrically paced during echocardiography and tomography. Sixteen (55%) patients showed CAD on angiography (stenosis > or = 50% of the luminal diameter of a major epicardial vessel). The detection sensitivity for CAD was 94% for the tomography and 88% for the echocardiography (P = NS). The difference between the sensitivities of the two techniques in detecting CAD based on the affected coronary artery was not statistically significant. Of the 13 patients without CAD, tomography showed a positive result in nine cases, i.e., a specificity of 31%, whereas echocardiography showed a positive result in only one case, i.e., a specificity of 92% (P < 0. 01). Exercise thallium-201 myocardial computed tomography produces an increased rate of false-positive results in patients with permanent transvenous cardiac pacemaker (PCP) implanted in the right ventricle (RV). Dobutamine stress echocardiography can thus be used to reduce considerably the level of false-positive results in these patients and still retain a detection sensitivity for CAD equal to that of myocardial tomography.
