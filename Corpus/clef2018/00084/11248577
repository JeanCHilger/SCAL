The role of radionuclides in primary musculoskeletal tumors beyond the 'bone scan'. Radionuclides represent a means of functional imaging, which is able to reflect the metabolic state of tissues. Recently developed radiotracers and older radiotracers with newer applications, imaged through single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), can provide significant information in the diagnosis, grading, therapy response or recurrence of primary musculoskeletal tumors. The unique ability of these radiotracers to demonstrate non-invasively the efflux pump rate, which is a common reason of therapy failure, as well as the metabolic and proliferative rates of the tumors should be a powerful tool in the orthopaedic oncology in the evaluation of musculoskeletal tumors.
