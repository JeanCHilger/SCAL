Positron-emission tomography (PET) in the diagnosis of malignancy, recurrence, and staging in patients with head and neck tumors. We report a prospective study with 15 patients with the diagnosis of head and neck tumors. They underwent two types of studies, the radiological one with computed tomography or magnetic resonance image scan and the positron emission tomography (PET) with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Five patients did not receive any treatment before, and the PET was performed to evaluate the possibility of malignancy, to determine the stage of the disease and if a recurrence was suspected. The study with the PET has the advantage of detecting small lesions and it is not influenced by radiotherapy or surgery.
