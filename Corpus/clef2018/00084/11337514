Automatic determination of left ventricular ejection fraction from gated blood-pool tomography. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a new algorithm to automatically compute left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from gated blood-pool tomography (GBPT). The results were compared with those of conventional planar radionuclide angiocardiography (PRNA).Fifty-three consecutive patients received an injection of 740 MBq (99m)Tc-labeled human serum albumin. PRNA and GBPT were performed consecutively in a random sequence. PRNA served as the reference, and GBPT images were processed using a new edge detection algorithm. The algorithm is fast (<45 s), fully automatic, and works in three-dimensional space. The method includes identification of the valve plane and the septum. The left ventricular cavity at end-diastole is delineated by segmentation using an iterative threshold technique. An optimal threshold is reached when the corresponding isocontour best fits the first derivative of the end-diastolic count distribution in three dimensions. This optimal threshold is then applied to delineate the left ventricular cavity on the other time bins. The data are corrected for the partial-volume effect. Left ventricular volumes are determined using a geometry-based method and are used to calculate the ejection fraction.The success rate of the new algorithm was 94%. LVEFs calculated from GBPT agreed well with those calculated from PRNA (r = 0.78 GBPT = 0.94 PRNA + 6.33). The systematic error was 2.8%, and the random error was 8.8%. Excellent inter- and intraobserver reproducibility was found, with average differences of 1.1% +/- 4.6% and 1.1% +/- 5.0%, respectively, between the two measurements.This new algorithm provides a fast, automated, and objective method to calculate LVEF from GBPT.
