Clinical Impact of 18F-FDG-PET in the Suspicion of Recurrent Ovarian Carcinoma Based on Elevated Tumor Marker Serum Levels. Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate the contribution of 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) to the diagnosis and clinical management of patients who were suspected of recurrent ovarian carcinoma, based on elevated tumor markers levels with normal or equivocal computed tomography (CT) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).Procedures: 20 patients with these characteristics underwent FDG-PET. PET findings were confirmed in 14, in 7 by surgery, and in the other 7 by clinical course.Results: Recurrence was confirmed in 12 patients, all with FDG-PET positive. In other 2, recurrence was rule out and in 1, FDG-PET was negative. FDG-PET accuracy was 93% with 4 surgeries avoided and guided other 6.Conclusions: FDG-PET is an useful technique for detecting recurrent ovarian carcinoma suspected by elevated tumor markers levels and normal or equivocal results in the morphologic imaging techniques and has an important clinical impact on the management of these patients.
