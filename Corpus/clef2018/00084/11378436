Attenuation-Correction Induced Artifact in F-18 FDG PET Imaging Following Total Knee Replacement. Purpose: The clinical use of PET FDG in the work-up of patients with bone and soft tissue malignant tumors is rapidly increasing. The recognition of any source of artifact, therefore, is important to avoid interpretation pitfalls.Procedures: Two patients with complete knee joint replacement by metallic prosthesis in the course of their treatment for malignant bone and soft tissue sarcoma were evaluated by PET F-18 FDG imaging using a dual head coincidence gamma camera.Results: Both studies demonstrated in the attenuation-corrected images intense increase activity at the joint space between the metallic prosthetic surfaces at the level of the knee joint. No uptake, however, was noted in the same location on the non-attenuation-corrected images. Subsequent bone and thallium-201 scans confirmed the absence of tumor recurrence in the first patient. The second patient had multiple follow up F-18 FDG scans over a period of 16 months that show no changes from the baseline study.Conclusion: In the F-18 FDG PET images of patients with total knee metallic prosthesis, an intense activity tends to be seen in the joint space, only in the attenuation-corrected images. Such pattern of uptake is considered artifactual and should always be verified in the non-attenuated images.
