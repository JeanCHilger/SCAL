Synthesis of tropane and nortropane analogues with phenyl substitutions as serotonin transporter ligands. The effects of structural modifications of 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-phenyl tropane analogues were evaluated on in vitro affinity to the dopamine (DAT) and serotonin (5-HTT) transporters in rat brain tissue. The introduction of a large alkyl group at the 4'-position of the phenyl ring, affording 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4'-alkylphenyl) tropane, diminished the affinity for the DAT whereas moderate 5-HTT affinity was obtained. The introduction of an iodine at the 3'-position of the 4'-alkylphenyl, affording 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(3'-iodo-4'-alkylphenyl) tropane, and N-demethylation, affording 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(3'-iodo-4'-alkylphenyl) nortropane, improved affinity and specificity for the 5-HTT. It could be assumed from these results that the combination of these three modifications of tropane structure yielded highly selective compounds for the 5-HTT. Of the new compounds synthesized, the most selective cocaine derivative, 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(3'-iodo-4'-isopropylphenyl) nortropane (8d) labeled with iodine-123 or carbon-11, could be a potential ligand for exploration of the 5-HT transporter by SPET or PET.
