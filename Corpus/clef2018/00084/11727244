Relation of the cerebellum with cognitive function: neuroanatomical, clinical and neuroimaging evidence. Published studies in the last decades, employing a variety of methodologies, suggest that the cerebellum function is not only limited to motor control but also has an important role in cognition and emotion.In the present paper we review the main neuroanatomical and functional neuroimaging studies supporting the idea that the cerebellum has a role in non motor behavior. On the other hand, we expound the results of the neuropsychological studies of patients with cerebellar lesions. The deficits showed after cerebellar lesions include disturbances in executive functions, learning, memory, attention, visuo-spatial functions, language and personality change. Some studies propose that the cerebellum, through its afferent and efferent circuits with the cerebrum, perform a global function capable to influencing motor behavior, in cognitive functions and in emotion. A fault in this function would cause the behavioral deficits shown in patients with cerebellar lesions.The evidence available in the anatomical, functional and clinical studies support the conclusion that the cerebellum participates not only in motor functions, but also in cognitive functions and in emotion.
