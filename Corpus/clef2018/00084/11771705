Plasma-induced graft polymerization of acrylic acid onto poly(ethylene terephthalate) films: characterization and human smooth muscle cell growth on grafted films. Graft polymerization of acrylic acid onto plasma treated poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films was carried out to develop surfaces for protein immobilization and smooth muscle cell seeding. Films with various graft densities were characterized by contact angle measurements, attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The contact angle was observed to decrease from 72.9 degrees for the virgin PET films to between 26 degrees and 33 degrees depending on the graft density. Storage of grafted films led to an increase in the contact angle, suggesting molecular rearrangement at the surface. However, films with the lowest graft levels showed maximum enhancement in the contact angle up on storage. XPS confirmed the presence of the polyacrylic acid grafts at the film surface and AFM showed a marked increase in the wavelength of the surface roughness as the graft density increased. The amount of collagen immobilized at the surface of the grafted films also increased as the graft density increased. The collagen immobilized films provided an excellent substrate for the growth of human smooth muscle cells.
