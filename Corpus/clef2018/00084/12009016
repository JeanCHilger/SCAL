Quantification of skeletal kinetic indices in Paget's disease using dynamic 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography. The purpose of this study was to quantify indices of regional bone metabolism in Paget's disease and to compare these indices with normal bone using dynamic 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography (PET). Seven patients with vertebral Paget's disease had 1 h dynamic 18F-fluoride PET scans performed. The scans included a diseased vertebra and an adjacent normal vertebra. Arterial plasma input functions were also measured. A three-compartment, four-parameter model was used with nonlinear regression analysis to estimate bone kinetic variables. Compared with normal bone, pagetic bone demonstrated higher values of plasma clearance to bone mineral (Ki 1.03 x 10(-1) vs. 0.36 x 10(-1) ml/min per milliliter
