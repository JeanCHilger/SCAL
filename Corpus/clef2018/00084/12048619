Vagus nerve stimulation. A potential therapy for chronic/recurrent depression?. Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is since the 1990 a clinically useful anticonvulsant therapy for treatment-resistant epilepsy. Open acute and longer term data suggest the potential clinical utility of VNS as an antidepressant therapy especially in treatment refractory depression. The vagus nerve has connections to the limbic system and other brain structures which modulate affect. PET studies showed functional changes under VNS in such critical areas, which can explain the mechanisms of action of VMS. Ongoing studies will have to better establish its acute and longer-term efficacy, and specific indications in the treatment of depression.
