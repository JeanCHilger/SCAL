Application of oral contrast media in coregistered positron emission tomography-CT. Coregistration of positron emission tomography (PET) and CT images results in significantly improved localization of abnormal FDG uptake compared with PET images alone. For delineation of intestinal structures, application of oral contrast media is a standard procedure in CT. The influence of oral contrast agents in PET imaging using CT data for attenuation correction was evaluated in a comparative study on an in-line PET-CT system.Sixty patients referred for PET-CT were evaluated in two groups. One group of 30 patients received oral Gastrografin 45 min before data acquisition. The second group received no contrast medium. PET images were reconstructed, using CT data for attenuation correction. Image analysis was performed by two reviewers in consensus, using a 4-point scale comparing FDG-uptake in the gastrointestinal tract in PET images of both groups. Furthermore, correlation of FDG uptake and localization of contrast media in the intestinal tract in CT images were determined.No significant difference in FDG uptake in PET images in all regions of the gastrointestinal tract except the ascending colon was seen in both groups. No correlation was found in the location of increased FDG uptake and contrast media in the CT images.An oral contrast agent can be used for coregistered PET-CT without the introduction of artifacts in PET.
