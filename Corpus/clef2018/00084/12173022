Detection and chemoradiotherapeutic evaluation of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma using gallium-67 SPET: a preliminary study. About 20 years ago, gallium-67 planar scintigraphy was introduced for the evaluation of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (AESCC). Although single-photon emission tomography (SPET) is now available in many institutions, there have been no reports regarding the evaluation of AESCC using (67)Ga SPET. The aims of this preliminary study were to assess the potential of (67)Ga SPET for the detection of AESCC and to further evaluate whether (67)Ga SPET can predict the effect of preoperative chemoradiotherapy on AESCC. Thirty-eight patients with histologically proven AESCC (35 men and 3 women, mean age 62+/-6.9 years) underwent (67)Ga SPET before and after preoperative chemoradiotherapy. The histological response to the chemoradiotherapy was determined from a surgical specimen of the esophagus: grade 0, 100% viable tumor cells grade 1a, 99%-67%
