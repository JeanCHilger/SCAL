Diagnostic and prognostic value of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Patients with recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) in this patient population.We performed a retrospective review of 143 patients with previously treated HNSCC who underwent 181 PET scans at our institution from May 1996 through April 2001 to detect recurrent disease. Disease recurrence within 6 months was used as the gold standard for assessing true disease status at PET.With equivocal sites considered positive, the sensitivity and specificity of PET for detecting recurrence overall were 96% and 72%, respectively. PET was highly sensitive and specific at regional and distant sites. At local sites, sensitivity was high, but specificity was lower because of false-positive findings. One fifth of all false-positive PET scans occurred at sites of known inflammation or infection. The area under the curve for a receiver operator characteristic curve on the basis of standardized uptake value (SUV) was 0.882 +/- 0.025. PET interpretation, SUV, and physical examination were independent predictors of relapse-free and overall survival in a time-dependent, multivariate proportional hazards model. An increase in SUV by one unit increased the relative risk (RR) of relapse by 11% and the RR of death by 14%. A positive PET interpretation increased the RR of relapse by four-fold and the RR of death by seven-fold.PET was a highly sensitive method of detecting recurrent HNSCC and provided important prognostic information for relapse-free and overall survival.
