Thymic enlargement and FDG uptake in three patients: CT and FDG positron emission tomography correlated with pathology. Our purpose was to describe three adult patients in whom we found increased thymic uptake of FDG on positron emission tomography and thymic enlargement with convex lateral margins on CT. Subsequent biopsy or resection showed normal thymic tissue.In three adults, we found a physiologic uptake of FDG by the thymus with standardized uptake values in the range of thymic neoplasia.
