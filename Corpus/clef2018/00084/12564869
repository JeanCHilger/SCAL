A review of cardiac image registration methods. In this paper, the current status of cardiac image registration methods is reviewed. The combination of information from multiple cardiac image modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, and ultrasound, is of increasing interest in the medical community for physiologic understanding and diagnostic purposes. Registration of cardiac images is a more complex problem than brain image registration because the heart is a nonrigid moving organ inside a moving body. Moreover, as compared to the registration of brain images, the heart exhibits much fewer accurate anatomical landmarks. In a clinical context, physicians often mentally integrate image information from different modalities. Automatic registration, based on computer programs, might, however, offer better accuracy and repeatability and save time.
