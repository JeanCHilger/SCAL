Techniques for imaging neuroscience. In the last 20 years, a number of non-invasive spatial mapping techniques have been demonstrated to provide powerful insights into the operation of the brain during task performance. These are, in order of their emergence as robust technologies: positron emission tomography, source localization with EEG and MEG, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. The imaging neuroscience study areas represented in this volume use the first or last of these - PET and fMRI. The physical principles underlying both of these techniques are outlined, and the important assumptions and limitations are made explicit. The range of applications for each is briefly indicated.
