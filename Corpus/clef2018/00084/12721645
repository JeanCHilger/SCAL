Imaging of neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas. To compare the value of the various imaging modalities in the detection of pancreatic islet cell tumors.Analysis of the literature to compare the value of ultrasound, CT, MRI, angiography, venous sampling, scintigraphy and PET in the detection of neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas.For transabdominal ultrasound a sensitivity of 60% has been reported for endoscopic ultrasound a sensitivity of more than 90%. MRI with a sensitivity of 75-100% is more sensitive compared to CT with a sensitivity of 64-82%. Angiography and venous sampling have a reported sensitivity of 66% and 76%. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy has a sensitivity of 81-88% with significant differences between the various histological subtypes of the pancreatic islet cell tumors. PET does not play an important role in the detection of neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas.None of the various modalities is superior alone, so that it is often necessary to combine them for diagnostic imaging of pancreatic islet cell tumors.
