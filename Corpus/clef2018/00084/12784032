Subjective experience of memory deficits related to clinical and neuroimaging findings. The aim of this study was to evaluate cognitive impairment, psychiatric symptoms and cerebral blood flow (CBF) patterns in middle-aged (35-64 years) and younger old patients (65-74 years) with subjective experience of memory deficits. The study group was heterogeneous with patients fulfilling criteria for dementia, as well as patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and with non-verified cognitive impairment (non-MCI). Seventy per cent of the non-MCI patients reported long-lasting experiences of psychosocial stress tentatively causing the memory problems. The MCI patients were subdivided into two groups: MCI type 1 included patients with isolated memory impairment, while MCI type 2 included patients with memory impairment together with slight verbal and/or visuospatial impairments. CBF measurements comparing the two MCI groups with the non-MCI group were performed. The MCI type 2 showed reduced CBF in the left anterior medial temporal lobe as well as in parts of the posterior cingulate gyrus. The CBF pattern in MCI type 2 concurs with the pathophysiological process of Alzheimer's disease. The results indicate that it is important to make a subdivision of MCI patients regarding the presence of isolated memory impairments or memory impairments together with other slight cognitive deficits.
