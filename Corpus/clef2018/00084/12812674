Relationship between three neuropsychological tests and cerebral glucose metabolism in Alzheimer's disease. To study the relationship between the scores of 3 neuropsychological scales: MMSE, extended scale of dementia (ESD) and Blessed dementia scale (BDS) and cerebral glucose metabolism in Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicated by positron emission tomography (PET).Brain scanning was performed with SIEMENS ECAT 47 PET scanner among 21 AD patients, aged 60 - 83 (10 mild, 6 moderate, and 5 severe), and 15 healthy persons, aged 57 - 73. The ratio of mean radioactivity of cerebral lobe to that of cerebellum as semi-quantitative parameters was used to evaluate the cerebral glucose metabolism. Cognitive function was assessed by three neuropsycholigical scales: MMSE, ESD and BDS.The average MMSE score was 13.3 +/- 6.3 (range 2 - 25), the average ESD score was 120.5 +/- 54.8 (range 28 - 200), and the average BDS score was 4.7 +/- 3.1 (range 0.5 - 10) in the AD patients. The decreases of glucose metabolism in parietal, frontal and temporal lobes were significantly positively correlated with MMSE and ESD scores, and negatively correlated with BDS scores in AD patients (P < 0.05). The correlations between MMSE and ESD (r = 0.886), MMSE and BDS (r = -0.763), and ESD and BDS (r = -0.773) were significant in AD patients (all P < 0.01). Taking the ratio of radioactivity of cerebral lobe to that of cerebellum as an independent variable X, the MMSE, ESD and BDS scorsas dependent variable Y, three regression equations were established as follows: Y = 40.11 * X- 25.32, Y = 309.19 * X- 180.9, Y = 19.97 - 16.53 * X. The independent variable entering the three regression equations was always the ratio of radioactivity of left parietal lobe to that of cerebellum. The ratio of radioactivity of left parietal lobe to that of cerebellum was a significant predictor for cognitive dysfunction measured by MMSE, ESD and BDS in AD patients (P < 0.01).MMSE, ESD and BDS scores correlate well with impaired cerebral glucose metabolism in AD. The function of left parietal lobe may play an important role in the progress of the disease. MMSE, ESD and BDS are good measures for cognitive dysfunction.
