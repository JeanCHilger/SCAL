Decrease in nickel sensitization in young patients--successful intervention through nickel exposure regulation? Results of IVDK, 1992-2001. In the early 1990s, the prevalence of nickel contact allergy was high-almost 20% on a population level, and some 40% in contact dermatitis patients. Around that time, nickel exposure was starting to be regulated.Descriptive and bivariate analyses of patch test results of all patients tested with nickel sulfate (5% pet.) in the departments joining the Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK) 1992-2001 (n=82,991, women: 52,709 men: 30,282). The annual frequency of sensitization to nickel was analyzed in women and men in four age subgroups (<31/31 to <44/44 to 58= or >58).In young women less than 31 (n=13.909) the prevalence of contact allergy to nickel decreased significantly from 36.7% in 1992 to 25.8% in 2001. In young men in the same age group (n=7087), the prevalence dropped from 8.9% in 1992 to 5.2% in 2001.The observed decline indicates that measures to limit the release of nickel from costume jewelry helped reduce the prevalence of nickel allergy. In general term, allergen elimination or reduction is an effective primary prevention strategy which does not depend on individual behavior modifications.
