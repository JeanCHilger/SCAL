Structure-function analysis of the enteroaggregative Escherichia coli plasmid-encoded toxin autotransporter using scanning linker mutagenesis. The plasmid-encoded toxin (Pet) from enteroaggregative Escherichia coli is a cytopathic serine protease, which is prototypical of a large family of bacterial autotransporter toxins. To further elucidate the structure-function relationships of this toxin, we employed transposon-based scanning linker mutagenesis. A subset of insertions throughout the Pet mature toxin (passenger) domain reduced secretion to the extracellular space. Many of these mutants were undetectable, but secretion of a subset of mutants with insertions in the N-terminal half of the toxin could be restored to wild type secretion levels if cultured in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. Secretion of two mutants with insertions at the extreme C terminus was partially restored when co-expressed with a minimal clone of EspP, a related autotransporter protein. Several well secreted mutants with insertions in the N-terminal third of the molecule reduced protease activity over 20-fold, suggesting that the protease domain is located within this N-terminal region of Pet. We have also identified two insertional mutants in the middle of the passenger domain that were proteolytic but no longer cytopathic these mutants displayed decreased binding and internalization upon incubation with HEp-2 cells. Our data suggest the existence of separate functional domains mediating Pet proteolysis, secretion, and cell interaction.
