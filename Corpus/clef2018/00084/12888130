Relation between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and peripheral vasomotor function. Low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are one of the most common lipid abnormalities in patients with coronary artery disease. Endothelial dysfunction is also highly prevalent in patients with coronary artery disease. We sought to determine whether HDL cholesterol levels are correlated with endothelium-dependent vasomotion in patients being evaluated for atherosclerosis. Peripheral vascular endothelial function was assessed by high-resolution brachial artery ultrasound. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) during reactive hyperemia was defined as the percent change in arterial diameter following 5-minute arterial occlusion. All patients underwent stress testing with nuclear single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging to determine percent left ventricular ejection fraction and define the presence or absence of coronary artery disease. One hundred fifty-one subjects (87 men, 64 women) were enrolled (average age 58 +/- 11 years). Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were 188 +/- 48, 47 +/- 13, 108 +/- 37 and 154 +/- 88 mg/dl, respectively. The mean FMD for the entire group was 9.9 +/- 5.2%. Subjects with an HDL cholesterol of <40 mg/dl (n = 39) had lower FMD (7.4 +/- 3.6%) compared with those with an HDL cholesterol >/=40 mg/dl (11.0 +/- 5.5%, p <0.001). There was a significant correlation between FMD and HDL cholesterol level (linear regression, p <0.001), and in multivariate analysis, HDL cholesterol was an independent predictor of FMD. Peripheral endothelial function was abnormal in subjects with low HDL cholesterol and well-preserved in those with high HDL cholesterol. These data suggest that impaired endothelial function associated with low HDL cholesterol may be an additional, previously unrecognized mechanism contributing to the increased risk of atherosclerosis in these patients.
