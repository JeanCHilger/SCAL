Coexpression of the preS1(1-42) and the Core(1-144) antigen of HBV in E. coli. To study the therapeutic T cell vaccine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.The genes of HBcAg (1-144) and preS1 Ag (1-42) were amplified and fused by PCR. This fusion gene was inserted in the prokaryotic expression vector pET-11d and expressed in E. coli.It was showed by SDS-PAGE that the protein molecular weight of the coexpression product was about 20,000, twenty percent of all bacteria protein. The monoclone antibody against Core and preS1 antigen could react with this fused protein by Western-blot technique respectively. The fused gene was verified by sequencing. Under the immune electron microscopy, this fused protein is a typical particle of HBcAg but in an aggregated form.The results may aid for studying T cell immunotherapeutic vaccine to chronic hepatitis B.
