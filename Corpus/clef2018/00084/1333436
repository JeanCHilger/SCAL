The adenylate kinase family in yeast: identification of URA6 as a multicopy suppressor of deficiency in major AMP kinase. The gene URA6 encoding uridylate kinase (UK) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the respiratory-deficient phenotype of an S. cerevisiae mutant defective in the gene AKY2 encoding AMP kinase (AK). The URA6 gene also restored temperature resistance to two different temperature-sensitive mutations in the gene encoding Escherichia coli AK. By contrast, the gene encoding UK of Dictyostelium discoideum on a multicopy yeast shuttle plasmid, expressed under control of the constitutive yeast AKY2 promoter, failed to complement the deficiency in yeast, although such transformants expressed high UK activity. We show that yeast UK exerts significant AK activity which is responsible for the complementation and is absent in the analogous enzyme from D. discoideum. Since UK also significantly phosphorylates CMP (but not GMP), it must be considered an unspecific short-form nucleoside monophosphate kinase. Wild-type mitochondria lack UK activity, but import AKY2. Since multicopy transformation with URA6 heals the Pet- phenotype of AKY2 disruption mutants, the presence of AKY2 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space is not required to maintain respiratory competence. However, furnishing UK with the bipartite intermembrane space-targeting presequence of cytochrome c1 improves the growth rates of AKY2 mutants with nonfermentable substrates, suggesting that AK activity in mitochondria is helpful, though not essential for oxidative growth.
