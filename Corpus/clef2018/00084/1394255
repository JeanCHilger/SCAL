Single photon emission computerized tomography in childhood hydrocephalus. Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) is now widely used as one of the tools in evaluating cerebral blood flow (CBF). The authors report the CBF changes in childhood hydrocephalus. Five pediatric cases studied by 123I-IM SPECT in children are presented. The authors counted radioactivities both in early and delayed images in each patient, and calculated the reabsorption ratio (RR). Two negative-RR cases and three positive-RR cases were found. All of the negative-RR patients had a poor prognosis, while all of the positive-RR patients had a favorable outcome.
