PET-fluorodeoxyglucose of cranial and spinal neuromas. Five patients with eighth nerve, one with ninth nerve and one with cervical neuromas were studied with PET and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Four of the patients had had surgery prior to the PET study, and six patients had subsequent surgery. All tumors were well-visualized on the PET images. Only one patient with bilateral acoustic neuroma exhibited tumor recurrence or growth after the PET study these two lesions showed the highest FDG uptakes in the PET studies (tumor-to-cerebellum ratio of 0.93-0.98). All other tumors were relatively hypometabolic (tumor-cerebellum ratios of 0.43-0.65) and showed no tumor growth or recurrence during follow-up periods ranging from 5 to 8 yr. These results suggest that PET-FDG may be of value in the evaluation of cranial and spinal schwannomas.
