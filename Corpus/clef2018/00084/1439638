Long-term blood flow potentials in sequential internal mammary artery grafts. Exercise thallium scan for myocardial perfusion study. In two groups of patients, coronary artery bypass surgery for angina pectoris included internal mammary artery (IMA) sequential grafts (group I) or single grafts (group II). At postoperative angiography all grafts were patent. In addition, the patients received on average 1.8 vein grafts into other coronary arteries. The mean interval to postoperative follow-up was 9.5 years in group I and 9.7 years in group II. The preoperative incidence of acute myocardial infarction was 44% and 45% in groups I and II. Exercise thallium scan at follow-up showed IMA graft-related ischemia in 33% of the patients with sequential graft and in 64% of those with single graft (ns). Our results indicated that sequential IMA grafts functioned at least as well as single grafts and maintained adequate myocardial supply even 10 years postoperatively. Internal mammary arteries are superior graft material and can be recommended both as single and as sequential graft in coronary artery bypass surgery.
