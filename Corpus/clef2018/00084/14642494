Assessment of the impact of model-based scatter correction on [18F]-FDG 3D brain PET in healthy subjects using statistical parametric mapping. It is recognized that scatter correction can supply more accurate absolute quantification, and that iterative reconstruction results in better noise properties and significantly reduces streak artefacts however, it is not entirely clear whether they produce significant changes in [18F]-FDG distribution of reconstructed 3D brain PET images relative to not scatter corrected images and analytic reconstruction procedures. The current study assesses the effect of model-based scatter correction using the single-scatter simulation algorithm and iterative reconstruction in 3D brain PET studies, using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis. The study population consisted of 14 healthy volunteers (6 males, 8 females
