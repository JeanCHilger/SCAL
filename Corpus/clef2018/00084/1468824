Assessment of cardiac adrenergic supply in mitral valve prolapse using m-[123I]iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. Presynaptic as well as postsynaptic adrenergic regulation abnormalities are reported in symptomatic patients with mitral valve prolapse. This study was undertaken to evaluate presynaptic sympathetic supply by m-[123I]iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy in 17 preselected patients with mitral valve prolapse and symptoms suggestive of hyperadrenergic dysautonomia as compared to normal scintigraphic findings. Mitral valve prolapse was echocardiographically proven within the left parasternal long axis view. Percentual activity of m-[123I]iodobenzylguanidine in 33 sectors of all oblique slices along the short axis was calculated relative to the maximal uptake, set at 100%. In general, no significant differences of mean values of sectoral quantitative uptake of m-[123I]iodobenzylguanidine were detectable between patients and the control group. Only in two sectors of the basal anterolateral region P values < 0.01 were present. Thus, using m-[123I]iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy as marker of cardiac adrenergic supply, no evidence of altered presynaptic hyperadrenergic supply was present in patients with mitral valve prolapse. These findings suggest postsynaptic regulation abnormalities to be preponderant in this condition.
