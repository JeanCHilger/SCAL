Comparative characteristics of stress tests--bicycle ergometry test and psycho-emotional test--in patients with ischemic heart disease. To compare efficacy bicycle exercise (BE) and psychoemotional tests (PET) in provoking myocardial ischemia and arrhythmia in patients with acute and chronic forms of ischemic heart disease (IHD).BE and PET (mathematical count test) were performed in 108 IHD patients. 30 patients had stable effort angina (FC II-III), 48 patients had progressing effort angina and 30 patients were at the subacute stage of myocardial infarction.PET was less efficient in detection of myocardial ischemia but is more adequate in detecting episodes of painless ischemia and ventricular rhythm disorders compared to BE. The greatest differences in efficiency of the tests occurred in patients with acute forms of IHD.Application of different stress tests in IHD patients raises efficacy of detecting episodes of painful, painless myocardial ischemia and rhythm disorders, specifies mechanisms of coronary failure development.
