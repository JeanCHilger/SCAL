Paragangliomas in the head-/neck region. I: Classification and diagnosis. Paragangliomas of the head and neck occur sporadically or are hereditary. The hereditary phenotype characteristically occurs between the 2nd and 3rd decade of life the sporadic phenotype beyond the 4th decade. The hereditary phenotype "paraganglioma syndrome type 1" frequently shows multilocular tumor manifestations and rarely cases of maltransformation. Therefore, paragangliomas should be considered a systemic disease. For diagnosis, an interdisciplinary, step by step procedure is mandatory comprising genetic screening, whole body medical check-up including catecholamine metabolism, and optionally an 18F-Dopa-PET and localised imaging procedures.
