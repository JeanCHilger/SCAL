New fluorescence-quenching process through resumption of PET process induced by complexation of alkali metal ion. [reaction: see text] Under acidic conditions, a fluorescence-quenching process of 1 induced by selective binding of alkali metal ions was discovered. The mechanism of this new process involves alkali metal ion-induced deprotonation of the ammonium ion to trigger resumption of a fluorescence-quenching PET process.
