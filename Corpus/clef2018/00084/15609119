Overview of economic evaluation of positron-emission tomography. Since the 1990s positron-emission tomography (PET) in Germany has been used increasingly in clinical diagnostics in the areas of oncology, cardiology, and neurology/ psychiatry. As the use of PET requires a complex and expensive infrastructure, analysis of the cost-effectiveness of PET compared to common diagnostic methods is becoming increasingly important. This contribution summarizes and discusses the results of a health technology assessment report on the cost-effectiveness of PET.
