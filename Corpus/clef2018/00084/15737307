The value of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) in diagnosis of neoplastic diseases. Positron emission tomography (PET) has the ability to detect cancer based on molecular and biochemical processes within the tumor tissues. The most widely used radiotracer in oncology at this time is the glucose analogue 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG). Like glucose, 18F-FDG is transported into cells by a glucose transporter protein and rapidly converted into 18F-FDG-6-phosphate. PET imaging with 18F-FDG is able to diagnose, stage, and restage many cancers with accuracies ranging from 80% to 90%. Responses to therapy can be identified earlier and with greater accuracy than is possible with anatomic imaging modalities. The prognostic information available through 18F-FDG PET is superior to that of conventional imaging for many cancers. The aim of this review article is to show the most promising clinical indications for the use of PET in oncology.
