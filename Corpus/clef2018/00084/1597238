Physical assessment of the GE/CGR Neurocam and comparison with a single rotating gamma-camera. The GE/CGR Neurocam is a triple-headed single photon emission tomography (SPET) system dedicated to multi-slice brain tomography. We have assessed its physical performance in terms of sensitivity and resolution, and its clinical efficacy in comparison with a modern, single rotating gamma-camera (GE 400XCT). Using a water-filled cylinder containing technetium-99m, the tomographic volume sensitivity of the Neurocam was 30.0 and 50.7 kcps/MBq.ml.cm for the high-resolution (HR) and general-purpose (GP) collimators, respectively the corresponding values for the single rotating camera were 7.6 and 12.8 kcps/(MBq/ml)/cm. Tomographic resolution was measured in air and in water. In air, the Neurocam resolution at the cente of the field-of-view (FOV) is 9.0 and 10.7 mm full width at half-maximum (FWHM) with the HR and GP collimators, respectively, and is isotropic in the three orthogonal planes
