Effect of RGD peptide on adhesive stability of human umbilical vein endothelial cell on polyethylene terephthalate surface. In this study for exploring the effect of RGD peptide on adhesive stability of endothelial cells biomaterial surface, all materials were divided into three groups, RGD group (PET covalently grafted synthetic RGD peptides), control group (PET precoated with fibronectin) and blank group (Non-coated surface). Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded on the materials, then adhesive stability of HUVECs on the varied PET surfaces was observed under steady flow condition, and effects of shear stress and shear time on adherent cells were compared. The results showed that the resistance adherent endothelial cells to detachment by flow was shear stress and shear time dependent. Comparison three groups under the same condition revealed that the ECs retention rates of RGD-grafted or fibronectin-coated group were much higher than that of the non-coated group. Under 8.19 dyne/cm2 shear stress after 4h, retention rates were 13.73% (blank group), 43.33% (RGD group) and 40.75% (control group) respectively. These data indicated that RGD peptide can improve the adhesive stability of endothelial cell on biomaterial and the effect of RGD in vivo needs further studies.
