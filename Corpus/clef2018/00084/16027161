COQ9, a new gene required for the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Currently, eight genes are known to be involved in coenzyme Q6 biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we report a new gene designated COQ9 that is also required for the biosynthesis of this lipoid quinone. The respiratory-deficient pet mutant C92 was found to be deficient in coenzyme Q and to have low mitochondrial NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity, which could be restored by addition of coenzyme Q2. The mutant was used to clone COQ9, corresponding to reading frame YLR201c on chromosome XII. The respiratory defect of C92 is complemented by COQ9 and suppressed by COQ8/ABC1. The latter gene has been shown to be required for coenzyme Q biosynthesis in yeast and bacteria. Suppression by COQ8/ABC1 of C92, but not other coq9 mutants tested, has been related to an increase in the mitochondrial concentration of several enzymes of the pathway. Coq9p may either catalyze a reaction in the coenzyme Q biosynthetic pathway or have a regulatory role similar to that proposed for Coq8p.
