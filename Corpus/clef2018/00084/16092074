How to diagnose multiple system atrophy. The diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (MSA) in life remains entirely clinical. Consensus diagnostic criteria have been developed, but their use does not particularly render a diagnosis of MSA more accurate than are clinicians' diagnoses. Some patients may not fulfill the stipulated core diagnostic criteria, yet display many so-called red flags pointing toward MSA. The additional usefulness of these red flags and of a variety of investigations currently is being investigated, with a view to some of them being incorporated in future sets of diagnostic criteria.
