Contrast-enhanced dark lumen PET/CT and MR colonography in a rodent polyp model: initial results with histopathologic correlation. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of PET/CT for the detection of colorectal masses in a rodent polyp model in an intraindividual comparison with dark-lumen MR colonography.Detection of small tumors with PET/CT and MR colonography is possible in a rodent model. The technique thus warrants further evaluation in animal studies as well as in patients with suspected colorectal disease.
