Kanji word reading process analysed by positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography, involving the H2(15)O injection technique, was used to study changes in regional cerebral blood flow during Japanese kanji word reading. Three-times intrasubject averaging analysis revealed that the main cortical responses occurred in the bilateral (left-side dominant) posterior inferior temporal area for visual input. We believe the left posterior inferior temporal area processes highly complex morphological features of kanji. For language output, left-side dominant activation of the posterior inferior frontal gyrus and the basal ganglia was found.
