Review of non-positron emission tomography functional imaging of primary musculoskeletal tumours: beyond the humble bone scan. Bone and soft tissue tumours are rare neoplasms. There are five major roles of imaging in the management of primary musculoskeletal tumours, that is, to differentiate between benignity and malignancy, to evaluate for local tumour extension, to screen for metastases, to judge the effect of chemotherapy, and to monitor for recurrence. To accomplish this, multiple modalities are required because no single examination is able to complete all these tasks. These modalities include plain radiography, CT, MRI, conventional nuclear medicine as well as positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Elsewhere, PET imaging has been discussed at length, because it is likely to be superior in the assessment of bone and soft tissue tumours over conventional nuclear medicine procedures. However, conventional nuclear medicine may be of value when PET is unavailable. In this review, an overview of anatomical imaging will be given and the role of non-PET functional imaging will be discussed in detail. A variety of illustrative cases will be presented.
