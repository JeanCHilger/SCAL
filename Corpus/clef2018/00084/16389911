Power and sample size calculation of comparative diagnostic accuracy studies with multiple correlated test results. We consider the power and sample size calculation of diagnostic studies with normally distributed multiple correlated test results. We derive test statistics and obtain power and sample size formulas. The methods are illustrated using an example of comparison of CT and PET scanner for detecting extra-hepatic disease for colorectal cancer.
