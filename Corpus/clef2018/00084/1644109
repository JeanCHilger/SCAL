Comparison of thallium-201 and technetium-99m teboroxime myocardial single photon emission tomography with coronary arteriography. Myocardial single photon emission tomography (SPET) using technetium-99m teboroxime (teboroxime) was studied and the results compared with those of thallium-201(thallium) SPET and coronary arteriography in 19 patients. Resting teboroxime SPET was performed initially. Two hours later, exercise teboroxime SPET was performed. Exercise ergometer tests for both teboroxime and thallium were carried out in a supine position. The levels of exercise achieved for both tests were similar. Agreement for the identification of myocardial segments between thallium SPET and teboroxime SPET was 147/171(86%) (NS). When a significant stenosis was defined as greater than or equal to 75% or greater than or equal to 50%, agreement between two radiopharmaceuticals for the detection of diseased vessels was 89% (NS, k = 0.601) or 88% (NS, k = 0.713), respectively. In only 2/19 cases were inferior and posterior segments (3/171) difficult to interpret in teboroxime SPET due to hepatic activity. Thus, teboroxime SPET with a short data acquisition time resulted in a rapid completion for each study and had a good correlation with thallium SPET.
