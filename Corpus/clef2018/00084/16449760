Frontal assessment battery and brain perfusion image in Parkinson's disease. The objective was to compare brain perfusion image using 3-dimensional stereotactic surface projection analysis of N-isopropyl-p-123I iodoamphetamine single photon emission computed tomography between Parkinson's disease patients with a high frontal assessment battery score and those with a low frontal assessment battery score. Thirty nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease were studied. Patients were divided into 2 groups: a high-scoring group whose frontal assessment battery score was 12 or more and a low-scoring group whose frontal assessment battery score was 11 or less. The high-scoring group included 21 patients, and the low-scoring group included 9 patients. They underwent N-isopropyl-p-123I iodoamphetamine single photon emission computed tomography, and we analyzed the data by the 3-dimensional stereotactic surface projection method. Results showed that left inferior parietal lobule and left supramarginal gyrus perfusion of the low-scoring group were significantly decreased compared with the high-scoring group. It is concluded that patients with Parkinson's disease may have frontal lobe dysfunction, but the decreased frontal assessment battery score may be caused not by progressed frontal lobe dysfunction but by parietal lobe dysfunction added to their preexisting frontal lobe impairment.
