Feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen. III. Antibody titers in cats from leukemia cluster households. Serum samples from 182 healthy cats residing in environments known to have a natural exposure to feline leukemia virus (FeLV) were examined for the presence of antibody to the feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen. The number included 138 cats from leukemia-"cluster" households. Such cats previously showed greatly increased frequencies of FeLV infection, as determined by the virus group-specific antigen (gasa) in peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets. The geometric mean antibody titer for all 182 cats with known exposure to FeLV was 4.69, more than four times higher than the mean titer for healthy pet cats from the same geographic areas but with no known FeLV exposure. About 92 percent of the cats in exposure environments were positive for FeLV gsa or feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) antibody, and gsa-positive cats had lower FOCMA antibody geometric mean titers than gsa-negative cats. In the exposure environments, no differences were seen for cats of different sexes, but a higher geometric mean antibody titer was observed for cats 5 years and over when compared to younger groups. These results prove that previous reports of increased incidences of leukemia in cluster households were not due to chance alone, but rather to increased infection rates of cats in the FeLV environment. Also, they suggest that horizontal transmission of FeLV is highly efficient under crowded conditions, and that most cats naturally exposed to virus elicit an active immune response.
