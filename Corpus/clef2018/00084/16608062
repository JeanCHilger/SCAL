Lung motion correction on respiratory gated 3-D PET/CT images. Motion is a source of degradation in positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) images. As the PET images represent the sum of information over the whole respiratory cycle, attenuation correction with the help of CT images may lead to false staging or quantification of the radioactive uptake especially in the case of small tumors. We present an approach avoiding these difficulties by respiratory-gating the PET data and correcting it for motion with optical flow algorithms. The resulting dataset contains all the PET information and minimal motion and, thus, allows more accurate attenuation correction and quantification.
