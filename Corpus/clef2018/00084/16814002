Positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the management of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The incidence of Hodgkin's disease (HD) and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is around 8% of all malignancies. Fortunately, HD and NHL are among the few malignancies that are potentially curable with current existing treatment modalities, even in advanced or recurrent disease. Accurate staging, early therapy monitoring, and posttreatment evaluation of lymphomas are important for optimum management of these patients. We reviewed the imaging findings of patients with histologically proved lymphoma who underwent staging positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), early monitoring therapy PET/CT (after 3 cycles of chemotherapy), and posttreatment PET/CT. PET/CT imaging findings are shown. Utility of PET/CT in recognizing false-positive and false-negative cases of CT and PET alone is addressed. Pitfalls and diagnostic difficulties are analyzed. PET/CT is a new imaging technology that improves the evaluation of lymphoma. This review will help the reader to better understand the imaging findings and applications of PET/CT in the management of lymphoma.
