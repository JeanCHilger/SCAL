Regional metabolism in microsmic patients with schizophrenia. The cerebral glucose metabolism of eight patients with schizophrenia and an olfactory agnosia was compared with that of eight normosmic patients with schizophrenia and eight normal controls. Since all patients were scanned while on their current medication regimen, the duration and dosage of the medication of the two patient groups were compared. Similarly, duration and dosage were correlated with absolute regional metabolic rates. No significant effects were found in these analyses. The patients with schizophrenia had significantly lower rates of frontal metabolism than the normal controls. However, the patients with schizophrenia and an olfactory agnosia had a lower right basal ganglia and thalamic metabolism than the normosmic patients with schizophrenia.
