99mTc-annexin-V functional imaging of luminal thrombus activity in abdominal aortic aneurysms. The mural thrombus of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is involved in aneurysm progression via several interdependent biological processes including platelet activation. 99mTc-annexin V (ANX) is a scintigraphic tracer that binds to phosphatidylserine exposed on activated platelets and apoptotic cells. Here, we evaluated the potential of ANX imaging to assess mural thrombus biological activity in an experimental AAA model. The clinical applicability was further tested ex vivo on human samples of excised AAA thrombi.Experimental AAA was created by infusing elastase into infrarenal abdominal aorta in 17 rats, and 6 sham-operated rats were used as controls. Abdominal ANX scintigraphy was performed 2 weeks later followed by quantitative autoradiography and histological studies. Among the 13 rats which developed AAA, 11 displayed intense ANX uptake within AAA by scintigraphy. ANX uptake in the aneurysms on planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging was higher than that observed in infrarenal aorta of sham-operated controls (target/background ratio: 5.7+/-0.9 versus 1.33+/-0.21 P<0.005 for SPECT). Aneurysm-to-background activity ratios obtained by scintigraphy correlated with ANX activity in corresponding autoradiograms (R=0.69ANX imaging may assess mural thrombus renewal activity linked to permanent flowing blood interface.
