Subjective and behavioural consequences of striatal dopamine depletion in schizophrenia--findings from an in vivo SPECT study. Dysphoria is an integral part of the symptomatology of a variety of clinical states, though there is little empirical data available on the qualitative and quantitative aspects of this phenomenon. The purpose of the study was to administer alphamethyl paratyrosine (AMPT), a catecholamine depleting agent as a chemical probe to induce dysphoria, and document the ensuing changes in mental status. AMPT (4-5 g/day) was administered to a group of medication-free schizophrenic patients (n=13) over a 48 hour period, and changes in their mental status were monitored at 12 hour intervals with the Profile of Mood States (POMS), Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI), Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI) and other standardized rating scales. All of the subjects experienced dysphoric responses of variable severity. The profile of changes included blunted pleasure responsivity, clouded thinking, loss of motivation and lowered vigilance. Subtle subjective changes were experienced soon after the first dose of AMPT and the dysphoria steadily worsened, resulting in social withdrawal and personal distress. Subjective responses were the earliest to manifest, followed by akathisia, akinesia and rigidity. We conclude that AMPT induced dopamine depletion is a safe, rapid, reliable and reversible method of studying dysphoric states in humans. The technique is helpful in examining the phenomenology of dysphoria, the temporal relationship between subjective and behavioural consequences of dopamine depletion, and the role of dopamine in mediating subtle aspects of pleasure responsivity, which is in turn crucial to the understanding of treatment non-adherence in schizophrenia and the origins of comorbid substance abuse.
