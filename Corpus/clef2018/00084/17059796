What are the most useful and trustworthy noninvasive anatomic markers of existing vascular disease? Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in developed countries. Evidence challenges the notion that the severity of lesions on angiography is a predictor of future cardiac events. With the recognition that subclinical coronary artery stenoses are responsible for myocardial infarcts and sudden death, it may be important to identify patients with plaque characteristics that may place them at increased risk. Intravascular ultrasound, though invasive, remains the current imaging gold standard. Computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and single-photon emission CT positron emission tomography are evolving and promising modalities. Functional studies reflecting plaque temperature and molecular imaging reflecting plaque constituents are being developed. We review the pathology of the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque and recent innovations in imaging modalities to assess plaque complication risk.
