Current and future use of positron emission tomography (PET) in breast cancer. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a radiotracer imaging method that is increasingly used in both the clinical care of breast cancer patients and in translational breast cancer research. This review emphasizes current and future clinical applications of PET to breast cancer, and highlights some translational research using PET to elucidate the clinical biology of breast cancer. PET principles are reviewed, followed by a review of current applications of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to clinical breast cancer care. Finally we review work done with other radiopharmaceuticals beyond FDG designed to image a number of aspects of breast cancer biology, emphasizing those most likely to enter clinical trials in the near future.
