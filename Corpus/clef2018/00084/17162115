Communication in the veterinary emergency setting. Veterinarians working in emergency situations are frequently faced with challenging communication situations. Obtaining informed consent is often difficult because of the emotional content of the situation and the limited amount of time available. Emergency veterinarians are also frequently required to deliver bad, sad, or unwelcome news to clients. Using effective communication skills in these situations may decrease the anxiety and stress for the health care team and contribute to several positive outcomes for the client.
