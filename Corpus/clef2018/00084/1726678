Role of [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine therapy in carcinoids. From cumulative reported data the sensitivity of [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) scintigraphy of carcinoids appears to be greater than 60% at our Institute 131I-MIBG scintigrams were positive in 51 of 70 patients with metastatic carcinoid. Twenty patients with symptomatic, metastatic disease have received 7.4 GBq doses of 131I-MIBG for palliation. Most of these patients had multiple large metastases showing no response to other therapies. No objective response (greater than 50% tumor volume reduction) was ever observed
