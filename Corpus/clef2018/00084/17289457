Assessment of age-related morphological and functional changes of selected structures of the head and neck by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. The head and neck is a complex anatomical region that can be evaluated using many imaging modalities. It is important to discern normal structures from ones that are affected by disease and to study how these structures change in their morphological and functional properties with aging. Therefore, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we retrospectively evaluated volumes of the parotid glands, submandibular glands, thyroid gland, tongue, soft palate, and lingual tonsils in 64 subjects ages 13 to 81 years. Volume, attenuation (HU), and metabolic activity (maximum SUV) of the parotid, submandibular, and thyroid glands were assessed retrospectively using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging in 35 subjects ages 10 to 76 years. Metabolic activity (maximum SUV) of the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands tongue
