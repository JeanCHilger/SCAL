The role of FDG-PET scans in patients with lymphoma. 18-Fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a noninvasive, 3-dimensional imaging modality that has become widely used in the management of patients with malignant lymphomas. This technology has been demonstrated to be more sensitive and specific than either (67)gallium scintigraphy or computerized tomography, providing a more accurate distinction between scar or fibrosis and active tumor. PET scans have been evaluated in pretreatment staging, restaging, monitoring during therapy, posttherapy surveillance, assessment of transformation, and, more recently, as a surrogate marker in new drug development. Data to support these various roles require prospective validation. Moreover, caution must be exercised in the interpretation of PET scans because of technical limitations, variability of FDG avidity among the different lymphoma histologic subtypes, and in the large number of etiologies of false-negative and false-positive results. Recent attempts to standardize PET in clinical trials and incorporation of this technology into uniformly adopted response criteria will hopefully lead to improved outcome for patients with lymphoma.
