Radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS), PET/CT image-guided surgery, and fluorescence image-guided surgery: past, present, and future. (125)I-labeled anti-TAG-72 antibodies were applied in radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) to remove gross and occult tumors. It is challenging to handle (125)I-labeled materials. PET/CT image-guided surgery utilizes (18)FDG to monitor the biochemical activity of the tumor and to integrate pre- and postoperative imaging for complete tumor removal. PET/CT image-guided surgery only detects later stage disease. Fluorescence image-guided surgery using anti-TAG-72 antibodies may provide opportunities for intraoperative cancer detection of both gross and occult tumors.
