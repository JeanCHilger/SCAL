Comparison of brain MRI and 18F-FDG PET in the differential diagnosis of multiple system atrophy from Parkinson's disease. To investigate the diagnostic value of brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) in the differentiation of multiple system atrophy (MSA) from Parkinson's disease (PD). Thirty-five patients with MSA (23 MSA-P and 12 MSA-C) and 17 patients with PD were included in this study. Overall correct diagnosis rates between clinical and imaging diagnosis among MSA-P, MSA-C, and PD patients were 80% for visual MRI analysis, 88.5% for visual (18)F-FDG PET analysis, and 84.3% for SPM-supported analysis of (18)F-FDG PET. The sensitivity of brain MRI, and visual and SPM analysis of (18)F-FDG PET in differentiating MSA from PD was 72.7%, 90.9%, and 95.5%, respectively, the specificity was 100% for each imaging analysis, the positive predictive value was 100% for each imaging analysis, and the negative predictive value was 60%, 81.8%, and 90%, respectively. Our results suggest that brain MRI and (18)F-FDG PET are diagnostically useful in differentiating MSA (MSA-P and MSA-C) from PD, and indicate that (18)F-FDG PET has a tendency toward higher sensitivity compared to brain MRI, but a larger longitudinal study including pathological data will be required to confirm our findings.
