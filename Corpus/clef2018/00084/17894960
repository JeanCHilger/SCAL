Demonstration of hypoperfusion surrounding intracerebral hematoma in humans. We undertook this study to determine whether ischemic regions are present that may contribute to poor outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in humans. Hypoperfusion around an ICH has not been reported in humans. Brain computed tomography (CT) and (99m)Tc-HMPAO brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion studies were carried out 51 +/- 12 hours after supratentorial ICH in seven patients selected from a referral hospital over an 8-month period. The widest diameters of the hematoma on CT and of reduced perfusion on SPECT were measured and compared. The diameters of reduced perfusion were measured at the 40% and 20% reduced count levels compared with the contralateral side. Reduced perfusion in and around the hematoma was seen in all seven cases. The diameters of ICH on CT (mean, 53 +/- 12 mm) were comparable to the diameters of 40% reduction of counts (mean, 61 +/- 14 mm) measured by SPECT. The mean diameter of brain demonstrating 20% reduction in counts was 76+/-19 mm, which was 43% greater than the hematoma diameter on CT (p = .004). In conclusion, substantial regions of reduced perfusion surround ICH in humans, which might contribute to poor outcome and be amenable to anti-ischemic therapy.
