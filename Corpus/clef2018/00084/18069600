William's syndrome. William's syndrome is of great interest to neurosclence as it is expected to help understand the genetic and neural mechanisms that underlie our cognitive systems. Although patients with this syndrome have moderate levels of learning disability, some of them, however, have superior skills in language, auditory memory, face recognition, empathy with others and a passion for music. The theory that best explains this syndrome is that the degeneration of the functions of the left hemisphere generates a compensation via an increase in the functions of the right hemisphere.
