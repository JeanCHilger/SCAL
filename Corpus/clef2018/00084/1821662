Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose in multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure. We studied 45 patients who had autonomic failure with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose to characterize the neuroimaging features of multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure and determine the utility of these techniques in distinguishing multiple system atrophy from pure autonomic failure. There were 30 patients with multiple system atrophy and 15 with pure autonomic failure. In the multiple system atrophy group, eight patients had mainly cerebellar signs, seven extrapyramidal and 15 had combinations of cerebellar and extrapyramidal signs. Cerebellar atrophy on computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, signal hypointensity in the posterolateral putamen on magnetic resonance imaging and a generalized reduction in glucose utilization rate with positron emission tomography with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, were the main findings and were seen only in the patients with multiple system atrophy. Decreased glucose utilization (hypometabolism) was most prominent in the cerebellum, brainstem, striatum and frontal and motor cortices. These results indicate clear differences, using neuroimaging studies, between multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure.
