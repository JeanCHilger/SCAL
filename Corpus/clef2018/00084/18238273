Super PETT I: A Positron Emission Tomograph Utilizing Photon Time-of-Flight Information. The physical characteristics and some imaging capabilities of Super PETT I, a positron emission tomograph utilizing time-of-flight (TOF) in its image reconstruction process were assessed experimentally by means of measurements carried out in phantoms and clinical imaging studies. The performance characteristics assessed included sensitivity, spatial resolution, image improvements resulting from time-of-flight information utilization, system dead time, and linearity. The clinical examples included imaging of the brain, the heart, the liver, and a demonstration of Super PETT I's capability of achieving cardiac gating.
