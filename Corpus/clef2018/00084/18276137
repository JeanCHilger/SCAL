PB183, a sigma receptor ligand, as a potential PET probe for the imaging of prostate adenocarcinoma. PB183, a non-selective sigma receptor ligand displaying high sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptor affinity, was evaluated in prostate tumour cell lines for its suitability as PET radiotracer. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties suggested PB183 as a potential PET radiotracer to visualize prostate adenocarcinoma.
