Influence of cell proportions and proliferation rates on FDG uptake in squamous-cell esophageal carcinoma: a PET study. We investigated the influence of cell proportions and proliferation activities on tumor maximum standard uptake value (SUV(max)) in patients with squamous-cell esophageal cancer (SCEC).Sixteen (16) patients with untreated SCEC were examined with (18)F-flourodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). The tumor SUV(max) were calculated. Tumors were resected by transthoracic esophagectomy. Tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for the measurement of cell proportions and MIB-1 for measurement of proliferation indices (PIs). Tumor SUV and histologic data were related by using multiple linear regression analysis.The mean proportion of tumor cells in the tumor site was 58.1% (+/-12.1%) the proportion of inflammatory cells was 34.2% (+/-14.2%)In untreated SCEC-patients, the tumor maximum FDG uptake is weakly associated with the proliferation rate of tumor cells. In contrast, neither the proportion nor the PI of inflammatory cells in the tumor site significantly correlates with the maximum SUV and should not profoundly affect PET interpretations.
