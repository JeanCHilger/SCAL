New staging and response criteria for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. The International Harmonization Project developed recommendations for the use of positron emission tomography (PET) in managing patients who have lymphoma. It provided guidance as to the interpretation of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and generated response definitions, incorporating metabolic imaging with the goal of improving interpretation of response and comparability among studies, leading to accelerated new agent development, more rapid availability of more effective therapies, and the enhancement of outcome for patients with lymphoma.
