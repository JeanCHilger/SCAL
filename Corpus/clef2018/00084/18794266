Gated myocardial perfusion SPECT: algorithm-specific influence of reorientation on calculation of left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Gated myocardial perfusion SPECT allows calculation of end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (EDV and ESV, respectively) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The quantification algorithms QGS (quantitative gated SPECT), 4D-MSPECT, and CARE heart show a good correlation with cardiac MRI. Nevertheless, differences in contour finding suggest algorithm-specific effects if heart axes vary. The effect of tilting heart axes on gated SPECT was quantified as a possible source of error.Sixty men underwent gated SPECT (450 MBq of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin or sestamibi, 8 gates/cycle). After correct reorientation (R(0)), datasets were tilted by 5 degrees , 10 degrees , 15 degrees , 20 degrees , 30 degrees , and 45 degrees along both long axes (R(5), R(10), R(15), R(20), R(30), and R(45), respectively). EDV, ESV, and LVEF were calculated using QGS, 4D-MSPECT, and CARE heart. Because a 15 degrees tilt could be a maximum possible misreorientation in routine, R(0) and R(15) results were analyzed in detail. Absolute-difference values between results of tilted and correctly reoriented datasets were calculated for all tilts and algorithms.QGS and CARE heart succeeded for R(0) and R(15) in all cases, whereas 4D-MSPECT failed to find the basal plane in 1 case (patient B). R(2) values between paired R(15)/R(0) results were 0.992 (QGS), 0.796 (4D-MSPECT R(2) = 0.919 in n = 59 after exclusion of the failed case), and 0.916 (CARE heart) for EDVDespite tilted heart axes, QGS showed stable results even when using tilts up to 45 degrees . 4D-MSPECT and CARE heart results varied with reorientation of the heart axis, implying that published validation results apply to correctly reoriented data only.
