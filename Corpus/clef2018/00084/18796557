Patterns of FDG uptake in post-thoracotomy surgical scars in patients with lung cancer. Increased (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) uptake can occur in surgical scars. This study assesses the incidence, patterns and natural history of (18)F-FDG uptake in post-thoracotomy scars of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. 73 (18)F-FDG-PET/CT studies performed after resection of NSCLC in 61 patients (49 men, 12 women mean age, 66.7 years) were retrospectively reviewed for the presence, pattern and intensity (maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max))) of (18)F-FDG uptake in sites of previous thoracotomy. Increased (18)F-FDG uptake in surgical scars was found in 61% of studies (43/70) (average SUV(max), 3.6)
