Multiple molecular logic functions and molecular calculations facilitated by surfactant's versatility. Two isomeric compounds and , combining intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanisms together, were designed and used as logic gates with configurable multiple outputs ten different logic functions (AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XNOR, INHIBIT, YES, NO, PASS 1 and PASS 0) were achieved by varying the inputs threshold or by altering the inputs
