Clarifying the diagnosis of clinically suspected recurrence of cervical cancer: impact of 18F-FDG PET. Clarifying the diagnosis of clinically suspected recurrence of cervical cancer can be challenging. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical value of (18)F-FDG PET in this context.The medical records of a cohort of 40 (18)F-FDG PET referrals in whom recurrence of cervical cancer was clinically suspected were reviewed. Two expert gynecologic oncologists assessed the level of pre-PET clinical doubt, quality of pre-PET work-up, and impact of (18)F-FDG PET on diagnostic understanding and management using questionnaires.In patients with clinically equivocal recurrence, (18)F-FDG PET had a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 93% (prevalence, 65%). Before (18)F-FDG PET, there was high disagreement about the adequacy of the conventional work-up (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.25) and the presence of recurrence (ICC, 0.24). (18)F-FDG PET increased experts' confidence (median increase, 14% and 25% P < 0.0001) and diagnostic agreement (from 68% to 98%(18)F-FDG PET can help to clarify the diagnosis of clinically suspected recurrence of cervical cancer. In this patient population, (18)F-FDG PET had significant value in diagnostic understanding and management of recurrent cervical cancer, facilitating decision making and treatment planning. Therefore, (18)F-FDG PET should be part of the diagnostic work-up in detection of recurrent cervical cancer. The high positive predictive value of (18)F-FDG PET in these patients suggests that inclusion in intervention trials might be based on a positive (18)F-FDG PET scan.
