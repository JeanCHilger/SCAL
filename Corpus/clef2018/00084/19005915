Novel methods for tendon investigations. Tendon structures have been studied for decades, but over the last decade, methodological development and renewed interest for metabolic, circulatory and tissue protein turnover in tendon tissue has resulted in a rising amount of investigations.This paper will detail the various modern investigative techniques available to study tendons.There are a variety of investigative methods available to study the correlations between mechanics and biology in tendons.The available methodologies not only allow for potential insight into physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms in tendon tissue, but also, to some extent, allow for more elaborate studies of the intact human tendon.
