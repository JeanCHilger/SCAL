Brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in neuropediatrics. The clinical value in neuropediatrics of [99mTc]HM-PAO brain single photon emission computed tomography was preliminary evaluated by the consecutive investigation of 79 children. Planned epilepsy surgery was the most common indication for the investigation. In 56 children investigated because of epilepsy, SPECT yielded relevant information in 79% of cases examined. The corresponding figures for magnetic resonance imaging and CT were 49% of 35 and 36% of 56 cases, respectively. All 22 children with an epileptic focus, ascertained by freedom from seizures after removal of the area or by consistent neurophysiological and neuroradiological findings, also had abnormal perfusion in the relevant area. Twenty-three children were examined because of neurological signs and symptoms other than epilepsy. SPECT findings were useful for elucidating neonatal brain impairments. Hypoperfused areas in the brain of asphyxiated infants and in posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus corresponded to neuroradiological and autopsy findings. SPECT was found to be an excellent tool when analysing cerebrovascular accidents. In cases with signs and symptoms of a diffuse severe encephalopathy, SPECT did not clarify the etiology but provided information on the distribution of the lesions and probable underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.
