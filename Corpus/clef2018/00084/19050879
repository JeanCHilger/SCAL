Agreement and disagreement between contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear imaging for assessment of myocardial viability. The purpose of this study was to compare contrast-enhanced MRI and nuclear imaging with (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for assessment of myocardial viability.Included in the study were 60 patients with severe ischaemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI, (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin and (18)F-FDG SPECT. Myocardial segments were assigned a wall motion score from 0 (normokinesia) to 4 (dyskinesia) and a scar score from 0 (no scar) to 4 (76-100% transmural extent). Furthermore, (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin and (18)F-FDG segmental tracer uptake was categorized from 0 (tracer activity >75%) to 3 (tracer activity <25%). Dysfunctional segments were classified into viability patterns on SPECT: normal perfusion/(18)F-FDG uptake, perfusion/(18)F-FDG mismatch, and mild or severe perfusion/(18)F-FDG match.Minimal scar tissue was observed on contrast-enhanced MRI (scar score 0.4+/-0.8) in segments with normal perfusion/(18)F-FDG uptake, whereas extensive scar tissue (scar score 3.1+/-1.0) was noted in segments with severe perfusion/(18)F-FDG match (p < 0.001). High agreement (91%) for viability assessment between contrast-enhanced MRI and nuclear imaging was observed in segments without scar tissue on contrast-enhanced MRI as well as in segments with transmural scar tissue (83%). Of interest, disagreement was observed in segments with subendocardial scar tissue on contrast-enhanced MRI.Agreement between contrast-enhanced MRI and nuclear imaging for assessment of viability was high in segments without scar tissue and in segments with transmural scar tissue on contrast-enhanced MRI. However, evident disagreement was observed in segments with subendocardial scar tissue on contrast-enhanced MRI, illustrating that the nonenhanced epicardial rim can contain either normal or ischaemically jeopardized myocardium.
