Comparison of maximal elastance and systolic wall thickening using arterial tonometry and gated myocardial SPECT in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Myocardial SPECT using (99m)Tc-sestamibi, (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin, (201)Thallium is widely used in nuclear cardiology. Left ventricular systolic wall thickening (SWT) by SPECT and regional maximal elastance (rE(max)) using arterial tonometry were compared. rE(max) was calculated from time-pressure and time-volume curves. In normal heart, improvement of SWT was 4.1+/-11%, while 6.0+/-16% in dilated heart. Improvement of rE(max) was 0.67+/-1.0mmHg/mL in normal heart and 0.32+/-0.7mmHg/mL in dilated heart (p<0.05). rE(max) can be an alternative variable as an index of regional contractility.
