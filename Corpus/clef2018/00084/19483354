Modalities for evaluating chemotherapeutic efficacy and survival time in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer: comparison between FDG-PET, CT, and serum tumor markers. It has recently been reported that (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is useful for estimation of the chemotherapy effect. Thus, we examined the value of FDG-PET in assessing the efficacy of chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic cancer, and compared this modality with tumor markers (TMs) and CT.Nineteen patients with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma were enrolled. All patients received chemotherapy with gemcitabine and S-1, an oral derivative of 5-fluorouracil, and underwent FDG-PET, CT, and serological examination for TMs before and after chemotherapy.Standardized uptake value in FDG-PET before treatment and survival time were not correlated. A good prognosis was seen after 1 course of chemotherapy in patients whose tumors were in partial or complete remission as assessed by FDG-PET [median of survival time (MST), 12.5 months] or TMs (MST, 13.5 months), but not in CT responders (MST, 10.3 months). Furthermore, patient prognosis correlated with PET and TM assessment of the best tumor response through all courses. Namely, both PET and TM were useful for the prediction of survival or chemotherapy sensitivity of the patients.FDG-PET and TMs can each play an adjunct role to CT for estimating the effect of chemotherapy and predicting survival by distinguishing between responders and non-responders among patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
