Absolute myocardial blood flow determination using real-time myocardial contrast echocardiography during adenosine stress: comparison with single-photon emission computed tomography. To assess the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of real-time myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE)-derived absolute myocardial blood flow for detection of myocardial perfusion abnormalities compared with simultaneous technetium 99 m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Prospective study.Tertiary-care medical institution.79 patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.Simultaneous SPECT and real-time MCE during adenosine stress.Absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF, ml/min/g), microbubble velocity (beta, min(-1)), and reserve values. Endpoints included sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+) or negative likelihood ratio (LR-) and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve.Reserve measurements were feasible in 975 of 1343 segments (73%) of these, 130 segments (13%) were abnormal by SPECT. MCE perfusion parameters clearly distinguished abnormal from normal segments for beta reserve (1.13 (0.99) vs 2.22 (1.36), p<0.001) and MBF reserve (1.80 (2.29) vs 3.69 (2.79), p<0.001). The beta reserve cut-off of 1.60 provided the following: AUC, 0.787Real-time MCE-derived absolute MBF, beta, and reserve values are feasible and accurate for detecting myocardial perfusion abnormalities as defined by SPECT.
