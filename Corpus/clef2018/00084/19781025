Biceps brachii and brachialis tendon of insertion injuries in eleven racing greyhounds. To report injuries of the biceps brachii (BTI) or brachialis (BrTI) tendons of insertion in 11 racing Greyhounds.Case series.Greyhounds (n=11).Medical records (1990-2006) of racing Greyhound dogs with BTI injuries were reviewed. Preinjury, injury, and posttreatment information was obtained via trainer telephone questionnaire and individual greyhound race data. Outcomes between surgical and conservative management were compared.Dogs had elbow hyperextension, positive biceps test, and forelimb circumduction and 82% were male, whereas Queensland's male to female ratio of racing Greyhounds was almost equal. Eight dogs had right BTI injuries. Nine dogs had surgically confirmed tendon injuries: 5 combined BTI and BrTI, 2 mid-body BTI, 1 musculotendinous BTI, and 1 ulnar tuberosity avulsion fracture. Seven dogs were treated surgically (3 loop pulley sutures, single radial screw and washer, suture screws or fracture fixation in lag fashion), 2 dogs were euthanatized at surgery, 2 were rehomed and hence managed conservatively. All surgically treated dogs returned to near preinjury performance 6 returned to racing and at least 4 won races in the same or higher grade. One conservatively managed dog returned to "pet" function. No dog reinjured its BTI or BrTI.BTI and BrTI avulsions are rare acute traumatic performance injuries of racing Greyhounds.Preinjury racing performance can be achieved with early surgical repair of BTI and BrTI and optimal postoperative management.
