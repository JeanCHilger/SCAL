Value of 123I-MIBG Scintigraphy in Paraganglioma. The aim of the study was to evaluate the current role of (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy in the detection and follow-up of patients with paragangliomas.117 patients were referred for diagnostic (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy based on a strong clinical suspicion, positive familial history and genetic testing, or for follow-up of paragangliomas.(123)I-MIBG images were analyzed and correlated with (111)In-octreotide scintigraphy, CT or MRI results. Accuracy of the imaging method was calculated per patient and per tumor per site.A total of 117 patients were referred for (123)I-MIBG diagnostic imaging 80 patients were diagnosed with paraganglioma(123)I-MIBG scintigraphy remains important in pheochromocytoma and functioning neuroendocrine tumors. The value of (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy is high in familial syndromes with multiple neuroendocrine tumors at different sites, multifocal tumors, and relapsing and metastatic disease.
