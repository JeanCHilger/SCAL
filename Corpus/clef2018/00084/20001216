Acute intravenous injection toxicity study of MIBG in mice. Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is an analog of norepinephrine. I-131-labeled MIBG has been thought to be safe and effective in the evaluation of neuroendocrine tumors, mainly in neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma. This article describes the acute toxicity of MIBG in imprinting control region (ICR) mice. Treated mice were administered with MIBG at dose levels of 75, 150, and 300ng/kg with dose volumes of 20mL/kg. The control mice were administered 20mL/kg of vehicle control. The mice were observed for 14 days. Observations included general demeanor, clinical signs, mortality, body weights/total body-weight gains, and gross necropsy findings. None of the animals died during the 14-day study period. There was no difference in body weights among all treated and control mice.
