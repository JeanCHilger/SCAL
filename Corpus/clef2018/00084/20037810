Central opioid peptide-containing neurons mediates therapeutic effect of short-pulse gastric electrical stimulation on dyspepsia-like symptoms in dogs. This study investigated whether the curative effect of short-pulse gastric electrical stimulation (GES) on the vasopressin-induced dyspeptic symptoms was mediated by central opioid peptide-producing neurons. Five female beagle dogs implanted with 1 pair of electrodes in gastric serosa were used in a two-experiment study. In experiment one, the brain was scanned by positron emission tomography in 3 dogs with and without short-pulse GES, and the radioactivity in nuclei of solitary tract (NST) and hypothalamus was detected. Experiment two was composed of 4 sessions. In session one, the dogs were injected with vasopressin in the absence of short-pulse GES. With session two, the short-pulse GES was simultaneously given via the electrodes with the injection of vasopressin. In sessions three and four, naloxone and naloxone methiodide was administered respectively in the presence of short-pulse GES. Motion sickness-like symptoms were scored and compared among the different sessions. The results showed that the short-pulse GES significantly increased the radioactivity in NST and hypothalamic nuclei (P<0.05, vs control). The short-pulse GES could ameliorate the vasopressin-induced motion sickness-like symptoms in dogs. Naloxone, but not naloxone methiodide could attenuate the curative effects of short-pulse GES. It is concluded that NST and hypothalamic nuclei may participate in the mediation of the curative effects of short-pulse GES on dyspepsia-like symptoms. Central opioid peptide-containing neurons presumably mediate the therapeutic effect on dyspeptic symptoms of short-pulse GES.
