Influence of a low dose of amphetamine on vesicular monoamine transporter binding: a PET (+)[11C]DTBZ study in humans. We previously reported increased binding of (+)[11C]DTBZ (dihydrotetrabenazine), the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand, in striatum of some methamphetamine users. This finding might be explained by stimulant-induced vesicular DA depletion resulting in decreased DA (+)[11C]DTBZ competition at VMAT2. In a prospective PET study, we now find that administration of an acute oral dose of amphetamine (0.4 mg/kg) to humans does not cause increased striatal (+)[11C]DTBZ binding but a slight 5% decrease. Our data suggest that a low amphetamine dose is unlikely to cause sufficient DA depletion to detect increased (+)[11C]DTBZ binding and that a higher dose might be required.
