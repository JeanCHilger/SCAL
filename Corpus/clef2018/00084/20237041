Influence of bowel preparation before 18F-FDG PET/CT on physiologic 18F-FDG activity in the intestine. Our objective was to investigate the use of bowel preparation before (18)F-FDG PET/CT to reduce intestinal (18)F-FDG uptake.Sixty-five patients with abdominal neoplasias were assigned either to a bowel-preparation group (n = 26) or to a native group (n = 39). (18)F-FDG activity was measured in the small intestine and the colon.In the 26 patients with bowel preparation, average maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was 3.5 in the small intestine and 4.4 in the colon. In the 39 patients without bowel preparation, average SUVmax was 2.6 in the small intestine and 2.7 in the colon. (18)F-FDG activity impaired diagnosis in 6 patients (23%) in the bowel-preparation group and 11 patients (28%) in the native group (P = 0.5). SUVmax in the colon was significantly higher in the bowel-preparation group (P = 0.002), but SUVmax in the small intestine did not significantly differ between the 2 groups (P = 0.088).Bowel preparation increases (18)F-FDG activity in the large intestine and is therefore not useful before PET/CT.
