Phage display applications for molecular imaging. The advancement of molecular imaging hardware and disease targets has driven the demand of novel probes for diagnosis of human diseases. The high-throughput property of phage-display techniques makes the fast developments of these probes possible. The antibody and peptide phage display libraries have been widely used in ligand-selections for a variety of targets in tumors including osteosarcomas, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, thyroid, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, prostate, bladder, colon and gastric cancers. The phage display techniques also have been utilized in development of imaging agents for tumor therapy response, apoptosis, hypoxia, infection and inflammation, Alzheimer's diseases, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
