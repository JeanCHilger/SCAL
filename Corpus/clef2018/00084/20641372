 Somatostatin (SST) (somatotropin release-inhibiting hormone, somatotropin release-inhibiting factor) is a cyclic disulphide-containing peptide hormone of 14 amino acids (1). SST inhibits hormone secretion, cell proliferation, and promotes apoptosis through binding to specific cell-surface somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) (2). Five SSTR subtypes are identified in the central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal tract, and a variety of benign and malignant tumors (2). All subtypes of SSTRs belong to the family of G protein–coupled receptors, and exhibit high affinity to SST by recognizing the β-turn in the peptide sequence of SST including Phe7, Trp8, Lys9, and Thr10 (2). The structural difference between SSTRs generates specific pharmacological and physiological properties for each subtype, which allows targeting of SSTRs with subtype-specific SST analogs (1). For example, octreotide, a SST analog with a peptide sequence of eight amino acids (D-Phe-c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys)-Thr(ol)), possesses a much higher affinity (~2 nM) binding to SSTR-2, -3, and -5 than binding to SSTR-1 and -4 (>1,000 nM). In addition to symptomatic treatment of tumors in clinic, these analogs are also labeled with a variety of probes for imaging (1).
