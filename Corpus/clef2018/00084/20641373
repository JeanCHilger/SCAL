 Integrins are transmembrane glycoproteins with two noncovalently bound α and β subunits. The two subunits mediate cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, and they act downstream of several primary signaling events that lead to angiogenesis (1-4). Integrins comprise a large family of cell adhesion molecules, and integrin α
