 Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a characteristic feature of a variety of cancers such as lung, breast, ovarian, head and neck, bladder, and colon cancers (1). EGFR is a 170-kDa transmembrane protein that promotes cell proliferation through a receptor-associated tyrosine kinase–mediated signal transduction pathway that is activated by the specific binding of autocrine molecules such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor α (TGFα). An increased activity of these factors is believed to contribute to the progression of cancers. There are indications that EGFR polymorphism is associated with differences in the
