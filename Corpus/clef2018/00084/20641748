. Claudins are transmembrane proteins that belong to the multigene adhesion molecule family and are found in cellular tight junctions. These proteins are considered to be responsible for the establishment of a paracellular barrier that controls the flow of molecules across the intracellular spaces of the epithelium (1). Claudins are believed to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation because they also bind cell-signaling ligands (2, 3). There are ~24 known claudins that have a tissue-specific expression pattern and any change in their pattern or distribution has been suggested to have a role in the pathology of various disorders, including cancer (4). Gene expression profiling showed that claudin 4, also a receptor for the
