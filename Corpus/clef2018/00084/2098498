The membrane-bound hexokinase as a potential marker for malignancy in human gliomas. Hexokinase is a key enzyme in carbohydrate metabolism. Its activity has been shown elevated in cells with high mitotic index. In particular, experimental cancer cells, due to their peculiar energy metabolism, display a hexokinase activity proportional to the degree of malignancy. This is the case also for human gliomas in which glucose metabolism, evaluated via positron emission tomography, has been shown to be predictive for patient prognosis. In order to better correlate these findings, specific reagents for tumor hexokinase (a polyclonal antibody and a full-length cDNA probe both specific for murine tumor hexokinase) have been successfully employed to quantitate the protein and its messenger in cultured cell lines the antibody was also tested in four specimens obtained from human astrocytomas.
