Myocardial perfusion imaging using a technetium-99m sestamibi in asymptomatic and low risk for coronary artery disease patients with diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus. The aim of the present study was to evaluate technetium-99m sestamibi single photon emission tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and its association with some clinical and laboratory parameters in an asymptomatic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) population.Twenty-one subjects with SLE and no suspected or documented coronary artery disease (CAD) accomplished myocardial perfusion imaging. Some SLE and CAD parameters were also evaluated in association with myocardial SPECT.Twenty-one women with a diagnosis of SLE (mean age 36.9 Â± 12.8) entered the study. All patients were in the low-risk category for CAD pretest however, abnormal myocardial perfusion results were found in eight (38%) patients. Amongst the traditional CAD risk factors, there was a significant association between the presence of dyslipidemia and myocardial perfusion abnormalities (P= 0.047). However, we found no significant association between other traditional and SLE-specific risk factors.This study's significant finding was that asymptomatic CAD is common in SLE patients, even in those thought to be low risk for CAD and in the absence of cardiac symptoms.
