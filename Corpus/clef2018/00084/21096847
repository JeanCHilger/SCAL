New reconstruction algorithm, distance dependent exact, with reduced statistical Î± error, dedicated to emission tomography using a collimator with large and long holes. SPECT (single photon emission computerized tomography) is physically one of the worst medical imaging modalities. Despite a considerable and still increasing medical impact, its spatial resolution (beyond 1 cm) and its sensitivity (less than 10(-4)) are both awful. This situation is mainly due to the use of a thin parallel hole collimator. In addition the application of the unfitted radon-transform worsens the figure.
