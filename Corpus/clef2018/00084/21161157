Assessment of residual tumours after systemic treatment of metastatic seminoma: ¹⁸F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography - meta-analysis of diagnostic value. Meta-analysis evaluating the accuracy and sensitivity of FDG (2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose) positron emission tomography (PET) to predict viable residual tumours in patients with metastatic seminoma.Altogether 5 studies with 130 patients were identified. Both FDG PET and the size of the residual lesions on conventional computed tomography (CT lesions either ≤ or > 3 cm) were correlated with the presence or absence of viable residual tumour.The specificity (92 vs 59%), sensitivity (72 vs 63%), positive (70 vs 28%) and negative (93 vs 86%) predictive value of FDG PET were superior to data obtained by assessing residual tumour size (either ≤ or > 3 cm) applying CT scans alone.In view of the data currently available, FDG PET seems to be a clinically useful predictor of viable tumour in post-chemotherapy residuals of pure seminoma.
