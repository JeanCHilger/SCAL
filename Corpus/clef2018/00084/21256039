Automated production of [11C]acetate and [11C]palmitate using a modified GE Tracerlab FX(C-Pro). As researchers explore new applications for positron emission tomography radiopharmaceuticals, the demand for effective and readily available radiopharmaceuticals continues to increase. The syntheses of two such radiopharmaceuticals, [(11)C]acetate and [(11)C]palmitate, can be automated on the GE Tracerlab FX(C-Pro) by utilizing Grignard reactions. Radiochemical purities of the [(11)C]acetate and the [(11)C]palmitate products were high (>98% and >99.9%, respectively) with average non-corrected yields of 18% (n = 3) and 10% (n = 5), respectively. These data comprise the validation trials for site qualification of clinical production of both radiopharmaceuticals.
