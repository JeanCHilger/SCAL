Striatal binding of 11C-NMSP studied with positron emission tomography in patients with persistent tardive dyskinesia: no evidence for altered dopamine D2 receptor binding. Dopamine D2 receptor binding characteristics were studied by positron emission tomography (PET) using N-11C-methyl spiperone as receptor ligand in patients on longterm treatment with neuroleptic drugs and in control subjects. Eight of the patients had symptoms of tardive dyskinesia whereas three patients did not have any symptoms. Control subjects comprised 5 healthy volunteers and 7 patients with pituitary tumors. All patients had been free of neuroleptic drugs for at least 4 weeks. The time dependent regional radioactivity in the striatum was measured and the receptor binding rate, k3, proportional to receptor number, Bmax and association rate for the receptor was calculated in relation to the cerebellum. The lack in difference in k3 values between TD patients, neuroleptic treated patients without TD and control subjects throws doubt on the hypothesis that changes in striatal D2 dopamine receptor number or binding affinity is an etiological mechanism for persistent TD.
