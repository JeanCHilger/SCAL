Challenges in chelating positron emitting copper isotopes: tailored synthesis of unsymmetric chelators to form ultra stable complexes. The synthesis of chelators that form high stability complexes with copper(II) isotopes and do not suffer from transchelation in vivo has been a goal for many chemists. Such chelators will facilitate the exploitation of the (64)Cu isotope (t(1/2) = 12.7 h, β(+) (19%) β(-) (39%)
