Radiologic evaluation of the neck: a review of radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other imaging modalities for neck pain. The patient with neck pain may pose a diagnostic dilemma for the treating physician. As with other areas of medicine, imaging is guided by the history and physical examination. The steady advance of 3-dimensional, functional, and nuclear medicine studies make it increasingly important that the ordering physician be aware of the potential benefits and disadvantages of imaging options. This article reviews the current literature on imaging for the patient with neck pain, illustrates several imaging abnormalities, and discusses the workup of commonly seen patient populations.
