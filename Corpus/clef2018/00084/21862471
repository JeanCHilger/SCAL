Effects of exercise and human contact on animal welfare in a dog shelter. The aim of the study is to investigate the reduction of stress in dogs in municipal shelters through easy-to-implement activities, ie, 25-minute sessions of exercise and human contact, that do not require a significant investment in terms of funding, staff or time. The results demonstrate that the dogs taking part in these sessions have lower salivary cortisol levels (F=121.42 P<0.05) and achieve better scores on a behaviour test (t(17)=4.27
