Cloning and expression of a outer membrance protein gene(OmpS(2)) of Edwardsiella tarda HB01 and its immunogenicity. To construct a recombinant strain BL21(DE3)(pET-28a-OmpS(2)),  and obtain a genetic engineering vaccine to provide protective immunity against diseases caused by Edwardsiella tarda.According to the GenBank sequences (GenBank Accession No. AY078509), one pair of primers was designed and the outer membrance protein gene (OmpS(2)) of Edwardsiella tarda HB01 was amplified by PCR.  The OmpS(2)The immunogenicity of the expressed OmpS(2) protein was confirmed by Western blotting. Mice and Paralichthys olivaceus were immunized with the genetic engineering vaccines of Edwardsiella tarda and Aeromonas hydrophila,  showing promise that all these vaccines have a high protective ability.  And the protective ability to Edwardsiella tarda and Aeromonas hydrophila in Paralichthys olivaceus respectively reached  70% and 80%.The recombinant strain BL21 (DE3)(pET-28a-OmpS(2)) could be candidate of genetic engineering vaccine to provide protective immunity against diseases caused by Edwardsiella tarda.
