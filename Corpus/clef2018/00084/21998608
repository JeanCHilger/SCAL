Kinetics of proinflammatory cytokines after intraperitoneal injection of tribromoethanol and a tribromoethanol/xylazine combination in ICR mice. Tribromoethanol (2,2,2-tribromoethanol, TBE) is a popular injectable anesthetic agent used in mice in Korea. Our goal was to assess the risks associated with side effects (lesions) in the abdominal cavity, especially at high doses. To understand the underlying pathophysiological changes, we examined levels of cytokines through ELISA of abdominal lavage fluid and spleen collected from mice treated with low and high-dose TBE. ICR mice were anesthetized using one of the following protocols: a combination of TBE 200 mg/kg (1.25%) and xylazine 10 mg/kg TBE 400 mg/kg (1.25%)
