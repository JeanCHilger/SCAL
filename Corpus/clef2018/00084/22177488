Pulmonary cryptococcosis: analysis of 38 cases. To investigate the clinical features, radiology, diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary cryptococcosis.A total of 38 cases of pulmonary cryptococcosis, confirmed by pathological examinations at Fuzhou General Clinical Medical College, Fujian Medical University from March 2003 to February 2010, were retrospectively studied.All of the cases were community-acquired. The patients consisted of 29 males and 9 females, aged from 21 to 70 years. There were no underlying diseases in 29 cases. The CD(4) cell numbers were normal in 20 patients. Radiological study showed that the majority of the lesions (35 cases) were close to the pleura. Lower lungs were often involved (left 21 and right 23). Pulmonary nodules, either solitary nodules (11 cases) or multiple nodules (16 cases), were the most common CT finding. The lesions had a higher standardized uptake value (SUV) in 4 patients with a PET-CT scan. The lung specimens of 33 cases were obtained by CT guided transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy. The disease was cured in 34 cases, and improved in 3 cases, but 1 died.Pulmonary cryptococcosis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions of the lungs. The disease has some characteristics on radiology, such as multiple lesions, always close to the pleura and occurs frequently in the lower lungs. CT guided percutaneous biopsy is a safe and effective method for diagnosis.
