Synthesis of [18F]-labeled (6-fluorohexyl)triphenylphosphonium cation as a potential agent for myocardial imaging using positron emission tomography. Lipophilic cations such as phosphonium salts penetrate the hydrophobic barriers of the plasma and mitochondrial membranes and accumulate in mitochondria in response to the negative inner-transmembrane potentials. Thus, as newly developed noninvasive imaging agents, [(18)F]-labeled phosphonium salts may serve as molecular "voltage sensor" probes to investigate the role of mitochondria, particularly in myocardial disease. The present study reports the radiosynthesis of (6-fluorohexyl)triphenylphosphonium salt (3) as a potential agent for myocardial imaging by using positron emission tomography (PET). The reference compound of (6-[(18)F]fluorohexyl)triphenylphosphonium salt ([(18)F]3) was synthesized with 74% yield via three-step nucleophilic substitution reactions. The reference compound was radiolabeled via two-step nucleophilic substitution reactions of no-carrier-added [(18)F]fluoride with the precursor hexane-1,6-diyl bis(4-methylbenzenesulfonate) in the presence of Kryptofix 2.2.2 and K(2)CO(3). The radiolabeled compound was synthesized with 15-20% yield. The radiochemical purity was >98% by analytical HPLC, and the specific activity was >6.10-6.47 TBq/Î¼mol. The cellular uptake assay showed preferential uptake of [(18)F]3 in cardiomyocytes. The results of biodistribution and micro-PET imaging studies of [(18)F]3 in mice and rats showed preferential accumulation in the myocardium. The results suggest that this compound would be a promising candidate for myocardial imaging.
