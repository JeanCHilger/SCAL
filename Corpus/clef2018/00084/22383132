Assessment of dementia risk in aging adults using both FDG-PET and FDDNP-PET imaging. In a previous study, positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile (FDDNP), a molecule that binds to plaques and tangles in vitro, identified three subgroups of non-demented subjects according to FDDNP binding patterns: low global (LG) binding high frontal, parietal, medial temporal binding (HF/PA)Fifty-four subjects with normal aging (N = 28) or amnestic forms of mild cognitive impairment (N = 26) underwent FDDNP-PET and FDG-PET scanning. Subjects in the LG, HF/PA, and HT/PC FDDNP subgroups were compared according to visual ratings, statistical parametric mapping, and automated region of interest analyses of their FDG-PET data.The FDDNP-PET subgroups demonstrated different glucose metabolic patterns according to visual ratings, region of interest, and statistical parametric mapping analyses of FDG-PET data. The LG FDDNP subgroup showed no areas of significant hypometabolism relative to the other subgroups and had low Alzheimer's disease risk by FDG-PET standards. The HF/PA FDDNP subgroup demonstrated hypometabolism in bilateral inferior parietal/parietotemporal, bilateral posterior cingulate, perisylvian, mid-temporal gyrus, and dorsolateral prefrontal regions, which is a pattern suggestive of high Alzheimer's disease risk. The HT/PC FDDNP subgroup demonstrated heterogeneous FDG-PET patterns with predominant anterior frontal and anterior temporal hypometabolism, suggestive of mixed etiologies, including fronto-temporal dementia risk.The FDG-PET data provided independent validation that different patterns of FDDNP-PET binding in non-demented individuals may be associated with differential dementia risk.
