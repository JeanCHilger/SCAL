Grooming in pet birds. Grooming a bird refers to clipping wing feathers, trimming claws (nails), and on occasion, smoothing and trimming the beak. A veterinarian or experienced technician can perform this service on an otherwise healthy bird. Some disease states can result in nail and beak problems consequently, all birds should be properly examined at regular intervals every 6 to 12 months.
