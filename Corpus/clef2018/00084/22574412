Usefulness of 18F-FDG-PET/CT for diagnosis of large vessel vasculitis. Positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodesoxyglucose allows to locate pathological foci expressing a high metabolism. Originally shown in the investigation of neoplasia, this procedure is increasingly used as a new tool to search for inflammatory syndromes. Systemic vasculitis is a complex disorder, often manifested by non specific symptoms. Diagnosis at early stages allows early treatment, which may prevent progression to later complications. Through a case report and a review of the literature, this article describes the important role of PET/CT for the diagnosis when traditional tests remain unsuccessful.
