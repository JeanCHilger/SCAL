Long-term outcomes after autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with POEMS syndrome (osteosclerotic myeloma): a single-center experience. The POEMS syndrome (polyradiculoneuropathy, organomegaly, multiple endocrinopathies, monoclonal protein, skin changes) is a rare disease associated with a plasma cell dyscrasia. Patients with disseminated POEMS can be treated with high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). While clinical improvement is nearly universal in these patients, the long-term outcomes after transplantation are unclear. We therefore assessed the long-term clinical outcomes of 59 POEMS patients treated with ASCT at our institution. With a median follow-up of 45 months, 14 patients have progressed with a progression-free survival of 98% and 75% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. Factors associated with progression have included an IgG-Î» monoclonal component (hazard ratio [HR] 7.5 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-28.3
