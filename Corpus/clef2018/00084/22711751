A prospective comparison of 18F-FDG PET/CT and CT as diagnostic tools to identify the primary tumor site in patients with extracervical carcinoma of unknown primary site. The aim of the present study was to evaluate prospectively the diagnostic value of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) and conventional CT regarding the ability to detect the primary tumor site in patients with extracervical metastases from carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) site.From January 2006 to December 2010, 136 newly diagnosed CUP patients with extracervical metastases underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT. A standard of reference (SR) was established by a multidisciplinary team to ensure that the same set of criteria were used for classification of patients, that is, either as CUP patients or patients with a suggested primary tumor site. The independently obtained suggestions of primary tumor sites using PET/CT and CT were correlated with the SR to reach a consensus regarding true-positive (TP), true-negative, false-negative, and false-positive results.SR identified a primary tumor site in 66 CUP patients (48.9%). PET/CT identified 38 TP primary tumor sites and CT identified 43 TP primary tumor sites. No statistically significant differences were observed between (18)F-FDG PET/CT and CT alone in regard to sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.In the general CUP population with multiple extracervical metastases (18)F-FDG PET/CT does not represent a clear diagnostic advantage over CT alone regarding the ability to detect the primary tumor site.
