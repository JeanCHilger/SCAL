Value of etomidate for the temporary clamping in early surgery, in normotension, of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Preliminary study of 8 cases. For 8 cases of aneurysmal ruptures in patients between twenty two and sixty-six years old, with clinical grade I or II, without diabetes neither high blood pressure, all of them underwent before the third day, with EEG monitoring, the surgical technic requires a temporary clipping of the carrying vessel (extreme times: 2 min 30 and 16 min), with a normal mean blood pressure. mean (ASBP) The circulatory cerebral brain protection is obtained with vascular filling before the clipping time and administration of Etomidate, (0.4 mg.kg-1) as soon as the aneurysm is exposed. For etomidate the posology is. The total required dose of Etomidate was about 98 mg. In all cases this protocol well tolerated (no neurological deficit) enables a good brain protection without cardio-vascular inconveniences of high barbiturate posologies. The waking up is very quick and allows a very early neurological check-up and a return to the presurgery tensional pattern too.
