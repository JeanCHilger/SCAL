Accurate preoperative staging of gastric cancer with combined endoscopic ultrasonography and PET-CT. Accurate staging of gastric cancer is helpful to determine the most appropriate therapy, but no staging modality has been accepted as the standard. Objective is to evaluate the usefulness of endoscopic ultrasonograph (EUS) combined with position emission tomography and computed tomograph (PET-CT) in gastric cancer staging. A total of 124 patients confirmed with gastric cancer were subjected to staging with EUS and PET-CT scanning. The detection rate of primary tumor was 99.2% by combination use of two modalities and 97.6% by EUS alone (p = 0.6219), but the detection rate was 90.3% (112 of 124) by PET-CT alone (compared with the combination, p = 0.0027 compared with EUS alone, p = 0.0299). The locoregional lymph node invasion was identified in 84/124 (67.7%) by combined PET-CT and EUS, which was obviously higher than that with EUS (52.4%) or PET-CT (43.5%) alone (p = 0.0194 and p = 0.0002, respectively). There was no statistical difference in identification of celiac axis lymph node metastasis among three methods, but the combined examination or PET-CT alone was more effective than EUS alone in the detection of distant metastases (all p < 0.01). Furthermore, the combined EUS and PET-CT was more optimal than using EUS or PET-CT alone in the accurate T and N staging and the effect on change of treatment. The present study indicates that the combination of EUS and PET-CT is an ideal modality in the preoperative staging of gastric cancer and it provides beneficial guidance for the treatment of gastric cancer.
