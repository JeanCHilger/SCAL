How reliable are odour assessments? This paper will demonstrate the differences found in odour test results, when odour sampling is performed at the same sources by two different consultants. By examining two case studies, this paper will highlight that the difference between the results can be significant. Both studies are based on odour sampling programs determining the odour removal efficiency of odour control units installed at two different facilities: a pet food facility and an oil/grease recycling facility. The first study is based on odour measurements at the inlet and outlet of the unit installed by Applied Plasma Physics AS at the pet food facility. Odour assessments were performed by two separate consultants at the same time. The second study is based on testing of the odour removal effectiveness of two units: a scrubber and a biofilter at an oil/grease recycling facility. During this study two odour sampling programs were performed by two consultants at different times, but under the same process conditions. This paper will show how varying results can play a role in choosing the adequate odour control technologies. The final results suggest that although, an odour control unit may appear to be insufficient, it actually is successful at removing the odours.
