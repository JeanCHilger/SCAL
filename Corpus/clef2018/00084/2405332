Regional cerebral blood flow studied by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Clinical experience based on regional cerebral blood flow investigations with 99mTc HMPAO SPECT in 164 patients is reported. The pharmacokinetics of the 99mTc HMPAO are summarised, and the important indications of the investigations are interpreted in case reports (stroke, surgical solution of intracavernous aneurysm, Alzheimer and multiinfarct types of dementias). The literature data suggest that the diagnostic possibilities with this method are good in other diseases too, this area is surveyed briefly.
