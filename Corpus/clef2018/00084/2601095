F-18 FDG PET in dementia. Glucose metabolism was measured by F-18 FDG PET in 33 patients with dementia. In patients with DAT, rCMRgl showed marked decrease in the associated areas in the temporo-parietal lobes, and it was relatively preserved in the primary cortices such as sensory, motor and visual areas. Frontal lobes were also involved in patients with advanced disease. In Pick disease, the frontal lobes were severely impaired. Multi-infarct dementia, Parkinson dementia and supranuclear palsy showed diffuse or multiple involvement throughout the entire brain. Correlation with rCMRgl and clinical severity was found in DAT patients. In conclusion, F-18 FDG PET is clinically useful in the differential diagnosis and grading of dementias.
