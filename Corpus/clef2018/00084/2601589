Radioanatomy of cerebral perfusion in single-photon emission-computed tomography using 99mTc-labelled amines. A study was made of the cerebral hemodynamics by assessing the distribution in single-photon emission computerized tomography with 99mTc-hexamethyl-propyleneminoxyne in health using a Testascan in 9 standard slices. The whole set of tomographic slices was conventionally divided into 3 levels. For better orientation in gamma-tomographic images, pictures were presented where in addition to scintigrams a morphological scheme of the cerebral parts with the marked parts perfused by cerebral arteries, was given.
