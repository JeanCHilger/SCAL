Positron emission tomography compared with magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography in supratentorial gliomas using multiple stereotactic biopsies as reference. Ten patients with findings at computed tomography (CT) suggesting intracranial supratentorial glioma were investigated to compare the diagnostic efficacy of this technique with that of positron emission tomography (PET) using 11C-methionine and examinations with magnetic resonance (MR). The findings were related to histopathologic examination of serial stereotactic biopsies, which were guided by the appearance of the lesions on PET examination. To obtain corresponding slice orientation with the different examination techniques, an individually shaped helmet fixation was used. However, in 3 cases this fixation device could not be used for MR. Histopathologic diagnosis, obtained in all cases from multiple target stereotactic biopsies, included glioma in 9 patients and reactive gliosis in one case. A detailed comparison of the three imaging techniques and the findings at stereotactic biopsies was possible in 7 patients, while in 3 patients comparison with MR was less exact due to the patient's refusal to wear the helmet during this examination. MR was the most accurate method for outlining the total extent of a lesion, i.e. the tumor and the edema surrounding it. Four lesions had homogeneous signal characteristics and in 6 lesions two (or more) compartments could be distinguished with MR. In 5 cases the MR findings were in complete agreement with the histopathologic findings. However, a thorough correlation between signal characteristics and histology was not possible. Using PET the occurrence and the extent of tumor tissue was correctly predicted in 7 patients. The PET was normal in one case. Findings at CT were in agreement with the histopathologic diagnosis in 5 patients. MR was the most sensitive method for the detection of lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
