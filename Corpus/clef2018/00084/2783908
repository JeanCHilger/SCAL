Quantification of myocardial ischemia and infarction with single photon emission computed tomography. To evaluate the feasibility of 201Tl single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for quantitative detection of myocardial infarction and ischemia, scintigraphic studies were related to angiographic findings. In study A infarct sizes with SPECT were compared with the angiographic infarct sizes of 30 patients. A linear correlation was found for the % infarct of the left ventricular circumference between both methods (r = 0.73 P less than 0.001
