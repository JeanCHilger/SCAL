Human dopamine receptor subtypes--in vitro binding analysis using 3H-SCH 23390 and 3H-raclopride. Affinities and regional densities of the D1- and D2-dopamine receptor subtypes were studied in the human post-mortem brain in vitro using the two selective radioligands 3H-SCH 23390 and 3H-raclopride. 3H-Raclopride binding was confined to the caudate nucleus, the putamen and the substantia nigra, while 3H-SCH 23390 bound to cortical regions as well. The binding of 3H-SCH 23390 was reduced by a low concentration of ketanserin, indicating binding to 5-HT2 receptors in addition to the D1-dopamine receptors. The endogenous neurotransmitter dopamine interacted potently both with the D1-dopamine receptor and the D2-dopamine receptor, displaying two affinity states for each subtype. The distribution of the dopamine receptor subtypes obtained in the present in vitro investigation is in agreement with data obtained with 11C-SCH 23390 and 11C-raclopride in positron emission tomographic studies in human volunteers.
