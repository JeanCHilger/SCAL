Radiobrominated spiroperidol for the study of dopamine D2 receptors. Some neuropsychiatric disorders have been suggested to be related to the CNS dopaminergic system. In order to probe this neurotransmitter system, radiobrominated spiroperidol, a potent dopamine (DA) D2-receptor antagonist, was developed. This review deals with the routine synthesis of [75, 76, or 77Br]-p-bromospiroperidol (BrSP), its validation as a radiopharmaceutical directed to DA D2 receptors, and the imaging studies which have been done using this radioligand with either single photon tomography (SPECT) or positron tomography (PET). [*Br]BrSP will be compared to other D2 ligands currently available. The present state and future direction of DA receptor research, in particular, the quantitative aspects, will be discussed.
