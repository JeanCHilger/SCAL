Comparison of MIBG and monoamines uptake mechanisms: pharmacological animal and blood platelets studies. The uptake of MIBG, a scintigraphic agent widely used in the detection of APUD tumours, was studied with a pharmacological approach on an in vitro and an in vivo models. MIBG as well as norepinephrine (NE) was taken up by human blood platelets, a model for presynaptic nerve endings amine uptake, with a thermodependant mechanism. MIBG and NE uptake was inhibited by desimipramine and reserpine. However, MIBG but not NE uptake was inhibited by fluvoxamine, a serotonin (5HT) uptake inhibitor. This suggests that MIBG is a NE and also a 5HT uptake tracer which involves uptake one and vesicular storage mechanisms. In rats treated with 6-hydroxydopamine to induce a chemical sympathectomy, we observed an inhibition of uptake similar for MIBG and NE in the heart, the salivary glands and the spleen, but no effect was observed in the liver. Some clinical inferences to best investigate specific monoamine uptake are drawn from these results.
