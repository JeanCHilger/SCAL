The reliability of thallium-201 myocardial tomography in a clinical setting without exclusions for drugs or suboptimal exercise. A prospective study of 181 patients who underwent SPECT thallium stress imaging produced a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 90%, and an accuracy of 93%. Clinically it is often hard to withhold cardiac medications or exclude attempts at diagnosis even after suboptimal stress. These results indicate that tomographic thallium stress testing provides excellent clinical information, even in a relatively unselected population.
