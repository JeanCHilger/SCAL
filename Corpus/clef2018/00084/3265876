Drug distribution in dog brain studied by positron emission tomography. We used positron emission tomography to monitor the distribution of radioactivity in dog brain and muscle following i.v. administration of 11C-labelled antipyrine, imipramine, and quinidine. Twenty-five sequential scans of a transaxial slice of the head were performed within 90 min radioactivity in plasma was measured in a gamma-counter. Following i.v. injection of [11C]antipyrine (50 mg kg-1
