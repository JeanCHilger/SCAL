Complex partial seizures: cerebral structure and cerebral function. We studied the relationships between cerebral structure and function in 10 patients with complex partial seizures who had major cerebral lesions, including porencephalic cysts, tuberose sclerosis, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and cerebral hemiatrophy. Evaluation included computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, EEG, and positron emission tomography (PET) using [18F]-2-deoxyglucose. Surface EEG usually showed widespread, bilateral epileptiform discharges even if pathology was clearly restricted to one hemisphere. In several cases, interictal PET hypometabolism was more widespread than structural changes seen on CT and MRI, extending to involve the ipsilateral temporal lobe in patients with extratemporal lesions. This study shows that patterns of metabolic and electrophysiologic dysfunction may not be predicted by structural lesions in patients with partial seizure disorders.
