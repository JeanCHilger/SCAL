Carbon-11 labelled tyrosine to study tumor metabolism by positron emission tomography (PET). To measure the rate of protein synthesis in human neoplasms by positron emission tomography, we prepared no carrier added DL-(1-11C)-tyrosine by 11C-carboxylation of the appropriate alpha-lithioisocyanide followed by hydrolysis of the isocyanide function and removal of the protecting methoxy group. The purification, resolution and solvent switch to saline was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). DL-(1-11C)-Tyrosine in 0.1 N NaH2PO4 buffer was prepared with a radiochemical yield of 8%-16% (EOS, 35 min). The enantiomeric separation and solvent switch to saline were achieved in 5 min and 10 min respectively. Consequently L-(1-11C)-tyrosine in physiological saline was obtained in 2%-4% radiochemical yield. Tumor accumulation in rats with the experimental WALKER 256 carcinosarcoma was observed for both the L- and D-isomer. Using positron emission tomography a tumor/muscle ratio of two was observed for the L-isomer 15 min after injection. The corresponding figure for the D-isomer was 2.5. The first clinical results with DL-(1-11C)-tyrosine show accumulation of radioactivity in meningioma, a primary breast carcinoma and in liver metastases of a colonic carcinoma.
