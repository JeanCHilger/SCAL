The investigation of dementia syndromes by 133Xenon dynamic single photon emission computed tomography. The patterns of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease is compared with that of patients with dementia caused by multiple cerebral infarctions. A total of 47 patients were examined with 133Xenon SPECT. The results show that the global CBF correlates with the severity of dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease and that the two forms of dementia show two different patterns of disturbances.
