Treatment of neuroblastoma with 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine: experience of the MÃ¼nster/Kassel Group. I-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine was used for treatment of neuroblastoma stage IV in three children after surgery and or chemotherapy had failed to be effective. In two of the children with multilocular lesions, after an impressive improvement of clinical symptoms tumor progression was observed. Because in about 25% of children with relapsing neuroblastoma complete remission may be achieved by combining surgery, chemotherapy, and I-131-MIBG treatment, this therapeutic modality should be included in the therapeutic strategy of stage III and IV neuroblastoma.
