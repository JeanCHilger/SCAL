Use of a psychoemotional test in patients with ischemic heart disease. Sixty-three patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) of II-IV functional classes and with stable angina pectoris were examined using the psychoemotional test (PET). Psychoemotional stress was modeled by giving an assignment under conditions of time deficit as well as by the appropriate motivation of the patients (the factor of the patient's interest in the study) and the punishment by light and sound in cases of failure. Seventeen patients presented ischemic changes on the ECG with or without attendant pain. In 18 subjects the test was stopped due to an anginal attack unattended by ischemic changes on the ECG. Thus, 37 out of the 63 patients (58.7%) showed positive results during the psychoemotional test. The frequency of the positive PET is directly correlated with the severity of the disease as judged by the tolerance to exercise and the degree of damage to the coronary bed.
