The problem of furred pets in childhood atopic disease. Failure of an information program. This epidemiological study is based on all schoolchildren (n = 40,010) in a Swedish county (population: 270,000) and analyses by questionnaire, 1) the prevalence of regular direct contact with furred animals, 2) the prevalence of allergy to animal danders, 3) the prevalence among child asthmatics of regular direct contacts with furred animals correlated to the efforts made to impart information on allergy. 4) A comparison between levels of medical care/medicine-intake in dander-allergic and non-dander-allergic child asthmatics. This method gave the following results: 1) 52% of schoolchildren have furred pets in their homes (urban area: 39%, rural area: 77%), and 24% ride and/or have contact with animals in barns and stables. 2) The overall prevalence of dander allergy was 5.3%, in child asthmatics 57% and in children with allergic rhinitis 30%. 3) Non-dander-allergic child asthmatics have more regular direct contact with furred animals than non-asthmatics. The incidence of domestic pet-keeping by dander-allergic child-asthmatics is less than half that of non-asthmatics. 4) Dander-allergic child-asthmatics have a higher level of medical care/medicine-intake, than the non-allergic. It is stressed that the family with an atopic child should be informed as soon as possible of the furred animal problem, i.e. before they have bought such a pet.
