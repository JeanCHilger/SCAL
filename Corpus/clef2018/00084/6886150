Quantitation of regional cerebral glucose metabolism. Kinetic analysis of 18F-labeled 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2FDG) has been carried out in 28 studies on 25 subjects. The object of the analysis was to determine the practical problems of quantitation of glucose metabolic rate (GMR) using the Sokoloff model with 2FDG. We found that arterial and venous plasma concentration of 2FDG yielded equivalent values of the integrated plasma concentration (IPC*) and that one arterial or venous plasma sample at 30 min serves to predict IPC* to within +/- 7%. These observations suggest that quantitation is indeed possible in such subjects without using complex arterial or venous sampling procedures. The average values of K1, K2, and K3 are observed to be 0.14 +/- 0.08, 0.20 +/- 0.10, and 0.030 +/- 0.012 min-1. The data are consistent with a value of lumped constant of 0.4 and a considerable spread in global values of GMR (30%) in an unselected group of subjects.
