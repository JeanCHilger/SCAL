Cortical activation with sound stimulation in cochlear implant users demonstrated by positron emission tomography. Six postlingually deaf patients using multi-channel cochlear implants were examined by positron emission tomography (PET) using 15O-labeled water. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were measured during different sound stimuli. The stimulation paradigms employed consisted of two sets of three different conditions (1) no sound stimulation with the speech processor of the cochlear implant system switched off, (2) hearing white noise and (3) hearing sequential Japanese sentences. In the primary auditory area, the mean rCBF increase during noise stimulation was significantly greater on the side contralateral to the implant than on the ipsilateral side. Speech stimulation caused significantly greater rCBF increase compared with noise stimulation in the left immediate auditory association area (P < 0.01), the bilateral auditory association areas (P < 0.01), the posterior part of the bilateral inferior frontal gyri
