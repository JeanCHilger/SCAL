Positron emission tomography and central neurotransmitter systems in movement disorders. This article discusses the anatomical and neurochemical structure of the basal ganglia and reviews the Positron Emission Tomographic (PET) ligands available for investigating these pathways. We discuss how clinical PET studies have improved our understanding of the neurochemical changes underlying principal movement disorders.
