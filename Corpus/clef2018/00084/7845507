Diaschisis in right putaminal hemorrhage: correlation with motor function. Local cerebral lesions may cause depression of function in remote areas of the brain presumably by a transneural mechanism it has been called "diaschisis". In the present study, to investigate the relationship between motor function and "diaschisis" regional brain blood flow in hypertensive right putaminal hemorrhage was studied in 33 patients (mean age, 55 years
