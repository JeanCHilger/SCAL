Manganism and idiopathic parkinsonism: similarities and differences. From the comparison we have made between PD and manganism, we draw the following conclusions: 1. There are similarities between PD and manganism, notably the presence of (a) generalized bradykinesia and (b) widespread rigidity. 2. There are also dissimilarities between PD and manganism, notably the following in manganism: (a) less-frequent resting tremor, (b) more frequent dystonia, (c) a particular propensity to fall backward, (d) failure to achieve a sustained therapeutic response to levodopa, and (e) failure to detect a reduction in fluorodopa uptake by PET. Further studies are likely to yield more discriminants between PD and manganism. For example, PET with raclopride may be useful in early cases of manganism, and MRI may be helpful in patients with advanced manganism.
