Preoperative and postoperative glucose consumption in mesiobasal and lateral temporal lobe epilepsy. We have studied 25 patients with interictal 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) before and after selective surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Based on the findings of the presurgical evaluation, including ictal intracranial EEGs, histopathologic findings, and the postoperative outcome, we classified the patients in three subgroups: (1) patients with TLE of lateral temporal origin (n = 5), (2) patients with mesiobasal limbic TLE associated with mesial gliosis (n = 14), and (3) patients with mesiobasal limbic TLE and small mesial tumors (n = 6). Postoperatively, patients with mesiobasal limbic TLE and mesial gliosis and five of six patients with mesiobasal limbic TLE and mesial tumors were seizure-free the remaining sixth patient had one generalized seizure. Patients with TLE of lateral temporal origin had more than 90% reduction of seizure frequency. The main postoperative metabolic findings were as follows: (1) marked increase of regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglu), both in the ipsilateral and, significantly, in the contralateral hemisphere in patients with mesiobasal limbic TLE and mesial gliosis-the changes of brain metabolism were characteristic for patients with the syndrome of "mesial temporal lobe epilepsy" (MTLE)
