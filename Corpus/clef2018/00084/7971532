Effect of plasma modification on biological properties of polyethylene terephthalate foil. Film of poly(ethylene terephthalate) modified with plasma of pure argon and with mixture of argon and perfluorohexane. Wettability of surface, toxic influence, reaction of tissues and influence on the blood-clotting system of modified samples were tested. Plasma was modification allowed to obtain PET both with hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface. We did not observed the increase of toxicity and of the reaction of tissues in comparison with the initial film. Modification with plasma of perfluorohexane had the test influence on the blood-clotting system.
