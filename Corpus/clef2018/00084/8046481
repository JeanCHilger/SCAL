First-pass ventricular ejection fraction using a single-crystal nuclear camera. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the reliability of ejection fractions obtained from first-pass radionuclide ventriculography with a large field-of-view tomographic single-crystal gamma camera.A SPECT camera had its electronics redesigned to improve counting efficiency and was equipped with an experimental ultra-high sensitivity collimator. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured in 28 patients by 30 degrees RAO first-pass imaging and by "best septal view" LAO planar equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography on a conventional small field of view Anger camera. For 28 other patients, first-pass ejection fractions were compared to multicrystal gamma camera values. Visual analysis was performed to judge clinical acceptability of first-pass images for identification of wall-motion abnormalities.Linear regression analysis of first-pass against equilibrium ejection fraction demonstrated good correlation (r = 0.92 slope = 0.90The evaluated camera/collimator system measured left and right ventricular ejection fraction accurately. Lung frame correction and dual regions were superior to paraventricular background correction and a fixed end-diastolic region.
