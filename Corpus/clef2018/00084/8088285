Predictors of toxicity in treating patients with neuroblastoma by radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine. We searched for methods that would enable prescriptions of the maximum tolerable doses of iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and iodine-125 MIBG in the treatment of patients with neuroblastoma. We correlated doses, defined in different ways, with subsequent platelet levels in treated patients to determine accurate predictors of the most frequent toxicity, thrombocytopenia. Nine patients with neuroblastoma were given 131I-MIBG (4.9-8.1 GBq or 132-220 mCi) and ten were given 125I-MIBG (8.3-30.0 GBq or 224-809 mCi) as initial treatments. These therapies were sufficiently varied that correlations could be made between indices of the doses and the subsequent toxicity as reflected in circulating platelet levels. Predictors of toxicity were: whole-body absorbed dose of radiation (cGy) calculated from pretherapy tracer doses of 131I-MIBG GBq/kg of body weight
