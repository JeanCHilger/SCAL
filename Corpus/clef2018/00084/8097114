Central D2-dopamine receptor occupancy in relation to antipsychotic drug effects: a double-blind PET study of schizophrenic patients. The relationship between central D2-dopamine receptor occupancy and antipsychotic drug effects was examined in a double-blind study. Raclopride was the compound used to induce a selective occupancy of the D2-dopamine receptors. In addition, 11C-labeled raclopride was the radioligand used to measure occupancy by positron emission tomography (PET). Seventeen schizophrenic patients were randomly assigned to one of three parallel groups treated for 4 weeks with daily doses of 2, 6, or 12 mg of raclopride. D2-receptor occupancy was determined by PET at steady-state conditions in 13 patients who completed the study. A statistically significant relationship was demonstrated between antipsychotic effect and degree of D2-receptor occupancy (p < 0.05). Patients with extrapyramidal side effects had significantly higher D2-receptor occupancy than those without (p = 0.02). The finding of a relationship between selective occupancy of the D2-dopamine receptors and clinical effects in schizophrenic patients principally provides new support for the dopamine hypothesis of antipsychotic drug action.
