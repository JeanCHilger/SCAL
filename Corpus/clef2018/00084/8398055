Positron emission tomography in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Positron emission tomography (PET) allows the non invasive and quantitative measurement of regional distribution of molecules labeled with positron emitting isotopes such as: nitrogen, oxygen, carbon and fluorine. The aim of the present paper is to review the applications of this methodology for the in vivo study of the kinetics and of the mechanism of action of drugs in humans.
