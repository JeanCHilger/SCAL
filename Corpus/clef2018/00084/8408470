Bone metabolic activity measured with positron emission tomography and [18F]fluoride ion in renal osteodystrophy: correlation with bone histomorphometry. We evaluated the bone metabolic activity in patients with renal osteodystrophy using positron emission tomography and [18F]fluoride ion. Eight patients had secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT), and three had low-turnover bone disease. Eleven normal subjects were also studied, and three of the eight HPT patients were reevaluated after therapy. A rate constant (K) describing the net transport of [18F] fluoride ion into a bound compartment in bone was calculated using both a three-compartment model and Patlak graphical analysis. Values of K were compared with biochemical data and with histomorphometric indices. The results indicate that K is significantly higher (P < 0.01) in HPT patients than in normal subjects and patients with low-turnover bone disease. Values of K correlated with serum alkaline phosphatase (r = 0.81) and PTH (r = 0.93) levels and with histomorphometric indices of bone formation rate (r = 0.84, P < 0.01) and eroded perimeter (r = 0.77, P < 0.05). Values of K decreased by 40 and 30%, respectively, in two patients who underwent parathyroidectomy and medical therapy. Positron emission tomography studies of bone using [18F]fluoride ion can differentiate low turnover from high turnover lesions of renal osteodystrophy and provide quantitative estimates of bone cell activity that correlate with histomorphometric data.
