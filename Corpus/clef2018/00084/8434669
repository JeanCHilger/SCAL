Correlation of acute cocaine-induced changes in local cerebral blood flow with subjective effects. The authors administered 48 mg of intravenous cocaine or placebo to eight abstinent cocaine users in a double-blind, crossover design and examined blood flow using single photon emission computed tomography. Cocaine produced significant decreases in frontal cortical and basal ganglia blood flow these latter correlated negatively with increases in self-ratings of "rush" and "high." The authors conclude that these local effects are compatible with dopaminergic system involvement.
