Imaging of D2 dopamine receptors of patients with Parkinson's disease using single photon emission computed tomography and iodobenzamide I 123. To test the usefulness of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with iodobenzamide in imaging basal ganglia and to elucidate the postulated upward regulation of the striatal D2 dopamine receptors in patients with early Parkinson's disease.Fourteen patients with Parkinson's disease and eight control subjects were investigated with SPECT using iodobenzamide labeled with iodine 123 as dopamine receptor ligand.Neurological outpatient service at a university hospital in Kuopio, Finland.Fourteen patients with recently diagnosed unilateral, unmedicated Parkinson's disease and eight healthy control subjects.The SPECT images revealed high uptake of iodobenzamide in the basal ganglia. In the patient group, the accumulation was more intense and the iodobenzamide affinity rate was significantly higher in the striatum contralateral to the parkinsonian symptoms. Also, the basal ganglia-cerebellum ratio was higher in the contralateral hemisphere. In the control group, no significant side-to-side differences were observed.Iodobenzamide with SPECT imaging is useful in evaluating patients with Parkinson's disease. The results also suggest compensatory D2 dopamine receptor upward regulation in the striatum of patients with early unmedicated Parkinson's disease.
