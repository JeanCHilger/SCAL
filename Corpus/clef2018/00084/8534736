Rat model of peritoneal fibrosis: preliminary observations. The aim of this study was to establish a rat model of peritoneal fibrosis. After insertion of peritoneal catheters into 18 rats, the rats were divided into three groups. All animals were dialyzed twice a day with 4.25% Dianeal containing heparin. Group 1 rats (control) received antibiotics (vancomycin and gentamicin) in each exchange: group 2 rats were inoculated with Escherichia coli (5 x 10(6) in 5 mL of saline) at the beginning of the study group 3 rats were treated with antibiotics after Escherichia coli inoculation
