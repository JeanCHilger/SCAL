Fate of the resting perfusion defect as assessed with technetium-99m methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography after successful revascularization in patients with healed myocardial infarction. It is concluded that in patients with healed myocardial infarction, MIBI uptake at rest underestimates myocardial viability and may improve significantly if blood flow is restored. Patients with MIBI defects at rest may therefore take advantage of revascularization.
