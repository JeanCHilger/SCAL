Single photon emission computed tomography studies of partial epilepsies. At present, in the field of clinical epilepsy, it has been established that single proton emission computed tomography (SPECT) is useful for the regional determination of epileptic foci. In particular, it seems to be of great advantage to the field of clinical epilepsy that epileptic foci situation in the deep regions of the brain are detectable by the three-dimensional resolution power in SPECT, because such foci are not often represented on routine scalp electroencephalograph (EEG). In reference to our review published previously, recent findings in SPECT studies of partial epilepsies are surveyed here.
