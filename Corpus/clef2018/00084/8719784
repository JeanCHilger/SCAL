Inhibition of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated effects by (Rp)-8-bromo-PET-cyclic GMPS. 1. The modulation of the guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP)- and adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase activities by the diastereomers of 8-bromo-beta phenyl-1, N2-ethenoguanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate, ((Rp)- and (Sp)-8-bromo-PET-cyclic GMPS) was investigated by use of purified protein kinases. In addition, the effects of (Rp)-8-bromo-PET-cyclic GMPS on protein phosphorylation in intact human platelets and on [3H]-noradrenaline release and neurogenic vasoconstriction in electrical field stimulated rat tail arteries were also studied. 2. Kinetic analysis with purified cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) type I alpha and I beta, which are expressed in the rat tail artery, revealed that (Rp)-8-bromo-PET-cyclic GMPS is a competitive inhibitor with an apparent Ki of 0.03 microM. The activation of purified cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) type II was antagonized with an apparent Ki of 10 microM. 3. In human platelets, (Rp)-8-bromo-PET-cyclic GMPS (0.1 mM) antagonized the activation of the PKG by the selective activator 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-pCPT-cyclic GMP 0.2 mM) without affecting the activation of PKA by (Sp)-5, 6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofurano-sylbenzimidazole- 3':5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate ((Sp)-5,6-DCl-cyclic BiMPS
