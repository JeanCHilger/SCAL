Cerebral perfusion in early and late opiate withdrawal: a technetium-99m-HMPAO SPECT study. The purpose of this study was to determine if cerebral blood flow (CBF) alterations are associated with discontinuation of heroin in chronic heroin users, and whether these alterations are reversible during abstinence. Ten physically healthy opioid-dependent males, hospitalized on an inpatient drug rehabilitation unit, were studied. Each patient had an initial single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) scan with the radiotracer technetium-99m-d,l-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) 1 week after opiate discontinuation and a repeat scan 2 weeks later. The initial scans in 9 of the 10 subjects demonstrated significant, often discrete, perfusion defects, especially in the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. Two weeks later, repeat brain perfusion SPECT scans showed improvement in all nine subjects who had abnormal scans. Comparisons of the first scan with the second scan showed an increase in cortical uptake on the repeat SPECT study. All subjects had normal computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scans. The results of this preliminary study suggest that the chronic use of opiates, like chronic use of cocaine, results in perfusion abnormalities without corresponding abnormalities on imaging studies of cerebral anatomy and morphology. This study also documents that these perfusion defects are partially reversible with short-term abstinence.
