Regional cerebral blood flow in patients with schizophrenia: relevance to symptom structures. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured with technetium-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single photon emission computed tomography in 38 neuroleptic-treated schizophrenic patients. To improve the validity of the evaluation of symptomatology, we applied findings previously derived in a principal component analysis (PCA) of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. The PCA had disclosed five orthogonal independent symptom structures (i.e., negative, hostile/excited, thought disordered, delusional/hallucinatory, and depressive components), and obtained factor scores for 70 schizophrenic subjects, including the present sample. Stepwise regression analysis elucidated some of the cortical regions in which relative rCBF predicted the severity of symptoms--namely, lateral and orbital prefrontal, lateral temporal, inferior parietal, and medial temporal regions. Findings suggested that symptom structures derived from PCA could prove helpful in elucidating the pathophysiology of neural mechanisms.
