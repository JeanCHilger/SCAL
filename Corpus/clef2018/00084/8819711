Usefulness of 123I-BMIPP scanning for distinction of ischemic from nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. To determine if imaging of blood flow (using 201Tl) and fatty acid (using 123-I-BMIPP) with SPECT can distinguish cardiomyopathy of coronary artery disease from nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, 24 patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction were evaluated. The origin of left ventricular dysfunction had been previously determined by coronary angiography to be ischemic (9 patients) or nonischemic (15 patients). Images were visually analyzed by three observers on a graded scale (score 0 normal, 1
