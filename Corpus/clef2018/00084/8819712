Therapeutic effects of coenzyme Q10 on dilated cardiomyopathy: assessment by 123I-BMIPP myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT): a multicenter trial in Osaka University Medical School Group. To evaluate therapeutic effects of Cenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), 15 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were investigated by 123I-BMIPP myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The BMIPP defect score was determined semiquantitatively by using representative short and long axial SPECT images. Mean BMIPP defect score with CoQ10 treatment was significantly low, 7.7 +/- 6.1 compared to 12.7 +/- 7.4 without CoQ10 treatment. On the other hand, in 8 patients of dilated cardiomyopathy, % fractional shortening using echocardiography was not different before and after CoQ10 treatment. In conclusion, 123I-BMIPP myocardial SPECT was proved to be sensitive to evaluate the therapeutic effects of CoQ10, which improve myocardial mitochondrial function, in the cases of dilated cardiomyopathy.
