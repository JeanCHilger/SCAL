Magnetic resonance of the disk of the temporomandibular joint. MR imaging protocol. Disk displacement can be well detected using proton density-weighted and T2*-weighted two-dimensional gradient-echo sequences. In uncertain cases, especially if the bilaminar zone is not sufficiently represented, a contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo sequence should also be performed. Also in patients with disk degeneration and osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint, proton density-weighted and T2*-weighted two-dimensional gradient-echo sequences are of great diagnostic value. In this collective, however, T1-weighted contrast-enhanced spin-echo sequences should be generally performed, to demonstrate inflammatory reaction of the synovia.
