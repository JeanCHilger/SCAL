Tyrosine transport as an indicator of cell membrane dysfunction in schizophrenia. In a series of studies tyrosine transport was investigated in patients with schizophrenia. Plasma amino acids competing with tyrosine for transport with the L-system were found to be elevated, and correlated negatively with homovanillic acid levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of the patients. The results were interpreted as a decrease in the transport of tyrosine to the brain leading to a reduced dopamine turnover. In in vitro studies with fibroblasts the transport capacity of tyrosine was found to be decreased (a lower Vmax value) in the patients. No changes in transport mechanism for the other neutral amino acids were found. The finding of a lower transport capacity in patients was replicated in a new sample in whom tyrosine transport also was determined in vivo with positron emission tomography. The in vivo studies demonstrated a decrease in the influx of tyrosine across the blood-brain barrier. Altogether the results were interpreted in support of the view of schizophrenia as a systemic disorder with a primary disturbance in cell membrane function.
