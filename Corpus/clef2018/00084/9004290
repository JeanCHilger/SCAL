1-11C]octanoate as a potential PET tracer for studying glial functions: PET evaluation in rats and cat. To evaluate the ability of [1-11C]octanoate as a PET tracer for imaging the brain, we examined its distribution in the brain and surrounding tissues in rats and cats with PET. In rats, owing to the accumulated radioactivity in the harderian glands, clear brain images were not obtained at rostral levels. In cats, the brain was imaged clearly at every level of the coronal brain slices, suggesting the potential of [1-11C]octanoate for imaging the brain.
