Development of an MRI-compatible needle insertion manipulator for stereotactic neurosurgery. A variety of medical robots for stereotactic neurosurgery has been developed in recent years. Almost of all these robots use computed tomography (CT) to scan the brain of the patient before and during surgery. Currently, we are developing a needle insertion manipulator for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided neurosurgery. MRI techniques, including MRI angiography and functional MRI, are attractive for the development of interventional MRI therapies and operations. If a robot were available, these therapies would be minimally invasive, with more accurate guidance than is possible with current CT-guided systems. Actuation of a robot in an MRI environment is difficult because of the presence of strong magnetic fields. Therefore, the robot must be constructed of nonmagnetic materials. The system frame was manufactured using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and was actuated using ultrasonic motors. Accuracy-evaluation procedures and phantom tests have been performed. The total accuracy of the system was approximately 3.0 mm. No artifacts caused by the manipulator were observed in the images.
