Prevalence of bacterial enteropathogens in pet dogs in Trinidad. The rectal swabs of diarrhoeic and apparently healthy non-diarrhoeic dogs presented to a Small Animal Clinic were cultured for Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Campylobacter and the enteropathogens were characterized. Overall, of 130 dogs divided equally into two groups consisting of 65 diarrhoeic and 65 non-diarrhoeic dogs, 99 (76.2%), 6 (4.6%) and 18 (13.8%) were positive for E. coli, Salmonella and Campylobacter, respectively. The differences were statistically significant (P < or = 0.05 chi 2). The prevalences of the enteropathogens in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic dogs were not statistically significant (P > or = 0.05
