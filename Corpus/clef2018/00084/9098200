Metabolism substrate with negative myocardial uptake of iodine-123-BMIPP. Iodine-123-BMIPP is an iodinated methyl-branched-chain fatty acid. Low uptake of BMIPP relative to thallium or other perfusion tracer indicates metabolically damaged but viable myocardium (for example, ischemic but viable myocardium). In some cases, however, negative myocardial uptake of BMIPP is observed. The main purposes of this study were to assess the frequency of such BMIPP findings and to clarify metabolism of such cases by using PET.Among the 1258 patients who underwent BMIPP scintigraphy, 11 patients (0.9%) showed negative myocardial uptake of BMIPP. Under fasting condition, PET using [11C]palmitate, 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) and [11C]acetate was performed in nine of these 11 patients.Global myocardial uptake of [11C]palmitate, expressed as the standardized uptake value, was significantly lower in the patients than in control (3.62 +/- 0.44 versus 5.49 +/- 1.62 p < 0.01). However, the early phase clearance rate of [11C]palmitate and oxidative metabolism was not significantly different. In the fasting state, PET studies showed increased FDG accumulation in seven of nine patients (high group) and decreased accumulation in two patients (low group). In the high group patients, glucose metabolism in the fasting state was similar to that in the normal volunteers after glucose loading (Kcomplex: 0.050 +/- 0.016 versus 0.038 +/- 0.015Negative myocardial uptake of BMIPP is occasionally, but not often, observed. Global uptake of [11C]palmitate was decreased in these patient. The majority of these patients showed "metabolic switching" from normal free fatty acid metabolism to abnormally enhanced glucose metabolism in the fasting state. However, some patients showed decreases in both exogenous glucose utilization and free fatty acid uptake in the fasting state.
