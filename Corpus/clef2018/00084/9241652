The application of receptor theory to receptor-binding and enzyme-binding oncologic radiopharmaceuticals. The successful imaging of tumor biochemistry using a receptor binding radiotracer is related to the affinity constant and the receptor concentration. The target to nontarget ratio can be predicted by steady state equations using in vitro data, although this is a necessary but not sufficient upper limit. The prediction of the sensitivity of the radiopharmaceutical to changes in the tumor biochemistry is not possible with this evaluation.
