Clinical applications of fusion imaging in oncology. Recent developments in tumor imaging, made possible by advances in instrumentation and radiopharmaceuticals, has led to an increasing need for accurate anatomic correlation of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) images. Fusion imaging permits the functional strengths of SPECT and PET to be combined with the anatomic resolution of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinical applications of fusion imaging include the evaluation of brain tumors, lymphoma, hepatic lesions and monoclonal antibody studies. The continued development of these techniques will eventually allow fusion imaging to become a routine part of nuclear medicine practice.
