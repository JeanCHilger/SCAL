Direct comparison of arbutamine and dobutamine stress testing with myocardial perfusion imaging and echocardiography in patients with coronary artery disease. Arbutamine, a new sympathomimetic compound, appears to elicit a more balanced inotropic and chronotropic response than dobutamine, currently used as a pharmacologic stress agent. The present study was performed to compare standard dobutamine stress testing with arbutamine for the detection of myocardial ischemia with technetium (Tc)-99m sestamibi tomographic imaging and 2-dimensional echocardiography in patients with coronary artery disease. Twenty-six patients with evidence of coronary artery disease underwent dobutamine infusion of 5 to 40 microg/kg/min in 3-minute stages. On a separate day, arbutamine was administered by an automated, computerized, closed-loop device monitoring both heart rate and blood pressure. Both infusions were terminated upon achievement of target heart rate, completion of maximal infusion dose (dobutamine), heart rate saturation (arbutamine), or standard clinical end points. Tc-99m sestamibi was injected before termination of both infusions followed by tomographic myocardial perfusion imaging, whereas echocardiography was performed at baseline and throughout the infusions. There were no significant differences in maximal heart rate, blood pressure, and rate-pressure product as well as in the development of anginal symptoms or electrocardiographic changes during both infusions. The location and severity of myocardial perfusion defects and echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities were similar between both agents. It is concluded that arbutamine produces similar imaging results compared with standard dobutamine stress with both Tc-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic myocardial perfusion imaging and 2-dimensional echocardiography.
