Geriatric behavioral problems. Behavior problems in older pets may be due to many of the same causes as in younger pets. However, the effects of aging on the pet's body may cause a dramatic decline or deterioration in organ and sensory function, which may have a profound impact on the pet's behavior. A decline in cognitive function may also afflict older pets, in many instances due to the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease brain pathology, especially beta amyloid plaque formation. Correlation of geriatric behavior problems, therefore, entails first diagnosing and treating any underlying medical problems. Behavior modification techniques and drug therapy may then be required, with modifications and adjustments made to suit the specific needs of the older pet.
