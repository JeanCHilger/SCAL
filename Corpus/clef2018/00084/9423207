Evaluation of heart-to-organ ratios of 123I-BMIPP and the dimethyl-substituted 123I-DMIPP fatty acid analogue in humans. Radioiodinated fatty acid analogues modified by methyl-substitution are used for single photon emission tomography (SPET) imaging of the heart. The effect of mono- and dimethyl-substitution on heart-to-organ ratios was investigated in humans to evaluate their relative merits for SPET image quality. Planar total body scans were performed in fasting patients with coronary artery disease, but without heart failure, 1 h after administration of 111 MBq 15-(p-[I-123]-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP, n = 7) or 111 MBq 15-(p-[I-123]-iodophenyl)-3,3-dimethylpentadecanoic acid (DMIPP, n = 4). Because these branched fatty acids are used for cardiac imaging, we focused on heart-to-organ (heart/organ) ratios by comparing small regions of interest in heart, liver, lung, muscle and bladder. Both tracers showed good visualization of the heart. DMIPP showed a relatively high liver uptake: the heart/liver ratios for DMIPP and BMIPP were 0.39 +/- 0.05 and 1.00 +/- 0.12, respectively (P < 0.0001). Increased lung activity was found for BMIPP, with a heart/lung ratio of 1.63 +/- 0.17 versus 2.32 +/- 0.28 for DMIPP (P < 0.001). In contrast to DMIPP, BMIPP also showed increased activity in the bladder. In conclusion, BMIPP and DMIPP show different distribution patterns. Despite the more favourable heart/lung ratios for DMIPP, the high liver uptake affects cardiac SPET image quality and therefore BMIPP appears to provide superior cardiac SPET image quality in humans.
