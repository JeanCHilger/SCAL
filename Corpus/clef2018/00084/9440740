Preclinical and clinical studies of bone marrow uptake of fluorine-1-fluorodeoxyglucose with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor during chemotherapy. To evaluate the effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on bone marrow glucose metabolism in rodents and in patients, as assessed by 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake measured directly or by positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning.Groups of three rats received either daily saline, G-CSF, or GM-CSF injections for 7 days. After treatment, FDG was injected and F-18 activities in tissues measured 1 hour later. Twenty-two breast cancer patients treated with multiagent chemotherapy were sequentially studied with PET. Eleven patients received G-CSF therapy as an adjunct to chemotherapy, while 11 received chemotherapy only. The standardized uptake value-lean (SUL) of bone marrow FDG uptake was measured and compared.In rats, bone marrow F-18 activity was significantly higher in both CSF groups than in the saline group (G-CSF, 0.44 +/- 0.08 GM-CSF, 0.33 +/- 0.02Substantial increases in bone marrow FDG uptake are rapidly induced by CSF treatments and should not be misinterpreted as diffuse bone marrow metastases.
