Correlation of middle latency auditory evoked potentials and cerebral blood flow changes. The purpose of this study is to find the correlation between middle latency auditory evoked potentials (MLAEP) and sound activated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies. This study was performed on six normal right-handed volunteers with a mean age of 35.2 +/- 7.6 years, using the split-dose technique. First, a SPECT study was performed on subjects in blinded, awake and silent states. After bilateral ears were stimulated with a click sound, MLAEP and a second SPECT study were performed. Subtraction of the first SPECT from the second SPECT revealed a statistically significant increase of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the bilateral superior temporal region. Bilateral Na amplitudes of MLAEP had a statistically significant and good correlation with the percentages of CBF changes in the bilateral superior temporal region. The superior temporal cerebral blood flow activation can be expressed by electrophysiological activation. Moreover, correlation during the left Na components and left frontal and occipital lobe are discussed.
