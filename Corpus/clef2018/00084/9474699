Does radiofrequency catheter ablation induce a deterioration in sympathetic innervation? A positron emission tomography study. Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) is an effective treatment for the interruption of accessory bypass tracts in WPW syndrome or the modification of the AV-nodal conduction system in patients with AV-nodal tachycardias. However RFCA may also damage cardiac innervation. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess possible changes in sympathetic innervation after RFCA as evaluated by the cathecholamine analog carbon-11-hydoxyephedrine (HED) positron emission tomography (PET) which allows the visualisation of sympathetic nerve terminals. We investigated nine patients with supraventricular tachycardias before and two to six weeks after RFCA. Myocardial perfusion was depicted by n-13-ammonia-PET. In addition to visual analysis, HED retention was quantified in the myocardial quadrant distal to the location of intervention these results were compared with values in remote areas. Before RFCA, myocardial perfusion showed homogenous distribution in 8 of 9 patients. One patient showed a perfusion defect in the posterior wall. HED retention matched perfusion distribution in all patients. After RFCA there was no significant change observed either in ammonia or in HED distribution. Quantitative HED retention data showed no significant change before versus after RFCA. Thus, HED-PET does not demonstrate any abnormalities of tracer uptake indicating integrity of sympathetic nerve terminals after radiofrequency ablation therapy.
