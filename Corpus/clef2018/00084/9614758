Estimation of myocardial glucose utilisation with PET using the left ventricular time-activity curve as a non-invasive input function. The validation study is described of a new modelling method that has been developed, using tracer kinetic modelling with positron emission tomography (PET) to achieve non-invasive measurement of myocardial metabolic rate of glucose (MMRGlc). Eight data sets obtained from dynamic cardiac PET 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) studies on human subjects are employed, and the estimation of MMRGlc using both the new and traditional methods is compared. The results from all eight human FDG studies are consistent with those from previous computer simulations. With the new method, the estimated mean of K (a parameter directly proportional to MMRGlc) increases by about 8%, and that of k 4 (the rate constant of FDG dephosphorylation) decreases by about 48%. The approach should be more suitable for use in dynamic cardiac PET studies when non-invasive means are used to obtain the plasma time-activity curve from left-ventricle PET images.
