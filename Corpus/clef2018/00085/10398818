Use of technetium-99m sestamibi ECG-gated single-photon emission tomography for the evaluation of left ventricular function following coronary artery bypass graft: comparison with three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging. In patients who had undergone cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass graft) and whose hearts showed abnormal movement during the cardiac cycle, we studied the accuracy of functional assessment using ECG-gated single-photon emission tomography (SPET) and the automated software developed by Germano et al. by comparing the findings with magnetic resonance (MR) images acquired three-dimensionally. Sixteen patients who had undergone cardiac surgery underwent 99mTc-sestamibi gated SPET (MIBI-g-SPET) and MRI on the same day. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (EDV, ESV) and ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured using MIBI-g-SPET and the aforementioned algorithm. Regional wall thickening was assessed using a four-point scale on MIBI-g-SPET and cine MRI. There was a good correlation between MIBI-g-SPET and MRI in respect of EDV (r=0.89), ESV (r=0.93) and LVEF (r=0.89). A high degree of agreement was found between the wall thickening scores obtained by MIBI-g-SPET and MRI in total segments (kappa=0.62) and in septal segments (kappa=0.67). It is concluded that ECG-gated perfusion SPET can provide regional and global functional information, including absolute volumes, in patients following cardiac surgery.
