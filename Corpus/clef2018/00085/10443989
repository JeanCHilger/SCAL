Hypoperfusion of the cerebellum and aging effects on cerebral cortex blood flow in abstinent alcoholics: a SPECT study. This study evaluated hypotheses concerning alcoholism, aging, and the relationship between cerebral hypoperfusion and residual deficits in the functioning of cerebellar and neocortical brain systems.The participants were 10 healthy abstinent alcoholics (9 men, 1 woman) and 12 nonalcoholic controls (10 men, 2 women) ranging in age from 35 to 67 years. Cerebral blood flow was observed through the use of regionally specific computer-derived quantitative analysis of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion images. Cerebellar perfusion was measured and compared with cerebral cortex perfusion in age-equivalent subgroups of alcoholics and controls (under 55 years 55 years and over).In abstinent alcoholics under age 55, cerebellar perfusion ratios were significantly reduced compared with the controls. In alcoholics and nonalcoholic controls 55 years old and older, this relationship was reversed, probably as a result of diminished cortical perfusion with aging in the alcoholics and of cerebellar decline in the controls.The findings support hypotheses that the residual effects of alcoholism include cerebellar brain abnormalities and that aging combined with long-term alcoholism leads to cerebral cortical decline.
