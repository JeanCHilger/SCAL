Positron emission tomography using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose and [11C] l-methionine to metabolically characterize dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors are unique and benign congenital tumors occurring frequently in children and adolescents. Differentiation from other low-grade tumors is important for management. Five patients with confirmed dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors were studied with positron emission tomography using glucose and protein metabolic uptake in an attempt to categorize these tumors metabolically. Functional brain mapping also was obtained to aid in operative management. Results of the study conclude that dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, although having similar neuroimgaing characteristics to other low-grade tumors, are distinguished by a unique metabolic profile. They are inactive tumors with no significant glucose or protein metabolic activity. The combination of preoperative positron emission tomographic metabolic studies with functional brain mapping allowed for prediction of tumor type, defined eloquent areas of cortical function, and improved approach and resection of the tumors with minimal risk of neurologic impairment.
