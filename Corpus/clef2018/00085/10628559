Elimination of nonspecific radioactivity from [76Br]bromide in PET study with [76Br]bromodeoxyuridine. [76Br]Bromodeoxyuridine ([76Br]BrdU) might allow a determination of proliferation in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET), but only with consideration of organ nonspecific radioactivity constituted by [76Br]bromide. A first study assessed the potential of diuretics to eliminate [76Br]bromide. [76Br]Bromide was injected in the vein of rats and different diuretic combinations were given. Urine was collected and radioactivity measured. Torasemide plus sodium chloride gave better 76Br elimination than the other diuretics. In a second experiment, rats were given [76Br]BrdU. After the radioactivity injection, the rats of the treatment group were given torasemide plus NaCl. At 44 h after the radioactivity injection, the radioactivity concentration and the fraction incorporated into DNA were measured in different organs. Using diuretics, the elimination of [76Br]bromide was increased. The radioactivity decreased 30-50% in most of the organs but the highest radioactivity uptake was found in the organs with more active DNA synthesis. This method may facilitate the use of [76Br]BrdU as a tracer for DNA synthesis using PET.
