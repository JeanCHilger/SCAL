Speech activation SPECT measurements in the determination of hemispheric dominance. Cognitive activity leads to an increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and energy metabolism in both cerebral hemispheres. In order to assess the reliability of rCBF-SPECT measurements in hemispheric dominance (Broca's area) speech activation SPECT studies were performed in nine patients. Patients (men, n = 6 women, n = 3, mean age: 33.8 +/- 13.8 years) with diagnosis of epilepsy (n = 7) and AVM (n = 2) participated in the preoperative study. Two SPECT studies were performed in each case, one in rest, and one during speech activation. 740 MBq of 99mTc-HMPAO/ECD was injected and stereo TCD monitoring was performed during the three minutes of speech activation. The acquisition was performed by a dual-head ADAC Solus Epic Atlas SPECT camera (ADAC Laboratories, Milpitas, USA). RCBF SPECT measurements were analyzed visually and by a special region-of-interest (ROI) program. The hemispheric dominance profiles were established on the basis of the respective blood flow velocity values obtained by fTCD and cortical hyperperfusion measured by SPECT. The neuropsychological test battery, used in the present study, was developed in our institute. The results of rCBF-SPECT studies highly correlated with the lateralization of hemispheric dominance measured by fTCD. There was a significant increase of rCBF in the inferior posterior frontal cortex (Broca's area, p < 0.0003). The non-invasive speech activation rCBF-SPECT measurement is a highly reliable and useful method in the determination of hemispheric dominance. SPECT studies are especially useful in cases where the performance of fTCD measurements are impossible due to the lack of temporal bone window or occlusive cerebral arterial disease.
