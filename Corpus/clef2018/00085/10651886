Neuroanatomical correlates of the near response: voluntary modulation of accommodation/vergence in the human visual system. This study identifies brain regions participating in the execution of eye movements for voluntary positive accommodation (VPA) during open-loop vergence conditions. Neuronal activity was estimated by measurement of changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with positron emission tomography and 15O-water. Thirteen naive volunteers viewed a checkerboard pattern with their dominant right eye, while a lens interrupted the line of gaze during alternate 1.5 s intervals. Three counterbalanced tasks required central fixation and viewing of a stationary checkerboard pattern: (i) through a 0.0 diopter (D) lens (ii) through a -5.0-D lens while avoiding volitional accommodation and permitting blur
