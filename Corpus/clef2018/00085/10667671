Cerebral perfusion MRI with arterial spin labeling technique at 0.5 Tesla. Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility of cerebral perfusion MRI using an arterial spin labeling technique at 0.5 T.We performed perfusion imaging with a flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) sequence in a total of 37 patients with cerebral infarction.FAIR perfusion images demonstrated areas of pathological perfusion corresponding (13 patients) or not corresponding (15 patients) to the infarcted area on MR images. Among 19 patients in whom comparison between FAIR perfusion imaging and regional cerebral blood flow single photon emission CT was available, the two studies correlated well in 15 patients.Our results indicate that the FAIR technique allows reliable cerebral perfusion imaging at 0.5 T.
