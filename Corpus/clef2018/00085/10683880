Aphasia research and speech localization in the brain. Aphasia research has become an acknowledged branch of modern cognitive neuropsychology research whose aim is to explore more fully the structures of knowledge and of cerebral processes which might both be affected in patients with aphasia. Up to the second half of this century, a model based on a specific cerebral localisation of language processes had emerged based on brain localisation research by Broca and Wernicke (among others). New modern neuroimaging techniques, however, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but also functional imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography or functional MRI, have modified these concepts. It emerges that in comprehension as well as in production of language, not only a few well defined centres are responsible for the activity, but there is a synchronised activity in large neuronal networks connecting various regions located both in the cortex and in the deep subcortical structures today, this activity can be demonstrated best in a non-invasive and reproducible way with functional MRI.
