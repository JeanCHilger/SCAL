Cerebral blood flow in volunteers measured by PET and Xe CT/CBF. A comparison. Aim of this study was to compare two quantitative CBF methods. Seven young, healthy volunteers were studied with PET (15-0 labelled water) and afterwards with Xe CT/CBF (30% xenon in oxygen, 3 minutes wash-in, 5 minutes washout protocol). Xe CT/CBF showed greater differences between high and low flow areas than PET CBF. Correlation was found within subjects between ROI's, but no agreement or correlation between the methods could be demonstrated. The disagreement in this study could be due to changes in PCO2.
