Evaluation of myocardial infarct size in rat heart by pinhole SPECT. High-resolution single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with a pinhole collimator is a new method for evaluating the regional properties of radiopharmaceuticals in small laboratory animals in vivo. Although several reports of normal images of rat taken by this new technique are available, there are as yet few reports on its use in disease models, such as myocardial infarction. In this study, we clearly visualized myocardial flow in the rat heart with myocardial infarction using this system, and evaluated the relationship between SPECT images and histologic analysis.For visualization of myocardial flow in rat heart, 201Tl images were taken just before and 24 days after left coronary artery ligation. The images were taken using a 4-head SPECT scanner with pinhole collimators. The percent infarct size on 201Tl-SPECT imaging (%SI) and the defect score were then assessed and compared with the percent infarct size on histologic analysis (%HI). Both the %SI and defect score correlated well with %HI (r = 0.97 and 0.74, respectively).Serial SPECT imaging using pinhole collimators permits estimates of myocardial flow even in small laboratory animals noninvasively in vivo.
