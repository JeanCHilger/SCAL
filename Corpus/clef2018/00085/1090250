Evaluation of methods for the isolation of Salmonella and Arizona organisms from pet turtles treated with antimicrobial agents. Turtles infected with and actively excreting Salmonella-Arizona organisms were treated with various concentrations of both Neo-Terramycin (N-Te) and Terramycin (Te) (Pfizer) for various periods of time and then tested for the presence of these pathogens by two methods, excretion and blending.  Turtles treated with 200 mug of Te per ml of container water for 9, 12, or 14 weeks, whereas when representative turtles from treatment groups were blended 72 h posttreatment these organisms were isolated from the whole turtle homogenate.  Salmonella and Arizona could be recovered from homogenate prepared from turtles treated for 7 and 14 days with 400, 800, or 1,000 mug of Te or N-Te per ml.  These findings suggest that the blending methods is more sensistive than the excretion method for the detection of Salmonella-Arizona in the treated turtle.
