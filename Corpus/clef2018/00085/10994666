Positron emission tomography for the assessment of myocardial viability in Kawasaki disease using different therapies. 13N-ammonia and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) of the heart were performed on 30 children with a history of Kawasaki disease. The results indicated PET abnormalities in 61.1% of patients during the acute and subacute stages and in 41.2% of patients in the convalescent stage of Kawasaki disease. Two-dimensional echocardiography and coronary angiography could not predict the myocardial viability and perfusion as well as PET. Different therapies during the acute stage of the disease did not effectively prevent myocardial damage, despite the absence of coronary arterial abnormalities. The patients who received 400 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for 5 days had a significantly lower incidence of PET abnormalities than those who received a single dose of 2000 mg x kg(-1) IVIG (P < 0.05).
