Indirect signs of anterior cruciate ligament injury on SPET: comparison with MRI and arthroscopy. Indirect signs of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) include bony contusions in the lateral femoral condyle and the posterior portion of the lateral tibial plateau. This study was undertaken to assess the value of single photon emission tomography (SPET) in the diagnosis of ACL injury by examining the uptake pattern in the distal femur and the proximal tibia. Thirty-five patients were examined using SPET, MRI and arthroscopy. Seventeen patients were found to have ACL tears on arthroscopy. The duration of symptoms was 4 days to 10 years (mean 26.4 months). MRI and SPET images were analysed retrospectively without information from arthroscopic examination. Radionuclide uptake in the lateral femoral condyle and the posterior lateral tibial plateau was considered an indirect sign of ACL injury on SPET. We evaluated the diagnostic value of indirect signs of ACL injury obtained on SPET by comparing these findings with arthroscopic and MRI results. Fifteen of 17 patients with ACL injury showed indirect signs on SPET. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for indirect signs of ACL injury were 88%, 56%, 65% and 83% on SPET and 59%, 94%, 91% and 71% on MRI, respectively. However, despite the higher sensitivity of indirect signs on SPET than on MRI, the overall diagnostic value of MRI is better than that of SPET. In the clinical setting, indirect signs of ACL injury may be of value in interpreting incidental findings on SPET.
