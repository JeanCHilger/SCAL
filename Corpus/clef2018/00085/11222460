Diffusion tensor imaging in patients with epilepsy and malformations of cortical development. Malformations of cortical development (MCD) are a common cause of epilepsy. Studies of structural MRIs and PET data in patients with MCD have found widespread changes outside the visually identified lesions. The aim of this study was to investigate diffusion changes interictally in patients with MCD and to test the hypothesis that MCD would be associated with widespread abnormalities of diffusion. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) to compare objectively tissue organization in 22 patients with partial seizures and MCD, with 30 control subjects. Whole-brain DTI was acquired using echo planar imaging. Rotationally invariant anisotropy and diffusivity maps were calculated and, after normalization to Talairach space, each patient was compared with the group of control subjects using SPM. Areas of reduced anisotropy were found in 17 patients and areas of increased diffusivity in 10. Two patients had areas of increased anisotropy. There were no patients with reduced diffusivity. Areas of increased diffusivity were in general more extensive than areas of reduced anisotropy. Changes in tissue beyond the MCD, that appeared normal on conventional MRI, were found in six patients for anisotropy and nine patients for diffusivity. Both measurements showed widespread changes in tissue beyond the MCD, i.e. adding information to conventional MRI. Increased or abnormally located grey matter or pathological white matter with abnormal myelination or ectopic neurones could cause reduced anisotropy. Increased diffusivity could be caused by a defect of neurogenesis or cell loss resulting in increased extracellular space. The widespread nature of abnormalities should be considered if surgical treatment is contemplated.
