The contribution of positron emission tomography to the study of ischemic heart failure. Cardiac imaging with positron emission tomography offers unrivaled sensitivity and specificity to probe cardiovascular physiology in health and disease. The use of positron emission tomography to noninvasively measure regional myocardial blood flow and assess myocardial viability in patients with ventricular dysfunction and coronary artery disease has contributed greatly to our understanding of the pathophysiology of ischemic heart failure. The advances and the need for further studies to establish both the natural history of such ventricular dysfunction and the role of coronary revascularization are discussed.
