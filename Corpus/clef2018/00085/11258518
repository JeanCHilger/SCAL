An efficient batch preparation of high specific activity. The increasing demand for radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) prompted the need to obtain the radiopharmaceutical by a reliable, routine and simple synthetic method for batch production. The production of mIBG labeled with either 123I or 124I has been optimized by modifying literature methods that involve solid-state exchange reaction on "cold" mIBG facilitated by ammonium sulfate. The radiochemical yield and purity of radioiodinated mIBG generally exceeded 80 and 98%, respectively, with specific activity of > 50 mCi/mg.
