Astrocytes Couple Synaptic Activity to Glucose Utilization in the Brain. Astrocytes have functional characteristics that make them particularly well suited to couple glutamate uptake from the synaptic cleft to Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activation and glucose utilization. The changes in glucose metabolism associated with these processes may provide signals detected by positron emission tomography.
