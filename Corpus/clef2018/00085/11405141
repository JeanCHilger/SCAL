Processing vestibular impulses in the central nervous system. Study based on positron emission tomography. Functional imaging methods have opened new perspectives for vestibular research. Many authors have investigated the central connections of the system, but the differences between the reports leave further questions open. We investigated the cerebral projection of the vestibular system, using positron emission tomography in right-handed subjects.Bilateral caloric stimulation was used in every volunteer (n = 6). This can be considered a standard method, which will make it possible to compare the results from different laboratories in the future. A detailed map of activated and deactivated brain regions is included.Changes caused by vestibular stimulation are portrayed. The activated regions partially correspond with previous results in the literature. We would like to point out the Brodmann 6 region as the cortical manifestation of involuntary isometric tightening of muscles. We have found many, previously unidentified regions showing decreased regional cerebral blood flow.We are the first to point out the functional connection between the hippocampus and the vestibular system in this report.
