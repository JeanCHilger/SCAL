Perfusion imaging using spin-labeling methods: contrast-to-noise comparison in functional MRI applications. In this study the performance of FLASH imaging with selective inversion preparation for functional perfusion studies was investigated. In addition to the absolute quantification of perfusion by measurement of the longitudinal relaxation times with global (T(1glob)) and selective (T(1sel)) inversion, the measurement of absolute (BASE) and relative (FAIR) perfusion increases by subtraction of appropriately weighted images was also considered. The subject averages of absolute perfusion obtained by the quantitative method were 70.7 +/- 4.0 ml/100g/min in gray matter, 10.2 +/- 3.4 ml/100g/min in white matter, and 89.0 +/- 3.1 ml/100g/min in visual cortex. These values, as well as the average increase of perfusion due to visual stimulation (44.4 +/- 3.7 ml/100g/min), agree well with respective data reported by PET and other MRI studies. However, for individual subjects the standard deviations over single ROIs inside the visual cortex lay around 100% which prevented the detection of significant activation. BASE and FAIR, on the other hand, were able to detect significant activation in single subjects. The measured average perfusion increases were 51.7 +/- 6.6 ml/100g/min and 56.5 +/- 13.8%, respectively. Magn Reson Med 46:172-182, 2001.
