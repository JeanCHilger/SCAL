Neuroimaging consortium workshop: development of novel PET and SPECT ligands for brain imaging. It was clear from the levels of participation in this panel discussion and from the levels of interest expressed in the upcoming NIMH tracer Consortium Workshop that there is a great deal of potential benefit to public health from the development of new PET and SPECT (and, perhaps, MRI?) tracers. For extramural NIH programs, the tool guidelines for grantees are in fact only that--guidelines--but they could become specific regulations if unacceptable threats to basic research are perceived. This is because the benefits of collaboration among basic scientists are considered essential for the success of research programs. On the other hand, intramural programs at NIH are considered by some to be the "beta test site" for emerging issues and policies, regardless of the specific scientific topic. This may well be true for research tools and presents an opportunity to find new ways of working. As for the industry, threats to intellectual property arise from myriad sources. The magnitude of these threats can only be appreciated from the perspective of long-term investment in research-based industries with significant regulation. In particular, the pharmaceutical industry enjoys only a relatively short period of time during which investments in the last medicament can be recouped to support the development of the next. A great deal of commitment and sophistication will be required if the United States shall succeed in finding new ways of translating basic into applied science for the practical benefit of currently underserved patient populations.
