Alteration of regional cerebral metabolism in patients with cirrhosis in positron emission tomography. To evaluate the alteration of cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in cirrhosis, we measured regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (rCMRO2), and oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF) in twelve patients with cirrhosis (six with a history of hepatic encephalopathy and six without) and six age-matched controls using positron emission tomography. Regional CBF in whole brain was not different in cirrhotic patients from that in controls. In six cirrhotic patients with a history of hepatic encephalopathy, rCMRO2 was significantly lower in the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, hippocampus, thalamus, cerebellum and brain stem, than that in each region of controls. On the other hand, rCMRO2 in six cirrhotic patients without a history of hepatic encephalopathy did not differ from the controls in all regions except for the frontal cortex. Regional OEF in cirrhotic patients without a history of hepatic encephalopathy was higher in the hippocampus and striatum than that in each region of controls. Among twelve cirrhotic patients, rCMRO2 in the occipital cortex and striatum correlated directly with plasma leucine levels, and rCMRO2 in the striatum directly correlated with plasma valine levels. Regional CMRO2 in the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, parietal cortex, white matter as well as brain stem correlated inversely with plasma phenylalanine levels, and rCMRO2 in the occipital cortex correlated inversely with plasma tyrosine levels. Brain oxygen metabolism is impaired in cirrhotic patients with a history of hepatic encephalopathy, but preserved in those without a history or in the early stage of cirrhosis. Reduced oxygen metabolism is related with altered amino acid metabolism.
