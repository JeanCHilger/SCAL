Photoinduced electron transfer and electronic energy transfer in naphthyl-appended cyclams. A series of novel macrocyclic tetraaza ligands that incorporate a naphthalene moiety as a photoactive chromophore have been prepared and structurally characterized as their Cu(II) complexes. Variable-temperature photophysical studies have concluded that the luminescence quenching evident in the Cu(II) complexes is due to intramolecular electronic energy transfer (EET). In their free-base forms, these ligands undergo reductive luminescence quenching via photoinduced electron transfer (PET) reactions, with proximate amine lone pairs acting as electron donors. Consequently, the emission behavior can be modulated by variations in pH and/or the presence of other Lewis acids such as Zn(II).
