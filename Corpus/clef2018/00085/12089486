Validation of left ventricular function from gated single photon computed emission tomography by using a scintillator-photodiode camera: a dynamic myocardial phantom study. A scintillator-photodiode camera is able to acquire single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images by using a rotating chair system. We validated the left ventricular (LV) parameters of this camera system utilizing a dynamic myocardial phantom.
