Swallowing and stroke. Neurological effects and recovery. The development of imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning has allowed non-invasive imaging of the brain, to a greater detail, that in the past was not possible. These imaging modalities have allowed the study of the cortical control of swallowing both in the healthy volunteers and the stroke patient. It has become increasingly obvious that swallowing is complex and its recovery following stroke even more so. Swallowing is represented in many areas of the hemisphere and is affected in many different ways following stroke. In most, recovery is spontaneous, but in some it is slow or non-existent. Studies using direct and transcranial electrical stimulation and pharmacological agents have shown interesting results in the recovery of swallowing following stroke.
