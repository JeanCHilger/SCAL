Synthesis and reactions of triphenylsilanethiolato complexes of manganese(II), iron(II), cobalt(II), and nickel(II). Reactions of Fe[N(SiMe(3))(2)](2) with 1 and 2 equiv of Ph(3)SiSH in hexane afforded dinuclear silanethiolato complexes, [Fe(N(SiMe(3))(2))(mu-SSiPh(3))](2) (1) and [Fe(SSiPh(3))(mu-SSiPh(3))](2) (2), respectively. Various Lewis bases were readily added to 2, generating mononuclear adducts, Fe(SSiPh(3))(2)(L)(2) [L = CH(3)CN (3a), 4-(t)BuC(5)H(4)N (3b), PEt(3) (3c), (LL) = tmeda (3d)]. From the analogous reactions of M[N(SiMe(3))(2)](2) (M = Mn, Co) and [Ni(NPh(2))(2)](2) with Ph(3)SiSH in the presence of TMEDA, the corresponding silanethiolato complexes, M(SSiPh(3))(2)(tmeda) [M = Mn (4), Co (5), Ni (6)], were isolated. Treatment of 3a with (PPh(4))(2)[MoS(4)] or (NEt(4))(2)[FeCl(4)] resulted in formation of a linear trinuclear Fe-Mo-Fe cluster (PPh(4))(2)[MoS(4)(Fe(SSiPh(3))(2))(2)] (7) or a dinuclear complex (NEt(4))(2)[Fe(2)(SSiPh(3))(2)Cl(4)] (8). On the other hand, the reaction of 3a with [Cu(CH(3)CN)(4)](PF(6)) gave a cyclic tetranuclear copper cluster Cu(4)(SSiPh(3))(4) (9), where silanethiolato ligands were transferred from iron to copper. Silicon-sulfur bond cleavage was found to occur when the cobalt complex 5 was treated with (NBu(4))F in THF, and a cobalt-sulfido cluster Co(6)(mu(3)-S)(8)(PPh(3))(6) (10) was isolated upon addition of PPh(3) to the reaction system. The silanethiolato complexes reported here are expected to serve as convenient precursors for sulfido cluster synthesis.
