Dynamic renal blood flow measurement by positron emission tomography in patients with CRF. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging device that allows dynamic regional blood flow measurements. We performed a study to test whether PET could detect acute changes in renal blood flow (RBF) in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF).RBF was measured by means of PET (PET-RBF) using oxygen 15-labeled water (H2(15)O) in eight men with hypertension and moderate CRF before and 5, 40, 80, and 120 minutes after the injection of quinaprilat (10 mg intravenously). Effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured simultaneously by para-aminohippuric acid (PAH-ERPF) and inulin clearances before and 20, 60, 100, and 140 minutes after quinaprilat injection.Baseline RBF and ERPF were decreased in all patients (221 +/- 20 mL/min/100 g and 225 +/- 38 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively). PET-RBF increased significantly after quinaprilat injection (+15%, +26%, +19%, and +23% versus baseline P < 0.003). PAH-ERPF did not increase significantly (-6%, +12%, +20%, and +15% versus baselineThis study dynamically measured RBF by means of PET in patients with CRF for the first time. It showed that RBF rapidly increased after quinaprilat injection. PET using H2(15)O is a powerful method for the noninvasive measurement of dynamic changes in RBF that remain undetected by PAH clearance.
