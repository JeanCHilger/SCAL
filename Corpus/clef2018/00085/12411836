18FDG PET versus high-dose 67Ga scintigraphy for restaging and treatment follow-up of lymphoma patients. To date, only one published study has directly compared 67Ga scintigraphy (low dose, planar) with planar dual-head gamma camera 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) imaging for the purpose of treatment follow-up monitoring in lymphoma patients, and no data on restaging are available. The present study reports the direct comparison of high-dose (297-370 MBq) 67Ga planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and conventional 18FDG positron emission tomography (PET) for restaging and treatment follow-up of lymphoma patients versus a gold standard consisting of morphological imaging, including plain radiography and computed tomography (CT) scanning, bone marrow examination and long-term follow-up (<12 months). Sixteen patients, 10 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and six with Hodgkin's disease, were included (10 men, six women median age, 43 years
