Cardiac tests in asymptomatic type 2 diabetics. To evaluate the use of noninvasive procedures for the detection of myocardial ischemia and its relation with other coexistent clinical factors in patients with asymptomatic type 2 diabetes mellitus.A total of 42 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, aged 41-72 years with no clinical history suggestive of coronary heart disease, were evaluated for silent myocardial ischemia by stress cardiac exercise tolerance test (ETT), 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG), transthoracic echocardiography and stress myocardial perfusion scan using technetium-99m tetrofosmin.Eleven patients (26.2%) showed an ischemic pattern on ETT, the resting ECG was suggestive of ischemia in only 2 (4.8%), echocardiography showed diastolic dysfunction in 9 (21.4%), and the stress myocardial perfusion scan was ischemic in 3 (7.3%). For subjects over the age of 57, a significant difference was found between age and ischemic ETT (p = 0.026) and diastolic dysfunction by echocardiography (p = 0.044). Patients with microalbuminuria and/or diastolic dysfunction were more likely than others to have ischemic ETT (p = 0.036 and 0.024, respectively) and patients with diastolic dysfunction had a higher prevalence of ischemic ETT. There was no relation between ischemic ETT and other major cardiac risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, sex, duration of diabetes, BMI, and glycated hemoglobin levels).The cardiac ETT was most helpful for detecting myocardial ischemia in asymptomic type 2 diabetics. For equivocal ETT findings, echocardiography is recommended. The prevalence of myocardial ischemia was high in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
