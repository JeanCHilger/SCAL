Ferret urogenital diseases. Improved nutrition and client education have decreased the incidence of certain urinary tract diseases in ferrets. Early neutering programs at commercial breeding farms in the United States have also led to a marked decrease in the incidence of reproductive tract disease, especially estrogen-induced bone marrow suppression. However, the increased incidence of adrenal disease and its secondary effects on reproductive and associated urinary tract tissue presents an ongoing challenge for the clinician working with pet ferrets. Acute and chronic renal failure remain important, though less common, disease entities. It is imperative that the veterinarian working with pet ferrets be aware of the clinical presentation and clinicopathologic abnormalities associated with these syndromes.
