Recombinant Helicobacter pylori catalase. To construct a recombinant strain which highly expresses catalase of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and assay the activity of H. pylori catalase.The catalase DNA was amplified from H. pylori chromosomal DNA with PCR techniques and inserted into the prokaryotie expression vector pET-22b (+), and then was transformed into the BL21 (DE3) E.coli strain which expressed catalase recombinant protein. The activity of H. pylori catalase was assayed by the Beers and Sizers.DNA sequence analysis showed that the sequence of catalase DNA was the same as GenBank's research. The catalase recombinant protein amounted to 24.4 % of the total bacterial protein after induced with IPTG for 3 hours at 37 degrees and the activity of H. pylori catalase was high in the BL21 (DE3) E.coli strain.A clone expressing high activity H. pylori catalase is obtained, laying a good foundation for further studies.
