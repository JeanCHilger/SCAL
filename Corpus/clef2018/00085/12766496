Hibernation and congestive heart failure. The most common cause of heart failure is coronary artery disease, and whilst intensive treatment of acute coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction continue to reduce the mortality associated with these conditions, many survivors develop heart failure. In general, heart failure secondary to ischaemic heart disease results from: (i) irreversible myocyte loss due to infarction with scar formation (ii) chronic left ventricular dysfunction which may recover after revascularisation (hibernating myocardium)
