Influence of mobilized stem cells on myocardial infarct repair in a nonhuman primate model. Although previous findings have suggested that some adult stem cells are pluripotent and could differentiate in an appropriate microenvironment, the fate conversion of adult stem cells is currently being debated. Here, we studied the ability of mobilized stem cells to repair cardiac tissue injury in a nonhuman primate model of acute myocardial infarction. Mobilization was carried out with stem cell factor, 25 mcg/Kg/d (D), and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, 100 mcg/Kg/D administered 5 days before (D - 5 group n = 3) or 4 hours after (H + 4 group
