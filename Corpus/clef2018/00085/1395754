Cardiac output determination during progressive exercise in cystic fibrosis. Cardiac output (Q) determination using the equilibrium CO2-rebreathe indirect Fick technique (Equil) to estimate mixed venous PCO2 (Pv-CO2) has been validated during steady state (SS) exercise in subjects with lung disease. A modification of the exponential method using a low concentration of CO2 with an exponential rise in PEt-CO2 (Ex) during rebreathing to estimate Pv-CO2 has been validated during nonsteady state exercise. The purpose of the present study was to validate the Ex method in subjects with lung disease. Q was measured by Ex at every second work load during Prog. Q was measured after 5 min of SS exercise by both Ex and Equil. Arterial PCO2 was estimated from PEtCO2. There was no significant difference in the Q-VO2 relationship during Prog exercise between the combined control and mild (FEV1 > 70%) CF subjects or the moderate and severe CF subjects. Q can be determined in the nonsteady state using the exponential CO2-rebreathe indirect Fick technique in subjects with CF, allowing for noninvasive examination of cardiopulmonary interaction during exercise at a wide range of work loads.
