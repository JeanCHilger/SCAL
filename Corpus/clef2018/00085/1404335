The baboon model under anesthesia for in vivo cerebral blood flow studies using single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) techniques. Single photon emission computed tomography of the brain can be useful in animal experimentation directed toward cerebral conditions. A well established and understood baboon model, necessarily under anesthesia, could be especially valuable in such investigations. Six normal baboons were studied under various anesthetic agents and their combinations: ketamine, thiopentone, pentobarbitone, and halothane. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies were performed with 99mTc-HMPAO. CBF effects from various anesthesia were detected, requiring careful choice of the anesthesia for cerebral investigations.
