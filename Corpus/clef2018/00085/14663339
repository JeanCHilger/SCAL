Determination of kinetic rate constants for 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and partition coefficient of water in conscious macaques and alterations in aging or anesthesia examined on parametric images with an anatomic standardization technique. Kinetic rate constants for 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) and the tissue-blood partition coefficient of water were determined using dynamic positron emission tomography in conscious macaques, and alterations in these parameters in aging or anesthesia were also examined. The parameters were estimated on a pixel-by-pixel basis using an anatomic standardization technique group differences were then examined on the parametric images from the young, aged, and anesthesia groups. For the conscious condition, seven young and seven aged male rhesus macaques were used
