Temporal characterisation of amphetamine-induced dopamine release assessed with [11C]raclopride in anaesthetised rodents. Competition between endogenous neurotransmitters and radiolabelled tracers, as measured by positron emission tomography (PET), may provide a measure of endogenous neurotransmitter flux in vivo. For example, carbon-11 labelled raclopride has been effectively used to monitor dopamine release following pharmacological and behavioural manipulations. The current study describes a rodent model of amphetamine-induced [11C]raclopride reduction, which allowed the characterisation of the dose-response and temporal dynamics of this reduction over a 24-h time course. Over the range studied, a monotonic dose-response relationship between amphetamine dose and [11C]raclopride reduction was observed. When compared with previously published microdialysis data, an approximate 16% reduction in [11C]raclopride binding potential was associated with a approximately 25-fold increase in extracellular dopamine. A reduction of 20-30% in raclopride binding was observed 30 min after amphetamine injection (4 mg/kg i.p.). This reduction in [11C]raclopride binding persisted for 4 h but returned to baseline by 8 h. The data suggest a persistent amphetamine-induced raclopride displacement in rodents and reinforce findings from nonhuman primates that a simple competitive occupancy model may not adequately explain the temporal characteristics of the amphetamine-induced decrease in radiotracer binding.
