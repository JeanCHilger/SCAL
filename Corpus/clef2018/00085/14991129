Current status and future potentials of multislice computed tomography. This overview article gives a short introduction into present status and future potential of multislice computed tomography. The main benefits of established 4- to 16-slice CT systems are larger volume coverage, better utilization of the X-ray tube output and above all improved transverse resolution. Spiral examinations with 16 submillimeter slices are a breakthrough on the way towards isotropic scanning for routine applications. ECG-controlled CT-examinations of the heart benefit from both the improved temporal and spatial resolution of the new generation of 16-slice CT systems. Compared to 4-slice scanners, cardiac examinations are clinically more robust. The most important potential for improvement of multislice cardiac CT is a further enhancement of temporal resolution which requires increased gantry rotation speed for robust clinical performance. Combined systems such as CT PET scanners will gain increasing importance in the near future. In general radiology the race for more slices will continue, finally leading to the introduction of CT systems with area-detectors.
