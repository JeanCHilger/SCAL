Long-term follow-up of Anglian Germ Cell Cancer Group surveillance versus patients with Stage 1 nonseminoma treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. To study survival and late events after adjuvant chemotherapy in Stage 1 nonseminoma.From 1978 to 1986, all patients had surveillance. From 1986, adjuvant chemotherapy (initially a 3-day regimen of etoposide, bleomycin, and cisplatin, but, more recently, bleomycin, Oncovin, and cisplatin) was offered to patients at a high risk of relapse (greater than 30%).A total of 382 patients with Stage 1 nonseminoma treated between 1978 and 2000 were reviewed. Of the 234 patients treated by surveillance, 71 (30%) had relapses (5 after 2 years), 6 died (2.6%) of germ cell cancer, and 3 developed second primary testicular cancer. Of the 148 men treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, 6 (4%) had relapses and 2 (1.4%) died of chemoresistant cancer. After one course of etoposide, bleomycin, and cisplatin, 3 (6.5%) of 46 developed a relapse after two courses, 1 (3.6%) of 28 did soAdjuvant chemotherapy is more effective than retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for reducing the relapse risk in high-risk Stage 1 nonseminoma. However, given the uncertainty about the incidence of postchemotherapy late events, surveillance and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection remain justified alternatives. With positron emission tomography and laparoscopy showing increasing promise in these cases, quality-of-life studies and greater patient involvement in treatment selection are needed.
