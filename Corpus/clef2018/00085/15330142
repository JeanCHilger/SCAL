FDG-PET scan in local follow-up of irradiated head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. We performed a prospective study to assess the value of positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in the prediction of local control in irradiated head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Forty-two patients with irradiated HNSCCs underwent 49 FDG-PET scans between 3 and 6 months after the end of radiotherapy. The mean follow-up time after the first FDG-PET scan was 17 months. The result of the FDG-PET scan was true-positive in 6 patients, false-positive in 7 patients, and true-negative in 29 patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of FDG-PET scanning were 100%, 81%, 46%, and 100%, respectively. We conclude that FDG-PET scanning is useful for prediction of therapy outcome in irradiated HNSCCs. No biopsy is needed for at least 1 year if an FDG-PET scan is negative. If the scan is positive and the biopsy is negative, decreased FDG uptake measured in a follow-up scan indicates that a local recurrence is unlikely.
