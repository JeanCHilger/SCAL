Selective D1- and D2-dopamine receptor blockade both induces akathisia in humans--a PET study with [11C]SCH 23390 and [11C]raclopride. Pharmacological effects were recorded and time course for receptor binding in brain was followed by positron emission tomography after IV injection of the selective D1-dopamine receptor antagonist SCH 23390 in four healthy subjects in doses of 310-810 micrograms. Akathisia, the syndrome of motor restlessness, appeared after the three highest doses. The akathisia was transient and occurred only when [11C]SCH 23390 binding in the basal ganglia was at a high level with a central D1-dopamine receptor occupancy of 45-59%. The D2-dopamine receptor antagonist [11C]raclopride was injected IV into 20 healthy subjects and 13 schizophrenic patients. Akathisia appeared in 14 healthy subjects and 7 patients and coincided with maximal [11C]raclopride binding in the basal ganglia. The findings for [11C]raclopride and [11C]SCH 23390 are the first demonstration of a relationship between time courses for radioligand binding in the human brain and simultaneously induced pharmacological effects.
