Real time myocardial contrast echocardiography to predict left ventricular wall motion recovery after reperfused acute myocardial infarction. Real time myocardial contrast echocardiography (RTMCE) is a recently developed method. We sought to determine: a) whether RTMCE predicts recovery of left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and b) whether data obtained with this method are comparable to those obtained with 99mTc-sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance.We studied 85 patients with AMI who underwent angioplasty. RTMCE was performed 7 (4) days after AMI. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed at the time of the RTMCE study and at follow-up (10 [4] weeks). SPECT and magnetic resonance were performed after AMI in 18 and 32 patients, respectively.Follow-up two-dimensional echocardiography results were available for 82 patients, who were subdivided into 2 groups: recovery (n=49) and no recovery (n=33). Regional (AMI-related) wall motion score index improved from 1.75 (0.49) to 1.32 (0.36) (P< .001) in the recovery group, and worsened from 1.85 (0.39) to 1.95 (0.36) in the no recovery group (P< .001). RTMCE perfusion score was 0.8 (0.3) in the recovery group, and 0.6 (0.4) in the no recovery group (P< .001). Concordance between RTMCE and SPECT in a segmental analysis was 78% (P< .001 kappa=0.49), whereas concordance between RTMCE and hyperenhancement with delayed contrast magnetic resonance findings was 70% (P< .001RTMCE showed a modest predictive value for recovery of left ventricular function after reperfused AMI.
