Chronic myocardial infarction: assessment of morphology, function, and perfusion by gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging and 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile SPECT. To assess the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify the anatomic and functional abnormalities associated with completely scarred myocardium, 20 patients with chronic transmural myocardial infarction confirmed by electrocardiography and cineventriculography were examined by gradient echo MRI. Myocardial perfusion at rest was assessed in corresponding transverse sections using 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography (MIBI-SPECT). MRI scar was defined as diastolic wall thickness (DWT) 2.5 SD below corresponding normal values or systolic wall thickening (delta WT) less than or equal to 1 mm. For MIBI-SPECT images, scar was defined as a MIBI uptake less than 2.5 SD below normal values. By MIBI-SPECT, 152 segments contained normal tissue and 88 contained scarred myocardium. In 226 of 240 (94%) segments, MRI gradings by DWT and MIBI-SPECT gradings were identical. DWT by MRI was higher in normal than in scarred MIBI-SPECT segments (10 +/- 1 versus 4 +/- 2 mm, p less than 0.001). In 230 of 240 (96%) segments, MRI gradings by delta WT and MIBI-SPECT gradings were identical. Segments graded normal by MIBI-SPECT showed higher delta WT by MRI than scar segments (5 +/- 1 versus 0.3 +/- 1 mm, p less than 0.001). MIBI-SPECT perfusion defect size and regions with reduced DWT on MRI tomograms correlated well (r = 0.85). This study indicates that myocardial regions fulfilling electrocardiographic and ventriculographic criteria for transmural myocardial scar are clearly depicted by regional diastolic wall thinning and delta WT less than or equal to 1 mm on gradient echo MR images.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
