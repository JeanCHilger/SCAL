Increased propensity for apnea via dopamine-induced carotid body inhibition in sleeping dogs. We determined the effects of specific carotid body chemoreceptor inhibition on the propensity for apnea during sleep. We reduced the responsiveness of the carotid body chemoreceptors using intravenous dopamine infusions during non-rapid eye movement sleep in six dogs. Then we quantified the difference in end-tidal Pco(2) (Pet(CO(2))) between eupnea and the apneic threshold, the "CO(2) reserve," by gradually reducing Pet(CO(2)) transiently with pressure support ventilation at progressively increased tidal volume until apnea occurred. Dopamine infusions decreased steady-state eupneic ventilation by 15 +/- 6%, causing a mean CO(2) retention of 3.9 +/- 1.9 mmHg and a brief period of ventilatory instability. The apneic threshold Pet(CO(2)) rose 5.1 +/- 1.9 Torr thus the CO(2) reserve was narrowed from -3.9 +/- 0.62 Torr in control to -2.7 +/- 0.78 Torr with dopamine. This decrease in the CO(2) reserve with dopamine resulted solely from the 20.5 +/- 11.3% increase in plant gain
