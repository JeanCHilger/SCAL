Clinical evaluation of 123I-BMIPP myocardial scintigraphy in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 123I-BMIPP myocardial scintigraphy was performed in 13 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and compared with 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy performed within 3 months for evaluating the clinical significance of 123I-BMIPP myocardial scintigraphy. SPECT images were divided into 13 segments and segmental images were visually scored on a 4 (increased tracer uptake) to 0 (severely decreased tracer uptake) scale according to the tracer uptake. In comparison of 123I-BMIPP early images and 201Tl perfusion images, mismatches were seen in about 70% of all segments. The number of segments demonstrating lower myocardial uptake of 123I-BMIPP was larger than that of 201Tl. In hypertrophic regions, the tracer uptake of 123I-BMIPP early images was significantly lower than that of 201Tl images and the lower uptake of 123I-BMIPP delayed images was more marked. In non-hypertrophic regions, no significant difference was seen between the tracer uptakes of 123I-BMIPP early images and 201Tl images but the tracer uptake of 123I-BMIPP delayed images was significantly lower than that of 201Tl images. The mismatch between the tracer uptakes of 123I-BMIPP images and 201Tl images was thought to be a reflection of disordered myocardial fatty acid metabolism. "Washout", the difference between the tracer uptakes of 123I-BMIPP early images and delayed images was also thought to be a reflection of disordered myocardial fatty acid metabolism. These results suggest that 123I-BMIPP is a promising radiopharmaceutical for evaluating disordered myocardial fatty acid metabolism in patients with HCM.
