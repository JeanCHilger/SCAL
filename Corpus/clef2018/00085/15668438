Decreased striatal D2 receptor binding in non-manifesting carriers of the DYT1 dystonia mutation. To determine whether reduced striatal D2 receptor binding reported in patients with idiopathic torsion dystonia is associated with the genotype, the authors used PET and [11C]-raclopride to assess non-manifesting carriers of the DYT1 mutation. D2 receptor binding was reduced by approximately 15% in caudate and putamen (p < 0.005). These results suggest that striatal D2 binding reductions are a trait feature of the DYT1 genotype.
