Long-term follow-up of adrenal medullary transplantation for Parkinson's disease. Long-term follow-up of eight patients who underwent stereotactic grafting of adrenal medullary tissue into unilateral or bilateral caudate nuclei is presented. We demonstrate that this procedure can be performed with minimal risk. Our results show little benefit when the group as a whole is analyzed. A subgroup of four patients was identified who responded to the procedure, as evidenced by a reduction in motor scores, reduction in medication requirements, and greater "on" time. Three of these patients continue to accrue benefit after 2 years. No characterization of a responder profile was evident. We conclude that a modest benefit is derived from this procedure that may persist for as long as 2 years. Future clinical studies to evaluate grafting procedures are encouraged.
