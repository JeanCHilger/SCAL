The regional cerebral circulation in infarct patients. Rapid dynamic T2*-weighted MRT after a bolus injection of gadolinium-DTPA. The aim was to validate the MRI assessment of regional cerebral blood flow. Measurements were performed on a 1.5 T imaging system using a fast T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequence. After intravenous injection of gadolinium-DTPA 30 images were acquired in the same slice position during 84 seconds. In 12 volunteers we observed a symmetrical cortical decrease of signal intensity during the passage of the contrast medium. In 9/23 patients with impairment of cerebral blood flow a circumscribed area of reduced signal intensity decrease (hypoperfusion) was found. In 4/23 patients the decrease of signal intensity was more pronounced than in normals (hyperfusion). In 9/23 patients signal intensity changes were normal. HMPAO-SPECT confirmed successful MRI assessment of cerebral blood flow in 22/23 patients.
