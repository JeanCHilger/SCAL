Three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection SPECT analysis in Parkinson's disease with and without dementia. We investigated regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection (3D-SSP) analysis in 30 patients initially diagnosed as Parkinson's disease (PD), and compared differences in rCBF between patients with and without PD-related manifestations. 3D-SSP analysis of cerebral perfusion was performed by use of a control database. Compared to age-matched controls, there were multiple hypoperfusion areas in cases where the original diagnosis was PD. Temporal bases showed the lowest perfusion frontal bases and medial parietal lobes the second
