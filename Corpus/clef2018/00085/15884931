Highly sodium-selective fluoroionophore based on conformational restriction of oligoethyleneglycol-bridged biaryl boron-dipyrromethene. A non-PET and non-PCT fluoroionophore has been designed and synthesized based on the combination of a biaryl boron-dipyrromethene fluorophore with an oligoethyleneglycol bridge. A specific red-shift response of absorption for NaClO4 in acetonitrile was demonstrated based on conformational restriction triggered by cation recognition at the bridge. The concentration of Na+ can be determined accurately using fluorescence due to a high extinction coefficient (epsilon = 50 000), a high fluorescence quantum yield (Phif = 0.68), and the sharpness of absorption and emission peaks of the boron-dipyrromethene derivative.
