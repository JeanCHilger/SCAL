Bipolar disorder is associated with significant morbidity and mortality however, many aspects of this disorder remain poorly understood. It is likely that rapid advances in molecular genetics and neuroimaging will play a major role in advancing our understanding of bipolar disorder in future. Molecular genetics studies have already identified some candidate genes
