Preventive effect of exercise training on recurrent stenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether exercise training for 12 weeks prevents the development of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Symptom-limited treadmill exercise with thallium-201 myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed one and 13 weeks after PTCA in 18 patients with exercise training and in 20 patients without. For quantitative analysis, the average count of region of interest in the hypoperfused area on the polar map was calculated. A percentage T1 uptake was determined by dividing average count of the hypoperfused area by that of a normal reference area at an initial image (%IU) and a delayed image (%DU). A percentage redistribution (%RD) was obtained by subtracting %IU from %DU as the parameter of residual ischemia in the hypoperfused area. Total treadmill exercise duration and maximal pressure rate product 13 weeks after PTCA increased significantly (p less than 0.01) in the trained group, whereas there was no significant change in the untrained group. %DU increased significantly (p less than 0.01) in the trained group, whereas there was no significant change in the untrained group. %RD decreased significantly (p less than 0.01) in the trained group, whereas there was no significant changes in the untrained group. The restenosis rates at the third month after PTCA was 17% (3/18) in the trained group and 40% (8/20) in the untrained group. These findings suggest that in patients with coronary artery disease exercise training improves myocardial perfusion by preventing the progression of coronary artery stenosis after PTCA.
