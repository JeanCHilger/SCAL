Magnetic resonance first pass perfusion imaging for detecting coronary artery disease. Magnetic resonance first pass perfusion imaging can be used to detect abnormalities in myocardial blood flow. This technique involves imaging the first pass of gadolinium based contrast through the myocardium. Images are initially read qualitatively for areas of reduced signal intensity. Additionally, at our institution a quantitative method is applied that can aid both detection and diagnosis of perfusion defects. This method involves fitting the myocardial signal intensity curves and then calculates absolute myocardial blood flow. Our approach to first pass perfusion imaging will be reviewed. Magnetic resonance first pass perfusion imaging has a complimentary role with coronary angiography either non-invasively using CT or with catheterization. Perfusion imaging defines the physiology and angiography in the anatomy of coronary artery disease.
