Phaeochromocytoma and functioning paraganglioma in childhood and adolescence: role of iodine 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine. Phaeochromocytomas and functioning paragangliomas are rare tumours in childhood and adolescence. We review our experience of 43 cases (24 men, 19 women) who were first diagnosed at the age of less than or equal to 18 years. All patients were evaluated at some point in their illness with iodine 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-mIBG) scintigraphy. Eight patients (19%) had bilateral adrenal tumours, 12 (28%) had solitary extra-adrenal tumours, and 8 (19%) had multiple tumours. In 10 patients (23%), the tumours were associated with a familial neurocristopathic syndrome. Thirteen of 24 (54%) unifocal tumours which were initially considered to be benign ultimately proved to be multi-focal and/or malignant. The final prevalence of malignancy was 60%--26 patients, of whom only 15 (57%) had obviously malignant tumours at the time of diagnosis. Primary tumour size greater than or equal to 5 cm was more commonly associated with a malignant course in adrenal but not extra-adrenal tumours. No other clinical, biochemical or morphological characteristic was significantly associated with malignancy. Although the high prevalence of malignancy in this series at least partly reflects referral bias, the need for lifelong follow-up of these patients is underscored. 131I-mIBG scintigraphy was positive in 36 patients (84%), with a somewhat lower false-negative rate (12%) than X-ray computed tomography (20%). Eight patients with malignant tumours received therapeutic doses of 131I-mIBG, with partial tumour responses in 3. Thus, 131I-mIBG is an efficacious, non-invasive, localising agent and may be considered as a palliative therapeutic agent when alternatives have failed.
