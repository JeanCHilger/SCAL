Integrated PET/CT for cardiac imaging. Positron emission tomography (PET) is an investigative tool that has allowed unprecedented in vivo quantification of physiologic processes including myocardial perfusion and metabolism. Several technical features make PET an ideal technology for the noninvasive evaluation of cardiac physiology. The exponential growth in the number of PET cameras worldwide, offers new opportunities for cardiac applications of PET. Moreover, the integration of PET and multidetector CT (PET/CT) technology will likely accelerate the clinical use of this modality in cardiology for revealing the degree and location of anatomic stenoses and their physiologic significance, the atherosclerotic plaque burden and its composition. Integrated PET/CT is a powerful noninvasive modality to establish the diagnosis, define risk, and guide management with a single study of CAD patients.
