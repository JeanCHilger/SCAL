Surveillance imaging during remission identifies a group of patients with more favorable aggressive NHL at time of relapse: a retrospective analysis of a uniformly-treated patient population. Approximately one-third of the patients with relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) are cured by second-line chemotherapy followed by high-dose consolidation. The age-adjusted international prognostic index determined at the time of relapse (sAAIPI) predicts outcome in relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, suggesting that the success of salvage therapy could be enhanced by early relapse detection. This study evaluated the role of surveillance imaging in detection of relapsed disease and its impact on outcome of salvage treatment.One hundred and eight patients with relapsed aggressive NHL were treated with ICE-based second-line chemotherapy. Relapses were categorized as detected by imaging, examination, or patient-reported symptoms.Twenty per cent of relapses were detected by routine imaging while 80% were identified by reported symptoms or abnormalities on exam. Patients were 4.1 times (95% CI: 1.7-10.2) more likely to have low risk disease if relapse was diagnosed by routine imaging (group 1) compared with those diagnosed by reported symptoms or physical findings (group 2). Median overall 5-year survival for group 1 versus group 2 was 54% and 43% respectively (P = 0.13).These results suggest that routine surveillance imaging can identify a population of patients with a more favorable outcome based on the sAAIPI.
