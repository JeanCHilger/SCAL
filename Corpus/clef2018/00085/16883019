Acquisition settings for PET of 124I administered simultaneously with therapeutic amounts of 131I. Radiation dosimetry of thyroid cancer therapy with 131I can be performed by coadministration of 124I followed by longitudinal PET scans over several days. The photons emitted by 131I may affect PET image quality. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of large amounts of 131I on PET image quality and accuracy with various acquisition settings.Noise equivalent count (NEC) rates of 124I only were measured with a standard clinical PET scanner. Apart from the standard 350- to 650-keV energy window, 425- to 650-keV and 460- to 562-keV windows were used and data were acquired both with (2-dimensional) and without (3-dimensional [3D]) septa. A phantom containing 6 hot spheres, filled with a combination of 131I and 124I and with a sphere-to-background ratio of 18:1, was scanned repeatedly with energy window settings as indicated and emission and transmission scan durations of 7 and 3 min, respectively. NEC rates were calculated and compared with those measured with the phantom filled with only 124I. Sphere-to-background ratios in the reconstructed images were determined. One patient with known metastatic thyroid cancer was scanned using energy window settings and scan times as indicated 3 and 6 d after administration of 5.5 GBq of 131I and 75 MBq of 124I.The highest 124I-only NEC rates were obtained using a 425- to 650-keV energy window in 3D mode. In the presence of (131)I, the settings giving the highest NEC rate and contrast were 425-650 keV and 460-562 keV in 3D mode, with the clinical scans giving the highest quality images with the same settings.Acquisition in 3D mode with a 425- to 650-keV or 460- to 562-keV window leads to the highest image quality and contrast when imaging 124I in the presence of large amounts of 131I using a standard clinical PET scanner.
