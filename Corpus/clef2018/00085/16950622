Synthesis of radiolabeled stilbene derivatives as new potential PET probes for aryl hydrocarbon receptor in cancers. New carbon-11 and fluorine-18 labeled stilbene derivatives, cis-3,5-dimethoxy-4'-[11C]methoxystilbene (4'-[11C]8a), cis-3,4',5-trimethoxy-3'-[11C]methoxystilbene (3'-[11C]8b), trans-3,5-dimethoxy-4'-[11C]methoxystilbene (4'-[11C]10a), trans-3,4',5-trimethoxy-3'-[11C]methoxystilbene (3'-[11C]10b), cis-3,5-dimethoxy-4'-[18F]fluorostilbene (4'-[18F]12a), and trans-3,5-dimethoxy-4'-[18F]fluorostilbene (4'-[18F]13a), were designed and synthesized as potential PET probes for aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in cancers.
