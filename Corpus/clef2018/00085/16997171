Response monitoring of neoadjuvant therapy using CT, EUS, and FDG-PET. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant multimodality therapy in oesophageal cancer is introduced in an effort to improve prognosis. However, in a substantial fraction of patients there is no response to this non-surgical therapy. Non-invasive imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) have been evaluated for assessing patient response to therapy, and these are described in this review. Currently, FDG-PET seems to be the best available tool for neoadjuvant therapy response assessment in oesophageal cancer.
