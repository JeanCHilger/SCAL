In vitro and in vivo characterization of 64Cu-labeled Abegrin, a humanized monoclonal antibody against integrin alpha v beta 3. Abegrin (MEDI-522 or Vitaxin), a humanized monoclonal antibody against human integrin alpha(v)beta(3), is in clinical trials for cancer therapy. In vivo imaging using Abegrin-based probes is needed for better treatment monitoring and dose optimization. Here, we conjugated Abegrin with macrocyclic chelating agent 1,4,7,10-tetra-azacylododecane N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic (DOTA) at five different DOTA/Abegrin ratios. The conjugates were labeled with (64)Cu (half-life = 12.7 hours) and tested in three human (U87MG, MDA-MB-435, and PC-3) and one mouse (GL-26) tumor models. The in vitro and in vivo effects of these (64)Cu-DOTA-Abegrin conjugates were evaluated. The number of DOTA per Abegrin varied from 1.65 +/- 0.32 to 38.53 +/- 5.71 and the radiolabeling yield varied from 5.20 +/- 3.16% to 88.12 +/- 6.98% (based on 2 mCi (64)Cu per 50 microg DOTA-Abegrin conjugate). No significant difference in radioimmunoreactivity was found among these conjugates (between 59.78 +/- 1.33 % and 71.13 +/- 2.58 %). Micro-positron emission tomography studies revealed that (64)Cu-DOTA-Abegrin (1,000:1) had the highest tumor activity accumulation (49.41 +/- 4.54% injected dose/g at 71-hour postinjection for U87MG tumor). The receptor specificity of (64)Cu-DOTA-Abegrin was confirmed by effective blocking of MDA-MB-435 tumor uptake with coadministration of nonradioactive Abegrin. (64)Cu-DOTA-IgG exhibited background level tumor uptake at all time points examined. Integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-specific tumor imaging using (64)Cu-DOTA-Abegrin may be translated into the clinic to characterize the pharmacokinetics, tumor targeting efficacy, dose optimization, and dose interval of Abegrin and/or Abegrin conjugates. Chemotherapeutics or radiotherapeutics using Abegrin as the delivering vehicle may also be effective in treating integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-positive tumors.
