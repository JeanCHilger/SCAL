Positron-emission tomography/computed tomography: artifacts and pitfalls in cancer patients. Diagnostic accuracy and correct initial staging (or restaging) are fundamental in the management of oncological patients and can directly influence therapeutic decisions. The combination of positron-emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) in a single scanner (PET/TC) represents an important achievement in the fields of oncology, nuclear medicine, and radiology. These scanners allow morphologic images (obtained by CT) to be fused and correlated with metabolic images (obtained by PET) to a high degree of accuracy. In addition to an understanding of the physiopathology of cancer and the behavior of the different types of neoplasms, the correct interpretation of PET/CT images requires in-depth knowledge of the physiological distribution of the F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose molecule (FDG, currently the most widely used marker in oncology), of the frequent physiological variations in its distribution, and of the possible causes of non-malignant pathological FDG uptake. Furthermore, the use of CT data to correct attenuation and reconstruct PET images in PET/CT scanners can generate some characteristic artifacts specific to this new diagnostic tool, and these can lead to misinterpretation with potential therapeutic implications. This article reviews and illustrates some of the most common artifacts and pitfalls that can appear in PET/CT studies. The detection and correct interpretation of these findings are essential for the appropriate management of oncologic patients.
