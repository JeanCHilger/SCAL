Examination of PET image evaluation experimentation method aiming at improved accuracy of data acquisition. Multiple data evaluation is desirable for data obtained by positron emission tomography (PET), as the data follow the Poisson distribution. Such evaluation, however, tends to be very complicated, since the count- rates change with nuclide decay. To solve this problem, we propose a new data scan protocol in this communication. With this method, the true+scatter coincidence counts were computed during the initial one-minute scanning, which was fixed as the standard. A dynamic scan was then performed with the fixed counts from the high count-rate region. Regions with +/-2.5% of the image noise of the standard image was chosen to provide the data for evaluation. These were found to be the regions of 16.5-25.5 kcps (2D) and 81.1-138.5 kcps. Image quality was found to be affected by noise (2D) and random coincidence. Using this method, multiple data could be obtained by a single experiment, and very reliable image evaluation could be done.
