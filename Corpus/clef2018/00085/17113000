Noninvasive characterization of myocardial molecular interventions by integrated positron emission tomography and computed tomography. We sought to investigate the usefulness of integrated positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) for in vivo characterization of an angiogenesis-directed molecular intervention.Controversies about the effectiveness of molecular therapies for cardiovascular disease have prompted the need for more powerful noninvasive imaging techniques.In a model of regional adenoviral transfer of the VEGF(121) gene to myocardium of healthy pigs, PET-CT using multiple molecular-directed radiotracers was employed.Two days after gene transfer, successful transgene expression was noninvasively confirmed by a reporter probe targeting co-expressed HSV1-sr39tk reporter gene. The CT-derived ventricular function and morphology remained unaltered (left ventricular ejection fraction 57 +/- 5% in adenovirus-injected animals vs. 53 +/- 5% in controls p = 0.36). Increased regional perfusion was identified in areas overexpressing VEGF (myocardial blood flow during adenosine-induced vasodilation 1.47 +/- 0.49 vs. 1.14 +/- 0.27 ml/g/min in remote areasIntegrated PET-CT has the potential to dissect cardiovascular biologic mechanisms from gene expression to physiologic function and morphology. The VEGF overexpression in healthy myocardium increases myocardial perfusion without significant up-regulation of alpha(v)beta3 integrin adhesion molecules early after the intervention.
