Renal scarring sequelae in childhood Kawasaki disease. To assess renal inflammation and its sequelae in Kawasaki disease (KD) patients, we conducted a prospective study in a university medical center setting in Taiwan. From June 2002 to January 2005, 50 children with KD were enrolled, and after admission, all received technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy single photon emission computed tomography (DMSA renal SPECT), the results of which were used as the reference standard for determining renal inflammation. Patients with renal inflammation underwent another DMSA renal SPECT more than 6 months later to evaluate the sequelae. We found that 26 of the 50 patients (52%) had renal inflammatory foci. There were no significant relationships between clinical or laboratory parameters and renal involvement in KD, except the presence of coronary artery lesions [P<0.01 odds ratio (OR) 5.18
