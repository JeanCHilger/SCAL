The apolipoprotein E epsilon4-allele and antihypertensive treatment are associated with increased risk of cerebral MRI white matter hyperintensities. Apolipoprotein E-epsilon4 (APOE-epsilon4) is a potential risk factor for cerebral vascular disease. The aim of the present study was to examine the relative importance of APOE-epsilon4 and other relevant risk factors for the extent of cerebral white matter hyperintensity (WMH) in a community-based sample of elderly subjects.From a cohort of 976 subjects born in 1914, APOE genotype was determined and MRI examinations were carried out in 75 subjects. WMH were rated using a standard semi-quantitative method. ANOVA and regression analyses were conducted to explore the relative importance of the potential risk factors.APOE genotype and antihypertensive treatment were significantly associated with severity of total WMH load (P < 0.05).The study confirmed the association between APOE-epsilon4 and WMH. Pharmaceutical treatment for arterial hypertension was also associated with the total burden of WMH in this study.
