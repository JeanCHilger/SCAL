Changes in the wall motion of left ventricle in dipyridamole-induced ischemic cardiopathy studied by nuclear magnetic resonance. A comparison with myocardial scintigraphy with 99mTc MIBI. To investigate whether magnetic resonance imaging (NMR) can detect alterations in LV contractility during myocardial ischemia, ten patients aged 32-72 with coronary artery disease underwent ECG gated NMR performed at 0.5 Tesla after intravenous infusion of high dose dipyridamole (DP) (0.7 mg/Kg) over 5 minutes. LV contraction in planes similar to echo short axis projection was imaged under condition, 3' and 15-20' after infusion of DP by fast multiphasic imaging (FMI), multiple angulated cine-NMR sequence with a temporal resolution of 50 m/sec. Entity and size of perfusion defects after DP were determined by Tc 99m MIBI myocardial scintigraphy. In all patients changes in LV contractility appeared at NMR in the same site of perfusion impairments revealed with MIBI. In 8 patients the alterations lasted even more than 20' after the first NMR scan. NMR provides the opportunity of performing long-lasting assessment of ventricular wall contractility and enables to exactly localize the site and extension of kinetic changes as well as their time of onset and time duration.
