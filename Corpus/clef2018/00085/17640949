Ex vivo occupancy of gamma-secretase inhibitors correlates with brain beta-amyloid peptide reduction in Tg2576 mice. Reduction of brain beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) synthesis by gamma-secretase inhibitors is a promising approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, measurement of central pharmacodynamic effects in the Alzheimer's disease patient will be a challenge. Determination of drug occupancy may facilitate the analysis of efficacy of gamma-secretase inhibitors in a clinical setting. In this study, the relationship of gamma-secretase site occupancy and brain Abeta40 reduction by gamma-secretase inhibitors was examined in Tg2576 mice. [3H](2R,3S)-2-Isobutyl-N1-((S)-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-3-yl)-3-propylsuccinamide (IN973) was used as a gamma-secretase radioligand, since it has been shown to bind to gamma-secretase in rat, rhesus, and human brains with high affinity and specificity. We extended these findings by showing that [3H]IN973 bound to gamma-secretase in Tg2576 brains with an affinity, specificity, and regional localization very similar to the other species. To quantify gamma-secretase occupancy by gamma-secretase inhibitors, an ex vivo binding assay was developed using [3H]IN973 and frozen brain sections from drug-treated mice. Gamma-secretase occupancy and brain Abeta40 reduction were found to be highly correlated in animals dosed with either 2-[(1R)-1-[[4-chlorophenyl)-sulfonyl](2,5-difluorophenyl)amino] ethyl]-5-fluoro-benzenepropanoic acid (BMS-299897) or (S)-2-((S)-2-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-2-hydroxyacetamido)-N-((S,Z)-3-methyl-4-oxo-4,5-dihydro-3H-benzo[d][1,2]diazepin-5-yl)propanamide (BMS-433796) over a wide range of doses and times postdose, with the exception of the earliest times postdose. This lag in Abeta40 response to gamma-secretase inhibition is probably related to the delayed clearance of previously produced Abeta40. The excellent correlation between brain Abeta40 and gamma-secretase occupancy suggests that a positron emission tomography ligand for gamma-secretase could be a valuable biomarker to determine whether gamma-secretase inhibitors bind to their target in humans.
