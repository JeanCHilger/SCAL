18FDG uptake in oesophageal adenocarcinoma: linking biology and outcome. Variable uptake of 18FDG has been noticed in positron emission tomography (PET) studies of patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The aim of the present study was to investigate biological parameters involved in 18FDG uptake in oesophageal adenocarcinoma for selection of patients with increased 18FDG uptake and prediction of prognostic value of 18FDG PET.Preoperative PET scans were performed in 26 patients with histologically proven oesophageal adenocarcinoma. 18FDG uptake was semiquantitatively measured by SUV(BSAg. )Tumour sections were stained by immunohistochemistry for angiogenic markers (VEGF, CD31), glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1), hexokinase (HK) isoforms, for proliferation marker (Ki67), for macrophage marker (CD68) and for apoptosis marker (cleaved caspase-3). Cell densities, differentiation grade, degree of necrosis and mucus, T-stage and tumour size were assessed. In addition follow-up was analysed.No association was found between 18FDG uptake and angiogenic markers. In contrast, a significant correlation was found between 18FDG uptake and Glut-1 expression. No correlations were found between 18FDG uptake and HK isoforms, Ki67 or cleaved caspase-3. Also, no correlations were found between 18FDG uptake and cell density, differentiation grade, CD68, mucus and necrosis. However, there was a significant correlation between 18FDG uptake and tumour size and between 18FDG uptake and tumour recurrence.Glut-1 expression and tumour size seem parameters associated with 18FDG uptake in patients with biopsy proven oesophageal adenocarcinoma, and may be used to select oesophageal cancer patients in whom 18FDG-PET is of diagnostic value and may predict disease outcome.
