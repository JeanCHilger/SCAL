Inter-observer variations in FDG-PET interpretation for cancer screening. Diagnostic guidelines for the use of 2-(fluorine 18) fluoro-2 deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) in cancer screening have yet to be established. We assessed inter-observer variability in screening FDG-PET.Subjects comprised 40 individuals who underwent FDG-PET and computed tomography (CT) for cancer screening. To assess various patterns of FDG uptakes, three subsets of the cases were selected: 'Cancer', 15 cases with cancer 'Not malignant', 15 cases with suspected cancer by FDG-PET who were confirmed as cancer-freeInter-observer agreement for all lesions at each step was moderate, compared to fair agreement for 'Normal' subjects. Inter-observer agreement of 'Cancer' and 'Not malignant' subjects in Step 1 were better than those in Step 2 and 3 however, the differences were not statistically significant.The interpretation of FDG-PET is adequately reproducible, while that of 'Normal' subjects is less reproducible. Improvement of inter-observer variability in assessing physiological FDG uptakes requires universal reporting criteria in FDG-PET. Correlative interpretation of PET, CT and other information may require standardization in subjects with suspected cancer by FDG-PET.
