Imaging of tumor hypoxia with [124I]IAZA in comparison with [18F]FMISO and [18F]FAZA--first small animal PET results. This study was performed to compare the 2-nitroimidazole derivatives [124I]IAZA, [18F]FAZA and well known [18F]FMISO in visualization of tumor hypoxia in a mouse model of human cancer using small animal PET.PET imaging of female Balb/c nude mice bearing A431 tumors on a Phillips Mosaic small animal PET scanner was performed 3 h p.i. for all three tracers. Mice injected with [124I]IAZA were scanned again after 24 h and 48 h. In addition to the mice breathing air, in the case of [18F]FAZA and [124I]IAZA a second group of mice for each tracer was kept in an atmosphere of carbogen gas (5% of CO2 + 95 % of O2 from 1 h before to 3 h after injection) to evaluate the oxygenation dependency on uptake (all experiments n = 4). After the final PET scan animals were sacrificed and biodistribution was studied.Mice injected with [18F]FAZA displayed significantly higher tumor-to background (T/B) ratios (5.19 +/- 0.73) compared to those injected with [18F]FMISO (3.98 +/- 0.66 P $lt[18F]FAZA showed superior biokinetics compared to [18F]FMISO and [124I]IAZA in this study. Imaging at later time points that are not possible with the short lived 18F labeled tracers resulted in no advantage for [124I]IAZA, i. e. tumor to normal tissue ratios could not be improved.
