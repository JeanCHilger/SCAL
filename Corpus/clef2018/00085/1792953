Pathophysiology of central (thalamic) pain: a possible role of the intralaminar nuclei in superficial pain. In 15 patients with central pain (thalamic pain) after stroke, CT, PET scan and intraoperative thalamic microrecordings were performed. The results are considered together to evaluate a possible role of thalamic intralaminar nuclei in the genesis of central pain, especially of superficial pain. In the non-thalamic lesion group (deep pain dominant), thalamic background neural activity (BNA) was relatively high in Vim but low in CL. Conversely, in the thalamic lesion group (superficial pain dominant), thalamic BNA was higher in CL than in Vim, and markedly decreased in VC. In this group, regional cerebral oxygen consumption (rCMRO2) was relatively maintained, and regional oxygen extraction ratio (raOEF) and the relative value of regional cerebral glucose utilization (CMRGL), compared to rCMRO2, was increased in the cerebral cortex around the central sulcus. The genesis of superficial pain is discussed.
