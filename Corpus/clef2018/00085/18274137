Radiodiagnostic studies in atherosclerosis. Due to the fact that it is necessary to make a detailed assessment of the implication of atherosclerotic lesion in the development of coronary heart disease and to timely detect the instability of the process, there is a need for developing new methods for imaging atherosclerosis. Coronary angiography and radionuclide studies are known to be of importance in the diagnosis of atherosclerosis. Of particular interest is combined positron emission and X-ray tomography using 18FDG, which determines not only the site and degree of an atherosclerotic process, but also its activity.
