SPECT/CT fusion imaging in radionuclide cisternography for localization of liquor leakage sites. We report our experience with radionuclide cisternography (RC) with 111In-diethylenthriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) using a computed tomography (CT) mounted hybrid gamma camera in patients with cerebrospinal liquor leakage.SPECT/CT fusion imaging was performed in case of suspected tracer egress on planar or SPECT images in order to obtain a detailed correlation of the leakage site.Leakage was detected in all 3 patients. Using SPECT/CT, the extradural tracer accumulation could be correlated to an anatomical structure, which had not been possible by evaluation of the scintigraphic studies alone.Introducing SPECT/CT for radionuclide cisternography seems to be a valuable tool to facilitate the diagnosis of cerebrospinal liquor leakage.
