Erythrocyte insulin receptors in dogs with spontaneous hyperadrenocorticism. Erythrocyte insulin receptor binding measurements were evaluated in 8 dogs with spontaneous hyperadrenocorticism. These dogs had normal serum glucose concentration, with normal to high serum insulin concentration (range, 45 to 1,400 pmol/L normal, 40 to 170 pmol/L). Dogs with hyperadrenocorticism had significant (P less than 0.01) decrease in mean +/- SEM percentage of maximal binding for erythrocyte insulin receptors (2.25 +/- 0.21%), compared with results in 11 clinically normal pet dogs (4.29 +/- 0.42%). The decrease in erythrocyte receptor binding was attributed to significant (P less than 0.01) decrease in high-affinity receptor sites in dogs with hyperadrenocorticism (14.5 +/- 2.8), compared with clinically normal dogs (31.2 +/- 4.3). Significant differences in receptor affinity were not apparent between the 2 groups. Percentage of maximal binding for erythrocyte insulin receptors for dogs with hyperadrenocorticism was inversely correlated with serum insulin concentration (r = -0.85, P less than 0.01). Results indicate that the observed decrease in erythrocyte insulin receptor binding could contribute to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia associated with hyperadrenocorticism. Alternatively, decreased binding of insulin receptors in animals with hyperadrenocorticism may result from down-regulation secondary to hyperinsulinemia itself caused by insulin resistance at a postreceptor site (decreased responsiveness).
