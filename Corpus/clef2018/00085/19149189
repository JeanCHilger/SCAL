Expression, antiserum preparation and bioactivity assays of insect neurotoxin LqhIT2. According to the codon bias of Pichia pastoris, the mature insect neurotoxin gene LqhIT2 was synthesized based on its amino acid sequence and was cloned to vector of PET-30a (+) and pPIC9K respectively. The fusion protein expressed in Escherichia. coli was induced with IPTG and purified with Ni-NTA His Bind Column. The purified fusion protein was used to immunize BALB/c mice, and antiserum obtained was highly specific with the titer of over 1:128 000. Using the antiserum, high-level expression transformants of P. pastoris were screened by dot blotting. The highest expression of recombinant LqhIT2 was about 9 mg/L in baffled flasks. The fusion protein of LqhIT2 expressed in E. coli was not toxic to locust, but the recombinant LqhIT2 expressed in P. pastoris had insecticidal activity against locust through injection.
