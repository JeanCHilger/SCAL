Ovarian cancer: detection and radiologic staging. Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic malignancy. It is the deadliest, largely owing to late stage at the time of diagnosis. Ultrasound is modality of choice in the evaluation of suspected adnexal masses. Magnetic resonance imaging is an excellent problem solver when an adnexal mass is indeterminate on ultrasound. Staging of ovarian cancer remains surgical, though preoperative imaging can identify inoperable patients and identify suspicious sites for intraoperative biopsy. This article reviews the use of different imaging modalities in the detection and staging of ovarian carcinoma, and discusses imaging indications, radiologic features, and the shortcomings of imaging.
