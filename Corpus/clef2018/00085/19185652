Established, emerging and future roles of PET/CT in the management of colorectal cancer. Positron-emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) is rapidly being integrated into the imaging pathways of several different tumour types, most frequently using the glucose analogue 2- [(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). Integrated FDG-PET/CT combines functional and anatomical imaging to improve sensitivity and specificity of tumour detection. The aim of this article is to review the established, emerging, and future roles of FDG-PET/CT in the management of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).
