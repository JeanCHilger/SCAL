Advantages of PET-CT in the work-up of cervical cancer. The present paper addresses the advantages and limits of PET-CT in the work-up of cervical cancer. PET-CT is not to be overlooked in initial staging. It is useful to assess involvement of pelvic and lumbar lymph nodes. It can improve staging accuracy and help guide initial treatment such as optimisation of radiation therapy fields. Given its limited spatial resolution however, PET does not seem so adequate to document tumours less than 5 mm in diameter. It is not warranted for staging carcinoma in situ (FIGO stage 0) or preclinical carcinoma (FIGO stage 1A1 and 1A2). Furthermore MRI performances are best as far as local extension and tumour volume measurement are concerned. PET brings prognostic information. High initial uptake in tumour tissue or persistent increased uptake at completion of treatment indicates rather poor prognosis. PET is useful to evaluate therapy, but its exact role in this issue remains to be further refined. Finally, PET-CT can document early recurrence of disease.
