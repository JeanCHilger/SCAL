Considerations for the use of imaging tools for phase II treatment trials in oncology. In the context of assessing tumor response, imaging tools have the potential to play a vital role in phase II and III treatment trials. If the imaging test is able to predict potential phase III success in a reliable fashion, it would be a useful tool in phase II trial design as it may provide for a more rapid and timely response assessment. The benefits and challenges of using anatomic imaging measures as well as the promising molecular imaging measures, primarily fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, are discussed here. The general issues related to successful implementation of advanced imaging in the context of phase II treatment trials are discussed.
