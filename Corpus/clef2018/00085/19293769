Breast cancer therapy: the role of PET-CT in decision making. This paper describes the role of positron emission tomography (PET) and PET-computed tomography (CT) in breast cancer patients. Fluorine-18-Fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) has limited diagnostic value in detecting small noninvasive primary tumors, in staging the axillary region in early stages and in the detection of osteoblastic metastases. Better results have been shown in the detection and staging of primary invasive tumors. Significant clinical data are available in the monitoring of primary chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer where [(18)F]FDG PET-CT allows prediction of the response even shortly after the onset of therapy. Quantitative evaluation of tumor uptake is necessary. Therapy-induced changes in tumor metabolism may be helpful in making decisions about continuation, modification or cessation of therapy. Therefore, [(18)F]FDG PET-CT appears to be a promising tool for the personalization of breast cancer treatment by its early identification of nonresponders. It offers improved patient care, avoiding ineffective chemotherapy and the side effects while reducing the cost. An area generating high expectations for PET-TC in breast cancer is in monitoring in order to tailor therapy to the tumor characteristics of individual patients who may require tracers other than [(18)F]FDG. The introduction of new PET tracers and the development of new instruments will offer opportunities to improve the role of PET-CT in decision making of therapy in these patients.
