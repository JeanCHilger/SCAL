The role of FDG-PET and staging laparoscopy in the management of patients with cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction. The effort to improve outcomes in esophageal cancer has included attempts at improving staging and patient selection. 2-Deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-Dglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been extensively studied in this context and has been widely accepted as a staging tool. Its role in restaging or assessing therapeutic response is investigational and promising. Laparoscopy has also been studied as a means for improving staging, but its role may be limited in the era of PET. This article discusses the literature assessing these modalities, particularly with regard to the practical management of the patient in the clinic.
