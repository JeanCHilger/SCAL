Functional imaging of head and neck cancers. Functional imaging including single photon emission computed tomography, PET and MRI techniques in head and neck squamous cell cancer allows disease characterization beyond structure and morphology.In patients without clinical signs of lymph node involvement, sensitivity of fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET is only 50%. This has led to the use of sentinel lymph node scintigraphy that seems to be a valid alternative to elective stage dissection. Additionally, the use of single-photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography imaging enables a more accurate localization of the sentinel lymph node scintigraphy. The fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake intensity of the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma sites is related to locoregional control and overall survival. In case of suspicion for residual or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma after surgery or (chemo)radiotherapy, fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET has a high sensitivity and seems to be cost-effective in selecting patients for direct laryngoscopy. Diffusion-weighted MRI in combination with size and morphological criteria is a strong predictor of presence of malignant lymph nodes. Initial reports indicate the use of diffusion-weighted imaging for response assessment as early as 1 week after beginning of radiochemotherapy. Perfusion MRI is studied for the measurement of drug effects on tumour (micro)vascularity and capillary permeability.Functional imaging improves the initial staging and the detection of residual or recurrent disease following therapy.
