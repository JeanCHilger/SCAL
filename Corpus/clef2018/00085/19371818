Imaging findings in bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of jaws. Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ) is a well-described clinical condition with consistent radiographic findings. The purpose of this report was to review these findings in an attempt to offer important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic information associated with BRONJ.The findings of studies assessing the radiographic landmarks on plain films, intraoral films, orthopantograph, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear bone scans in patients with BRONJ were analyzed.The radiographic findings in patients with BRONJ include osteosclerosis, osteolysis, dense woven bone, a thickened lamina dura, subperiosteal bone deposition, and failure of postsurgical remodeling.Consistent imaging findings are noted in the BRONJ patient. Imaging is an essential part of the clinical assessment of the BRONJ patient and might be an additional tool for tracking the progression of the disease.
