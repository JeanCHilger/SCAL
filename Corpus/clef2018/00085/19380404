Radiopharmaceuticals in preclinical and clinical development for monitoring of therapy with PET. This review article discusses PET agents, other than (18)F-FDG, with the potential to monitor the response to therapy before, during, or after therapeutic intervention. This review deals primarily with non-(18)F-FDG PET tracers that are in the final stages of preclinical development or in the early stages of clinical application for monitoring the therapeutic response. Four sections related to the nature of the tracers are included: radiotracers of DNA synthesis, such as the 2 most promising agents, the thymidine analogs 3'-(18)F-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine and (18)F-1-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl)thymine agents for PET imaging of hypoxia within tumors, such as (60/62/64)Cu-labeled diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) and (18)F-fluoromisonidazole
