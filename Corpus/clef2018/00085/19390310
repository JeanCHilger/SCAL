Combined modality treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Substantial clinical progress over the last decades has improved the first-line treatment and prognosis of patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). This success is mainly based on the introduction of combined modality treatment strategies including chemotherapy in all risk groups and important progress in radiation techniques. The knowledge emerging from numerous clinical trials as well as better staging and imaging techniques helped to develop more effective therapies. According to our current knowledge, a stage and risk factor-based allocation into early favorable, early unfavorable, and advanced stages remains a suitable instrument to tailor risk-adapted therapy. In most of the study groups, patients with early stage HL receive 2 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy to the involved field. The treatment for advanced stages usually consists of 6 to 8 cycles, more intensive regimen, and radiotherapy for residual masses. Here, we review results from current clinical trials and discuss new therapeutic approaches in the combined modality treatment of HL.
