Automated production of copper radioisotopes and preparation of high specific activity [(64)Cu]Cu-ATSM for PET studies. (60)Cu and (64)Cu are useful radioisotopes for positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceuticals and may be used for the preparation of promising agents for diagnosis and radiotherapy. In this study, the production and purification of (60/64)Cu starting from (60/64)Ni using a new automated system, namely Alceo, is described. A dynamic process for electrodeposition and dissolution of (60/64)Ni/(60/64)Cu was developed. Preliminary production yields of (60)Cu and (64)Cu were 400 and 300mCi, respectively. (64)Cu was used to radiolabel the hypoxia detection tracer ATSM with a specific activity of 2.2+/-1.3Ci/micromol.
