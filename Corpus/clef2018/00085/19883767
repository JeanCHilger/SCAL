Escherichia coli expression and purification of LL37 fused to a family III carbohydrate-binding module from Clostridium thermocellum. The cathelicidin derived human peptide LL37 has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities. The large variety of biological activities makes LL37 a very promising candidate for clinical applications. The production of biologically active LL37 in large amounts with reduced costs can only be achieved using recombinant techniques. In this work, LL37 has been cloned to the N- and C-termini of a family III carbohydrate-binding module fused to the linker sequence (LK-CBM3) from Clostridium thermocellum both constructions (LL37-LK-CBM3 and LK-CBM3-LL37) were cloned into the pET-21a vector. A formic acid recognition site was introduced between the two modules, allowing the isolation of LL37 after chemical cleavage. The recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and solubilized with Triton X-100. The purification was achieved using cellulose CF11 fibers, taking advantage of the CBM3 specific affinity for cellulose
