Rheo-optical study of polymers by using time-resolved soft-pulse compression attenuated total reflection step-scan Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A time-resolved soft-pulse dynamic compression attenuated total reflection (ATR) step-scan Fourier transform rheo-optical system has been developed. This system was used to observe different viscoelastic properties of polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHx). Resonance features were observed in the dynamic compression ATR spectrum of PHBHx with 625 Hz soft-pulse frequency. In contrast, the dynamic compression ATR spectrum of PET showed no resonance features. The resonance feature of PHBHx was found at 1723 cm(-1), which corresponds to the structural or morphological reorganization of a less ordered (Type II) crystalline form under compressive perturbation. The time-resolved evolution of infrared (IR) spectra was effectively analyzed by conventional generalized two-dimensional (2D) correlation analysis. The 2D-IR results indicate that the dynamic response of the well-ordered Type I crystalline state (1289 and 1261 cm(-1)) is faster than that of the Type II (1723, 1277, and 1228 cm(-1)). The present method shows promise for characterizing a wide variety of viscoelastic materials, including polymer alloys, blends, composites, and copolymers, and semicrystalline polymers.
