Advances in imaging low-grade gliomas. Imaging plays a key role in the management of low-grade gliomas. The traditional view of these tumours as non-enhancing areas of increased signal on T2-weighted imaging is now accepted as being incorrect. Using new MR and PET techniques that can probe the pathological changes with in these tumours by assessing vascularity (perfusion MR), cellularity and infiltration (diffusion weighted and diffusion tensor MR), metabolism (MR spectroscopy and FDG PET) and proliferation (MR spectroscopy, methionine PET and 18F-fluorothymidine FLT PET). These tools will allow improvements in tumour grading, biopsy/therapy guidance and earlier assessment of the response to therapy.
