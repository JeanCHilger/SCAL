Evaluation of O-(2-[18F]-Fluoroethyl)-L-Tyrosine in the Diagnosis of Glioblastoma. To assess the feasibility of synthesis of O-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (FET), a new positron emission tomographic (PET) tracer described in several studies but not yet considered standard in management of glioma, in routine practice and to determine FET uptake in a homogeneous group of patients with suspected high-grade glioma.Prospective nonrandomized trial.Twelve patients with suspicion of high-grade glioma.The mean (SD) FET uptake ratio was 3.15 (0.72) for the 12 patients and 3.16 (0.75) for the 11 patients with glioblastoma.The initial results are promising and indicate that FET PET is a valuable and applicable tool for the imaging of high-grade glioma.
