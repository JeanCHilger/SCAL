. An autoimmune process and other environmental factors that destroy pancreatic β cells in the pancreatic islet cells are known to promote the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 1 diabetes) in individuals genetically predisposed to the disease (1). As a consequence of the β cell destruction, the net mass of these cells in the islet cells is reduced and, due to reduced insulin production, maintenance of blood glucose to a proper physiological level is impaired. The most common type of diabetes, type 2, is primarily caused by insulin resistance as a result of low insulin secretion by the β cells. Type 2 diabetes can often be corrected with exercise, diet control, and, if necessary, medication (2). On diagnosis of diabetes, knowledge of the β cell mass (BCM) or volume is an important factor to devise a successful treatment for the condition (3). Changes in the BCM during the onset of diabetes is poorly understood, and only an indirect method that measures the amount of simulated insulin secretion by the pancreas is used to quantify the BCM in humans (4). However, the β cells appear to have a reserved capacity to produce insulin, thereby limiting the use of insulin secretion as a determinant of BCM (4). As an alternative to determine insulin secretion to quantify BCM, investigators evaluated a non-invasive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique to determine the BCM in rats with the use of
