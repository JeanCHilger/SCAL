MicroPET imaging of noxious thermal stimuli in the conscious rat brain. Small animal positron emission tomography (microPET) has been utilized in the investigation of nociception. However, a possible drawback from previous studies is the reduced activation pattern due to the application of anesthesia. The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate a potential means of avoiding anesthesia during stimulation, as well as minimizing the confounding anesthetic effect. Sodium pentobarbital and ketamine were first evaluated to determine their effect on microPET images in the current study. [(18)F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) was an appropriate radiotracer to reveal activated regions in rat brains. Pentobarbital anesthesia significantly reduced (18)F-FDG uptake in neural tissues, blurrier to lower contrast therefore, ketamine was used to anesthetize animals during microPET. After the rats were anesthetized and secured in a laboratory-made stereotaxic frame, a simple, noninvasive stereotaxic technique was used to position their heads in the microPET scanner and to roughly conform the images in the stereotaxic atlas. For functional imaging, conscious rats were restrained in cages with minimal ambient noise
