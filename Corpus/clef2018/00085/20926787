Removing interictal fast ripples on electrocorticography linked with seizure freedom in children. Fast ripples (FR, 250-500 Hz) detected with chronic intracranial electrodes are proposed biomarkers of epileptogenesis. This study determined whether resection of FR-containing neocortex recorded during intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) was associated with postoperative seizure freedom in pediatric patients with mostly extratemporal lesions.FRs were retrospectively reviewed in 30 consecutive pediatric cases. ECoGs were recorded at 2,000 Hz sampling rate and visually inspected for FR, with reviewer blinded to the resection and outcome.Average age at surgery was 9.1 ± 6.7 years, ECoG duration was 11.8 ± 8.1 minutes, and postoperative follow-up was 27 ± 4 months. FRs were undetected in 6 ECoGs with remote or extensive lesions. FR episodes (n = 273) were identified in ECoGs from 24 patients, and in 64% FRs were independent of spikes, sharp waves, voltage attenuation, and paroxysmal fast activity. Of these 24 children, FR-containing cortex was removed in 19 and all became seizure-free, including 1 child after a second surgery. The remaining 5 children had incomplete FR resection and all continued with seizures postoperatively. In 2 ECoGs, the location of electrographic seizures matched FR location. FR-containing cortex was found outside of MRI and FDG-PET abnormalities in 6 children.FRs were detected during intraoperative ECoG in 80% of pediatric epilepsy cases, and complete resection of FR cortex correlated with postoperative seizure freedom. These findings support the view that interictal FRs are excellent surrogate markers of epileptogenesis, can be recorded during brief ECoG, and could be used to guide future surgical resections in children.
