Comparison of regional brain metabolism in bulimia nervosa and affective disorder assessed with positron emission tomography. Women with bulimia often present with symptoms of depression in addition to bingeing and purging behavior. Brain metabolism in eight women with bulimia nervosa was compared to that in eight women with major affective disorder and eight normal women, using positron emission tomography and 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose. Normal women have higher right than left cortical metabolic rates and active basal ganglia. Bulimics lost the normal right activation in some areas, but maintained basal ganglia activity. Depressives retained right hemisphere activation, but had decreased metabolism in basal ganglia. This suggests that although women with bulimia frequently present with symptoms of depression, the pathophysiologic changes associated with bulimia differ from major effective disorder.
