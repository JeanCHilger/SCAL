Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography findings in mantle cell lymphoma. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with a propensity for extranodal involvement. The role of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in common types of lymphoma has been well-established. However, there is limited information in the literature about the utility of FDG-PET imaging in patients who have MCL. The aim of this study was to determine the role of FDG-PET imaging in assessment of disease activity in MCL compared with conventional imaging techniques such as computerized tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI).FDG-PET images of 20 patients with MCL who were referred to our center for assessment of extent of disease were reviewed retrospectively. The FDG-PET findings were compared with those of CT/MRI and were correlated with clinical information, histopathology, and outcome.The diagnostic sensitivity for PET was 90% (17/19), and specificity was 100% (1/1). For CT/MRI, the sensitivity was 87% (14/16) and specificity was 50% (2/4). PET was better than CT/MRI in detecting nodal involvement. With respect to extranodal involvement, PET detected more cases of spleen involvement than CT/MRI. PET was equivalent to conventional imaging in detecting bowel involvement.PET imaging has a high sensitivity in detecting both nodal and extranodal involvement in patients who have MCL. Based on the available data in patients who had other subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the specificity of PET also appears to be superior to anatomic imaging techniques. FDG-PET imaging may prove to be the single most effective method for detection.
