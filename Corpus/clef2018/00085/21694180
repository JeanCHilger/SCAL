The first-principles multi-component molecular orbitalÂ approach to bound states of positron with the 2-deoxyglucose molecule as a reagent of positron emission tomography. Characteristic features of the positron binding properties of 2-deoxyglucose molecules of C(6)H(11)O(5)F and C(6)H(11)O(6)(-), which are used as reagents of positron emission tomography (PET), are discussed based on the results obtained by a first-principles multi-component molecular orbital calculation. This method can take the positron-electron coupling into account under the mean-field approximation. Due to the large electronic polarization, the positron affinity of anionic C(6)H(11)O(6)(-) is much greater than that of neutral C(6)H(11)O(5)F.
