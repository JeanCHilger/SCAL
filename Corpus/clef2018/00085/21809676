Role of single-photon emission computer tomography in dynamic evaluation of combined treatment of malignant cerebral glioma. Thirty-nine patients with malignant glioma of the brain were examined at the Center's Clinic. Tumor volume ranged 0.8-175.1 cu cm. Radionuclide diagnosis was obtained with the aid of single-photon emission tomography (E.Cam, Siemens). 99mTc-DTPA, 3-6 MBc/body, was injected intravenously. Smaller size of tumor and lower ratio of differentiated marker accumulation focus/contralateral area were registered in 34%. Simultaneously, a high index of the marker accumulation in the brain was reported, thus suggesting hyperimpermeability of the blood brain barrier. Another 26% revealed larger size of tumor and higher ratio of differentiated 99mTc-DTPA accumulation, likely due to lower impermeability of the blood brain barrier. Hence, use of single-photon emission tomography in diagnosis of malignant cerebral glioma provides a means of evaluating the level of the marker in a tumor node.
