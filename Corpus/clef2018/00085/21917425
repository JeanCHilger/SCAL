Differences in cerebral blood flow between missed and generalized seizures with electroconvulsive therapy: a positron emission tomographic study. While examining the acute effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), we could compare the changes in rCBF between missed (not generalized) and generalized seizures using H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography in patients with depression under anesthesia. In contrast to missed seizures, rCBF was increased extensively, particularly in the centrencephalic structures in generalized seizures. These results further support the centrencephalic theory of seizure generalization.
