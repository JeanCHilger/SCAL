Incidental detection of clinically occult follicle stimulating hormone secreting pituitary adenoma on whole body 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography. A 73-year-old man, known case of Hodgkin's lymphoma, underwent 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18-FDG PET-CT) for post-chemotherapy evaluation of the disease status. The scan revealed focal increased FDG uptake in pituitary fossa. The CT images showed homogenously enhancing pituitary lesion causing expansion of the sella. A possibility for the presence of pituitary adenoma was raised in the report. Hormonal assay of the patient showed raised follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level of 18 IU/ml (normal range for males up to 5 IU/ml). All the other pituitary hormones were within the normal range. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging of brain showed a pituitary lesion with expanded sella pushing the optic chiasma superiorly. NMR findings confirmed the presence of pituitary macroadenoma. A final diagnosis of FSH secreting pituitary macroadenoma was made.
