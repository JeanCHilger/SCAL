Assessment of myocardial damage in cardiomyopathy using 111In-antimyosin Fab myocardial scintigraphy. 111In-antimyosin Fab (AM) myocardial scintigraphy was carried out in (A) 10 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, (B) 7 with dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and (C) 8 with normal (control) individuals. Imaging was taken 48 hours after intravenous injection of 74 MBq of AM. Myocardial uptake of AM was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Positive uptake was observed in 9/10 (90%), 7/7 (100%) and 0/8 (0%) in group A, B and C, respectively. AM index (heart/lung ratio) in group A and B were 2.04 +/- 0.24 and 2.46 +/- 0.49, values significantly higher than that obtained in the control patient without cardiomyopathy (1.51 +/- 0.13) (p less than 0.01). Positive monoclonal antimyosin antibody studies were highly prevalent in dilated cardiomyopathic and dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathic patients, even in the presence of negative right ventricular biopsy. It is suggested that this method was useful for the noninvasive assessment of active myocardial damage in these patients.
