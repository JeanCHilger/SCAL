Outcome of cervical carcinoma with locoregional lymph node involvement by FDG-PET. To assess the outcome of cervical carcinoma with positive nodes on fluorodesoxyglucose positon emission tomography scans (FDG-PET).Patients with cervical carcinoma who had pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes involvement by FDG-PET and treated with a curative intent from 2003 to 2007 were retrospectively studied. All patients received pelvic (and possibly para-aortic) radiotherapy with chemotherapy, followed by brachytherapy, and possibly surgery. The first site of relapse was classified as follows: local, nodal (pelvic or para-aortic) or metastatic.Forty patients were included the study. Median age was 47 years (range: 28-78). Thirty patients had nodal involvement limited to pelvic area and ten had a para-aortic involvement. Median follow-up was 42.5 months (range: 11-85). There were 22 relapses and 20 deaths: 20 due to relapse and one due to late toxicity. Three-year survival is 50 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 36-65). First relapse was: metastatic for 33 % (13/40), local for 20 % (8/40) and isolated nodal for 5 % (2/40). Multivariate analysis has revealed that only staging according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and para-aortic involvement had a significant impact on survival. Three-year survival was 58 % (CI: 39-74) and 24 % (CI: 7-57) (P=0.009) in patient without and with para-aortic involvement, respectively.Para-aortic involvement by FDG-PET is a significant prognostic factor for overall survival. Local control at primary site remains of paramount importance for patient with nodal involvement. Isolated nodal failures are scarce.
