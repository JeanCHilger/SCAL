Super resolution SPECT reconstruction with non-uniform attenuation. In this paper, based on Novikov's explicit inversion formula for the attenuated Radon transform, we present a super resolution SPECT reconstruction algorithm with compensation for non-uniform attenuation. Unlike the former methods improving the medical image resolution via super resolution (SR) in the reconstructed image, the proposed method apply the SR algorithm in the low resolution (LR) sinogram, which needs only 1-D shift of the detector, and the PSF is easy to obtain. Simulation results show that our reconstruction algorithm is effective.
