Chondroitin sulfate and epidermal growth factor immobilization after plasma polymerization: a versatile anti-apoptotic coating to promote healing around stent grafts. Bioactive coatings constitute an interesting approach to enhance healing around implants, such as stent-grafts used in endovascular aneurysm repair. Three different plasma techniques, namely NH₃ plasma functionalization and atmospheric- or low-pressure plasma polymerization, are compared to create amino groups and covalently bind CS and EGF bioactive molecules on PET. The latter presents the greatest potential. CS + EGF coating is shown to strongly decrease cell apoptosis and cell depletion in serum-free medium, while increasing cell growth compared to unmodified PET. This versatile biomimetic coating holds promise in promoting vascular repair around stent-grafts, where resistance to apoptosis is a key issue.
