Parathyroid scintigraphy: when, how, and why? A concise systematic review. In recent years, preoperative imaging has become essential in the evaluation of sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) for selecting good candidates for minimally invasive HPT. Its role in patients with secondary/tertiary HPT is under investigation. Imaging is mandatory before reoperative parathyroid surgery for persistent or recurrent HPT, whatever the setting. This review provides detailed information regarding the nuclear imaging methods (dual phase, subtraction), the role of SPECT and SPECT/CT, and the clinical results of parathyroid scintigraphy in different clinical situations.
