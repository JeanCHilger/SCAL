Brown fat at PET/CT: correlation with patient characteristics. To assess the prevalence of brown fat in patients with cancer, compare demographic characteristics of those with and those without brown fat, and correlate these characteristics with the mean and maximum standardized uptake values of brown fat.This case-control study was institutional review board approved and HIPAA compliant. Informed consent was waived. Reports of 12 195 consecutive positron emission tomography/computed tomography examinations performed in 6867 patients between January 2004 and November 2008 were reviewed for documented fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in brown fat (n = 298). Control patients (n = 298) without brown fat were chosen and matched for age, sex, and month and year of examination. Age, sex, weight, body mass index, ethnicity, and examination stage (initial vs restaging) were compared between groups. Paired Student t test, χ(2) test, Pearson correlation coefficient, and analysis of variance were used for statistical analysis.Uptake of FDG in brown fat was demonstrated in 298 of 6867 (4.33%) patients. Prevalence of brown fat was significantly higher in female (5.9% [211 of 3587]) than in male patients (2.65% [87 of 3280] P < .001). Those with brown fat had significantly lower body weight (147.5 lb ± 3.8 vs 168.61 lb ± 5.0Patients with brown fat were more likely to be female and thinner than those without brown fat. Younger patients were more likely to have higher maximum standardized uptake values of brown fat.
