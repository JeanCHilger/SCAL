Molecular imaging of adrenal neoplasms. The adrenal glands are complex structures from which a variety of benign and malignant tumors may arise and are a common site of metastatic disease. Several radiopharmaceuticals are used for imaging the adrenals, including I-123/I-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), norcholesterol derivatives, In-111 pentetreotide and Ga-68 somatostatin analogs, [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose, [F-18]fluorodopa, [F-18]fluorodopamine, C-11 meta hydroxyephedrine, and C-11/F-18/I-123 Metomidate (MTO) or its analogs. In this review we focus on the role of these reagents in metastatic lesions, cortical neoplasms, pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, and neuroblastoma (NB).
