Assessment of myocardial viability by resting 201Tl SPECT image. The aim of this study was to assess whether resting 201Tl scintigraphy is superior in detecting viable myocardium than previous conventional methods. We performed not only stress 201Tl SPECT but also resting 201Tl SPECT within one month in 65 patients with coronary artery disease. Resting 201Tl images were quantitatively compared with 4 hour late images of stress study using a polar map. In stress study, redistribution was recognized on 83% (25/30) of non-MI SEGs with perfusion defect in the stress 201Tl image, and on 39% (18/46) of infarcted SEGs. The agreement of resting 201Tl study with 4 hour late images of stress study was shown on 93% (28/30) of non-MI SEGs and on 52% (24/46) of MI SEGs. The increased uptake of 201Tl in resting study, however, was found on 13 (46%) of 28 MI SEGs showing fixed defects in stress study. In stress delayed image with fixed defect, the %Tl uptake of improved SEGs was higher than that of unchanged SEGs (59 +/- 10% vs 48 +/- 11% p greater than 0.05). There was no viable myocardium which had %Tl uptake less than 40% at stress delayed image. In conclusion, the resting 201Tl imaging will give an important information as for the myocardial viability showing fixed defects, if more than 40% Tl uptake is observed.
