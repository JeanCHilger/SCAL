Combined PET/CT for IMRT treatment planning of NSCLC: contrast-enhanced CT images for Monte Carlo dose calculation. Combined PET/CT imaging has been proposed as an integral part of radiotherapy treatment planning (TP). Contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT) images are frequently acquired as part of the PET/CT examination to support target delineation. The aim of this dosimetric planning study was to investigate the error introduced by using a ceCT for intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) TP with Monte Carlo dose calculation for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Nine patients with NSCLC prior to chemo-RT were included in this retrospective study. For each patient non-enhanced, low-dose CT (neCT), ceCT and [(18)F]-FDG-PET emission data were acquired within a single examination. Manual contouring and TP were performed on the ceCT. An additional set of independent target volumes was auto-segmented in PET images. Dose distributions were recalculated on the neCT. Differences in dosimetric parameters were evaluated.Dose differences in PTV and lungs were small for all patients. The maximum difference in all PTVs when using ceCT images for dose calculation was -2.1%, whereas the mean difference was less than -1.7%. Maximum differences in the lungs ranged from -1.8% to 2.1% (mean: -0.1%). In four patients an underestimation of the maximum spinal cord dose between 2% and 3.2% was observed, but treatment plans remained clinically acceptable.Monte Carlo based IMRT planning for NSCLC patients using ceCT allows for correct dose calculation. A direct comparison to neCT-based treatment plans revealed only small dose differences. Therefore, ceCT-based TP is clinically safe as long as the maximum acceptable dose to organs at risk is not approached.
