The radiosynthesis of [N-methyl-11C]-sertraline. [N-methyl-11C]Sertraline, a potential agent for the study of the serotonergic system in vivo with positron emission tomography, was prepared by N-methylation of the corresponding norcompound with [11C]iodomethane, which was itself prepared from cyclotron-produced [11C]carbon dioxide. Under the best conditions found [norsertraline free base (20 mM) in DMF (0.70 mL), 120 degrees C for 8 min] [N-methyl-11C]-sertraline can be prepared in 43% radiochemical yield from [11C]iodomethane (decay-corrected), corresponding to 20% overall radiochemical yield from [11C]carbon dioxide (decay-corrected), with high specific radioactivity. Preparations can be ready for i.v. injection 50 min from the end of radionuclide production.
