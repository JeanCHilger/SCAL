Myocardial scintigraphy using 99m-technetium pyrophosphate in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarct. Comparison of planar and tomographic imaging. The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging with 99mTc-pyrophosphate in the verification of acute myocardial infarction. The study was performed on 39 patients (26 males, 13 females) aged between 41-76 years (mean 61 +/- 9) admitted to CCU for acute myocardial infarction. Patients underwent planar and SPECT imaging using a double-head-camera with a 360 degrees rotation arc within 6 days of admission. Planar images were obtained in three standard projections (anterior, LAO 45 degrees, LAO 75 degrees) with acquisitions of 500000 counts each. To obtain SPECT images ninety projections, each lasting 20 seconds, were taken subsequently images reconstruction was performed using an iterative algorithm. Positive planar images were found in 21 out of 39 patients
