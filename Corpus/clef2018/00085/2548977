Computer-controlled radiochemical synthesis: a chemistry process control unit for the automated production of radiochemicals. A computer-controlled general purpose chemistry process control unit (CPCU) suitable for the automated production of radiochemicals has been developed. This valve-and-tubing synthesis system can be user programmed to accommodate a variety of chemical processes. In a practical demonstration of its utility, the CPCU has been configured and programmed to synthesize 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (2-[18F]FDG) using aqueous [18F]fluoride ion. Using this instrument, the yield of 2-[18F]FDG from [18F]fluoride ion is 54.9% (+/- 11.2%, n = 125) corrected to EOB, after a synthesis time of 50-55 min. The average total activity produced (for runs of 5-10 microA) is 28.1 mCi/microA (+/- 5.03 mCi/microA). Thus, the amount of 2-[18F]FDG produced from a 10 microA for 1 h bombardment was 154.3 mCi (+/- 27.4 mCi). The unit has been similarly configured and programmed to synthesize 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-mannose (48% EOB), 3-(2'-[18F]fluoroethyl)spiperone (29% EOB), and [18F]fluoroacetate (66% EOB) from aqueous [18F]-fluoride ion, and 2-[18F]FDG from gaseous acetyl hypo[18F]fluorite (20% EOB).
