The multislice cylinder: a new approach to quantification of cardiac single photon emission tomography. A new method of displaying SPECT (single photon emission tomography) thallium-201 images is described in which cardiac activity is constructed as a cylindrical map. Exercise thallium-201 scintigrams from 52 patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease are analysed by this technique and a simplified severity score devised.
