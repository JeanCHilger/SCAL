Amino acid metabolism in pituitary adenomas. Patients with pituitary adenomas were examined with positron emission tomography with the administration of 11C-labelled methionine. In a few patients comparative studies using the two stereo-isomers L- and D-methionine were also performed. The results showed a rapid distribution of D-methionine within the tumor tissue without signs of irreversible trapping of the tracer. L-methionine on the other hand was rapidly irreversibly trapped indicating the metabolic fate. It is concluded that 11C-L-methionine can be used to quantify amino acid metabolism in the tumors. The amino acid metabolism was evaluated in a group of adenomas before and after treatment with bromocriptine. The results indicate a marked reduction of the amino acid metabolism in prolactinomas amounting to 60%. These tumors at a later time responded with tumor shrinkage. Hormonally inactive tumors showed no effect of treatment.
