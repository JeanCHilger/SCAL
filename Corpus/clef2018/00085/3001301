Imaging of [11C]-labelled Ro 15-1788 binding to benzodiazepine receptors in the human brain by positron emission tomography. The benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 was labelled with [11C] and examined for possible use as ligand for PET scan studies on benzodiazepine receptors in the brain of cynomolgus monkeys and human subjects. [11C] Ro 15-1788 allowed the in vivo visualization of benzodiazepine receptor binding in cerebral and cerebellar cortical areas as well as in basal brain nuclei in PET scan images. [11C] Ro 15-1788 exhibited a high ratio of specific benzodiazepine receptor binding (cerebral cortex) to non-specific binding (pons) and the kinetics of binding should be satisfactory for quantitative clinical PET scan studies using [11C]. The in vivo binding of [11C] Ro 15-1788 in the cerebral cortex of cynomolgus monkeys and healthy human subjects was reduced by approximately 90% within 10 min after the intravenous injection of a high dose of unlabelled Ro 15-1788 (0.5 mg/kg i.v.). Different areas of the healthy human brain showed an approximately 10-fold variation in maximal [11C] Ro 15-1788 binding that corresponded to the previously known distribution of benzodiazepine receptors in these regions. The highest degree of binding was obtained in the medial occipital cerebral cortex followed by frontal cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, striatum and pons. Two psychiatric patients with anxiety syndromes who had been treated for a long time with high doses of benzodiazepines had roughly the same degree of maximal [11C] Ro 15-1788 binding in brain regions as the healthy subjects but the rate of decline of [11C] Ro 15-1788 in the brain was higher. This indicates that there is measurable competition between [11C] Ro 15-1788 binding and clinical benzodiazepine concentrations in the body fluids of psychiatric patients. The results demonstrate that [11C] Ro 15-1788 should be a valuable tool for quantitative analyses of benzodiazepine receptor characteristics and receptor occupancy in the brain of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.
