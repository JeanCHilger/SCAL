Nicardipine improves myocardial perfusion in systemic sclerosis. Primary scleroderma myocardial disease may be due in part to myocardial ischemia caused by a disturbance of the coronary microcirculation. We evaluated the effect of the calcium channel blocker nicardipine on myocardial perfusion assessed by thallium-201 scanning in 16 patients with systemic sclerosis. Thallium-201 single photon emission computerized tomography was performed at baseline and 90 min after 40 mg of oral nicardipine. The mean (+/- SD) number of left ventricular segments with perfusion defects significantly decreased from 6.0 +/- 2.0 at baseline to 4.1 +/- 2.3 after nicardipine (p less than 0.01). The mean global perfusion score significantly increased from 10.2 +/- 1.9 at baseline to 11.9 +/- 2.6 after nicardipine (p less than 0.02). Our study demonstrates short-term improvement in thallium-201 myocardial perfusion with nicardipine in patients with systemic sclerosis.
