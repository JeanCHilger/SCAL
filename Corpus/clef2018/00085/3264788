Semiquantifying regional cerebral blood flow by 123I-amphetamine (IMP) SPECT in cerebrovascular disorders: correlations with CBF indices by 133Xe inhalation method. To examine the capacity of detecting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) disturbances in stroke, measurements with 133Xe inhalation and 123I-amphetamine (IMP) SPECT were performed within 1-2 days in 19 patients. IMP SPECT images in transverse sections consisting of outer and inner areas were correlated with 32 regions of 133Xe rCBF. 133Xe rCBF was assessed by ISI, CBF15, and F1. Inter hemispheric ratio correlation showed outer IMP uptake correlated better with 133Xe CBF indices than the inner one. With higher ratios of 133Xe rCBF. IMP uptake ratios were variable, suggesting less usefulness of this parameter in evaluation of mild ischemia. Values of IMP in outer regional hypo and hyperemic areas correlated better with those of 133Xe rCBF than the inner ones. In regional ratios of hypo and hyperemic areas from hemispheric mean, outer IMP uptake correlated with 133Xe CBF indices, reflecting regional disturbances of fast clearing tissue perfusion. Regression lines between ratios in 133Xe CBF and IMP uptake were located below one to one correlation, and dissociated more for hyperemic regions. IMP SPECT correlated better with 133Xe rCBF for tissues with reduced perfusion but underestimated hyperemic regions as measured with the 133Xe method. The data suggest outer cerebral IMP uptake evaluated by SPECT could reflect flow disturbances in the brain cortex.
