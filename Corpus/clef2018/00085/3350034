The biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of meta-iodobenzylguanidine in childhood neuroblastoma. MIBG is generating considerable interest for the treatment of neuroblastoma. This study has investigated the biological variation in handling of the compound in children with neuroblastoma. The biodistribution of the compound has been characterised in children undergoing tracer administrations of 123I and 131I-mIBG. Estimates of hepatic and whole body radiation dose delivery have been made. The results indicate substantial interpatient variation in hepatic dose delivery. This organ may be critical in some patients undergoing targeted radiotherapy with mIBG.
