New methods of examining gamma camera collimators. New methods are proposed and described to examine the quality of gamma camera collimators in two special performance categories, namely, uniformity in regional efficiency and regional variations in channel tilt. These two performances are critical areas for SPECT imaging. Results obtained from experimental and commercial collimators illustrate the variability seen for these performance characteristics in currently available collimators.
