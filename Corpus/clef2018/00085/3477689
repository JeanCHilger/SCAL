The pet owner experience. The sheer frequency of contact with animals poses special problems for the allergist it is estimated that six to seven percent of the U.S. population suffer from allergies and nearly 25% of the allergic population are sensitive to dogs and cats. That would mean that at least 1.5% of the population is sensitive to dogs and cats, let alone other animals. Considering that over 60% of the country's 85 million households have dogs and/or cats, this poses a problem that should not be ignored. The role of other furred and feathered pets must also be a topic of future research, especially as these animals become more popular. What must be appreciated is that the pet owner experience is so pervasive and of such importance in the lives of people that many people, especially young people, have more contact with animals than even those who work with animals. There is now a great concern for the emotional and economic well-being of those whose occupation involves animal contact, which is most appropriate. It is also time to extend this concern to the many other citizens of this country who share their lives with animals.
