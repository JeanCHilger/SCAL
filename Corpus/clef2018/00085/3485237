A dynamic quality control phantom for radionuclide cardiology. A three-dimensional dynamic cardiac phantom suitable for quality control of equilibrium gated nuclear cardiographic procedures is described. Its flexible microprocessor based design provides an absolute standard for ejection fraction determination, ventricular volume quantitation, and physiologically gated single photon emission computed tomography. The cost of the phantom is comparable to that of commercially available phantoms suitable for ejection fraction quality control alone.
