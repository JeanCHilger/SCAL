Diagnostic usefulness of SPECT with Tc99m HM-PAO in cerebral pathology in outpatient practice. After having outlined the importance of evaluating, in cerebral diseases, the regional cerebral blood flow by means of a non invasive method, the advantages of SPECT with Tc99m HM-PAO compared to the SPECT with radioxenon and iodoamphetamine are point out. The results obtained with this method on 28 different patients, six of with were normal subjects, while the remaining 22 were suffering: six from cerebro vascular disease, four from epilepsy, three from TIA, six from dementia, two from depressive syndrome and one from hemicrania are reported. The comparison of the results with literature references, proves that the tracer employed is definitely superior to TCT, while there is a coincidence with SPECT data obtained with radioxenon and iodoamphetamine. The radiotracer employed can be successfully used, due to its convenient physical-chemical features, in a daily routine, for the evaluation of regional cerebral blood flow in encephalic diagnostics.
