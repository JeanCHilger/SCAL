Polyclonal and monoclonal anti-CEA antibodies in immunolocalization of colorectal cancer. Antibodies to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) from sheep and monkey were immunoadsorbent purified. Mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) anti-CEA I-38S1 and Fab fragments of this antibody were prepared from mouse ascitic fluid. The IgG preparations were labelled with 123I or 131I, the Fab fragments with 131I. The antibody reactivity was unchanged after labelling. Patients with advanced colorectal carcinomas received an intravenous injection of 50-200 MBq 123I or 30-160 MBq 131I coupled to 250-500 micrograms antibody or antibody fragment. Patient examinations were performed using emission tomography (SPECT) and/or conventional gamma camera scintigraphy. The specific localization of labelled anti-CEA to tumor was compared to known tumor localized by CAT-scan, other x-ray methods or laparotomy, 50% of known tumors were accurately localized with sheep anti-CEA. In contrast, 70-80% of known tumor sites were correctly localized with polyclonal monkey anti-CEA antibodies, with monoclonal anti-CEA antibodies or with Fab fragments of the latter. A few previously unknown tumors were detected.
