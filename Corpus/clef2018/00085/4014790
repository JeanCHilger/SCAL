Storage mites culturing, sampling technique, identification and their role in housedust allergy in rural areas in the United Kingdom. Patients with symptoms suggesting housedust mite allergy were tested to storage mites, housedust, and Dermatophagoides spp. Housedust was examined for mites. All patients responded to storage mites. Some were negative to Dermatophagoides. All houses proved to have storage mites in the dust as well as Dermatophagoides, mainly in food stores or pet beds. Storage mites, therefore, are involved in dust allergy.
