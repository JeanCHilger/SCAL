Toxocara infection in animal hospital employees. The recent development of a sensitive and specific test (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) for Toxocara canis infection has made it possible to study the epidemiology of this parasite in man. Antibody to Toxocara was measured in veterinarians, kennel workers, nurses, laboratory technicians, and clerical personnel in an animal hospital (Animal Medical Center, New York, NY) in order to determine the risk of infection in persons with varying degrees of occupational and home exposure to pet dogs. Antibodies were found in 8 (11 per cent) of 73 employees, and the prevalence and intensity of antibody was not statistically associated with either job exposure or dog ownership. However, antibody was not detected in any of the 14 employees who denied both past and present dog ownership. Additional studies using larger numbers of sera are required to determine the significance of these findings.
