Serial measurements of positron-emitting isotope activity in rat brain. This report describes the construction and performance characteristics of a device capable of making rapid serial measurement of rat brain radioactivity following the administration of a positron emitting isotope. Two bismuth germanate oxide (BGO) scintillation detectors in a coincidence detection circuit are used to achieve the necessary degree of collimation. Data from the device can be used to characterize cerebral biochemical and physiological processes using computer-assisted mathematical models.
