Pet ownership in rural Northern California (El Dorado County). Demographic and economic aspects of pet ownership were studied in 488 households in El Dorado County, California, from May to July 1971. About 60% of households owned dogs or cats, and pet ownership was most prevalent (75%) in two small residential communities in the western end of the county. Among dogs, Poodle and German Shepherd Dog were the most popular breeds about 36% of the females in the sample were spayed, but only 6% of the males were castrated. Approximately one third of all cats had been neutered. Reported use of veterinary services was higher for dogs (79%) than for cats (53%). The results of the survey indicated pet ownership is most likely to be found in households with children, where the head of household is employed, generally confirming findings from earlier surveys in Yolo, Alameda, and Contra Costa Counties (all in northern California) and later surveys in Champaign County, Illinois, and Garland, Tex. Some community health findings were included for El Dorado County and nearby Yolo County. In these two counties, cancer was reported more frequently by adults without pets (3.9% of those greater than or equal to 65 years old) than by pet owners (1.8% of those greater than or equal to 65 years old). Among children less than 5 years old, "frequent diarrhea" was reported more commonly in homes without pets (9.5% vs 2.6%
