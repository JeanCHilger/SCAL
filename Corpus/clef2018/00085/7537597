Computer planning of stereotactic iodine-125 seed brachytherapy for recurrent malignant gliomas. At St Thomas' Hospital, we have developed a computer program on a Titan graphics supercomputer to plan the stereotactic implantation of iodine-125 seeds for the palliative treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas. Use of the Gill-Thomas-Cosman relocatable frame allows planning and surgery to be carried out at different hospitals on different days. Stereotactic computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans are performed and the images transferred to the planning computer. The head, tumour and frame fiducials are outlined on the relevant images, and a three-dimensional model generated. Structures which could interfere with the surgery or radiotherapy, such as major vessels, shunt tubing etc., can also be outlined and included in the display. Catheter target and entry points are set using a three-dimensional cursor controlled by a set of dials attached to the computer. The program calculates and displays the radiation dose distribution within the target volume for various catheter and seed arrangements. The CT co-ordinates of the fiducial rods are used to convert catheter co-ordinates from CT space to frame space and to calculate the catheter insertion angles and depths. The surgically implanted catheters are after-loaded the next day and the seeds left in place for between 4 and 6 days, giving a nominal dose of 50 Gy to the edge of the target volume. 25 patients have been treated so far.
