Effects of modified pharmacologic stress approaches on hyperemic myocardial blood flow. Pharmacologic stress testing with 0.56 mg/kg of intravenous dipyridamole is frequently used to noninvasively detect coronary artery disease (CAD). However, high-dose dipyridamole (0.80 mg/kg) or the combination of standard-dose dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg) with the isometric handgrip maneuver might evoke a greater coronary hyperemic response.To evaluate the effect of modified pharmacologic stress tests, myocardial blood flow as quantified in 11 male subjects (mean age: 27 +/- 7 yr) during standard-dose dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg), high-dose dipyridamole (0.80 mg/kg) and standard-dose dipyridamole combined with the isometric handgrip exercise using dynamic PET and a two-compartment model for 13N-ammonia.Systolic blood pressure, heart rate and rate pressure product remained unchanged from standard to high-dose dipyridamole but increased with the addition of the isometric handgrip. Myocardial blood flow was unchanged from standard to high-dose dipyridamole but was lower with the addition of the isometric handgrip.The hyperemic response induced by standard-dose dipyridamole cannot be further enhanced by high-dose dipyridamole. The addition of the isometric handgrip exercise results in a modest, but significant decline in hyperemic blood flow possibly due to increased extravascular resistive forces or an increase in a mediated coronary vasoconstriction associated with exercise.
