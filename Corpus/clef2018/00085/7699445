Posterolateral defect of the normal human heart investigated with nitrogen-13-ammonia and dynamic PET. The posterolateral defect is a common artifact seen when static 13N-ammonia imaging with PET is used to assess myocardial perfusion. The aim of this study was to compare dynamic and static. 13N-ammonia PET and to obtain more insight into the cause of the posterolateral defect.Dynamic 13N-ammonia PET was performed in 19 healthy nonsmoking volunteers at rest. Perfusion was assessed in the early phase of the study using a curve fit method over the first 90 sec. Nitrogen-13 accumulation (static PET) was assessed 4 to 8 min after injection. Each study was normalized to a mean of 100. The average distribution of normalized perfusion and activity was calculated in 24 segments. Heterogeneity of both activity and perfusion distribution were assessed and the activity distribution was compared with perfusion distribution.Perfusion distribution was homogeneous, with the exception of the inferior and apical regions. Activity distribution was inhomogeneous, with a lower activity in the posterolateral and apical regions. In the whole left ventricle, significant differences in distribution were found between static and dynamic imaging.Perfusion distribution was significantly different on dynamic images compared to static images. The posterolateral defect was not found on dynamic images. The posterolateral defect and other inhomogeneities in activity distribution are caused by tracer-dependent features, probably a redistribution of metabolites of 13N-ammonia.
