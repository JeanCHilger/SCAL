Dosimetric considerations in 131I-MIBG therapy for neuroblastoma in children. Dosimetric calculations have been made for organ doses in patients receiving 131I-MIBG therapy as treatment for neuroblastoma. As well as whole body and liver dose, consideration has been given to dosimetry of organs (lung, urinary bladder) whose tolerance may become treatment limiting when 131I-MIBG is given as part of combined modality therapy. Data from both adults and children receiving radiolabelled MIBG for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes have been compared in constructing dosimetry models for children. A recently published urodynamic model has been used in the estimation of radiation dose to the bladder. The results show that liver and lung may receive doses greater than the average total body dose (0.58 mGy MBq-1 and 0.35 mGy MBq-1, respectively, as compared with 0.25 mGy MBq-1 to the whole body). The organ dose estimates do not differ greatly from previous analyses except in the case of the bladder for which the new modelling studies have resulted in lower dose estimates (0.76 mGy MBq-1 administered, for dose to bladder surface from bladder contents) than in some published series. This may result from differing assumptions regarding parameters such as bladder content and urine flow rate, an enhanced fluid intake being assumed in the present bladder dose estimates. Average doses to the bladder wall from the contents were estimated to be 7.4-11.3% of the surface doses. The urodynamic modelling analysis shows that the bladder could receive a much greater dose (by an order of magnitude) in patients who were inadequately hydrated or had impaired renal function.
