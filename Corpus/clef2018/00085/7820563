The role of the right hemisphere in the interpretation of figurative aspects of language. A positron emission tomography activation study.

During regional cerebral blood flow measurement subjects were asked to perform three different linguistic tasks: (i) metaphorical comprehension (ii) literal comprehension of sentences
