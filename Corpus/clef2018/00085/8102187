The effect of neuroleptics on human brain estimated by SPECT and PET. In order to estimate the effect of neuroleptics on human central nervous system, a number of trials are now performed by means of SPECT and PET. Of these, the changes in glucose and oxygen metabolism and blood flow are good indicators of drug effects. The receptor occupancy during neuroleptics medication may provide the information on the most effective dose to be administered without side effect. By measuring both of the neural transmission and its effects on metabolism, brain function can be further clearly understood.
