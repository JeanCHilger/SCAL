Neurobiological bases of schizophrenia. Environmental and biological factors play an important role in the etiology of Schizophrenia. We believe that the disorder is probably multifactorial with a genetic predisposition that triggers morphological (CT, MRN) and functional (EP, SPECT and PET) brain alterations in the areas, where the integration of the affect, comprehension and expression of emotions occur. These areas are also involved in the planification and organization of cognitive and emotional functions. These findings may have clinical implicancies (soft signs), and neurochemical corroborations (neurotransmitters and receptors qualifications and imaging in SPECT and PET.
