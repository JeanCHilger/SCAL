Imaging of activated natural killer cells in mice by positron emission tomography: preferential uptake in tumors. Optimal delivery of immunologically active cells to target tissue(s) is important for improving adoptive immunotherapy of neoplastic diseases. By using positron emission tomography, we have measured the systemic distribution and tumor localization of locally injected, activated natural killer (NK) cells or nonactivated lymphocytes in the FSaII fibrosarcoma grown s.c. in the tail of C3H mice. Murine NK cells were isolated and expanded in the presence of interleukin 2 and collected at 5 to 7 days after culture. These cells were then washed and labeled with [11C]methyl iodide, a positron-emitting isotope. Ten million activated or nonactivated cells were injected into the lateral tail vein distal to the tumor over a period of 2 min, and the accumulation of counts in the tumor was monitored during the injection and at 30-60 min postinjection. There was no significant difference in the rate of accumulation of activated NK cells (685 +/- 264 (SE) n = 5) versus nonactivated splenic lymphocytes (595 +/- 105
