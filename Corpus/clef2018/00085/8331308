Variations in the size of the ischemic myocardium due to differences in the normal file. The myocardial thallium concentration is different during pharmacologic than exercise stress testing due to differences in coronary blood flow and cardiac output. These differences may affect the quantitative measurement of the size of ischemic myocardium if a stress-specific normal file is not used. This study examined this concept in 34 patients with isolated left anterior descending coronary artery disease. All patients underwent tomographic thallium imaging during adenosine infusion (140 micrograms/kg/min for 6 minutes). The size of the ischemic myocardium was measured from the polar map using two different normal files one derived from normal subjects undergoing treadmill exercise testing, and the second from normal subjects undergoing adenosine stress testing. The extent perfusion abnormality was 19 +/- 13% using the exercise file, and 11 +/- 10% using adenosine file (difference
