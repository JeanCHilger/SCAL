3H]CFT ([3H]WIN 35,428) accumulation in dopamine regions of monkey brain: comparison of a mature and an aged monke. The distribution of a tracer dose of the dopamine transport probe [3H]CFT ([3H]WIN 35,428 2.5 nmol/kg) in brain was examined 90 min following intravenous administration to a mature (8 years, approximately) and an aged (> 20 years) squirrel (Saimiri sciureus) monkey. Ex vivo autoradiography revealed [3H]CFT labeling predominantly in dopamine-rich regions. The high striatum:cerebellum ratio, 5.6, compares favorably with other markers for dopamine systems. Ligand accumulation in striatum was substantially lower in the aged monkey compared with the younger adult monkey. The present findings support the use of the cocaine congener CFT for monitoring the dopamine transporter on dopamine nerve terminals by PET (positron emission tomography) imaging.
