Regional cerebral blood flow measured by 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT differs in subgroups of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous entity. Identifying AD subtypes might have impact in patients' response to different treatment strategies. We designed a study to examine regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in AD subtypes. To identify AD subtypes, we performed a cluster analysis including performance on memory, language, visuospatial, praxic, and executive functions. The rCBF measured by 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT was referred to the cerebellum. We examined 35 patients fulfilling the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria of probable AD and 13 age and sex-matched healthy cognitively intact controls. AD patients were at the early stage of the disease, their mean Mini-Mental Status (MMS) score (S.D.) was 22.5 (3.6). The cluster analysis revealed two AD subgroups: AD1 (N = 12) and AD2 (N = 23). The subgroups did not differ in age, sex, or global clinical severity as assessed by MMS and Brief Cognitive Rating Scale (BCRS). Both subgroups had equally impaired memory. The AD2 group was inferior to the AD1 group on verbal, visuospatial, praxic, and executive functions. The AD1 group showed reduced rCBF ratios in the temporal and parietal cortices and the amygdala compared to controls. The AD2 group differed from controls in the rCBF ratios of frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, basal ganglia, and amygdaloid regions bilateral and from AD1 in the rCBF ratios of frontal and temporal cortices. In AD patients, the rCBF ratios did not correlate with MMS or BCRS scores. In contrast, several significant correlations were found between decreases rCBF ratios and impairment of memory and other cognitive functions. In conclusion, a cluster analysis on neuropsychological test performance identified two AD subgroups that differed on the neuropsychological profile and on the rCBF in spite of similar global clinical severity.
