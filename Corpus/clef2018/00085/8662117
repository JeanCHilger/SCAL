A simple method for the quantification of benzodiazepine receptors using iodine-123 iomazenil and single-photon emission tomography. Iodine-123 iomazenil (Iomazenil) is a ligand for central type benzodiazepine receptors that is suitable for single-photon emission tomography (SPET). The purpose of this study was to develop a simple method for the quantification of its binding potential (BP). The method is based on a two-compartment model (K1, influx rate constant k2', efflux rate constant
