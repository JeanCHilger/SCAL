The motility of the biliary tract studied with 99mTc-Br-IDA in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus. Autonomic neuropathy in diabetes mellitus can cause alterations of the motor function of various segments of the gastroenteric apparatus. With hepatocholangio-cholecystiscintigraphy-HIDA we have studied the motility of the biliary system in patients with diabetes mellitus type II. The research has been carried out in 29 patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy 12 healthy volunteers have been studied to compare the results obtained. The results showed a delay in the appearance of radionucleotide in the small intestine of diabetic subjects compared to controls with statistical significance. Moreover the diabetic subjects with a serious neuropathic injury showed increased intestinal transit time. These results match those obtained by other authors that have studied the cholecystic emptying in diabetic subjects with other methods. Consequently the biliary system is also affected by the diabetic autonomic neuropathy that can be in its turn the cause of other pathologies such as biliary lithiasis.
