Large-scale purification and characterization of recombinant fibroblast growth factor-saporin mitotoxin. In order to produce sufficient quantities of fibroblast growth factor-saporin (rFGF-2-SAP) mitotoxin for preclinical evaluation in models of diseases such as cancer and restenosis, we have undertaken the large-scale expression, purification, and characterization of the recombinant molecule. The fusion gene encoding rFGF-2-SAP was cloned into the inducible pET 11a expression vector and transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The transformants were grown using a fed-batch fermentation until the A600 reached 85. At this stage, induction of the expression of the fusion protein led to the production of approximately 2.2 mg/liter per A600 unit. The soluble mitotoxin was purified to homogeneity from cell lysates via expanded bed adsorption chromatography followed by cation-exchange, heparin-affinity, and size-exclusion chromatography. Purified rFGF-2-SAP contained less than 0.5 EU/mg of endotoxin, as determined by gel clot analyses. The highly purified rFGF-2-SAP retained the toxin's ability to inhibit protein synthesis as measured in a cell-free system and was cytotoxic to a number of normal and neoplastic cell lines bearing FGF receptors. Binding studies establish that the fusion protein exerts its effects via the FGF high-affinity receptor.
