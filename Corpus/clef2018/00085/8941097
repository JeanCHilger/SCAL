Prognostic value of exercise 201Tl tomography in patients treated with thrombolytic therapy during acute myocardial infarction. Although myocardial perfusion scintigraphy is of proven value in the risk stratification of patients with a recent myocardial infarction who receive conventional therapy, its value in patients undergoing thrombolytic therapy remains controversial.Seventy-one patients who received thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction had exercise 201Tl tomography and coronary angiography before hospital discharge. Eleven (15%) of 71 patients had ischemic ST-segment depression during exercise, whereas 27 patients (38%) had scintigraphic ischemia. Twenty-five (37%) of 68 patients had a cardiac event consisting of either death (n = 2), recurrent myocardial infarction (n = 5), congestive heart failure (n = 7), or unstable angina (n = 11) during a follow-up of 26 +/- 18 months. Univariate predictors of cardiac events were as follows: Killip class (P = .04) left ventricular ejection fraction (P < .0005)Quantitative exercise 201Tl tomography provides important incremental, long-term prognostic information in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction.
