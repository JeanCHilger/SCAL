Positron emission tomography study of the alterations in brain distribution of [11C]methamphetamine in methamphetamine-sensitized dog. We newly prepared a MAP-sensitized dog by repeated MAP treatment and studied the brain distribution of [11C]MAP in the normal and the MAP-sensitized dog using PET. The maximal level of accumulation of [11C]MAP in the sensitized dog brain was 1.4 times higher than that in the control. No difference was found in the metabolism of MAP between the two conditions. The significant increase of [11C]MAP in the MAP-sensitized brain indicates that subchronic MAP administration causes some functional change in the uptake site of MAP. The pharmacokinetic change may, in part, account for behavioral sensitization.
