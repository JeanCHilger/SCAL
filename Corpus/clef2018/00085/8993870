Radioimmunoscintigraphy with Tc-99m labeled monoclonal antibody 170H.82 in suspected primary, recurrent, or metastatic breast cancer. Radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) with Tc-99m labeled 170H.82, an intact murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) was performed in 27 patients with suspected primary, recurrent, or metastatic breast cancer. For radioimmunoimaging the authors used a double-headed, high-resolution gamma camera. The lesions detected by RIS were evaluated by histopathology, and for metastatic disease by CT, MRI, and bone scan. If the evaluation was made lesion by lesion, RIS with Tc-99m MAb 170H.82 showed 23 true-positive results, 3 false-negative results, 9 true-negative results, 3 false-positive results for primary and recurrent disease sensitivity was 88% and specificity was 75%. In patients with distant metastases, detection rate was 67% (12 true-positive results and 6 false-negative results). All patients had normal baseline values for human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) and 6 weeks after RIS with 2 mg MAb, only 2 of 23 patients had developed a HAMA response (9%). No adverse effects were observed. The authors' clinical experience shows that RIS with MAb 170H.82 is a valuable additional method for detecting breast cancer, especially in patients with uncertain primaries or scar tissue after breast conserving treatment in which differential diagnosis is very difficult.
