Usefulness of Ga-67 brain SPECT in patients with CNS malignant lymphoma. The efficacy of Ga-67 SPECT imaging of CNS malignant lymphoma was investigated in 14 studies of 11 patients. As compared with planar images, the SPECT imaging improved the detectability of the focus of CNS malignant lymphoma. All untreated cases showed L/N ratios higher than 3.0. And the L/N ratios also changed according to remission or relapse of CNS malignant lymphoma.
