In the last few years the has been an enormous development in noninvasive testing in the field of clinical cardiology. In fact, excellent monographs on each one of these techniques have been published elsewhere, but fewer publications exist that treat the topic of their indications and use in an integrated way, except for in the most common clinical situations. In this paper, the treatment of patients who present chest pain, stable and unstable angina is discussed, including the study of postinfarction patients.
