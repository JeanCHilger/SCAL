Determination of unchanged [18F]dopamine in human and non-human primate plasma during positron emission tomography studies: a new solid-phase extraction method comparable to radio-thin-layer chromatography analysis. Routine determination of [18F]DOPA and its metabolites in plasma is essential for assessment and quantification of presynaptic dopamine function in vivo using a modeling approach with positron emission tomography (PET). The determination of unchanged [18F]DOPA from human and non-human primate plasma using solid-phase extraction (SPE) with Sep-Pak cartridges during PET dopaminergic studies is described here. The results from the studies showed that this new approach in comparsion to a method such as thin-layer chromatography (TLC) possessed a simplicity, rapidity and accuracy as well as good correlation between the two techniques (p<0.0001). A proposed procedure involving radioanalysis on alumina plates (Al2O3) was also developed with an excellent correlation compared to the conventional C18 plates (r=0.96). Thus it could be concluded that the SPE on either C18 or alumina cartridges (Waters) compared to radio-TLC analysis on C18 and alumina systems, appears to be a useful analytical method suitable for correcting the input arterial function in routine clinical PET neurotransmission studies.
