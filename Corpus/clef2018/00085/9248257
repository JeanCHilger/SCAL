Development of a high resolution beta camera. We have developed and tested a high resolution beta camera. The beta camera consists of thin CaF2(Eu) scintillator, tapered fiber optics plate, position sensitive photomultiplier tube (PSPMT). The output of the PSPMT is fed to position calculation circuit and accumulated in the memory. The data in the memory is fed to personal computer for display and analysis. We have developed two types of beta cameras. One is 20 mm diameter field of view (FOV) camera, and the other is 10 mm diameter camera. Intrinsic spatial resolutions were 0.8 mm FWHM and 0.5 mm FWHM for 20 mm and 10 mm FOV camera, respectively. We confirmed that developed beta cameras may overcome the limitation of the resolution of the PET camera.
