Positron emission tomography-based boron neutron capture therapy using boronophenylalanine for high-grade gliomas: part I. Determination of tumor boron-10 (10B) levels is required for accurate neutron dosimetry during boron neutron capture therapy. We assessed a new method for quantitative measurement of boronated drug uptake in high-grade gliomas. This method uses positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18-labeled L-fluoroborono-phenylalanine (L-18F-10B-FBPA), which was synthesized as an analogue of L-boronophenylalanine. We studied the accumulation of L-18F-10B-FBPA by PET in patients with high-grade gliomas. Dynamic PET studies of brain tumors revealed that L-18F-10B-FBPA accumulated gradually after bolus injection, and the value of PET activity divided by the integrated plasma activity reached a constant level 42 min after injection, which was defined as the incorporation constant (Ic*). This constant reflected the appropriate L-18F-10B-FBPA accumulation in tumor tissue. Based on the Ic* constant, the methods for estimating tumor 10B concentration were devised. With this method, the estimated values of 10B concentration in gliomas were very close to the 10B levels in surgical specimens. This method was based solely on PET and can potentially provide data that would assist in the selection of patients for future treatment with boron neutron capture therapy after surgical resection of their brain tumors.
