Positron emission tomography-based boron neutron capture therapy using boronophenylalanine for high-grade gliomas: part II. Based on pharmacokinetic findings of fluorine-18-labeled L-fluoroboronophenylalanine by positron emission tomography (PET), methods for estimating tumor 10B concentration were devised. In clinical practice of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for high-grade gliomas, a large amount of L-boronophenylalanine (L-10B-BPA)-fructose solution is used. Under these conditions, a slow i.v. infusion of L-10B-BPA-fructose solution should be performed for BNCT therefore, the changes over time in 10B concentration in the target tissue were estimated by convoluting the actual time course of changes in plasma 10B concentration with a PET-based weight function including the proper rate constants [K1 (ml/g/min), k2 (min(-1)), k3 (min(-1)), and k4 (min(-1))]. With this method, the estimated values of 10B concentration in gliomas were very close to the 10B levels in surgical specimens. This demonstrated the similarity in pharmacokinetics between fluorine-18-labeled L-fluoroboronophenylalanine and L-10B-BPA. This method, using the appropriate rate constant, permits the determination of tumor 10B concentration and is widely suitable for clinical BNCT, because the averaged PET data are enough to use in future patients without individual PET study.
