PET study of human voluntary saccadic eye movements in darkness: effect of task repetition on the activation pattern. Using H2(15)O 3D Positron Emission Tomography (PET), regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in six human subjects under two different conditions: at rest and while performing self-paced horizontal saccadic eye movements in darkness. These two conditions were repeated four times each. First, the comparison between the four saccadic and four resting conditions was investigated in a group and a single subject analysis. Saccades elicited bilateral rCBF increases in the medial part of the superior frontal gyrus (supplementary eye field), precentral gyrus (frontal eye field), superior parietal lobule, anterior medial part of the occipital lobe involving striate and extrastriate cortex (lingual gyrus and cuneus), and in the right inferior parietal lobule. At the subcortical level, activations were found in the left putamen. These results mainly replicate previous PET findings on saccadic control. Second, the interaction between the experimental conditions and their repetition was examined. When activations throughout repetition of the same saccadic task are compared, the supplementary eye fields show a progressive increase of activation. On the contrary, the activation in the cerebellum, left superior parietal lobule and left occipital cortex progressively decreases during the scanning session. Given the existence of such an interaction, the pattern of activations must be interpreted as a function of task repetition. This may be a factor explaining some apparent mismatch between different studies.
