Prognosis of "clandestine" myocardial ischemia, silent myocardial ischemia, and angina pectoris in medically treated patients. The aim of this study was to assess the prognosis of medically treated patients with "clandestine" myocardial ischemia (perfusion defect without angina and no ST depression > 1 mm during exercise test) compared to those with silent myocardial ischemia (ST-segment depression > 1 mm, without angina) and those with angina pectoris. One hundred twelve patients without previous myocardial infarction were included. All patients underwent a symptom-limited exercise test on a bicycle ergometer, myocardial perfusion technetium-99m-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and coronary angiography. They were classified into 3 groups (angina group, 34 patients silent group, 20 patients
