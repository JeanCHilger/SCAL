Sedation and anesthesia of pet rabbits. Pet rabbits frequently become stressed when handled and may require sedation or chemical immobilization for procedures such as blood collection, IV catheter placement, radiography, deep ear cleaning, and dentistry. Common surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia include spay, castration, gastrotomy, cystotomy, and orthopedic procedures. Rabbits may be difficult to safely sedate or anesthetize. Individual rabbits may have varying sensitivity to the depressant effects of anesthetics. The apparent sensitivity of the rabbit's respiratory center to anesthetic drugs and the narrow range between anesthetic and toxic doses in this species add to the unpredictable character of rabbit anesthesia. Furthermore, mortality following anesthesia and surgery in sick rabbits is common. Strategically, safe anesthesia of rabbits must include the planning of procedures so that anesthetic time is minimized. Clinicians must be on guard for individual variation in response to drugs. Minimizing the use of cardiovascular depressant agents, use of agents with a high therapeutic index, and careful titration of doses to effect, along with thorough cardiorespiratory monitoring, will permit attainment of appropriate anesthetic depth with the widest margin of safety. This article presents several injectable and inhalant anesthetic protocols that may assist in effective management of many types of rabbit patient.
