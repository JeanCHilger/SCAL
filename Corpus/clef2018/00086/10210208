Thallium-gated SPECT in patients with major myocardial infarction: effect of filtering and zooming in comparison with equilibrium radionuclide imaging and left ventriculography. The effect of filtering and zooming on 201TI-gated SPECT was evaluated in patients with major myocardial infarction.Rest thallium (TI)-gated SPECT was performed with a 90 degrees dual-head camera, 4 h after injection of 185 MBq 201TI in 32 patients (mean age 61 +/- 11 y) with large myocardial infarction (33% +/- 17% defect on bull's eye). End diastolic volume (EDV), end systolic volume (ESV) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were calculated using a commercially available semiautomatic validated software. First, images were reconstructed using a 2.5 zoom, a Butterworth filter (order = 5) and six Nyquist cutoff frequencies: 0.13 (B5.13), 0.15 (B5.15), 0.20 (B5.20), 0.25 (B5.25), 0.30 (B5.30) and 0.35 (B5.35). Second, images were reconstructed using a zoom of 1 and a Butterworth filter (order = 5) (cutoff frequency 0.20 [B5.20Z1]) (total = 32 x 7 = 224 reconstructions). LVEF was calculated in all patients using equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography (ERNA). EDV, ESV and LVEF were measured with contrast left ventriculography (LVG).LVEF was 39% +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM) for ERNA and 40% +/- 13% for LVG (P = 0.51). Gated SPECT with B5.20Z2.5 simultaneously offered a mean LVEF value (39% +/- 2%) similar to ERNA (39% +/- 2%) and LVG (40% +/- 3%), optimal correlations with both ERNA (r = 0.83) and LVG (r = 0.70) and minimal differences with both ERNA (-0.9% +/- 7.5% [mean +/- SD]) and LVG (1.1% +/- 10.5%). As a function of filter and zoom choice, correlation coefficients between ERNA or LVG LVEF, and gated SPECT ranged from 0.26 to 0.88 and correlation coefficients between LVG and gated SPECT volumes ranged from 0.87 to 0.94. There was a significant effect of filtering and zooming on EDV, ESV and LVEF (P < 0.0001). Low cutoff frequency (B5.13) overestimated LVEF (P < 0.0001 versus ERNA and LVG). Gated SPECT with 2.5 zoom and high cutoff frequencies (B5.15, B5.20, B5.25, B5.30 and B5.35) overestimated EDV and ESV (P < 0.04) compared with LVG. This volume overestimation with TI-gated SPECT in patients with large myocardial infarction was correlated to the infarct size. A zoom of 1 underestimated EDV, ESV and LVEF compared with a 2.5 zoom (P < 0.02).Accurate LVEF measurement is possible with TI-gated SPECT in patients with major myocardial infarction. However, filtering and zooming greatly influence EDV, ESV and LVEF measurements, and TI-gated SPECT overestimates left ventricular volumes, particularly when the infarct size increases.
