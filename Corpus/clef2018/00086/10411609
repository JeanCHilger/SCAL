Quantitative autoradiography with short-lived positron emission tomography tracers: a study on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors with N-[(11)C]methyl-4-piperidylbenzilate. The present work demonstrates quantitative autoradiography by using positron emission tomography tracers and storage phosphorimaging plates. The uptake and association of [(11)C]N-methyl-4-piperidylbenzilate was measured in rat brain tissue cryosections of various thicknesses. The signal increased with increasing section thickness, but only in 10-micrometer-thick sections did the binding reach the steady state during a 50-min observation time. This violation of the equilibrium condition, potentially combined with perfusion limitations, leads to erroneous increased binding-site density and decreased affinity in the 25- and 50-micrometer-thick sections. For better imaging of receptor distribution it is reasonable to use thicker sections. For quantitative analysis of receptor-binding parameters, the specific properties of ligands at different thicknesses of cryosections need to be considered. Evidence is provided that the nonselective muscarinic antagonist N-methyl-4-piperidylbenzilate binds preferentially to the M(4) subtype of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
