Iterative reconstruction for attenuation correction in positron emission tomography: maximum likelihood for transmission and blank scan. The quality of the attenuation correction strongly influences the outcome of the reconstructed emission scan in positron emission tomography. The calculation of the attenuation correction factors must take into account the Poisson nature of the radioactive decay process, because-for a reasonable scan duration-the transmission measurements contain lines of response with low count numbers in the case of large attenuation factors. Our purpose in this study is to investigate a maximum likelihood estimator for attenuation correction factor calculation in positron emission tomography, which incorporates the Poisson nature of the radioactive decay into transmission and blank measurement. Therefore, the correct maximum likelihood function is used to derive two estimators for the calculation of the attenuation coefficient image and the corresponding attenuation correction factors depending on the measured blank and transmission data. Log likelihood convergence, mean differences, and the mean of squared differences for the attenuation correction factors of a mathematical thorax phantom were determined and compared. The algorithms yield adequate attenuation correction factors, however, the algorithm taking the noise in the blank scan into account can perform better for noisy blank scans. We conclude that maximum likelihood-including blank likelihood-is advantageous to reconstruct attenuation correction factors for low statistic blank and good statistic transmission data. For normal blank and transmission statistics the implementation of the statistical nature of the blank is not mandatory.
