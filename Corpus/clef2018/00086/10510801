Radiation exposure of the patient caused by transmission measurement for myocardial perfusion SPECT. The aim was the determination of the radiation exposure to the patient caused by the transmission measurement for myocardial perfusion SPECT.Beside the emission measurement (Tc-99m-MIBI, A = 500 MBq) the myocardial perfusion SPECT simultaneously includes a transmission measurement using a Am-241-line source (A = 5550 MBq). During a simulation of the myocardial perfusion SPECT (without Tc-99m-MIBI) dose measurements with thermoluminescent dosimeters were carried out using a thorax phantom.For an acquisition time of 20 min the absorbed doses amounted to: surface (xyphoid) 30 microGy, heart 25 microGy, lung 14 microGy, second thoracic vertebra 16 microGy, upper anterior mediastinum 16 microGy, liver 0 microGy. An estimation of the ratio of the effective doses caused by the transmission and the emission measurement of 3.6 x 10(-3) and 4.1 mSv, respectively, resulted in a value of 9 x 10(-4).The radiation exposure of the patient caused by the transmission measurement can be neglected, and is therefore not a limiting factor regarding the general application of transmission measurement for clinical myocardial perfusion SPECT.
