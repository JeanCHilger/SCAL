An exploration of the potential benefits of pet-facilitated therapy. There is mounting evidence to suggest that those who keep pets are likely to benefit from various improvements in health. Despite founders of nursing such as Florence Nightingale advocating the importance of animals within the care environment, their integration into hospitals and other health care settings has been slow. The literature on animal-induced health benefits is reviewed and the conclusion is drawn that the potential benefits of pet therapy are considerable. It is suggested that nurses can assume an active role in advocating ward pet or pet-visiting schemes.
