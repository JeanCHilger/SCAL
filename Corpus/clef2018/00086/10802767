Acute single photon emission computed tomographic study of vagus nerve stimulation in refractory epilepsy. Left-sided vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an efficacious treatment for patients with refractory epilepsy. The precise mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. Only limited data on VNS-induced changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) are available. The aim of this study was to investigate rCBF changes during initial VNS with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).In 12 patients (8 women, 4 men) with mean age of 32 years and mean duration of epilepsy of 19 years, VNS-induced rCBF changes were studied by means of a 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer activation study with a single-day split-dose protocol before and immediately after initial stimulation. Images were acquired on a triple-head camera with fan-beam collimators and were reconstructed with scatter and attenuation correction. After coregistration to a standardized template, both a semiquantitative analysis using predefined volumes-of-interest (VOIs) as well as voxel-by-voxel analysis of the intrasubject activation were performed. During follow-up, efficacy of VNS in terms of seizure-frequency reduction was studied.The semiquantitative analysis, with reference to the total counts in all VOIs, revealed a significant decrease of activity in the left thalamus immediately after the initial stimulation train. These results agreed with voxel-by-voxel analysis. In our study ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion was the most significant finding. Mean frequency of complex partial seizures was reduced from 30 per month before implantation to six per month after implantation.VNS induces rCBF changes immediately after initial stimulation that can be studied with SPECT. VNS-induced changes in the thalamus may play an important role in suppression of seizures. However, no significant relation between the level of hypoperfusion and subsequent clinical efficacy was found.
