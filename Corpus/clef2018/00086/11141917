1959-1999: from serum markers to 18-FDG in oncology. The experience of the Ren√©-Huguenin Center. Blood tumour markers are widely used in the follow up of patients treated for a malignant tumour. In many cases where the tumour associated marker is increasing the clinical and radiological evaluations remain normal. PET and CDET-scan with 18-FDG have been demonstrated as powerful tools in oncology and their use in such situations may give a new appraisal on the development of the disease. Seventy patients with an isolated increasing of a tumour associated marker (CEA or CA19.9, CA15.3, CA125) were tested. Accuracy and sensitivity of the method were 82.8 and 96.5%, specificity 25%, and positive and negative predictive values 50% and 87%. Focusing on breast carcinomas and CA15.3 as well as ovarian cancers and CA125, the sensitivity and the predictive value are reaching 100%. Patients exhibiting a tumor target associated to an increasing in blood tumour marker may be treated earlier with dedicated protocols.
