Functional hepatic volume measured by technetium-99m-galactosyl-human serum albumin liver scintigraphy: comparison between hepatocyte volume and liver volume by computed tomography. We investigated the usefulness of measuring the functional hepatic volume by single-photon emission CT with 99m-technetium galactosyl-human serum albumin scintigraphy (GSA-LV). We then compared this value to the total hepatocyte volume and the hepatic volume determined from CT (CT-LV) in the patients with hepatobiliary tumors.Forty-seven patients were divided into two groups, the SM group (subsegmentectomy and monosegmentectomy) and the DT group (disegmentectomy and trisegmentectomy). These groups were further divided into subgroups with or without chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. The GSA-LV, CT-LV, and the total hepatocyte volume were then calculated. The GSA-LV and CT-LV measurements were performed preoperatively, at 2 and 4 wk, and at 3 and 6 months after surgery.The preoperative GSA-LV values were significantly correlated with the hepatocyte volume and the 15-min retention rate of indocyanine green (ICGR15). Similarly, the hepatocyte volume correlated well with the CT-LV and ICGR15. However, the CT-LV was correlated only with the ICGR15. Recovery of the GSA-LV in the DT group was delayed, and about 90% of the volumetric and functional regeneration was observed within 6 months after the hepatectomy. In contrast, the CT-LV of DT group patients with normal liver remnants returned to approximately 90% of their initial volume within 1 month after the hepatectomy, whereas patients with injured livers regenerated gradually and regained approximately 80% of their preoperative value by 6 months after the hepatectomy.We conclude that the measurement of functional hepatic volume using the GSA-LV is useful in fully evaluating hepatic function based on hepatocyte volume.
