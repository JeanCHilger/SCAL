Total variation norm for three-dimensional iterative reconstruction in limited view angle tomography. An iterative Bayesian reconstruction algorithm for limited view angle tomography, or ectomography, based on the three-dimensional total variation (TV) norm has been developed. The TV norm has been described in the literature as a method for reducing noise in two-dimensional images while preserving edges, without introducing ringing or edge artefacts. It has also been proposed as a 2D regularization function in Bayesian reconstruction, implemented in an expectation maximization algorithm (TV-EM). The TV-EM was developed for 2D single photon emission computed tomography imaging, and the algorithm is capable of smoothing noise while maintaining edges without introducing artefacts. The TV norm was extended from 2D to 3D and incorporated into an ordered subsets expectation maximization algorithm for limited view angle geometry. The algorithm, called TV3D-EM, was evaluated using a modelled point spread function and digital phantoms. Reconstructed images were compared with those reconstructed with the 2D filtered backprojection algorithm currently used in ectomography. Results show a substantial reduction in artefacts related to the limited view angle geometry, and noise levels were also improved. Perhaps most important, depth resolution was improved by at least 45%. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm has been shown to improve the perceived image quality.
