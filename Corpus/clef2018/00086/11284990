A survey of neuroimaging research in European neurological departments. In the international neurological literature, neuroimaging research plays an important role. Neuroimaging techniques are also of steadily increasing importance for clinical diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Therefore, neuroimaging research activities were surveyed by a questionnaire, which was completed by 100 neurological centres across Europe. It showed that most groups use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fMRI, computerized tomography (CT) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). Positron emission tomography (PET) and ultrasound are also employed by nearly half of the centres. Neuroimaging research involves co-operation amongst typically five to 10 disciplines. Cerebrovascular disease, dementia, cognitive disorders, epilepsy, movement disorders, brain tumours and multiple sclerosis are frequently being studied. Many groups rely on small budgets, have few full-time scientists and limited access to expensive resources. There is little exchange of scientists amongst laboratories. It was felt that funding and co-operation needed improvement in order to maintain a high standard in neuroimaging research.
