Alternating two finger tapping with contralateral activation is an objective measure of clinical severity in Parkinson's disease and correlates with PET We explored an objective method of measuring clinical severity of Parkinson's disease. Eighty-six patients with PD and 136 healthy subjects were studied. We serially carried out four types of finger tapping (FT) using a computerized drum machine: (i) repetitive one-finger tapping with an index-finger (F1K1) (ii) one-finger tapping on two keys separated by 20cm (F1K2)
