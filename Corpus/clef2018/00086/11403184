57Co SPECT, 99mTc-ECD SPECT, MRI and neuropsychological testing in senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. Inflammatory mechanisms contribute to the pathophysiology of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (sDAT). Previous studies have shown that 57Co single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is able to visualize inflammatory lesions, probably by means of the final common pathway of Ca2+ homeostasis disturbance in both neuronal degeneration and inflammation. The aims of this study were: (1) to detect 57Co SPECT changes in sDAT patients (2) to correlate these findings with those of conventional neuroimaging techniques and neuropsychological testing (NPT)
