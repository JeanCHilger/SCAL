Resolution recovery for list-mode reconstruction in SPECT. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the resolution recovery in the list-mode iterative reconstruction algorithm (LMIRA) for SPECT. In this study we compare the performance of the proposed method with other iterative resolution recovery methods for different noise levels. We developed an iterative reconstruction method which uses list-mode data instead of binned data. The new algorithm makes use of a more accurate model of the collimator structure. We compared the SPECT list-mode reconstruction with MLEM, OSEM and RBI, all including resolution recovery. For the evaluation we used Gaussian shaped sources with different FWHM at three different locations and three noise levels. For these distributions we calculated the reconstructed images for a different number of iterations. The absolute error for the reconstructed images was used to evaluate the performance. The performance of all four methods is comparable for the sources located in the centre of the field of view. For the sources located out of the centre, the error of the list-mode method is significantly lower than that of the other methods. Splitting the system model into a separate object-dependent and detector-dependent module gives us a flexible reconstruction method. With this we can very easily adapt the resolution recovery to different collimator types.
