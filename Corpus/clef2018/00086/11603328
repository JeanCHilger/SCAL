Assessing the informative value of positron emission tomography with the new radiopharmaceutical Sodium 11C-butyrate versus small-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography in the diagnosis of myocardial viability in patients with coronary heart disease and left ventricular dysfunction. Myocardial viability in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure was assessed by echocardiography with low doses of dobutamine and positron emission tomography with Sodium 11C-butyrate. Sensitivity and specificity of those methods were compared. Positron emission tomography and Sodium 11C-butyrate had quite high sensitivity and specificity, which could be compared with positron emission tomography and fluorine-18-deoxyglucose. Echocardiography with low doses of dobutamine had high specificity and its sensitivity was lower that one of positron emission tomography and Sodium 11C-butyrate. Thus, it is necessary to use the protocol of stress dobutamine echocardiography with high doses to avoid this problem.
