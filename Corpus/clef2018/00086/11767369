Pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytoma is a tumor secreting catecholamines and is most often a sporadic and benign adrenal tumor. But in some cases the tumor is extra-adrenal (10%), malignant (10%) or familial (10%) and in this last case frequently bilateral. The clinical expression of pheochromocytoma is typically hypertension, with paroxysms including headache, excessive sweating, palpitations, but various clinical presentations can be observed. The biological diagnosis is represented by the measurement of urinary catecholamines. The most sensitive and specific test is the measurement of urinary metanephrines or of plasma methoxyamines. The tumor localization is generally easy using CT scan and (or) NMR imaging, associated with MIBG scintigraphy. The treatment is surgical after medical management.
