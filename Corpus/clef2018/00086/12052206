Labelled oligonucleotides as radiopharmaceuticals: pitfalls, problems and perspectives. The labelling of single-stranded oligonucleotides with a positron or single-photon emitter can result in valuable radiopharmaceuticals with promising applications for: (i) Imaging of specific mRNAs, i.e. visualisation of the expression of specific genes in vivo (ii) Monitoring of antisense chemotherapy, i.e. measuring the efficiency of efforts to block the expression of specific genes (iii) Gene radiotherapy, i.e. the targeting of radiation damage to specific DNA sequences in order to destroy tumours
