Sample collection, filtration and preservation protocols for the determination of 'total dissolved' mercury in waters. The objective of the work carried out was to recommend protocols for the collection, filtration (0.45 microm) and preservation of surface water samples for the subsequent determination of total 'dissolved' Hg. Cold vapour (CV) ICP-MS was employed to determine Hg samples were acidified to a strength of 4 mol l(-1) HCl and 1% NaBH4 was used as the reducing agent in-line. Four types of 125 ml bottles were studied (Teflon, fluorinated ethene propene copolymer, FEP
