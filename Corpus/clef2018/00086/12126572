Role of positron emission tomography in detecting recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma. To investigate the efficiency of positron emission tomography (PET) with (fluorine-18)-2-deoxyglucose ((18)FDG) for detecting recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma.Fifteen (18)FDG-PET scanning were performed on 13 patients, who was clinically free of disease after optimal cytoreductive surgery and sufficient chemotherapy, with suspicion of recurrence. Ten second-look or re-debulking operation were given after PET scanning.In all 8 cases with and 1 without elevated serum CA(125), PET demonstrated sites of increased (18)FDG uptake, which correlated well with surgical-pathologic findings (100%). Computed tomography scan and B  ultrasonography each detected 1 recurrence. One of the 6 patients with negative PET scan results underwent a second-look operation, which found no malignancy. The other 5 were closely followed up for 11 to 13 months. No sign of recurrence was noticed within 8 months.   One patient received her second PET scanning after the serum CA(125) began to elevate in the 9th month. Recurrent tumor was found by the second PET scan and confirmed by the operation after that.PET is accurate in detecting the recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma. As a non-invasive method, PET might be a fairly effective tool for monitoring and locating the recurrence of ovarian carcinoma.
