Left ventricular function evaluation after mitral valve replacement with preservation the subvalvular apparatus. The objective of this study was to evaluate the left ventricular function after mitral valve replacement (MVR) with preservation of all chordae. Fourteen patients with a diagnosis of mitral regurgitation were studied. These patients, 4 males and 10 females, age from 24 to 59 years, who underwent mitral valve replacement, in which all chordae tendineae were preserved. The mean follow-up interval was 6 months. Preoperation and postoperation multigated equilibrium radionuclide angiography was performed by Elscint Helix Apex SPECT. Each patient was injected with 740MBq 99mTc-HSA, rest ejection fraction (global EF) of LV (%), regional ejection fraction (EF) of LV (%), PER/S and PFR/S were measured. Regional EF was calculated by the method of dividing the left ventricle into five segments by radial axis. The results showed that the postoperative EF of the whole left ventricle of the chordae-preserved patients was significantly greater than their preoperative EF (40.0% +/- 17.8%, to 51.6% +/- 18.2%, P < 0.02), and also the regional EF at the lateral wall of the chordae-preserved MVR was significantly greater than the preoperative regional EF (an increase from 51.0% +/- 18.1% to 69.7% +/- 21.2%, P < 0.01). MVR with preservation of all chordae, the patient's left ventricular function remarkably improved.
