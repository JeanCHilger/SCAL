PET study of the effects of valproate on dopamine D(2) receptors in neuroleptic- and mood-stabilizer-naive patients with nonpsychotic mania. A previous study reported a higher than normal density of dopamine D(2) receptors in psychotic mania but not in nonpsychotic mania. The purpose of this study was to further examine D(2) receptor density in a larger sample of nonpsychotic manic patients by using positron emission tomography (PET) and [(11)C]raclopride.Thirteen neuroleptic- and mood- stabilizer-naive patients with DSM-IV mania without psychotic features and 14 healthy comparison subjects underwent [(11)C]raclopride PET scans. Of the 13 patients, 10 were treated with divalproex sodium monotherapy. PET scans were repeated 2-6 weeks after commencement of divalproex sodium. D(2) receptor binding potential was calculated by using a ratio method with the cerebellum as the reference region.The [(11)C]raclopride D(2) binding potential was not significantly different in manic patients than in the comparison subjects in the striatum. Treatment with divalproex sodium had no significant effect on the [(11)C]raclopride D(2) binding potential in manic patients. There was no correlation between the D(2) binding potential and manic symptoms before or after treatment.These results suggest that D(2) receptor density is not altered in nonpsychotic mania and that divalproex sodium treatment does not affect D(2) receptor availability.
