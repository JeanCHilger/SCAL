Selective middle cerebral artery Wada tests as a part of presurgical evaluation in patients with drug-resistant epilepsies. To analyze the role of selective middle cerebral artery (MCA) Wada tests in the presurgical workup of patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsies.Twenty MCA Wada test procedures were performed to identify eloquent cortex (a) in nine patients with hemispheric lesions involving the motor cortex (connatal MCA infarct, n = 5 unilateral cortical dysplasia, n = 3Co-registered single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIn = 18) showed that sodium amobarbital did not reach the target area in three procedures. Temporary neurologic deficits occurred in 12 procedures. Eleven patients were operated on with the following surgical approaches: functional hemispherectomy, n = 3Selective MCA Wada tests can contribute to risk assessment concerning postsurgical motor deficits before functional hemispherectomy. Other indications are less clear: The identification of language areas is targeted primarily by electrical-stimulation mapping after subdural grid implantations, and selective MCA Wada tests in ESES patients yet have to be validated in larger patient groups.
