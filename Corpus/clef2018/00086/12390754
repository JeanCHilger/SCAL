Investigation of short-term therapy results for radiofrequency ablation by positron emission tomography. To explore the possibility of evaluating the short-term therapeulic effect of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in cancer treatment by positron emission tomography.The radioactivity intensity of the tumor was detected by PET before and after RFA.Radioactivity blank was observed in all 33 cases with 54 lesions, indicating the elimination of the tumor was destroyed.PET is of great significance in evaluating the short-term effect of RFA.
