Radionuclide diagnosis of right ventricular myocardial infarction. The diagnostic capacities of 99mTc-pyrophosphate plane myocardial scintigraphy versus 99mTc-pyrophosphate single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were compared. Recording right precordial ECG leads showed that 26 patients had right ventricular myocardial infarction (MI)-typical changes as ST-segment evaluation, followed by abnormal Q wave. Plane scintigraphy indicated a characteristic inclusion of 99mTc-pyrophosphate into the right ventricular myocardium in 18.8% of the patients with acute lower MI and in one of 38 patients with acute MI of the anterior left ventricular wall. SPECT revealed a characteristic inclusion of 99mTc-pyrophosphate into the right ventricular myocardium much more frequently than did plane myocardial scintigraphy--in 34% of cases. Right ventricular myocardial inclusion of 99mTc-pyrophosphate was found in 50% of the patients with acute lower MI, including all 9 patients with positive 99mTc-pyrophosphate myocardial scintigraphy. Thus, the sensitivity of SPECT in the diagnosis of right ventricular MI is somewhat higher than that of precordial ECG and more than thrice higher than that of plane scintigraphy.
