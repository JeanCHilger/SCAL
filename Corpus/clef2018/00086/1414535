HM-PAO spect in head trauma. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) after intravenous administration of Technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene-amine oxime (Tc-99m HM-PAO) makes possible the evaluation of cerebral perfusion. We have been assessing the diagnostic accuracy of SPECT in some groups of head trauma patients: the preliminary results of this study are presented. Fourteen patients have been selected, all of them showing some kind of focal neurological deficit the Computed Tomography (CT) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) were normal, or showed lesions that could not be responsible for the neurological deficits. In all of the patients Tc-99m HM-PAO SPECT has been performed, showing changes in cerebral perfusion in areas correlated with the abnormalities elicited on clinical examination. These results show that Tc-99m HM-PAO SPECT is a better technique than CT or NMR in demonstrating the organic basis of some neurological deficits observed after head trauma.
