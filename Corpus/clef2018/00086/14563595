Acute beta-blockade reduces the extent and severity of myocardial perfusion defects with dipyridamole Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT imaging. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of acute beta-blockade on dipyridamole Tc-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging (DMPI).Studies suggest that antianginal drugs may reduce the presence and severity of myocardial perfusion defects with dipyridamole stress. However, there are no data regarding specific drugs.Patients with catheterization-proven coronary artery disease (CAD) were enrolled in this prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study and randomly assigned to DMPI after placebo, low-dose metoprolol (up to 10 mg), and high-dose metoprolol (up to 20 mg). Patients underwent one Tc-99m sestamibi study at rest on a separate day. The interval between DMPI studies was <or=14 days. Images were interpreted by three observers blinded to clinical data using a 17-segment, five-point model. For each image, a summed stress score (SSS), summed rest score (SRS), and summed difference score (SDS) were calculated (SDS = SSS - SRS). Images with an SSS <4 were considered normal.Twenty-one patients completed all four Tc-99m sestamibi studies. The sensitivity of DMPI for detection of CAD was 85.7% with placebo versus 71.4% with low- and high-dose metoprolol. In comparison with placebo, the SSS was significantly lower (p < 0.05) with low- and high-dose metoprolol (12.0 +/- 10.1 vs. 8.7 +/- 9.0 and 9.3 +/- 10.6, respectively). The SDS also was significantly lower (8.4 +/- 8.8 with placebo vs. 5.0 +/- 6.7 [p < 0.001] and 5.4 +/- 7.9 [p < 0.01] with low- and high-dose metoprolol, respectively).The presence and severity of CAD may be underestimated in patients receiving beta-blocker therapy undergoing dipyridamole stress myocardial perfusion imaging.
