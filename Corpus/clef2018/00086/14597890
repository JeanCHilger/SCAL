Stress echocardiography versus myocardial SPECT for risk stratification of patients with coronary artery disease. Diagnostic testing using noninvasive imaging has become an integral part of risk stratification in patients with coronary artery disease. It is important to understand the integral strengths and weaknesses between the different modalities of stress testing and to apply accurately the type of test the clinical scenario demands.There have been tremendous advances made in the field of cardiac imaging. Both myocardial perfusion imaging and stress echocardiographic techniques continue to evolve and play an important role in the assessment of patients with coronary artery disease.In this review the authors discuss the relative merits of both stress echocardiography and myocardial single photon emission computed tomographic imaging for diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with coronary artery disease.
