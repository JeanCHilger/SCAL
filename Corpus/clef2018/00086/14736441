Myocardial positron emission computed tomographic images obtained with fluorine-18 fluoro-2-deoxyglucose predict the response of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients to beta-blockers. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether the response of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients to beta-blockers can be predicted by positron emission tomography with fluorine-18 fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG-PET).Patients with DCM often have a poor prognosis, and it is important to predict their response to beta-blocker therapy, which may be effective in DCM. However, no accurate methods of predicting their response have been available.In 22 DCM patients with reduced left ventricular (LV) systolic function, FDG-PET was performed. Uptake in the LV after glucose loading was evaluated based on the average global percent uptake of the injected dose (G%ID) and the coefficient of variance (CV) in 24 segments of the LV. Uptake during fasting was evaluated semiquantitatively on the basis of the total uptake score. The beta-blocker was administered, and LV function was monitored by echocardiography. The histologic findings were assessed in the 18 patients who underwent endomyocardial biopsy.The beta-blocker was effective in the majority of patients whose G%ID after glucose loading was >0.7%, and the sensitivity and specificity of G%ID as a predictor of beta-blocker efficacy were 83.3% and 90.0%, respectively. Percent CV did not predict efficacy. Four groups, defined on the basis of the FDG uptake score during fasting and G%ID after glucose loading, had distinctive histologic findings and outcomes.It has been shown that FDG-PET is a good predictor for the effectiveness of beta-blockers.
