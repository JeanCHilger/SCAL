Prediction of tissue survival after stroke based on changes in the apparent diffusion of water (cytotoxic edema). This study tested the hypothesis that the estimate of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC an index of cytotoxic edema) of water is a reliable pathophysiological index of the viability of ischemic brain tissue. CBF, the partition volume of water (PVW
