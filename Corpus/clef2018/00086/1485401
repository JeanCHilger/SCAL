Ethical issues in the ownership of companion animals: an empirical and normative analysis. This article deals with the ethical aspects of companion animal ownership. Research was done by means of interviews (n = 40) and questionnaires (n = 871). Respondents were randomly chosen from Dutch telephone directories. Euthanasia, docking tails, ear clipping and sterilisation are discussed on the basis of the opinions of respondents. Owners of companion animals very often seem to have insufficient knowledge about animal behaviour. Companion animal owners as a group differ rather strongly in their moral opinions about the acceptability of certain actions towards animals. At the individual level also people are not always consequent in their reasoning as was illustrated by their opinions about ear clipping and the stopping of tail docking and vice versa. Respondents live in a community with animals and usually use a utilitarian balancing model. The different outcomes of the uses of this balancing model indicate how far the respondents are willing to adapt their life style to the needs of an animal in other words to what extent intrinsic values and integrity are taken into account within the process of (re)creating a living community.
