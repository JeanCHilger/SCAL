Relating neuronal dynamics for auditory object processing to neuroimaging activity: a computational modeling and an fMRI study. We investigated the neural basis of auditory object processing in the cerebral cortex by combining neural modeling and functional neuroimaging. We developed a large-scale, neurobiologically realistic network model of auditory pattern recognition that relates the neuronal dynamics of cortical auditory processing of frequency modulated (FM) sweeps to functional neuroimaging data of the type obtained using PET and fMRI. Areas included in the model extend from primary auditory to prefrontal cortex. The electrical activities of the neuronal units of the model were constrained to agree with data from the neurophysiological literature regarding the perception of FM sweeps. We also conducted an fMRI experiment using stimuli and tasks similar to those used in our simulations. The integrated synaptic activity of the neuronal units in each region of the model, convolved with a hemodynamic response function, was used as a correlate of the simulated fMRI activity, and generally agreed with the experimentally observed fMRI data in the brain areas corresponding to the regions of the model. Our results demonstrate that the model is capable of exhibiting the salient features of both electrophysiological neuronal activities and fMRI values that are in agreement with empirically observed data. These findings provide support for our hypotheses concerning how auditory objects are processed by primate neocortex.
