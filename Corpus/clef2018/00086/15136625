Differential diagnosis between Alzheimer's and frontotemporal disease by the posterior cingulate sign. This was a study to evaluate the posterior cingulate sign in differential diagnosis between Alzheimer's and frontotemporal disease. The impending availability of effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease makes this differential diagnosis important.Images of 20 patients with clinically confirmed or autopsy-proven (10 patients) Alzheimer's disease and 20 patients with clinically confirmed or autopsy-proven (7 patients) frontotemporal disease were compared with the consolidated images of 20 elderly healthy control subjects. The (99m)Tc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime SPECT data on brain blood flow from each patient were compared with the consolidated control image using statistical parametric mapping.Sixteen of 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease showed the posterior cingulate sign in the form of significant blood flow reductions 1 of 20 patients with frontotemporal disease showed the posterior cingulate sign. That patient's illness has evolved into Alzheimer's disease. The remaining 19 patients were negative for the posterior cingulate sign.When present, the posterior cingulate sign indicates the presence of Alzheimer's disease it is apparently absent in frontotemporal disease, thus serving as a differential diagnostic sign. It was absent in 3 patients with proven tangle-predominant Alzheimer's disease.
