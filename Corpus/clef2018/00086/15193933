Cardiac imaging using nuclear medicine and positron emission tomography. This article concentrates on specific issues that are of current interest in mainstream nuclear cardiology. These include developments in myocardial perfusion technique, the potential diagnostic benefits of ECG-gating and attenuation correction, nuclear imaging in the diagnosis of hibernating myocardium, and the cost-effectiveness of perfusion imaging in patients with suspected angina.
