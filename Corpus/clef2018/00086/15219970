Seroprevalence of and risk factors for Bartonella henselae and Bartonella quintana infections among pet cats in Jordan. To determine the seroprevalences of Bartonella henselae and Bartonella quintana antibodies in Jordanian pet cats, serum samples from 153 cats from three geographical regions were analyzed. Seroprevalences were determined by indirect immunofluorescence. The true seroprevalences to B. henselae and B. quintana were 32 and 1.5%, respectively. The seroprevalence of B. henselae-specific antibodies in cats from northern Jordan was significantly higher than in cats from the central or southern parts of Jordan. The seroprevalence to B. henselae increased to age 2 years. Odds of seropositivity were higher in cats living outdoors, showing hunting behavior, having a flea infestation and of a mixed breed. No association was detected with sex.
