The role of PET imaging in lymphoma. Positron emission tomography using fluorine-18 (FDG-PET) is increasingly used in the staging and follow-up of malignant lymphomas, although its precise role has not yet been determined. This review considers the results reported at the different stages in the disease history and separately considers the major histological subtypes. Attention is given to the situations in which PET scanning is most likely to influence management. Finally, this review discusses ongoing developments in PET scanning with improved resolution and different radiolabelled tracers.
