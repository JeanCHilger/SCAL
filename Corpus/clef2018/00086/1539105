The relationship of SPECT scans to behavioral dysfunction in neuropsychiatric patients. The authors describe 20 neuropsychiatric inpatients consecutively evaluated in the context of routine clinical care. Patients had both a neurological and psychiatric disorder. Each was clinically evaluated as part of a psychiatric hospitalization. DSM-III-R diagnoses, electroencephalograms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans of the brain, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans of the brain, and cognitive testing are reported. In only three cases were SPECT, MRI (or CT), and electroencephalogram all normal. SPECT abnormalities were associated with behavioral and cognitive presentations and with the hypothesized anatomical areas of dysfunction in 16 cases. In six cases SPECT and MRI were equivalent, involving structural lesions or normal scans. In only one case did MRI (or CT) detect deficits not revealed by SPECT, which were nonspecific white matter lesions and atrophy. The authors conclude that SPECT scans may be superior to structural brain scans in detecting clinically relevant deficits in neuropsychiatric patients, particularly when physiological lesions are involved.
