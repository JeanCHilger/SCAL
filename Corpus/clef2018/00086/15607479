Quantitative analysis of adenosine A1 receptors in human brain using positron emission tomography and [1-methyl-11C]8-dicyclopropylmethyl-1-methyl-3-propylxanthine. Fully quantitative analysis of the adenosine A(1) receptor (A1R) in the brain with (11)C-MPDX and positron emission tomography is reported. The kinetics is described using a two-tissue three-compartment model, and estimated binding potentials correspond well with the estimates made by Logan plot. The image of the binding potential of the MPDX is physiologically reasonable. We conclude that MPDX is applicable to the visualization of the A1Rs in the brain with Logan plot.
