Cerebral blood flow reactivity to hyperventilation in children with spontaneous occlusion of the circle of willis (moyamoya disease). To elucidate the relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) after hyperventilation (HV) and the rebuild-up phenomenon on the encephaloelectrogram (EEG) in children with moyamoya disease, comparative study of CBF immediately after HV and CBF after administration of acetazolamide (Diamox) was examined. CBF was measured by means of single photon emission CT (SPECT) using the 133Xe inhalation method. The subjects were 11 children (21 hemispheres) with moyamoya disease who were divided into two groups as follows, 1) Bypass group who underwent STA-MCA anastomosis with other synangiosis. 2) Non-Bypass group
