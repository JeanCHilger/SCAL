The value of [18F]FDG-PET in the diagnosis of large-vessel vasculitis and the assessment of activity and extent of disease. This study was performed to investigate the value of( 18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([(18)F]FDG-PET) in the diagnosis of large-vessel vasculitis and the assessment of activity and extent of disease.Twenty-six consecutive patients (21 females, 5 males median age - years, range 17-86 years) with giant cell arteritis or Takayasu's arteritis were examined with [(18)F]FDG-PET. Follow-up scans were performed in four patients. Twenty-six age- and gender-matched controls (21 females, 5 males[(18)F]FDG-PET revealed pathological findings in 18 of 26 patients. Three scans were categorised as grade I, 12 as grade II and 3 as grade III arteritis. Visual grade was significantly correlated with both CRP and ESR levels (p=0.002 and 0.007 respectively grade I: CRP 4.0 mg/l, ESR 6 mm/h[(18)F]FDG-PET is highly effective in assessing the activity and the extent of large-vessel vasculitis. Visual grading was validated as representing the severity of inflammation. Its use is simple and provides high specificity, while high sensitivity is achieved by scanning in the state of active inflammation.
