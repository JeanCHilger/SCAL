Acetazolamide enhanced single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) evaluation of cerebral perfusion before and after carotid endarterectomy. Twenty-five patients were tested before and after carotid endarterectomy with resting and acetazolamide enhanced single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans with hexamethyl propyleneamine oxine (HMPAO) or iofetamine hydrochloride I123 (123I labeled IMP), both widely available radiopharmaceuticals. Twenty preoperative SPECT studies were asymmetric, revealing focal or diffuse decreased perfusion reserve, and 13 also demonstrated infarcts. Five patients had symmetric (normal) studies. After carotid endarterectomy, 22 cases had changed flow distribution patterns. Usually improvement of reactivity ipsilateral occurred to the area operated on. In four, contralateral improvement was also found. Three of the patients who had preoperative symmetrical scans had increased ipsilateral reactivity after surgery indicating previous global loss of reactivity. Acetazolamide SPECT scans demonstrate a decreased perfusion reserve in 20 patients with carotid artery stenosis, indicating reduced perfusion and poor collateral circulation. Postoperative studies confirm improvement by demonstrating recovery of vascular reactivity in 84% of the patients. Acetazolamide enhanced SPECT scans may be helpful in providing objective evidence for selection of patients for carotid endarterectomy, especially in those who have an 80% carotid artery stenosis, but are asymptomatic.
