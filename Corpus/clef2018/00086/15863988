Dual modality of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography in patients with cervical carcinoma of unknown primary. To evaluate an optimized F-18-flurodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) acquisition protocol for head and neck cancer and assess the usefulness of combined FDG-PET/CT in locating unknown primary tumors in patients with biopsy-proven cervical lymph node metastases.Twenty-one patients with cervical lymph node metastases of unknown primary tumors underwent staging with FDG-PET/CT. The images of FDG-PET alone, CT alone, FDG-PET/CT read side by side and fused and FDG-PET/CT were evaluated separately by 2 physicians. Imaging results were correlated with either histology (n = 14) or clinical follow-up (n = 7).On the fused FDG-PET/CT images, primary tumors were identified in 12 patients (57%) with FDG-PET alone and FDG-PET and CT read side by side 11 (52%) primary tumors were found while CT alone identified 5 (23%) primary tumors.Our data indicate that fused FDG-PET and CT images increased the sensitivity of detecting carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) tumors compared to CT alone, but not to FDG-PET alone or FDG-PET and CT read side by side. Hence accurate fusion of functional and morphologic data by FDG-PET/CT is a promising imaging modality in the clinical workup of patients with cervical CUP tumors.
