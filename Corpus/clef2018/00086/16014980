Relationship of gastric emptying and volume changes after a solid meal in humans. Noninvasive imaging has been developed to measure gastric volumes. The relationship between gastric emptying and volume postprandially is unclear. The aims were to 1) develop a 3-dimensional (3D) single photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) method to simultaneously measure gastric volume and emptying postprandially, 2) describe the course of gastric volume change during emptying of the meal, and 3) assess a 3D method measuring gastric emptying. In 30 healthy volunteers, we used (111)In-planar and (99m)Tc-SPECT imaging to estimate gastric emptying and volume after a radiolabeled meal. A customized analysis program of SPECT imaging assessed gastric emptying. A Bland-Altman plot assessed the performance of the new SPECT analysis compared with planar analysis. Gastric volume postprandially exceeds the fasting volume plus meal volume. The course of volume change and gastric emptying differ over time. Higher differences in volumes exist relative to fasting plus residual meal volumes at 15 min (median 763 vs. 568 ml, respectively, P < 0.001), 1 h (median 632 vs. 524 ml, P < 0.001), and 2 h (median 518 vs. 428 ml, P < 0.02), in contrast to similar volumes at 3 h (median 320 vs. 314 ml, P = 0.85). Analysis of SPECT imaging accurately measures gastric emptying compared with planar imaging with median differences of 1% (IQR -2.25 to 2.0) at 1 h, 1% (-3.25 to 2.25) at 2 h, and -2.5% (-4 to 0) at 3 h. Gastric volume exceeds meal volume during the first 2 postprandial hours, and simultaneous measurements of gastric volume and emptying can be achieved with a novel 3D SPECT method.
