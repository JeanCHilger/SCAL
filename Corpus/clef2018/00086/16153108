Solvent-free vapor-phase photografting of acrylamide onto poly(ethylene terephthalate). Poly(ethylene terphthalate) (PET) films were photografted under reduced pressure in a solvent-free vapor of acrylamide and a co-initiator, benzophenone. Characterization of grafted samples by ESCA and contact angles showed that the grafting increased with grafting time and temperature. The amide groups obtained by the acrylamide grafting were converted into amine groups by the Hofmann rearrangement to be used in coupling reactions. The amine groups were confirmed by reaction with pentafluorobenzoyl chloride, which provides a fluorine label for ESCA. Surface grafting of polymeric substrates in the vapor phase induced by plasma or high energy and UV irradiation is reviewed.
