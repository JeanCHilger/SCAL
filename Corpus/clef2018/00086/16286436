Frontal lobe hypometabolism and impaired insight in Alzheimer disease. The authors examined the relationship between impaired insight regarding cognitive and functional deficits and frontal cortex hypometabolism in 41 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD).Regional cerebral glucose metabolism was determined with (18F)fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography. Level of insight was measured with the clinician-rated Neurobehavioral Rating Scale, and severity of global cognitive impairment was determined with the Mini-Mental State Exam.Inaccurate insight was correlated with glucose metabolic rate in the right lateral frontal cortex (Brodmann areas 6 and 45, and the lateral aspect of Brodmann areas 8 and 9) after controlling for global cognitive dysfunction.The findings from this study help to further elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying impaired insight in AD, indicating a link between this important clinical phenomenon and dysmetabolism in a focal region of the right prefrontal cortex.
