Unidirectional whole body turning: a new lateralising sign in complex partial seizures. The lateralising significance of unidirectional whole body turning in patients with complex partial seizures (CPS) arising from the temporal lobe was evaluated.A total of 330 patients undergoing long term video-EEG study were included. "Unidirectional whole body turning" was defined as rotation of the trunk, head, and limbs by >90 degrees and lasting >10 s. EEG correlates, MRI, and SPECT findings were compared and outcome after surgery was noted for patients with follow up data for >1 year.Unidirectional whole body turning was observed in 13 patients with a mean age of 18+/-8 years. Concordance of the side of whole body turning with the EEG focus and MRI findings was observed in 11 of the 13 patients (84.7%) and in 26 of 28 seizures (92.8%). The six patients who underwent temporal lobectomy or resection of lesion, opposite to the direction of body turning, had good seizure outcome.Unidirectional whole body turning is a new lateralising sign in temporal lobe CPS with good predictive value for epileptogenic focus contralateral to the direction of turning.
