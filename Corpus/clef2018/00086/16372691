Imaging techniques used in the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of patients with myeloma. Radiologists play a central role in the diagnosis, initial staging, follow-up, and restaging of patients with myeloma. This review article attempts to familiarize the reader with all the various types of myeloma, their imaging appearances and useful imaging strategies. The staging system for myeloma patients has been updated and now includes findings from advanced imaging modalities. Radiologists have a vast array of imaging modalities at their disposal to aid them in diagnosis, staging, and follow-up. Currently, conventional radiographic skeletal surveys, magnetic resonance imaging, and F-18 FDG PET/CT examinations are the most useful instruments.
