Retrospective motion correction protocol for high-resolution anatomical MRI. Modern computational brain morphology methods require that anatomical images be acquired at high resolution and with a high signal-to-noise ratio. This often translates into long acquisition times (>20 minutes) and images susceptible to head motion. In this study we tested retrospective motion correction (RMC), common for functional MRI (fMRI) and PET image motion correction, as a means to improve the quality of high-resolution 3-D anatomical MR images. RMC methods are known to be effective for correcting interscan motion therefore, a single high-resolution 3-D MRI brain study was divided into six shorter acquisition segments to help shift intrascan motion into interscan motion. To help reduce intrascan head motion, each segment image was reviewed for motion artifacts and repeated if necessary. Interscan motion correction was done by spatially registering images to the third image and forming a single average motion-corrected image. RMC was tested on 35 subjects who were considered at high risk for head motion. Our results show that RMC provided better contrast-to-noise ratio and boundary detail when compared to nonmotion-corrected averaged images.
