Artificial neural network classifier for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease using [99mTc]TRODAT-1 and SPECT. Imaging the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system with positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission tomography (SPECT) is a powerful tool for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have indicated that human observers have a diagnostic accuracy similar to conventional ROI analysis of SPECT imaging data. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that an artificial neural network (ANN), which can mimic the pattern recognition skills of human observers, may provide similar results. A set of patients with PD, and normal healthy control subjects, were studied using the dopamine transporter tracer [(99m)Tc]TRODAT-1 and SPECT. The sample was comprised of 81 patients (mean age +/- SD: 63.4 +/- 10.4 years age range: 39.0-84.2 years) and 94 healthy controls (mean age +/- SD: 61.8 +/- 11.0 years
