18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer: in comparison with vascularity, Ki-67, p53, and histologic grade. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) positivity of tumor recurrence and vascularity, Ki-67, p53, and histologic grade in patients with ovarian cancer. Nineteen patients with recurrent ovarian cancer underwent FDG PET before second-look surgery. Archival paraffin-embedded tissue materials were used to assess histologic grade including architectural pattern, mitotic activity, and nuclear pleomorphism intratumor microvessel density (MVD)
