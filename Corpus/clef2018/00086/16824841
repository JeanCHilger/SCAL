Recombinant P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-immunoglobulin, a P-selectin antagonist, as an adjunct to thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction. The P-Selectin Antagonist Limiting Myonecrosis (PSALM) trial. Inflammatory responses induced by reperfusion of previously ischemic myocardial tissue may lead to further damage of the microvascular structures. A group of cell adhesion molecules, named selectins, initiate those inflammatory changes at the endothelial wall surface. Recombinant P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-immunoglobulin (rPSGL-Ig), a P-selectin antagonist, was shown to have beneficial effects in several animal models of acute myocardial ischemia. We performed a mechanistic study with positron emission tomography to test the potential benefits of rPSGL-Ig in patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction.Patients with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction presenting within the first 6 hours of onset of chest pain were enrolled. All patients received alteplase. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 3 treatment groups: placebo 75 mg rPSGL-IgThe trial was prematurely stopped by the sponsor for lack of efficacy in an accompanying larger trial after enrolling 88 patients in the current study. Median MBF in the infarct-related territory (expressed as percentage of the normalized blood flow) at day 5 was similar in the 3 treatment groups (9.1% in the placebo group vs 3.8% in the 75-mg dose and 4.3% in the 150-mg rPSGL-Ig treatment group P = not significant). No significant differences in MBF reserve, myocardial metabolism, ST-segment resolution, left ventricular ejection fraction, or TIMI flow grade were found among the 3 groups.In this prematurely stopped mechanistic study, there was no evidence of a benefit of rPSGL-Ig given as an adjunct to thrombolysis on epicardial vessel patency, myocardial tissue reperfusion, or recovery of function.
