Fused radioimmunoscintigraphy for treatment planning. Advances in imaging technologies, including computerized tomography (CT) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT), are improving the role of imaging in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. Hybrid (SPECT/CT) imaging, in particular, shows an increased sensitivity for identification of prostate cancer. Published studies have also recently proposed a new paradigm in the administration of radiation therapy for prostate cancer, favoring dose-escalation strategies to improve tumor control for localized disease. Conventional dose-escalation protocols have previously relied primarily on margin extension to the entire prostate gland to achieve dose-escalation extending increased risk to radiosensitive normal structures. A newer strategy proposes use of advanced imaging to confine dose-escalation to biological target volumes identified on capromab pendetide SPECT/CT -fused image sets or image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). This strategy defines a shift in radiation dosimetry and planning from uniform glandular prescription dosing with dose-escalation applied generically to the peripheral regions and margin extension
