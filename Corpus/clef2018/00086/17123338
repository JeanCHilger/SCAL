Is there a role for sandostatin treatment in patients with progressive thyroid cancer and iodine-negative but somatostatin-receptor-positive metastases? The aim of our study was to determine whether treatment with a long-acting somatostatin-receptor analogue is effective in patients with (131)I-negative but somatostatin-receptor-positive metastases from dedifferentiated and anaplastic thyroid cancer.Twelve patients were screened for the study. All of them showed progressive disease confirmed by radiologic evaluation, increasing serum thyroglobulin (Tg), and negative diagnostic or posttherapeutic (131)I whole-body scans (WBS). Eight of 12 patients (4 males and 4 females age range, 57-89 yearsOnly 3 patients were able to undergo long-term treatment. Two patients were treated with octreotide long-acting release (LAR) for 1 year and 1 patient for 1(1/2) years. All patients showed progressive disease during the treatment: an increase of serum Tg on one hand and an increase in the number of lesions and extent in tumor size visible on FDG-PET-CT and Tc-99m Dep.WBS on the other. During the treatment there was no change in receptor expression, nevertheless, clear tumor progression under therapy with a somatostatin analogue was visible in FDG-PET-CT and in Tc-99m Dep.WBS.Our data demonstrate that all of our patients treated with a somatostatin analogue showed clinical progression and that our attempt to achieve a stabilization of the disease failed.
