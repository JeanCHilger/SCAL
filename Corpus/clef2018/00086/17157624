Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The diagnosis and management of lymphoma have undergone significant changes in the past 20 years. For example, new immunophenotypic and molecular methods have replaced traditional histology-based classification schemes for lymphoma. Fluorine-18-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has evolved into a potent staging tool and prognostic indicator in many kinds of lymphoma. The role of radiation therapy, especially in patients who have early-stage Hodgkin's disease, has changed substantially. The introduction of anti-CD 20 antibody therapy (Rituximab) has improved the treatment of B-cell lymphoma. These changes are linked with higher expectations for imaging, such as detection of more subtle lymphoma manifestations, evaluation of residual changes, and better assessment of early response. This article reviews clinical and radiologic features of both Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It also describes the radiologic staging of lymphoma and the emerging role of FDG-PET for assessing lymphoma.
