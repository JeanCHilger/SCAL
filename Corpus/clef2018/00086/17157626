Imaging of kidney cancer. Advances in molecular genetics have expanded the understanding of renal cell tumors. Now it is understood that renal cortical tumors are a family of neoplasms with distinct cytogenetics and molecular defects, unique histopathologic features, and different malignant potentials. Imaging contributes to clinical management of patients with renal tumors in providing diagnostic information for tumor detection, characterization, staging, treatment planning, and follow-up.
