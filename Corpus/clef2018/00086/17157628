Imaging of uterine cancer. Although surgical staging is the primary method of assessing prognostic factors in endometrial cancer, cross-sectional imaging may help in treatment planning by providing information about factors such as the depth of myometrial invasion, cervical involvement, and nodal status. The pretreatment evaluation of cervical cancer traditionally has consisted of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and conventional radiographic studies, but more advanced imaging methods allow additional insights into the morphologic and metabolic features of cervical cancer. This article reviews the applications of modern imaging modalities in the assessment of endometrial cancer and cervical cancer and their impact on treatment planning and posttreatment follow-up.
