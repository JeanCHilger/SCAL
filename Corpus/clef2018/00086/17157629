Imaging of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer is a heterogeneous and frequently multifocal disease with a variable clinical course. The management of bladder cancer is therefore challenging and complicated. CT and MR imaging have replaced the traditional excretory urography and are emerging as the imaging modalities of choice for work-up of patients who have bladder cancer. Imaging provides essential diagnostic information for detection, staging, and post-treatment follow-up of bladder cancer.
