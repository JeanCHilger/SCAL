Integrated CT-PET imaging of esophageal cancer: unexpected and unusual distribution of distant organ metastases. CT-PET imaging is being increasingly used for the initial staging, assessment of treatment response, and follow-up of patients with esophageal carcinoma, primarily because of its superior detection of distant metastases compared to conventional methods. Our recent experience has shown that metastases from esophageal cancer can occur in unusual locations and have an unexpected presentation. Recognition of the distribution and appearance of esophageal metastases is important for optimal image interpretation in order to avoid confusion with more benign disease. This article reviews the location and appearance of metastases detected by CT-PET imaging in patients with esophageal cancer either at presentation or after preoperative or definitive chemoradiation therapy.
