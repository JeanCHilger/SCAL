Positron emission tomography and familial Alzheimer's disease: a pilot study. Local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose were compared between patients with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (SAD), and normal controls (NC) to determine if FAD is associated with a unique pattern of brain metabolism.Case-control study matched to convenience sample of FAD.Subjects in the three diagnostic groups were scanned using fluorodeoxyglucose and the Positron Emission Tomographic (PET) technique. The criterion standard of a detailed clinical history and examination were compared to scan results.Patients in a university hospital.Ambulatory controls and Alzheimer's patients, both sporadic (n = 8) and familial (n = 7). The two groups were similar in severity of cognitive dysfunction.FAD and SAD patients did not significantly differ in terms of local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose.
