Practical aspects and clinical value of t(1418) monitoring in peripheral blood of the follicular lymphoma patients. Evaluation of practical value of monitoring t(14:18) in peripheral blood in follicular lymphoma.t(1418) was tested in 115 follicular lymphoma patients by methods: FISH, nested and multiplex PCR of blood, bone marrow and lymph node specimens. We tested the patients with rearrangement MBR quantitatively by real-time PCR. Testing intervals of t(14t(1418) is highly associated with follicular lymphoma. In practice, monitoring of t(14
