Whole body MRI and PET/CT in haematological malignancies. The usefulness of whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in haematological malignancies is reviewed. PET/CT combining functional and anatomical information is currently a valuable tool in the management of patients with lymphoma, especially in the assessment of early treatment response. MRI is advantageous in evaluating bone marrow involvement and therefore plays an important role in clinical decision making for patients with myeloma. The development of whole body functional MR studies is underway and can potentially complement the PET/CT for better patient care.
