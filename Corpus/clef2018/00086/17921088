Colorectal cancer: imaging surveillance following resection of primary tumour. Most patients with colorectal cancer undergo treatment with curative intent and subsequently enter a surveillance programme. The primary aim of surveillance is to identify patients with disease relapse at a resectable stage. However, the identification of local recurrence and metachronous carcinoma are also important aspects of follow up. Patients under observation may be referred for imaging either because regular imaging forms part of the surveillance strategy, or because tumour relapse is suggested by the development of new symptoms or a rise in tumour markers. This paper reviews the use of new and existing imaging techniques during surveillance following resection of primary colorectal cancer. The use of imaging for this surveillance is an application of cancer imaging that is supported by evidence-based clinical guidelines. Computed tomography provides the mainstay modality on grounds of good overall diagnostic performance combined with high availability and low cost. Improvements in survival with more aggressive follow up and treatment are likely to demand more accurate imaging techniques in the future.
