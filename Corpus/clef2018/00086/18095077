The predictive value of 18F-FDG-PET early evaluation in patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma treated with chemotherapy plus cetuximab. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the therapy-induced reduction of the (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) maximum standardized uptake value in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma treated with chemotherapy plus cetuximab could predict the objective response and outcome early during the treatment.The study was performed as a part of a phase II trial evaluating cetuximab plus the leucovorin/5-fluorouracil/irinotecan (FOLFIRI) regimen. The objective response was evaluated according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) every 6 weeks. The early metabolic response evaluated by 18F-FDG-PET was assessed according to our own evaluated cutoff value (<35%) after receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.Twenty of 22 patients had positive baseline 18F-FDG-PET. The best RECIST response was: complete response (CR), 3 partial response (PR), 9The early metabolic response evaluated by 18F-FDG-PET predicted the clinical outcome in this series of patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with chemotherapy plus cetuximab.
