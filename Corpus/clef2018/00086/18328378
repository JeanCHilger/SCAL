Environmental controls of allergies. Environmental controls of allergy remain a cornerstone in the management of patients who have allergic rhinitis. In the past, recommendations for environmental controls were based on common sense and the demonstration that certain methods of environmental control reduce antigen quantity. Reduction of antigen quantity is, however, only an indirect measure of whether an environmental control strategy actually reduces allergic symptoms. This article details current recommendations for reducing antigen exposure based on specific antigen sensitivities. Strategies for reduction of indoor inhalant allergens-dust mites, cockroach, molds, and house pet danders-are presented, as well as techniques for reducing exposure to outdoor inhalant allergens.
