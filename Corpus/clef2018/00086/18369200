The affective dimension of laboratory dyspnea: air hunger is more unpleasant than work/effort. It is hypothesized that the affective dimension of dyspnea (unpleasantness, emotional response) is not strictly dependent on the intensity of dyspnea.We tested the hypothesis that the ratio of immediate unpleasantness (A(1)) to sensory intensity (SI) varies depending on the type of dyspnea.Twelve healthy subjects experienced three stimuli: stimulus 1: maximal eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea against inspiratory resistance, requiring 15 times the work of resting breathing stimulus 2: Pet(CO(2)) 6.1 mm Hg above resting with ventilation restricted to less than spontaneous breathingStimulus 1 was always limited by subjects failing to meet a higher ventilation target none signaled severe discomfort. This evoked work and effort sensations, with relatively low unpleasantness (mean A(1)/SI = 0.64). Stimulus 2, titrated to produce dyspnea ratings similar to those subjects gave during stimulus 1, evoked air hunger and produced significantly greater unpleasantness (mean A(1)/SI = 0.95). Stimulus 3, increased until air hunger was intolerable, evoked the highest intensity and unpleasantness ratings and high unpleasantness ratio (mean A(1)/SI = 1.09). When asked which they would prefer to repeat, all subjects chose stimulus 1.(1) Maximal respiratory work is less unpleasant than moderately intense air hunger in this brief test (2) unpleasantness of dyspnea can vary independently from perceived intensity, consistent with the prevailing model of pain
