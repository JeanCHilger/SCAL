Localization of pathological gland's site in primary hyperparathyroidism: ten years experience with MIBI scintigraphy. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is characterised by pathological hyperfunctioning of one or more of the parathyroid glands leading to excessive parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic capacity of scintigraphy with MIBI, considering the surgical findings and the level of agreement with the result of cervical ultrasonography.In the period January 1996 to January 2006, 84 cases with PHPT were included in the study, in which scintigraphy with MIBI was used in addition to cervical ultrasonography. All were hospitalised as "short stay surgery" patients and then seen as outpatients at follow-up visits (at 7, 14 and 30 days), during which calcium, phosphorus and PTH values were measured.In 55 cases (65.5%), the site of the pathology was suspected on the basis of the cervical ultrasonography. Scintigraphy with MIBI was positive in 76 cases (90.4%) and negative in the other eight (9.6%). In six of these eight cases the site had been detected by the cervical ultrasonography. In the remaining two cases (2.4%), neither of these examinations gave positive diagnostic findings. In 58 patients we proceeded with the removal of a single adenoma, in 19 cases with the removal of two out of the four glands, and in seven cases with the removal of three out of the four glands, the single formations removed not showing clearly-defined macroscopic characteristics in two of the seven patients in whom three of the four glands were removed, the preoperative diagnostic examinations had not shown any evidence of gland pathology.We regard scintigraphy with MIBI as a preoperative diagnostic examination that has modified the surgical approach to PHPT, inclining surgeons towards a mini-invasive surgical procedures. We consider CT, MRI and SPECT techniques to be indicated only in cases of relapse of PHPT, possibly associated with ectopic localisation of the parathyroid gland not identified in the course of previous surgical procedures.
