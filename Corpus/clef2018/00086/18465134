CT coronary angiography: quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion using test bolus data-initial experience. The aim of this study is to quantify myocardial perfusion during coronary CT angiography using data from a modified timing test-bolus acquisition. Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. Nineteen patients with suspected coronary artery disease underwent combined coronary CT angiography and cardiac (82)Rubidium-PET perfusion. Prior to the CT angiogram a retrospectively ECG-gated dynamic test bolus was obtained following 25 mls of IV contrast medium injected at 5 ml/s. Images were acquired every 1.5 s for 30 s using 4 x 1.25-mm slices at 120 kV, 35 mAs. Regions of interest were drawn to delineate the myocardium and aorta on the resulting transaxial images. Time density curves were created and perfusion calculated using two simple approaches: maximum-slope method and peak method. In patients with normal PET myocardial perfusion, the mean (SD) resting myocardial perfusion estimated by CT using the maximum-slope method was 0.89 (+/-0.27) ml/min/g and 0.93 (+/-0.21) ml/min/g at end-systole and end-diastole, respectively, and 0.69 (+/-0.11) ml/min/g and 0.79 (+/-0.19) at end-systole and end-diastole, respectively, for the peak method. Thus quantification of myocardial perfusion from a routine coronary CT angiography test bolus is possible. CT-derived myocardial perfusion values are consistent with published values derived from other techniques.
