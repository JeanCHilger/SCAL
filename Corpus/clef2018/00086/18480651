Role of coronary spasm for a positive noninvasive stress test result in angina pectoris patients without hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease. A positive noninvasive stress test result is often considered as a false-positive indicator of coronary artery disease (CAD) when coronary angiography reveals no hemodynamically significant CAD.From January 2001 through December 2004, 5474 patients scheduled to undergo exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) [exercise ECG without imaging or exercise ECG with thallium-201 (201Tl) single photon emission tomography (SPECT)] or dipyridamole 201Tl tomography at our outpatient clinic because of chest oppressive sensation were included in this prospective study. Coronary angiography was performed when a noninvasive test result was positive for ischemia or when ischemic chest pain was suspected. Intracoronary methylergonovine testing was performed when spastic angina was suspected and coronary angiography showed no hemodynamically significant CAD.Noninvasive stress testing was positive in 113 (67%) patients with coronary spasm. Of the 53 patients who had positive exercise ECG (exercise ECG with or without imaging), ST depression was found in 50 patients and ST elevationin in 3 patients. Multivessel spasm was found in 6 (15%), 6 (15%), and 7 (21%) of the patients with a positive result on exercise ECG without imaging, exercise ECG with 201Tl SPECT, and dipyridamole 201Tl SPECT, respectively. There was no significant difference in the results of noninvasive stress testing and the number of vessels with coronary spasm (1-vessel spasm versus multivessel spasm) among these 3 noninvasive stress testing groups.Intracoronary ergonovine testing induced coronary spasm in over 50% of patients who had suspected ischemic chest pain, a positive noninvasive stress test, and no hemodynamically significant CAD.
