Non-small cell lung cancer: whole-body MR examination for M-stage assessment--utility for whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging compared with integrated FDG PET/CT. To prospectively and directly compare the capability of whole-body diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging, whole-body magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with and that without DW imaging, and integrated fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) for M-stage assessment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.The institutional review board approved this study informed consent was obtained from patients. A total of 203 NSCLC patients (109 men, 94 womenArea under ROC curve (A(z)) values of whole-body MR imaging with DW imaging (A(z) = 0.87, P = .04) and integrated FDG PET/CT (A(z) = 0.89, P = .02) were significantly larger than that of whole-body DW imaging (A(z) = 0.79). Specificity and accuracy of whole-body MR imaging with (specificity, P = .02 accuracy, P < .01) and that without DW imaging (specificity, P = .02Whole-body MR imaging with DW imaging can be used for M-stage assessment in NSCLC patients with accuracy as good as that of PET/CT.
