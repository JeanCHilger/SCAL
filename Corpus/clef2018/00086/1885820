Head holder for PET, CT, and MR studies. A new head holder for the fixation and repositioning of the patient head in PET, CT, and MR scanners has been designed and tested. With this device, a bidimensional correlation between functional and anatomical brain images can also be obtained. Head fixation and repositioning are achieved using the patient's dental morphology as an anatomical reference. With a dentistic material, a mold of the patient's teeth is obtained in a few minutes. The molding substance rests on a plastic support, fixed to the head holder. Each time the patient undergoes a new study, his/her personal mold is used, ensuring accurate head repositioning. External markers fixed on the head holder (made visible in lateral PET and CT projection images, midsaggital MR images, and also on the axial images) make it possible to record and recognize the angular orientation and the position of the brain in the three-dimensional space, to correlate images of the same patient obtained with different neuroimaging modalities, and to accurately reposition patients for follow-up studies. The head holder was tested on several subjects. Fixation and repositioning accuracy of within 2.5 mm were achieved in the three-dimensional space. Orientation accuracy was 1 degree.
