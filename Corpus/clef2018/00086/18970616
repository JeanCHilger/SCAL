Determination of intrinsic viscosity of poly(ethylene terephthalate) using infrared spectroscopy and multivariate calibration method. A methodology was developed to determine the intrinsic viscosity of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and multivariate calibration (MVC) methods. Multivariate partial least squares calibration was applied to the spectra using mean centering and cross validation. The results were correlated to the intrinsic viscosities determined by the standard chemical method (ASTM D 4603-01) and a very good correlation for values in the range from 0.346 to 0.780dLg(-1) (relative viscosity values ca. 1.185-1.449) was observed. The spectrophotometer detector sensitivity and the humidity of the samples did not influence the results. The methodology developed is interesting because it does not produce hazardous wastes, avoids the use of time-consuming chemical methods and can rapidly predict the intrinsic viscosity of PET samples over a large range of values, which includes those of recycled materials.
