Extrapyramidal syndromes: PET and SPECT. Extrapyramidal syndromes (ES) belong to the most common neurologic illnesses. Because new and promising therapeutic options are currently under development, there is a substantial demand for molecular imaging procedures with the potential to identify the pathologic changes of those illnesses. This article gives an overview of the current positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography applications for diagnosing ES and focuses on their use in clinical practice.
