In vivo molecular imaging of myocardial angiogenesis using the alpha(v)beta3 integrin-targeted tracer 99mTc-RAFT-RGD. Myocardial angiogenesis following reperfusion of an infarcted area may impact on patient prognosis and pro-angiogenic treatments are currently evaluated. The non-invasive imaging of angiogenesis would therefore be of potential clinical relevance in these settings. (99m)Tc-RAFT-RGD is a novel (99m)Tc-labeled tracer that targets the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin. Our objective was to determine whether this tracer was suitable for myocardial angiogenesis imaging.A rat model of reperfused myocardial infarction was employed. Fourteen days following reperfusion, the animals were injected with (99m)Tc-RAFT-RGD or with its negative control (99m)Tc-RAFT-RAD. Fourteen animals were dedicated to autoradiographic imaging, infarct staining, and gamma-well counting of myocardial activity. In vivo dual-isotope pinhole SPECT imaging of (201)Tl and (99m)Tc-RAFT-RGD or (99m)Tc-RAFT-RAD was also performed in 11 additional animals. Neovessels were observed by immunostaining in the infarcted and peri-infarct areas. (99m)Tc-RAFT-RGD infarct-to-normal ratios by gamma-well counting and ex vivo imaging (2.5 +/- 0.6 and 4.9 +/- 0.9, respectively) were significantly higher than those of (99m)Tc-RAFT-RAD (1.7 +/- 0.2 and 2.2 +/- 0.4, respectively, P < .05). The infarcted area was readily visible in vivo by SPECT with (99m)Tc-RAFT-RGD but not with (99m)Tc-RAFT-RAD (infarct-to-normal zone activity ratio, 2.5 +/- 0.6 and 1.7 +/- 0.4, respectively, P < .05).(99m)Tc-RAFT-RGD allowed the experimental in vivo molecular imaging of myocardial angiogenesis.
