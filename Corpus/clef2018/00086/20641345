. Nitric oxide (NO) is produced as an important mediator in physiological and pathophysiological conditions by three isoforms of NO synthase (NOS): endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS) (1, 2). NOSs are highly regulated for specific physiological roles in various tissues and cells. nNOS produces NO in neurons in both the central and peripheral nervous systems as a neurotransmitter and a neuronal modulator for cellular communication. NO is generated in blood vessels by eNOS in endothelial cells for blood pressure regulation. iNOS is induced by various inflammatory stimuli in activated macrophages and other types of cells and plays an important role in immunity and inflammation. iNOS is also essential for host defense against microorganisms and cancer cells. The basal level of NO is usually very low. In contrast, activated iNOS can generate a large amount of NO over a prolonged period of time during acute and chronic inflammatory diseases (3). iNOS has been found to be overexpressed in a number of tumors compared with normal tissues (4). As a result of the involvement of iNOS in a variety of physiological processes in both normal and diseased states, it is necessary to develop a radiolabeled ligand for noninvasive measurement of iNOS expression. Zhou et al. (5) reported the development of a series of 2-amino-4-methylpyridine analogs as iNOS Inhibitors for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging for iNOS. One of them, [
