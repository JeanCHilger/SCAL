Dynamic high resolution positron emission imaging of rats. The performance criteria for a dedicated rat positron emission tomography has been investigated. A survey of researchers indicated that 3 mm image spatial resolution and 2 second dynamic imaging capabilities were desirable characteristics for a dedicated system. Monte Carlo computer simulations were used to evaluate potential PET designs. The conclusion from the simulations were twofold: 1) unlike human imaging where both sensitivity and spatial resolution limitations significantly effect the quantitative imaging performance of a tomograph, the imaging performance of a dedicated rat tomography is almost solely based upon its spatial resolution limitations and 2) desirable performance could be obtained using a novel multi-layered detector system. Computer simulations were run to evaluate economical modular detector implementations. Two optimal dedicated rat PET designs were found, and prototype multilayered detector module is currently being constructed.
