Consensus guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PETs) are increasingly recognized. In order to assure an optimal treatment of patients and to propose an efficient diagnostic algorithm we were prompted to organize meetings, with participating experts, specialists in different fields of expertise. The idea for the meetings was to try to give a standardized approach, which would in future help in stratification of PET patients. Results of meetings are given in a form of Consensus guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
