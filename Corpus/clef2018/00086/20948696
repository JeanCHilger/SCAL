Recent imaging advances in the diagnosis and management of Parkinson's disease. In this review we report novel sensitive imaging biomarkers for Parkinson's disease (PD) and its atypical variants. Diffusion tensor imaging and transcranial brain sonography are potentially promising techniques that can differentiate typical PD from atypical variants (multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy) and from benign tremor disorders. Non-motor symptoms, such as dementia, depression, and sleep disruption, are often more distressing to PD patients than their slowness and stiffness. Dopamine replacement treatment can also lead to complications such as dyskinesias, impulse control disorders, and psychosis. Recent positron emission tomography studies have helped to clarify the physiopathological mechanisms underlying dementia and compulsive gambling in PD and provide a rationale for therapeutic strategies.
