Hyperparathyroidism, an emerging disease. A retrospective study based on 35 years of personal experience was done. Up to today 2,175 patients were operated, 1,318 for primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) and 857 for secondary and tertiary HPT. Considering recent years (1999 to July 2010), 918 patients were operated for primary HPT. Preoperatively all the patients performed a cervical ultrasound and/or a sestamibi scan. Open mininvasive procedure was preferred: it is an easily reproducible and costless technique. Using magnifying glasses up to 2.5, an excellent three-dimensional vision was obtained. The operating time is short and if there are any doubts it is possible to extend the exploration to the other side of the neck. Immediate and long-term results were excellent, with a cure rate greater than 99%. Complications in the treatment of a single adenoma are around 0.3%. Patients can be discharged 24-48 h after the operation. Regarding reoperations, a correct diagnostic and therapeutic approach is essential. CT, MRI and SPECT must correlate with the information given by ultrasound and scintigraphy. The intraoperative PTH assay (io-PTH) is required and the approach should be limited to the area where the missed gland probably is. The functionality of the autotransplantation (AT) performed immediately was good. The functionality of the cryopreserved tissue is better for the HPT I in comparison with HPT II. Considering HPT I or HPT II the use of io-PTH is helpful. MIBI scanning is helpful but not essential, except in reoperations. Surgeon experience is another very important factor for good results.
