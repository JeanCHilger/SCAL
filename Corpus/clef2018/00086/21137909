ZnO-nanowires/PANI inorganic/organic heterostructure light-emitting diode. In this paper, we report a flexible inorganic/organic heterostructure light-emitting diode, in which inorganic ZnO nanowires are the optically active components and organic polyaniline (PANI) is the hole-transporting layer. The fabrication of the hybrid LED is as follows, the ordered single-crystalline ZnO nanowires were uniformly distributed on flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-based indium-tin-oxide-coated substrates by our polymer-assisted growth method, and proper materials were chosen as electrode and carrier. In this construction, an array of ZnO nanowires grown on PET substrate is successfully embedded in a polyaniline thin film. The performance of the hybrid device of organic-inorganic hetero-junction of ITO/(ZnO nanowires-PANI) for LED application in the blue and UV ranges are investigated, and tunable electroluminescence has been demonstrated by contacting the upper tips of ZnO nanowires and the PET substrate. The effect of surface capping with polyvinyl alcohol (PANI) on the photocarrier relaxation of the aqueous chemically grown ZnO nanowires has been investigated. The photoluminescence spectrum shows an enhanced ultraviolet emission and reduced defect-related emission in the capped ZnO NWs compared to bare ZnO. The results of our study may offer a fundamental understanding in the field of inorganic/organic heterostructure light-emitting diode, which may be useful for potential applications of hybrid ZnO nanowires with conductive polymers.
