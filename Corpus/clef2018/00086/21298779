Microwave-assisted extraction and determination of cyanuric acid residue in pet food samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Cyanuric acid (CYA) is attracting more attention due to its potential toxicity. In the present work, microwave-assisted extraction method in combination with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was proposed for the determination of CYA in pet food samples. Among different solvents, diethylamine-acetonitrile-water mixture (1:5:4, v/v) was found to be the best one as the extractant due to the strong polarity of CYA in the pet food. An internal standard, (13) C(3) -labeled CYA, was used in the extractions. The separation was performed on a MERCK ZIC HILIC column (150 mm × 2.1 mm id, 5 μm) with gradient elution of 20 mM ammonium acetate solution-acetonitrile. CYA was well retained (Rt = 5.10 min) and eluted with good peak shape. The method could respond linearly with CYA at concentrations from 1.0 to 50 ng/mL with a quantification limit of 0.25 mg/kg. The intra- and inter-day precision was less than 4.0% and the recovery of the assay was in the range of 90.4-108.1%. In the analysis of practical spiked pet food samples, the new method yielded satisfactory results. Due to its simplicity and accuracy the straightforward method is particularly suitable for routine CYA detection.
