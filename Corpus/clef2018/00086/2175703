The role of imaging tests in the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma. Many noninvasive high-quality imaging tests are widely available to assist in the evaluation of thyroid nodules. These include thyroid scans, computed tomography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. These procedures and other less commonly performed tests are reviewed. Their routine role in the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma, however, has been, for the most part, obviated by the convenience and accuracy of fine needle aspiration cytology. Special situations in which imaging tests are most useful are discussed.
