Vasodilatory effect of pentoxifylline in isolated equine digital veins. The direct vasodilatory action of pentoxifylline (1-(5-oxohexyl)-3,7-dimethylxanthine) and its signalling pathway was evaluated in equine digital veins. Cumulative concentration-response curves to pentoxifylline (1 nM to 300 μM) were recorded in phenylephrine-precontracted equine digital vein rings under different experimental conditions. Relaxation to pentoxifylline was partially inhibited by endothelium removal, but was unaltered by CGS-15943 (a non-xanthine adenosine receptor antagonist 3 μM). Nitric oxide synthase (NOS), soluble guanylate cyclase and cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors (Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 μM), ODQ (30 μM) and indomethacin (10 μM), respectively) significantly reduced the maximum relaxation induced by pentoxifylline. Moreover, pentoxifylline-induced relaxation was strongly reduced by Rp-8-Br-PET-cyclic guanosine monophosphate-S (a protein kinase G inhibitor
