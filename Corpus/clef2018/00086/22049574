6-Deoxy-6-[ The phosphorylation of glucose, an initial and important step in cellular metabolism, is catalyzed by hexokinases (HKs) (1). There are four HKs in mammalian tissues. HKI, HKII, and HKIII have molecular weights of ~100,000 each. HKI is found mainly in the brain. HKII is insulin-sensitive and is found in adipose and muscle cells. HKIV, also known as glucokinase, has a molecular weight of 50,000 and is specific to the liver and pancreas. Most brain HK is bound to mitochondria, enabling coordination between glucose consumption and oxidation. Tumor cells are known to be highly glycolytic because of increased expression of glycolytic enzymes and HK activity (2), which is detected in tumors from patients with lung, gastrointestinal, and breast cancer. The HKs, by converting glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, help maintain the downhill gradient that results in the transport of glucose into cells through the facilitative glucose transporters (GLUT1-13) (3). GLUT4 and HKII are the major transporter and HK isoform in skeletal muscle, heart, and adipose tissue, wherein insulin promotes glucose utilization. HKIV is associated with GLUT2 in liver and pancreatic Î² cells. 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) was first developed to inhibit glucose utilization by cancer cells (4). HKs phosphorylate 2DG to 2-DG-6-phosphate, which inhibits phosphorylation of glucose. 2-[
