Is there a need for dedicated bone imaging in addition to 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging in pediatric sarcoma patients? Many children with sarcomas undergo whole body 2-deoxy-2-((18)F)fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) and technetium methylene diphosphonate ((99)Tc-MDP) studies. It is unknown whether the combination of both tests results in more accurate detection of bone lesions than (18)F-FDG- PET/CT alone.(99)Tc-MDP bone and (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans were each read by 2 "blinded" observers and then reviewed side-by-side by 3 readers. Bone lesions were graded qualitatively on a 5-point scale (from benign to malignant). Clinical and imaging follow-up (n = 21) and bone biopsy results (n = 8) served as reference standard.A total of 39 paired (99)Tc-MDP and (18)F-FDG-PET/CT studies (cases) performed at a mean interval 4 ± 7 days, were performed on 29 patients (mean age 12 ± 5 y). Of these, 21 patients (72%) had bone sarcoma, whereas 8 patients (28%) had soft tissue sarcoma. By patient and case-based analysis, (18)F-FDG PET/CT had an accuracy of 100%. Tc-MDP had accuracies of 90% and 82% by patient and case-based analysis. The combined interpretation had an accuracy of 97%.In this study, (99)Tc-MDP bone imaging does not provide an added diagnostic value for bone involvement over (18)F-FDG-PET/CT.
