Imaging prostate derived tumors with PET and N-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)putrescine. Because of the high uptake of polyamines by the prostate and by prostate derived tumors, polyamines have been considered as potential imaging agents for metastatic prostate cancer. We now report the successful PET imaging of the Dunning R3327H prostatic carcinoma with N-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)putrescine (FPP), a positron-labeled putrescine analog. Additionally, the biodistribution of FPP in tumor bearing Copenhagen male rats is analyzed. The tumor uptake of FPP was high, and the tumor-to-muscle ratios at 1, 2, 3 and 4.5 h post-injection were 7.2 +/- 1.0, 5.61 +/- 1.65, 4.62 +/- 0.21 and 3.51 +/- 0.91 respectively. The estimated radiation dose for FPP was calculated from rat biodistribution data. The radiation dose estimates suggest that the critical organ, following the administration of FPP, is the upper large intenstine which receives 0.3 rad/mCi administered.
