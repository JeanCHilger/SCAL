Combined PET/CT-perfusion in patients with head and neck cancers. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) can provide information about angiogenesis and blood-flow characteristics in tumours. [18F]Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) is one of the major oncological imaging techniques which provides information about viability of the tumour cell and partly also about its aggressiveness. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between FDG and CTP data in patients with head and neck cancers.Forty-one patients with a clinically suspected head and neck cancer were prospectively included. All patients underwent a combined PET/CT with an integrated CTP examination in the area of the head and neck tumour. CTP data (BF, BV and MTT) and PET data (SUVmax, SUVmean, TLG, PETvol) were compared between tumours and (1) healthy contralateral tissue, (2) inflammatory lesions, (3) metastatic lymph nodes, and CTP data and PET data were correlated in tumours.Thirty-five patients had a head and neck cancer. All CTP data were statistically different between tumours, inflammatory lesions, healthy tissue and metastatic lymph nodes PET/CT data were in part significantly different. CTP and PET parameters were not significantly correlated.CTP and PET parameters were not significantly correlated thus, the additional CTP values provide additional insights into tumour behaviour and their glycolytic status.
