(123)I-Labelled metaiodobenzylguanidine for the evaluation of cardiac sympathetic denervation in early stage amyloidosis. Cardiac amyloidosis is a rare disorder, but it may lead to potentially life-threatening restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac manifestations frequently occur in primary amyloidosis (AL) and familial amyloidosis (ATTR), but are uncommon in secondary amyloidosis (AA). Echocardiography is the method of choice for assessing cardiac amyloidosis. Amyloid deposits impair the function of sympathetic nerve endings. Disturbance of myocardial sympathetic innervations may play an important role in the remodelling process. (123)I-MIBG can detect these innervation changes.Patients with biopsy-proven amyloidosis underwent general work-up, echocardiography and (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy. Left ventricular internal dimensions and wall thickness were measured, and highly refractile cardiac echoes (sparkling) were analysed. Early (15 min) and late (4 h) heart-to-mediastinum ratio (HMR) and wash-out rate were determined after administration of MIBG.Included in the study were 61 patients (30 women and 31 men mean age 62 yearsMIBG HMR is lower and wash-out rate is higher in patients with echocardiographic signs of amyloidosis. Also, (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy can detect cardiac denervation in ATTR patients before signs of amyloidosis are evident on echocardiography.
