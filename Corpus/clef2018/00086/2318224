Myocardial perfusion after aortic implantation for anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. Postoperative myocardial perfusion and function were evaluated using thallium-201 myocardial imaging and technetium-99m cardiac pool imaging in five patients with an anomalous left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery. The patients underwent reimplantation of the left coronary artery at an age ranging from 10 months to 13 years. Postoperative electrocardiographic and radionuclide studies were performed both at rest and during stress 1 to 4 years after the operation. Electrocardiograms which were abnormal preoperatively returned to normal after surgery except that the T wave in lead aVL remained negative. Postoperatively, left ventricular ejection fraction measured by technetium-99m cardiac pool imaging was normal in all patients. Postoperative thallium-201 myocardial imaging, however, showed a perfusion defect with incomplete redistribution at the high-lateral or antero-lateral segment in all patients after a stress test. These data suggest that although myocardial ischaemic change decreases and global cardiac function improves after establishment of a dual coronary artery system, severe myocardial damage remains at the high-lateral or antero-lateral segment.
