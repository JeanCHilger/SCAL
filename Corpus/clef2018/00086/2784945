Rabbit myocardial 82Rb kinetics and a compartmental model for blood flow estimation. Quantification of regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) with rubidium-82 (82Rb) and positron emission tomography (PET) requires the validation of a tracer kinetic model that adequately describes the kinetics of 82Rb in tissue. We performed 134 82Rb kinetic experiments in 24 isolated, arterially perfused rabbit interventricular septa at different flow rates (0.5-4.5 ml.min-1.g-1) and under the following conditions: varied concentrations of glucose (2.8-11 mM), insulin (0-5 mU/ml), and potassium (5-8 mM) varied pH (7.2-7.8)
