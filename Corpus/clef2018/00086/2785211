Synthesis and biological evaluation of [125I]- and [123I]-4-iododexetimide, a potent muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist. A series of halogenated racemic analogues of dexetimide (1) was synthesized and their affinity for the muscarinic cholinergic receptor measured. One analogue, 4-iododexetimide (21), was efficiently labeled with 125I and 123I at high specific activity. In vitro binding studies and in vivo biodistribution studies suggest that 123I-labeled 21 may be useful for imaging muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the living human brain with single photon emission computed tomography.
