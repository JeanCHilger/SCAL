Methodology and dosimetry in adrenal medullary imaging with iodine-131 MIBG. Iodine-131 MIBG scans were performed in 59 patients in order to localize intra- or extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas (pheos), or to visualize hyperplastic adrenal medulla. Images were obtained from the pelvis to the base of the skull on Days 1, 4, and 7 after tracer injection. The 15 patients with histopathologic confirmation of adrenal medullary disease had positive scans. In three of these, the pheos were visible only on images obtained on Day 7. One scan was false negative. After excluding patients with a predisposition to adrenal medullary disease, nine subjects (28%) without verification of pheo displayed adrenal uptake of the radionuclide. Late images produce a low rate of false-negative scans the background activity diminishes and even small pheos can be detected. In order to increase the quality of late images, 40 MBq [131I]MIBG was used instead of 20 MBq. The dosimetric considerations are discussed.
