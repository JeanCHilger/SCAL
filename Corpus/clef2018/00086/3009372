High murine mammary tumor virus expression in milk in a low mammary tumor mouse strain and high incidence of mammary tumor in hybrids produced by crossing with another low mammary tumor mouse strain. Large amounts of murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV) were expressed in milk from a low mammary tumor mouse strain called II-TES, established by crossbreeding DBA/2 mouse strain with two strains of Japanese pet mouse origin. The reciprocal hybrids of the II-TES strain and OZ-F strain, another low mammary tumor strain of Japanese pet mouse origin, developed early-appearing mammary tumors at a high rate, and large quantities of MMTV were expressed in the milk. These findings suggest that different regulatory genes control MMTV expression and mammary tumorigenesis.
