Oxygen extraction fraction and cerebrovascular reactivity to PaCO2 changes in ischemic brain measured by positron emission tomography. Interrelations between oxygen extraction (OEF) and cerebrovascular reactivity to PaCO2 change (VRCO2) in ischemic brain were measured by the 15O gases steady state method and the H215O autoradiographic method using a positron emission tomography. OEF at rest and VRCO2 for hypercapnia and hypocapnia were assessed successively in five cross sections of 10 mm image resolution. With each study correlation coefficients between OEF and VRCO2 were calculated using 30 to 40 regions of interest. In hypercapnic measurements those which had a larger ischemic region resulted in a higher incident of a negative correlation. Fifteen of 19 studies (79%) showed the negative correlation. From the regression lines which showed significant correlation a mean OEF at VRCO2 =0 was 0.54 +/- 0.09, which might indicate the point at the maximal dilatation of the resistance vessels. On the other hand, in hypocapnic studies only five of 18 (28%) showed apositive correlation, and the other measurements showed diffusely negative VRCO2 over the whole regions in the brain.
