Orbital and periorbital dog bites. Although periorbital and orbital dog bites are rare, they most frequently occur in young children and commonly involve significant associated adnexal injuries. In most cases, the dog is either the family pet or is otherwise known to the victim. The exact precipitating event is usually unknown. Most victims are treated by a physician soon after injury, and can be reconstructed primarily following meticulous local wound care, including adequate irrigation. Infection is rare, but because of its potentially disastrous consequences, prophylactic treatment with penicillinase-resistant penicillin or cephalosporin seems indicated. Serious, potentially fatal consequences due to underlying intracranial injury in children under aged 2 years, fatal septicemia in splenectomized individuals, tetanus, and rabies must be considered by ophthalmologists who treat such patients.
