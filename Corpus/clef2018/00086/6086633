Mitochondrial gene expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae. II. Fidelity of translation in isolated mitochondria from wild type and respiratory-deficient mutant cells. The fidelity of mitochondrial translation has been examined in isolated yeast mitochondria incubated in an optimized protein-synthesizing medium (McKee, E. E., and Poyton, R. O., (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 9320-9331). These studies have revealed: that isolated mitochondria synthesize bona fide mitochondrial gene products which are identical in kind and relative amounts to those synthesized in vivo that mitochondria isolated from both mitochondrial mit- mutants and nuclear Pet mutants, which retain the capacity for mitochondrial protein synthesis, produce a mutant pattern of mitochondrial gene products which is similar to that produced in vivo
