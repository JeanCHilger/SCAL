15(p-[123I]Iodophenyl)pentadecanoic acid as tracer of lipid metabolism: comparison with [1-14C]palmitic acid in murine tissues. Uptake and turnover of 15-(p-[123I]iodophenyl)pentadecanoic acid (I-PPA), a radioiodinated free-fatty-acid analog, was examined in heart, lung, liver, kidneys, and spleen and compared with that of [1-14C]palmitic acid (PA). High cardiac uptake of both I-PPA (4.4% dose/g) and PA (2.8% dose/g) was followed by a two-component tracer clearance. Kinetics of I-PPA were linked to those of PA in tissues with primary oxidation of free fatty acids or their preferential storage. Tissue lipids of all organs investigated were labeled concordantly by both tracers. Fractional distributions of PA and I-PPA incorporation in tissue lipids were significantly correlated. Thus general pathways of FFA tissue metabolism are traced by this radioiodinated free-fatty-acid analog. High-quality metabolic imaging of the heart is possible by means of I-PPA with conventional scintigraphic equipment or cross-sectional imaging with single photon emission computerized tomography facilities.
