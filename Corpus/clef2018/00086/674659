Early clinical experience with a radionuclide emission computed tomographic brain imaging system. Six selected cases demonstrate the appearance of subdural hematomas, tumor, stroke, and abscess on single-photon emission tomography. Conventional radionuclide images were obtained on every patient, and computed transmission tomographs were obtained on 4 of the patients. This early clinical experience suggests several promising areas for further investigation.
