Prelabeling of chimeric monoclonal antibody L6 with 90yttrium- and 111indium-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N",N"'-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) chelates for radioimmunodiagnosis and therapy. 90Y and 111In have been attached to chimeric monoclonal antibody L6 with a bifunctional chelating agent (DOTA-peptide isothiocyanate). The bifunctional chelating agent was prelabeled with either radiometal and then conjugated to the antibody. Studies in human patients showed excellent 111In single-photon emission computed tomography images of breast cancer lesions 24 h after injection.
