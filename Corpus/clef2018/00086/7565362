The geometric modulation transfer function of a transmission imaging system that uses a SPECT scintillation camera and parallel hole collimation. An analytic expression has been derived to calculate the geometric modulation transfer function of a transmission imaging system that uses parallel hole collimation for both the source and the SPECT camera. This expression describes the resolution of the transmission imaging system and replaces the need to use computer intensive Monte Carlo simulations for the system design. The geometric modulation transfer function, denoted as MTFg(rho) = [A2sc(Ssc rho)**A2cc(Scc rho)]D(rho), where ** denotes two-dimensional convolution Asc(rho) and Acc(rho) are the Fourier transforms (FT) of the aperture functions for the parallel hole source collimator (SC) and the camera collimator (CC) holes, respectively
