Sensitivity of striatal [11C]cocaine binding to decreases in synaptic dopamine. We have previously shown that tracer concentrations of [11C]cocaine binding to the dopamine transporter (DAT) in human and baboon striatum can be visualized using positron emission tomography (PET). To determine whether the concentration of dopamine normally present in the synaptic cleft can compete with [11C]cocaine for transporter binding sites, we conducted baboon PET studies with drugs (sodium 4-hydroxybutyrate, four studies, 200 mg/kg gamma-vinylGABA, three studies, 300 mg/kg
