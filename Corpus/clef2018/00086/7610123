Positron emission tomography within a magnetic field using photomultiplier tubes and lightguides. The spatial resolution of positron emission tomography (PET) improves when positron annihilation takes place in a strong magnetic field. In a magnetic field, the Lorentz force restricts positron range perpendicular to the field. Since positron annihilation occurs closer to its point of origin, the positron annihilation point spread function decreases. This was verified experimentally by measuring the spread function of positron annihilation from a 500 mm 68Ge bead imbedded in tissue-equivalent wax. At 5 T the spread function full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the full width at tenth maximum (FWTM) decrease by a factor of 1.42 and 2.09, respectively. Two NaI(Tl) scintillation crystals that interface to a pair of photomultiplier tubes (PMTS) through long lightguides detect positron annihilation at zero field and 5.0 T. Photomultiplier tubes, inoperable in strong magnetic fields, are functional if lightguides bring the photons produced by scintillators within the field to a minimal magnetic field. These tests also demonstrate techniques necessary for combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET into one scanner.
