A method of two-dimensional mapping of cortical perfusion by cylindrical transformation of HMPAO SPET data. In order to synthesize three-dimensional information on relative regional blood flow (rCBF) from the cortical grey matter in 99Tcm-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) single photon emission tomographic (SPET) images into a single two-dimensional 'cortical peel' (CP) image, we developed a program that performs cylindrical transformation of SPET data. A sub-routine of this program performs measurements of cortex-to-cerebellum rCBF ratios for 54 cortical regions in the CP image. This program was used to establish a normative database derived from 30 young normal control subjects aged 28.7 +/- 6.9 years. The database was then used to express cortex-to-cerebellum rCBF ratios in four colour-coded ranges of normal standard deviation of the mean rCBF ratio across the cortical regions in the CP image. This CP method was implemented for 30 clinical HMPAO SPET studies in patients (n = 30, aged 71.8 +/- 4.2 years) with suspected dementia as well as several studies in aged healthy subjects (n = 8, aged 67 +/- 9.8 years). In 25/30 (83%) patients, all abnormalities seen on the tomographic display were evident on the corresponding CP image. No aged healthy subjects showed abnormalities on either the tomographic display or the corresponding CP image. An advantage of this technique is that the extent and severity of rCBF abnormalities are readily appreciated in one single image. This technique, in conjunction with the conventional multi-slice tomographic display, was a useful tool in identifying various patterns of rCBF abnormalities in the patients with clinically suspected dementia.
