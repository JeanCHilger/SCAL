Regional cerebral metabolism of glucose in comatose and vegetative state patients. Regional cerebral metabolism of glucose (rCMRglu) was evaluated in patients who were in a coma and vegetative state to determine the level of brain function during these conditions. rCMRglu was measured in 17 discrete brain regions with (/-) [18F] -fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and positrn emission tomography (PET) in 15 patients with brain pathology subsequent to cardiorespiratory arrest (CA), head trauma (HT), or brain ischemia (BI) resulting from cerebrovascular accident or brain surgery. Five comatose patients (Coma group, n = 5), and 10 vegetative state patients (VS, patients awake but not aware) were studied. The VA patients were subdivided, according to the length of their VS condition, into a VS group (n = 6, < 3 months if CA or BI patients, or < 12 months if HT patients) and a persistent vegetative state group (PVS, n = 4, > 3 months if CA or BI patients of > 12 months if HT patients.) Ten normal age-matched subjects served as control. Global CMRglu was 6.72 +/- 0.93 (+/-SD) mg/100 g/min in control subjects. It was significantly (p < - 0.001) reduced to 3.70 +/- 61 in coma, to 3.45 +/- in VS, and to 2.33 +/- 0.34 mg/100 g/min in PVS patients. rCMRglu was significantly reduced (p < - 01001) from control values in all the 17 structures surveyed in every patient. In the Coma and VS groups, there was an overlapping of rCMRglu in the majority of the brain structures. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
