Effect of acute and long-term smoking on myocardial blood flow and flow reserve. Cigarette smoking is a major preventable risk factor for coronary artery disease and sudden cardiac death. However, the effect of acute and long-term cigarette smoking on coronary vasodilatory capacity and myocardial flow reserve has not been quantified in humans.To examine the effect of short-term and long-term smoking, myocardial blood flow was quantified at rest and during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia (0.56 mg/kg) in 12 smokers (10 males and 2 females mean age, 27 +/- 4 years) under baseline conditions (reflecting the effect of long-term smoking) and during short-term cigarette smoking with 13N ammonia, positron emission tomography, and a two-compartment model. Twelve sex- and age-matched nonsmokers served as control subjects. Smoking significantly increased the rate-pressure product at rest from 7525 +/- 1290 to 9160 +/- 1125 (P < .001 versus baseline), which was paralleled by a proportional increase in myocardial blood flow at rest (0.70 +/- 0.17 versus 0.88 +/- 0.17 mL.g-1.min-1Short-term smoking increases the coronary vasomotor tone during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia and markedly reduces the myocardial flow reserve. In contrast, long-term smoking does not attenuate the coronary vasodilatory capacity in young individuals with a relatively short smoking history. It might be speculated that the short-term reduction in the coronary vasodilatory capacity during smoking could lower the ischemic threshold in smokers with coronary artery disease and contribute to the increased risk for sudden cardiac death.
