Clinical manifestations in complex partial crisis of the temporal lobe: a video-electroencephalographic study. We analysed 27 complex partial seizures arising from the temporal lobes recorded on videotape simultaneously with the EEG emphasizing the motor manifestations specially dystonic posturing, ictal paresis and head and eye forced deviation (version). The temporal lobe origin of the seizures was based on the agreement of many scalp-sphenoidal or zygomatic interictal and ictal EEG recordings, CT and MRI findings, interictal and, in some patients, ictal SPECT studies. 8 patients had surgery. In 5 from 7 patients who had temporal lobectomy, mesial temporal sclerosis was the anatomopathological finding and in one patient who had selective amigdalohippocampectomy, hemosiderosis and gliosis probably due to bleeding of a posterior cerebral artery giant aneurysm was found. All patients have been seizure free after surgery. While dystonic posturing and ictal paresis, present in 18 seizures (66.6%), were excellent as lateralizing seizure signs, since they were always contralateral to the ictal onset, contralateral and ipsilateral versive head and eye movements were observed.
