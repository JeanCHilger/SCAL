Fast nonsupervised 3D registration of PET and MR images of the brain. We propose a fully nonsupervised methodology dedicated to the fast registration of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance images of the brain. First, discrete representations of the surfaces of interest (head or brain surface) are automatically extracted from both images. Then, a shape-independent surface-matching algorithm gives a rigid body transformation, which allows the transfer of information between both modalities. A three-dimensional (3D) extension of the chamfer-matching principle makes up the core of this surface-matching algorithm. The optimal transformation is inferred from the minimization of a quadratic generalized distance between discrete surfaces, taking into account between-modality differences in the localization of the segmented surfaces. The minimization process is efficiently performed via the precomputation of a 3D distance map. Validation studies using a dedicated brain-shaped phantom have shown that the maximum registration error was of the order of the PET pixel size (2 mm) for the wide variety of tested configurations. The software is routinely used today in a clinical context by the physicians of the Service Hospitalier Frédéric Joliot (> 150 registrations performed). The entire registration process requires approximately 5 min on a conventional workstation.
