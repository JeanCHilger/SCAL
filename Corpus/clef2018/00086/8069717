Experimental study of olfactory and visual modalities in the communication system between child and pet dog. Different experimental methods are set up to specify the importance of the olfactory cues in the interaction systems between the young child and his pet dog. A realistic child dummy, with an affiliative or an agonistic posture, is wearing clothes of a child who is known or unknown from the animals. The study is dealt in kennels (N(o) of dogs observed: 68) and allows to define and quantify the behaviours of the dogs in response to different combinations of visual and olfactory informations. These behaviours allow to discuss the socio-cognitive abilities of the dogs and their relational strategies determined by the integration of several functional cues.
