Scintigraphic detection of splenosis: superiority of tomographic selective spleen scintigraphy. We used scintigraphy with sulphur colloid and heat-damaged red cells to detect splenosis after splenectomy in 19 patients 7 to 69 months after injury. We compared planar and tomographic selective spleen scintigraphy using heat-damaged red cells with subtracted planar colloid scintigraphy, and showed that the most sensitive method was tomographic selective splenic scintigraphy. The incidence of splenosis was 58% with this method, the other techniques detecting abnormalities in 21% and 26% of the patients.
