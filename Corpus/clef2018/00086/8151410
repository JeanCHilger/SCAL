Clinical experience with iodine-123-iodophenylpentadecanoic acid. Initial research in dogs and later research in normal volunteers and patients with coronary artery disease indicated that 123I-iodophenylpentadecanoic acid (IPPA) can provide valuable diagnostic information. This agent compared favorably to 201Tl in detecting stenosed coronary arteries and identified reversible lesions with greater frequency. Testing with both 201Tl and IPPA before and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty produced similar results, supporting the notion that IPPA deserves inclusion among the diagnostic tools used to evaluate coronary heart disease.
