Variations in regional cerebral blood flow investigated by single photon emission computed tomography with technetium-99m-d, l-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime = l-h during temporary clipping in intracranial aneurysm surgery: preliminary results. Single photon emission computed tomography with technetium-99m-d, l-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime was used to assess variations in regional cerebral blood flow during temporary clipping in the course of intracranial aneurysm surgery and during the postoperative period in 20 patients, 14 of whom underwent temporary clipping. Of these 14 patients (Group A), 9 had aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery, 2 had aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery, and 3 had aneurysms of the carotid siphon. Temporary clips were applied, according to the site of the lesion, on A1, on the trunk of the middle cerebral artery, or on the trunk of the internal carotid artery. The occlusion time ranged from 2 to 31 minutes. The six patients who did not undergo temporary clipping served as controls (Group B), as follows: three had aneurysms of the posterior communicating artery, one of the anterior communicating artery, one of the middle cerebral artery, and one of the internal carotid artery. All patients were investigated with cerebral single photon emission computed tomography preoperatively, perioperatively, and postoperatively. In all the patients of Group A, the preliminary results of the study show a sharp fall in the perfusion of the territories of the temporarily clipped parent vessel and practically a complete recovery within 2 to 7 days of surgery, with no significant neurological symptoms. No similar disturbance of perfusion was found in the patients of Group B.
