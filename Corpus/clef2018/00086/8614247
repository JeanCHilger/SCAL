Serotonin 5-HT2 receptor availability in chronic cocaine abusers. Serotonin 5-HT2 receptor availability was evaluated in chronic cocaine abusers (n = 19) using positron emission tomography and F-18 N-methylspiperone and was compared to control subjects (n =19). 5-HT2 Receptor availability was measured in frontal, occipital, cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices using the ratio of the distribution volume in the region of interest to that in the cerebellum which is a function of Bmax/Kd. 5-HT2 Receptor availability was significantly higher in cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices than in other frontal regions or occipital cortex. The values were not different in normal subjects and cocaine abusers. These results did not show any changes in 5-HT2 receptor availability in cocaine abusers as compared to the control subjects.
