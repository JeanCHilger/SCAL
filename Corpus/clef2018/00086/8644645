Relation between contractile response of akinetic segments during dobutamine stress echocardiography and myocardial ischemia assessed by simultaneous thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography. There are no standard criteria for the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia in akinetic segments during dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE). The aim of the study was to assess the relation between different responses of akinetic segments during DSE and ischemia assessed by thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography with simultaneous stress-reinjection thallium-201 SPECT was performed in 67 patients with old myocardial infarction significant and coronary artery stenosis. Fourteen myocardial segments were matched for both DSE and SPECT. Ischemia on SPECT was defined as reversible thallium defects. In 257 akinetic segments, 4 patterns during DSE were identified: (1) biphasic response in 41 segments (16%), defined as improvement at low dose (5 to 10 microgram/kg/min) followed by worsening at high dose (2) persistent akinesia in 155 segments (60%)
