Prognostic significance of normal dobutamine-atropine stress sestamibi scintigraphy in women with chest pain. To evaluate the prognostic value of normal dobutamine-atropine technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion imaging in women with chest pain and inability to perform an adequate exercise test, 80 women with a normal scintigram were followed up for 23 +/- 13 months. Mean age of the patients was 61 +/- 12 years. Nine patients (11%) had a low probability (< 10%) of coronary artery disease, 43 (54%) had an intermediate probability (10% to 80%) of disease, and 28 (35%) had a high probability (>80%) of disease (including 19 patients with known coronary artery disease). During follow-up, no major cardiac events (cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction) occurred. One patient with known coronary disease underwent coronary bypass surgery after 3 months, and 1 patient with a 91% pretest likelihood of coronary disease underwent coronary angioplasty after 7 months. Thus, the overall incidence of (soft) cardiac events during the follow-up period was 2 of 80 patients, or 1.3%/year. It is concluded that normal dobutamine-atropine technetium-99m sestamibi SPECT perfusion imaging in women with chest pain implies an excellent prognosis, even in women with high pretest likelihood of coronary disease.
