Regional cerebral blood flow measurements with Xenon-CT in the prediction of delayed encephalopathy after carbon monoxide intoxication. Reported evaluations of CBF with Xe/CT were performed in 11 patients during the lucid interval following CO intoxication. Results were compared with clinical and SPECT data. Two patients developed neuropsychiatric behavior (delayed encephalopathy) one month following the initial recovery. The symptoms persisted in one of them 15 months later. Their CBF values as well as those in most of the other patients, monitored at the basal ganglia and white matter areas, were in relation with the clinical outcome, However, further studies with a larger number of patients, are needed to confirm the predictive significance of Xe/CT measurements for the long term sequelae of CO poisoning.
