On the principles underlying the diagnosis of brain tumours--a survey article. A survey is given of the principles underlying the diagnosis of brain tumours. Traditionally diagnosis and localization of brain tumours have been based upon morphological criteria. Currently unsurpassed levels in imaging of anatomical details and topographical relations by the techniques of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been achieved. The techniques of positron emission tomography (PET) and of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), which depict also metabolic and blood flow aspects, provide a refinement of our knowledge on the metabolism, structure and pathophysiological relations of a tumour to the surrounding parenchyma. Recent advances in the recording of function-related changes of the cerebral electro-magnetic field allow a better definition of critical functional areas.
