Vascular imaging for arteriosclerosis obliterans. A) Noninvasive Diagnosis 1. Doppler ultrasonic techniques to get vascular image, to measure blood flow velocity and to hear blood flow sounds. 2. Plain X-ray photography to evaluate arterial wall calcification. 3. Plain and contrast enhanced X-ray computed tomography to assess arterial wall calcification, luminal stenosis and occlusion. 4. Three-dimensional spiral computed tomographic angiography to image the vascular lumen stereographycally. 5. Magnetic resonance angiography for the diagnosis and follow up. 6. Thermography at rest and after loading low temperature and/or exercise. B) Invasive Diagnosis 1. Vascular endoscope to evaluate arterial lumen directly. 2. Intravascular ultrasound imaging to assess the arterial wall architecture. C) Radioisotopic Diagnosis 1. RI angiography. 2. Single photon emission computed tomography to diagnose blood flow distribution in ischemic ulcer and/or hip muscle. In conclusion, it is very important to think always what one is seeing and what one wants to see. There is no single diagnostic procedure which enables one to diagnose everything.
