Ethological and 6-[18F]fluoro-L-DOPA-PET profiles of long-term vulnerability to chronic amphetamine. A chronic 10-day amphetamine (Amp) protocol was used to induce significant long-term decrements of the striatal [18F]fluoro-L-DOPA influx rate constant (FDOPA Ki) in the vervet monkey. Longitudinal FDOPA-positron emission tomography (PET) assessment in Amp-treated subjects subsequently revealed a gradual recovery of striatal dopamine function: FDOPA Ki values were decreased by approximately 70% at 1 month, approximately 45% at 6 months, approximately 20% at 12 months and were similar to pre-Amp values at 24 months. Motoric and social behavioral measures were obtained on all subjects within a species-typical group setting. Behavioral observations were conducted during both basal and stressor-challenge conditions, the latter being created by placing a potential intruder-animal in an individual cage adjacent to the subject's group enclosure. During basal conditions, post-Amp stereotypies were present at 2 weeks and locomotor behaviors were increased throughout 1 month both alterations occurred while FDOPA Ki values were significantly decreased. Social behaviors were also significantly affected
