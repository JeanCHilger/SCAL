Selection criteria for unilateral posteroventral pallidotomy. In an attempt to refine the indications for posteroventral pallidotomy (PVP) the authors instituted strict selection criteria which are based on the experience gained from the first 60 pallidotomy patients treated at their institution. In addition to clinical evaluation, all pallidotomy candidates undergo neuropsychological testing and 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose utilization positron emission tomography (FDG/PET). The data from which these criteria were developed are presented as are early clinical results. The authors demonstrate that these criteria enhance the efficacy of the procedure by assuring therapeutic response and reducing the incidence of post-operative dementia. Their indications and contraindications for pallidotomy are discussed.
