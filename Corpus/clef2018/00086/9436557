PET scan predicts recovery of left ventricular function after coronary artery bypass operation. Viable but hypocontractile myocardium can show functional improvement after revascularization (hibernation). It is sometimes difficult, however, to predict viability and recovery in patients with severe left ventricular function. This study sought to identify possible predictive factors of recovery of cardiac function after revascularization in patients with three-vessel disease.Positron emission tomography (fluoro-18-deoxyglucose uptake for metabolism nitrogen 13-labeled ammonia for flow) and equilibrium-gated nuclear angiography (for the global ejection fraction) were performed in 59 patients with three-vessel disease before and after undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. The positron emission tomographic data were expressed as match normal (flow and metabolism normal), mismatch (low flow, high metabolism), match viable (moderate decrease in flow and metabolism), and match necrosis (low flow and metabolism).Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that only mismatch regions played a significant role in predicting postoperative improvement in function (p = 0.019). There were 1.7 +/- 1.5 mismatch regions in 31 patients who showed an improvement in their ejection fraction (0.47 +/- 0.14 versus 0.58 +/- 0.11 mean +/- standard deviation) versus 0.8 +/- 1.0 mismatch regions (p = 0.017) in patients who did not show recovery. There was more pronounced functional improvement with increasing numbers of mismatch regions, and patients with at least one mismatch region had a high likelihood of recovery (p < 0.001). In patients with a very low preoperative ejection fraction and two or more mismatch regions, there was early significant recovery (0.27 +/- 0.08 versus 0.46 +/- 0.06At least one mismatch region must be present for there to be a postoperative functional benefit. When a low left ventricular ejection fraction is associated with mismatch, early recovery is substantial.
