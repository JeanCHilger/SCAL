Dorsal premotor cortex and conditional movement selection: A PET functional mapping study. Positron emission tomography (PET) brain mapping was used to investigate whether or not human dorsal premotor cortex is involved in selecting motor acts based on arbitrary visual stimuli. Normal subjects performed four movement selection tasks. A manipulandum with three graspable stations was used. An imperative visual cue (LEDs illuminated in random order) indicated which station to grasp next with no instructional delay period. In a power task, a large aperture power grip was used for all trials, irrespective of the LED color. In a precision task, a pincer grasp of thumb and index finger was used. In a conditional task, the type of grasp (power or precision) was randomly determined by LED color. Comparison of the conditional selection task versus the average of the power and precision tasks revealed increased blood flow in left dorsal premotor cortex and superior parietal lobule. The average rate of producing the different grasp types and transport to the manipulandum stations was equivalent across this comparison, minimizing the contribution of movement attributes such as planning the individual movements (as distinct from planning associated with use of instructional stimuli), kinematics, or direction of target or limb movement. A comparison of all three movement tasks versus a rest task identified movement related activity involving a large area of central, precentral and postcentral cortex. In the region of the precentral sulcus movement related activity was located immediately caudal to the area activated during selection. The results establish a role for human dorsal premotor cortex and superior parietal cortex in selecting stimulus guided movements and suggest functional segregation within dorsal premotor cortex.
