Peritoneal urea and creatinine clearances in continuous peritoneal dialysis patients with different types of peritoneal solute transport. We studied whether anuric subjects on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) who achieve the target Kt/V urea of 2.0 weekly will also achieve the target normalized creatinine clearance (NCCr) of 60 liter/1.73 m2 weekly, and the reasons of discrepancy between the two clearances in anuric subjects, by analyzing 476 clearance studies performed in 309 CAPD patients within 12 months of the performance of a peritoneal equilibration test (PET). On the basis of the PET, peritoneal solute transport was classified as low (37 clearance studies), low-average (199 studies), high-average (186 studies) and high (54 studies). We found that weekly values of Kt/V urea in the low transport group (LTG) was 1.74 +/- 0.51, in the low-average transport group (LATG) was 1.66 +/- 0.41, in the high-average transport group (HATG) 1.68 +/- 0.41, and in the high transport group (HTG) 1.73 +/- 0.46 (NS, variance analysis). Weekly values for NCCr, liter/1.73 m2 were: LTG, 37.8 +/- 9.0 LATG, 44.0 +/- 9.2
