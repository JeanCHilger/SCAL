Experiences with functional magnetic resonance imaging at 1 tesla. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been performed on a standard 1 T system using a pulse sequence developed to utilize blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast and an off-line analysis routine using correlation techniques. The sequence and the data analysis routine have been validated by reproducing the conventional hand movement paradigm studies reported by numerous other workers. Our work has then been extended to investigate cerebral foci for a tonic pain stimulus and the cortical representation of oesophageal stimulation. Both these studies relate to paradigms where the expected BOLD signal is significantly less than that encountered for motor or visual cortex paradigms. The results show good agreement with other modalities (positron emission tomography, magnetoencephalography and cortical evoked potentials). Performing fMRI at 1 T is slightly controversial. However, our successful study of demanding paradigms, using a standard clinical 1 T imaging system, has important implications for many other users operating at this field strength.
