Noninvasive assessment of transplant-associated arteriosclerosis. Transplant-associated arteriosclerosis is the major limitation to long-term survival in the cardiac transplant recipient, and annual surveillance angiography is used in many centers to monitor its progression. Noninvasive methods would be preferable because angiography is invasive, costly, and insensitive however, the reliability of such methods has been questioned.All publications relating to the assessment of the cardiac allograft by noninvasive testing were identified through MEDLINE and a review of references from the published literature on transplant-associated arteriosclerosis.Resting and stress ECG, radionuclide scintigraphy, echocardiography, and positron emission tomography have all been used in cardiac transplant recipients with variable results. Most techniques are insensitive, but this limitation may be improved with pharmacologic stress imaging like dobutamine echocardiography. Although insensitive, some methods have good specificity (i.e., radionuclide scintigraphy). The noninvasive measurement of absolute coronary blood flow is promising as a specific and sensitive technique but is limited by availability and cost.In general, noninvasive techniques to assess transplant-associated coronary arteriosclerosis are limited by variable sensitivity and specificity. However, certain methods, such as dobutamine echocardiography and radionuclide scintigraphy, can provide important adjunctive physiologic information to angiography. Such techniques can therefore help to guide the care and treatment of the cardiac transplant recipient with allograft coronary arteriosclerosis.
