Distinct brain loci in deductive versus probabilistic reasoning. Deductive versus probabilistic inferences are distinguished by normative theories, but it is unknown whether these two forms of reasoning engage similar cerebral loci. To clarify the matter, positron emission tomography was applied during deductive versus probabilistic reasoning tasks, using identical stimuli. Compared to a language comprehension task involving the same stimuli, both probabilistic and deductive reasoning increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) bilaterally in the mesial frontal region and in the cerebellum. In the direct comparison, probabilistic reasoning increased rCBF in left dorsolateral frontal regions, whereas deductive reasoning enhanced rCBF in associative occipital and parietal regions, with a right hemispheric prevalence. The results suggest that reasoning about syllogisms engages distinct brain mechanisms, depending on the intention to evaluate them deductively versus probabilistically.
