A phase II study of bryostatin 1 in metastatic malignant melanoma. Bryostatin 1 is a protein kinase C partial agonist which has both antineoplastic and immune-stimulatory properties, including the induction of cytokine release and expansion of tumour-specific lymphocyte populations. In phase I studies, tumour responses have been observed in patients with malignant melanoma, lymphoma and ovarian carcinoma. The dose-limiting toxicity is myalgia. Sixteen patients (age 35-76 years, median 57 years) with malignant melanoma were treated. All had received prior chemotherapy. In each cycle of treatment, patients received bryostatin 25 degrees g m(-2) weekly for three courses followed by a rest week. The drug was given in PET diluent (10 microg bryostatin ml(-1) of 60% polyethylene glycol, 30% ethanol, 10% Tween 80) and infused in normal saline over 1 h. The principal toxicities were myalgia (grade 2, eight patients and grade 3, six patients) and grade 2 phlebitis (four patients), fatigue (three patients) and vomiting (one patient). Of 15 patients evaluable for tumour response, 14 developed progressive disease. One patient developed stable disease for 9 months after bryostatin treatment. In conclusion, single-agent bryostatin appears ineffective in the treatment of metastatic melanoma in patients previously treated with chemotherapy. It should, however, be investigated further in previously untreated patients.
