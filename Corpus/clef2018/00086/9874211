Molecular cloning and expression of active Ole e 3, a major allergen from olive-tree pollen and member of a novel family of Ca2+-binding proteins (polcalcins) involved in allergy. A cDNA encoding Ole e 3, a major allergen from olive-tree pollen, has been cloned and sequenced. A strategy based on two-step PCR amplification towards the 5' end and 3' end, with an internal specific primer, has been used. The isolated cDNA contains an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide of 84 amino acids, which is in agreement with the composition and molecular mass of the natural allergen, exhibiting two 12-residue segments homologous to Ca2+-binding sites of EF-hand type. The cDNA was inserted into the pET-11b expression vector and over-expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant protein shows identical secondary structure to that of the natural allergen and is able to bind both IgE from sera of patients allergic to olive pollen and polyclonal antibodies raised against olive-pollen Ole e 3. The capacity of binding Ca2+ has been demonstrated for both natural and recombinant allergens. RNA transcripts of Ole e 3 were only detected in pollen tissue. Northern-blot and Western-blot analyses of poly(A)+ RNA and protein extracts, respectively, obtained from a variety of olive-tree-related and nonrelated mature pollens demonstrated the presence of Ole e 3 homologous proteins. This indicates a sequence conservation and widespread distribution for this family of Ca2+-binding proteins that can be responsible for allergenic cross-reactivity. We suggest the tentative generic name of polcalcins for the members of this family of Ca2+-binding proteins from pollen.
