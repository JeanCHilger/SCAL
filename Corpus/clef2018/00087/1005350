74 requests for interruption of pregnancy after failure of oral contraception (author's transl). Results of questionaires given to 130 women requesting abortion at the Maternity clinic after failure of oral contraception were compared with those from 40 women attending a psychiatric clinic, who had used oral contraception, but were not  requesting abortion.  The women were comparable in age, reasons for choosing the pill, percentage of those getting it from physicians, and in their next choice of a contraceptive method.  Some of the differences were:  among the abortion requests, more foreigners, more Catholics, more single women, shorter duration of pill use, more frequent medical advice for quitting pills, and especially, a high percentage with loss of an  important person or object (such as a family pet), 63%, and a high percentage with an emotional crisis, such as a separation, 42%.  Surprisingly, the control group from the psychiatric clinic reported a loss in 90% and a crisis in 70%, a much higher proportion than control groups in 2 previous studies.  The results are discussed in the light of the "Clayson syndrome" which assumes that unwanted pregnancy may be a substitute for loss of a desired loved one or object.
