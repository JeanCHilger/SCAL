The Selvester 32-point QRS score for evaluation of myocardial infarct size after primary coronary angioplasty. In patients treated successfully with primary angioplasty for a first myocardial infarction, the Selvester 32-point score correlates well with infarct size measured with quantitative thallium-201 perfusion imaging. Therefore, it is a useful parameter for infarct sizing, particularly in patients with anterior infarction or reduced ejection fraction at discharge.
