CBF and CBV measurements by USPIO bolus tracking: reproducibility and comparison with Gd-based values. The authors measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) by bolus tracking of a novel ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) contrast agent (NC100150) and compared absolute and relative perfusion measurements with those obtained by a standard gadolinium-based contrast agent. They found a linear correlation between the two methods. A dose of 0.4 mg Fe/kg body weight was found to produce a signal drop similar to that of a standard 0.2 mmol/kg gadodiamide injection using spin-echo echoplanar imaging (SE-EPI) at 1.0 T. The measurements showed a high degree of reproducibility of repeated absolute as well as relative CBF and CBV values, lending further hope to the possibility of using magnetic resonance bolus tracking for routine CBF and CBV measurements. Finally, the authors present their initial experience with high-resolution, non-EPI CBV maps obtained from steady-state levels of an intravascular superparamagnetic contrast agent.
