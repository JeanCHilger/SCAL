Effects of nifedipine on myocardial blood flow and systolic function in humans with ischemic heart disease. To test the hypothesis that, in humans with ischemic heart disease, nifedipine is a primary dilator of the coronary circulation and in general exerts a net positive effect on the balance of myocardial oxygen supply and demand.Positron-emission tomography with [13N]-ammonia was used to measure myocardial blood flow in patients at rest, and during infusion of adenosine and ingestion of nifedipine (10 mg capsule, a bite-and-chew technique). Myocardial segments were defined physiologically on the basis of blood flow to adenosine as being normal or having mild, moderate, or severe impairment of dilator reserve. Myocardial systolic function was assessed under comparable physiologic conditions using gated single-photon-emission computed tomography radionuclide ventriculography.Our study population consisted of 13 male patients and one female patient. Ingestion of nifedipine increased heart rate (from 63 +/- 11 to 80 +/- 16 beats/min, P < 0.001) and, as intended, lowered systolic arterial pressure (from 148 +/- 20 to 123 +/- 14 mmHg, P < 0.001) but had no effect on heart rate-pressure product (which changed from 9283 +/- 1576 to 9942 +/- 2162 mmHg/min). Myocardial blood flow in patients at rest in segments with mild, moderate, and severe reductions of dilator capacity (0.63 +/- 0.20, 0.67 +/- 0.25, and 0.58 +/- 0.27 ml/min per g, respectively) was less (P < 0.01) than normal (0.91 +/- 0.29 ml/min per g). Nevertheless, flow of blood was increased versus that at rest (P < 0.01) by infusion of adenosine (to 1.78 +/- 0.13, 1.29 +/- 0.16, and 0.75 +/- 0.22 ml/min per g) and ingestion of nifedipine (to 1.17 +/- 0.51, 1.06 +/- 0.36, 0.85 +/- 0.42 ml/min per g) in segments with mild, moderate, and severe reduction of dilator capacity as well as in normal segments (to 3.18 +/- 0.85 ml/min per g with adenosine and 1.68 +/- 0.65 ml/min per g with nifedipine). Global left ventricular systolic function remained unchanged versus baseline (ejection fraction 0.74 +/- 0.09) with nifedipine (0.76 +/- 0.10). Regional contraction expressed in normalized amplitude units also remained unchanged versus baseline in response to nifedipine.Nifedipine increases myocardial blood flow in humans with ischemic heart disease in normal segments as well as in segments with mild, moderate, and severe reductions of dilator capacity, albeit to a lesser extent with increasing impairment of dilator capacity. Both global and regional left ventricular contractile function also are not adversely affected by nifedipine. These improvements in myocardial blood flow in face of no change or a decrease in myocardial demand for oxygen reflect an overall favorable effect on the balance between the supply of and demand for myocardial oxygen.
