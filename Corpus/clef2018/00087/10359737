Prevalence of myocardial viability as detected by positron emission tomography in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Detection of myocardial viability is important in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Restoration of blood flow to viable myocardium is associated with improved left ventricular function and improved patient prognosis. However, the prevalence of viable myocardium in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy is unknown.To determine the prevalence of myocardial viability, clinical [13N]ammonia/18F-deoxyglucose PET studies performed in 283 patients (age, 63+/-10 years) with ischemic heart disease (mean ejection fraction, 26+/-8%) were visually analyzed for the presence and extent of viable and nonviable myocardium. The myocardium was divided into 19 segments. The extent of viable myocardium was considered "functionally" significant if >/=5 segments ( approximately 25% of the left ventricular myocardium) exhibited a blood flow/metabolism mismatch and "prognostically" significant if 1 to 4 left ventricular segments did so. Of all patients, 41% had no evidence of viable myocardium, 55% had viable myocardium, and 4% had normal blood flow and metabolism within an enlarged left ventricle. Functionally significant viability was found in 27% and prognostically significant viability in 28% of the patients. Multivariate analysis revealed the presence of angina to be the only clinical parameter associated with the presence of functionally significant viability.Revascularization might improve patient prognosis in 55% and result in improved left ventricular function in 27% of all patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
