Lack of prognostic value of 99mTc MIBI rest, 18F FDG and 201TL rest/redistribution on PTCA outcome of patients with moderate left ventricle dysfunction. The clinical work-out of patients undergoing coronary revascularization includes the assessment of myocardial viability. This approach has to be defined in the different classes of patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive prognostic value of different techniques on outcome following PTCA in patients with moderate left ventricle dysfunction (left ventricle EF > or = 40%).Seventeen patients with EF > or = 40% and undergoing PTCA were studied by 201Tl rest/redistribution, 18F-FDG and 99mTc-MIBI rest. Regional kinesis was scored by echo, dividing left ventricle in 11 segments. The echo evaluation was repeated at 1 and 6 months after revascularization.Global EF was 52.5 +/- 7% and 69 segments had abnormal kinesis. Patients underwent stress/rest 99mTc-MIBI SPET, rest/redistribution 201Tl SPET and rest 18F-FDG PET. Among the 11 segments defined on echo-matched tomographic images, the one with the highest activity at stress was assumed as reference (activity = 100%). If > 50% of reference segment, 18F-FDG and 201Tl uptakes were considered significant. After PTCA, the echo-follow-up did not demonstrated significant improvement of left ventricle function at 30 days after PTCA (EF 56 +/- 6%) as well as at 6 months (EF 56 +/- 9%). The positive predictive value under these conditions resulted: 46.5% with 99mTc-MIBI rest, 47.4% with 201Tl rest-redistribution and 45.7% with 18F-FDG.In summary, in the class of patients with moderately compromised function, considering as reference the improved regional kinesis after PTCA, 99mTc-MIBI at rest, 201Tl rest/redistribution and 18F-FDG do not exhibit a clear predictive value patient population is then a highly relevant point to establish the accuracy of these diagnostic procedures.
