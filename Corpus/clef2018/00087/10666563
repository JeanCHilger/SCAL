Different cortical activity in reading of Kanji words, Kana words and Kana nonwords. We report a positron emission tomography study on reading of Japanese Kanji (morphograms) words, Kana (phonograms) words and Kana nonwords using statistical parametric mapping. Activity was more pronounced in the lateral fusiform gyrus (Area 37) in Kanji, in contrast to the greater activation in the middle and inferior occipital gyri (Areas 18 and 19) and the deep perisylvian temporo-parietal area (Areas 40/22 and 22/21) in Kana, suggesting that Kanji and Kana are processed differently.
