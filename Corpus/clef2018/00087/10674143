Epilepsy surgery in Belgium, the experience in Gent. Between January 1992 and July 1998, 320 patients were presurgically evaluated for medically refractory epilepsy at the University Hospital of Gent. All patients underwent a comprehensive presurgical evaluation, including extensive neurological history and examination, video-EEG monitoring of interictal EEG and habitual seizures, and optimum magnetic resonance (MR). In a large subgroup of these patients, a comprehensive neuropsychological examination and interictal 18FDG-PET were performed. Subsequently, a bilateral carotid angiography and intracarotid amytal procedure (Wada-test) were planned in 49 patients to establish hemispheric language dominance and bilateral memory function. After proper selection, 23 patients underwent invasive video-EEG monitoring with intracranial implantation of parenchymal and/or subdural electrodes to further document the area of seizure onset. From the initial group of 320 potential surgical candidates, 75 patients (42 males, 33 females) with mean age of 29 years (range: 2 months-55 years) and mean duration of uncontrolled seizures of 15 years (range: 2 weeks-38 years) eventually underwent a surgical procedure. Sixty of 75 patients were on high dose antiepileptic polytherapy. Optimum MR detected structural abnormalities, confined to a limited brain area, in 71 patients. These abnormalities were of space-occupying nature in 31 cases an atrophic lesion was suspected in 39 patients
