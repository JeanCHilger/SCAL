Striatal kinetic modeling of FDOPA with a cerebellar-derived constraint on the distribution of volume of 30MFD: a PET investigation using non-human primates. The peripherally born metabolite of FDOPA, 3-O-Methyl-FDOPA (3OMFD), crosses the blood-brain barrier, thus complicating positron emission tomography-FDOPA (PET-FDOPA) data analysis. In previous reports the distribution volume (DV) of 3OMFD was constrained to unity. We have recently shown that the forward transport rate-constant of FDOPA (K(S1)) and the cerebellum-to-plasma ratio (C(b)/C(p)), a measure for the DV of 3OMFD, are functions of plasma large neutral amino acid (LNAA) concentration. Given large interstudy and intersubject differences in plasma LNAA levels, variations in the DV of 3OMFD are significant. In this report, the authors propose a constraint on the DV of 3OMFD that accounts for these variations. Dynamic PET-FDOPA scans were performed on 12 squirrel monkeys and 12 vervet monkeys. Two sets of constraints were employed on the compartmental model--M1 or M2. In M1, the striatal DV of 3OMFD was constrained to unity in M2, the striatal DV of 3OMFD was constrained to an estimate derived from the cerebellum. Striatal and cerebellar time-activity curves were fitted using FDOPA and 3OMFD plasma input functions. The estimate of K(S1) and that of the compartmental FDOPA uptake-constant (K(i)), both obtained using M2, were adjusted to values corresponding to average LNAA levels. Finally, K(i) was compared with the graphical uptake-constant (PK(j)). With the use of constraint M2, intersubject variability of squirrel monkey k(S3) and K(i) was reduced by 45% and 53%, respectively
