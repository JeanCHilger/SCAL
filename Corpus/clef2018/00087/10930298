The production and biological assessment of cervine interferon gamma. Cervine interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) was cloned and expressed using an Escherichia coli expression system pET-32. The expressed protein contained a 6 histidine purification tag and an 11 kDa thioredoxin fusion partner 5' to the IFN-gamma molecule. The ability of IFN-gamma to inhibit the killing of Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells by Semliki forest virus was used as a measure of the bioactivity of the recombinant cervine IFN-gamma (rIFN-gamma). It was shown that the presence of the thioredoxin fusion partner 5' to the IFN-gamma molecule did not affect its biological activity. As in the mouse model, it was shown that cervine rIFN-gamma was able to down-regulate the transcription of interleukin 10 mRNA while up-regulating the transcription of interleukin 12 mRNA in lipopolysaccharide-sensitized, peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A prototype ELISA was tested for its ability to detect both recombinant and native IFN-gamma. The ELISA was able to detect rIFN-gamma at concentrations greater than 100 pg/ml. It was also used to detect native IFN-gamma produced by peripheral blood lymphocytes from Mycobacterium bovis infected or vaccinated deer after in vitro restimulation with antigen. The rIFN-gamma and the cervine IFN-gamma specific ELISA provide valuable tools with which to study important zoonotic infections in farmed and wild deer.
