Myocardial perfusion evaluated with a 2-isotope technique. Experience with the first 1600 cases in Mexico. SPECT has a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Dual isotope protocol using rest thallium and stress MIBI was introduced in Mexico 4 years ago. This protocol reunite the advantages of both radiotracers for the study of myocardial perfusion. We present our experience of the first three years. One thousand six hundred patients were studied with suspected myocardial ischemia 288 were excluded because of an absence of a proper follow up. In 895 of the 1312 patients a coronariography was performed. Images were evaluated by dividing the heart in 20 segments using a 5 points scale (0 = normal to 4 = absence of perfusion). It was considered a perfusion defect when a segment had a score greater or equal to 2 and the SPECT study was considered abnormal if two or more segments had a MIBI stress score equal or greater than 2. The global sensitivity for diagnosis of ischemia was 96.28%. Dual isotope method is appropriate for the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. It has a high sensitivity and specificity for the recognition of global coronary disease and for specific coronary territories. This work constitutes the greatest series in Latin America that uses this diagnosis method.
