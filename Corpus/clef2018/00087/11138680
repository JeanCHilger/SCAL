Detection of esophagitis by 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile chest SPECT. Esophagitis is a common complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Unfortunately, an accurate diagnosis of esophagitis usually requires invasive endoscopy. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the use of noninvasive 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) chest SPECT to detect esophagitis in GERD patients.Forty GERD patients who underwent endoscopy for diagnosis and grading of esophagitis according to the Savary-Miller grading system were included in this study. 99mTc-MIBI chest SPECT was performed on all patients to detect and grade esophagitis.On the basis of the endoscopic findings, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 99mTc-MIBI chest SPECT to detect esophagitis were 100%, 77%, and 95%, respectively. The correlation between the Savary-Miller grading system and 99mTc-MIBI chest SPECT grading was found to be good.Noninvasive 99mTc-MIBI chest SPECT has excellent sensitivity and good accuracy as a screen for esophagitis.
