Nodal staging of lymphoma with whole-body PET: comparison of. Accurate staging is elementary for optimal management of malignant lymphoma. Advanced cases may be curable with multidrug chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy, whereas limited disease can sometimes be cured by local radiotherapy only. Recently, FDG imaging with whole-body PET (WB PET) has been introduced as an accurate method for staging lymphoma. We evaluated the usefulness of L-[methyl-11C]methionine (MET) in comparison with FDG as a tracer for nodal staging of lymphoma with WB PET.Nineteen patients with untreated, histologically proven malignant lymphoma underwent WB PET imaging with MET and FDG within 1 wk before treatment. Fourteen patients had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and 5 had Hodgkin's disease (HD). Two of these 19 patients were excluded from the final analysis because of hyperglycemia. WB PET images using FDG and MET were visually compared by 3 independent interpreters, and the PET findings were correlated with the data on the basis of conventional staging studies.Fifty-five of 178 lymph node regions were classified as diseased both by FDG PET and by CT, and 54 of 178 were classified as diseased both by MET PET and by CT. In addition, 11 lymph node regions that CT showed to be normal avidly accumulated FDG. Ten of these lymph node regions also had clear uptake of MET. Another 4 and 5 lymph node regions were enlarged at CT but were judged to be normal by FDG and MET PET, respectively. In nodal staging, both FDG PET and MET PET would have upstaged the disease in 3 patients. MET PET would also have downstaged the disease in 1 patient.FDG and MET seem to be comparable in the detection of lymphoma by WB PET. However, visual interpretation of the images tends to be hampered more by physiologic accumulations of MET than by normal accumulations of FDG, and MET may be preferable to FDG in hyperglycemic patients undergoing staging studies with PET.
