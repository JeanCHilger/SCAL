7. Survey of Results of Whole Body Imaging Using the PET/CT at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center PET Facility. Purpose: At the University Of Pittsburgh Medical Center, over 100 oncology studies have been performed using a combined PET/CT scanner. The scanner is a prototype, which combines clinical PET and clinical CT imaging in a single unit. The sensitivity achieved using three-dimensional PET imaging as well as the use of the CT for attenuation correction and image fusion make the device ideal for clinical oncology. Clinical indications imaged on the PET/CT scanner include, but are not limited to, tumor staging, solitary pulmonary nodule evaluation, and evaluation of tumor reoccurrence in melanoma, lymphoma, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, head and neck cancer, and renal cancer.Methods: For all studies, seven millicuries of F(18)-fluorodeoxyglucose is injected and a forty-five minute uptake period is allowed prior to positioning the patient in the scanner. A helical CT scan is acquired over the region, or regions of interest followed by a multi-bed whole body PET scan for the same axial extent. The CT scan is used to correct the PET data for attenuation. The entire imaging session lasts 1-1.5 hours depending on the number of beds acquired, and is generally well tolerated by the patient.Results and Conclusion: Based on our experience in over 100 studies, combined PET/CT imaging offers significant advantages, including more accurate localization of focal uptake, distinction of pathology from normal physiological uptake, and improvements in evaluating therapy. These benefits will be illustrated with a number of representative, fully documented studies.
