9. Assessment of Intrathoracic Metastatic Lung Cancer using FDG-PET and CT of the Thorax. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy in localizing mediastinal, hilar and intraparenchymal lymphadenopathy in patients with primary lung carcinomas, using FDG-PET and CT of the thorax and to correlate with surgical pathology.Method: Thirty-five patients with primary lung carcinomas and minimal metastatic lymph node involvement, (either N solidus in circle or N1 disease) underwent FDG-PET and CT of the thorax prior to surgical intervention. Both FDG-PET and CT of the thorax were blindly read independent of one another.Results: Histologically, 23 patients had negative lymph nodes (N solidus in circle) and 12 patients had N1 disease. The imaging performance characteristics for FDG-PET and CT of the thorax in N solidus in circle/N1 disease was evaluated and reported in Table 1.Conclusion: This study demonstrates the higher specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV of FDG-PET over CT of the thorax in patients with minimal lymph node disease.
