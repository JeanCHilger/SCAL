Analysis of trimethylsilyl derivatization products of phosphatidylethanol by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. For the detection of rare phospholipid, phosphatidylethanol (PEt), GC-MS analysis method was adopted for the detection of derivatization products of PEt by N,O-bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluroacetamide (BSTFA). A re-structured molecule derived from PEt, ethyl bis (trimethylsilyl)-phosphate was found from search of Wiley database. This molecule can be used as a marker for PEt analysis. The molecular formula was C8H23O4PSi2 and weight of the formula was 270.09.
