High resolution allelotype of nonfunctional pancreatic endocrine tumors: identification of two molecular subgroups with clinical implications. A high resolution allelotype for nonfunctional pancreatic endocrine tumors (NF-PETs) has been generated by microsatellite analysis of DNA from 16 frozen cases, each probed with 394 markers. Two subgroups of NF-PETs were found. Seven cases showed frequent, large allelic deletions [loss of heterozygosity (LOH)] with an average fractional allelic loss (FAL) of 0.55, whereas nine cases showed a small number of random losses with a FAL of 0.15. Designated high or low FAL, respectively, these genetic phenotypes showed correlation with the ploidy status: high-FAL tumors were aneuploid, low-FAL were diploid. Chromosomes 6q and 11q showed LOH in >60% of cases. About 50% of cases had losses on 11p, 20q, and 21. Selected LOH analysis on an additional 16 paraffin-embedded NF-PETs confirmed the high frequency of 6q and 11q LOH. The allelotype of NF-PET is markedly different from that of either ductal or acinar tumors of the pancreas as well as from that of functional-PETs. Moreover, whereas deletions involving chromosome 11 also are a feature of functional-PETs, the involvement of chromosome 6q is characteristic of NF-PETs. Survival analysis showed that none of the single chromosomal alterations was associated with outcome, whereas ploidy status is an independent factor adding prognostic information to that furnished by the proliferative index measured by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry.
