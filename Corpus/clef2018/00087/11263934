Positron emission tomography with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose of uterine sarcoma: a comparison with magnetic resonance imaging and power Doppler imaging. The effectiveness of positron emission tomography with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) for diagnosis of uterine sarcoma was evaluated in comparison to the effectiveness of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and power Doppler imaging.The cases of five Osaka City University Hospital patients diagnosed with uterine sarcoma based on histopathological examination, in whom FDG-PET, MR imaging, and power Doppler imaging studies had been performed preoperatively, were reviewed. A comparative study of the usefulness of these three imaging modalities for diagnosis of sarcoma was conducted. Tumors comprised three leiomyosarcomas, one endometrial stromal sarcoma, and one carcinosarcoma.FDG-PET examinations were 100% positive for the five sarcomas MR imagings were 80% positive (four of five cases), and US was 40% positive (two of five cases). The mean standardized uptake value of the sarcomas was 4.5 +/- 1.3.The sarcoma lesions were clearly imaged by FDG-PET. FDG-PET may be a most useful diagnostic method for uterine sarcoma.
