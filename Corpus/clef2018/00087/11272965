Reliability and validity of a community needs assessment instrument for nursing homes in Taiwan. Several studies have been conducted which identify the lack of nursing homes in the Taiwan area as a major problem. However, no research instruments were found which measure the perception of need for nursing homes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a community needs assessment instrument for nursing homes in Taiwan, called the Perception Evaluation Tool (PET). A randomly selected sample of 319 subjects participated in the study. Results suggest the PET has appropriate reliability and validity.
