Cloning and expression of cDNA encoding hamster liver 3-hydroxyhexobarbital/17beta(3alpha)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1. Using RACE techniques we have cloned and sequenced one of the hamster liver 3-hydroxy-hexobarbital dehydrogenases which catalyze not only cyclic alcohols but also 17beta-hydroxy-steroids and 3alpha-hydroxysteroids. The gene specific primers to 3-hydroxyhexobarbital dehydrogenase 1 (G2) were synthesized on the basis of its partial peptide sequences. The sequence of full length cDNA generated by 3'- and 5'-RACE PCR consisted of 1225 nucleotides including an open reading frame of 972 nucleotides encoding a protein of 323 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence matched exactly with the partial peptide sequences of hamster liver 3-hydroxyhexobarbital dehydrogenase 1 (G2). The sequence showed 84.5% identity to mouse liver 17beta-dehydrogenase(A-specific), and 74-76% identity to human liver bile acid binding protein/3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (DD2), human liver 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I (DD4) and type II (DD3), and rabbit ovary 20alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The protein contains catalytic residues of aldo-keto reductases, Asp50, Tyr55, Lys84, His117. These results suggest that the hamster liver 3-hydroxyhexobarbital/17beta(3alpha)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase belongs to aldo-keto reductase superfamily. The insert containing the full-length cDNA of 3-hydroxyhexobarbital dehydrogenase and vector specific overhang produced by PCR was annealed with pET-32 Xa/LIC vector. The plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells containing pLysS. The recombinant enzyme was induced 1 mM IPTG. The expressed enzyme was produced as fusion protein and purified by nickel chelating affinity chromatography followed by POROS CM column chromatography and superdex 75 gel filtration. Molecular weight of the recombinant enzyme fused thioredoxin and his*tag was about 55000 and that was 35000 after Factor Xa protease treatment. The recombinant enzyme dehydrogenated 3-hydroxy-hexobarbital, 1-acenaphthenol, 2-cyclohexen-1-ol, testosterone, glycolithocholic acid as well as the native enzyme purified from hamster liver.
