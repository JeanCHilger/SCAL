Axillary lymph node staging in breast cancer by 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography: clinical evaluation and alternative management. Surgical removal of axillary lymph node and histologic examination for metastases are used to determine whether adjuvant treatment is necessary for patients with breast cancer. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is a costly procedure associated with various side effects, and 80% or more of patients with tumors of 20 mm or less are lymph node negative and might avoid ALND. In this study, we evaluated whether an alternative, noninvasive method--i.e., positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-- could be used to determine axillary lymph node status in patients with breast cancer.One hundred sixty-seven consecutive patients with breast cancers of 50 mm or less (range = 5-50 mm mean = 21 mm) scheduled for complete ALND were studied preoperatively with FDG-PET, and then PET and pathology results from ALND were compared. All statistical tests were two-sided.The overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of lymph node staging with PET were 94.4% (PET detected 68 of 72 patients with axillary involvement 95% confidence interval [CI] = 86.0% to 98.2%), 86.3% (82 of 95 patients without axillary involvementNoninvasive FDG-PET appears to be an accurate technique to predict axillary status in patients with breast cancer and thus to identify patients who might avoid ALND. These results should be confirmed in large multicenter studies.
