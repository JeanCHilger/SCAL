Rate of progression in Parkinson's disease: a 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa PET study. The aim of this study was to investigate the rate of progression in Parkinson's disease (PD) with 6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-dopa (FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET). We investigated 21 patients with PD and eight healthy controls. Ten of the patients were de novo at the time of the first PET scan and antiparkinsonian medication was started thereafter, with a favourable response. A FDOPA PET scan was carried out twice at an approximately 5-year interval. The regions of interest were drawn on individual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, matched with the PET images. At the first PET scan, in PD patients the mean k(i)(occ) (x 10(-3) min(-1)) in the anterior putamen was 5.6 +/- 2.7 (mean +/- S.D. 55% of the control mean) and in the posterior putamen 4.5 +/- 2.4 (45% of the control mean). The k(i)(occ) value for the caudate nucleus was 7.5 +/- 2.1 (x 10(-3) min(-1)
