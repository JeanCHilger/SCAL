The scented brain: pheromonal responses in humans. Using PET, Savic et al., in this issue of Neuron, found a sexually dimorphic neural response to two putative human pheromones. The specific regions activated combined with the pronounced sex difference depict a pheromonal-type brain response in humans. Here, we preview this finding and suggest that human pheromones exist.
