Dipyridamole stress echocardiography vs dipyridamole sestamibi scintigraphy for diagnosing coronary artery disease in left bundle-branch block. To evaluate dipyridamole stress echocardiography (DSE) for predicting coronary artery diseases (CADs) in patients with complete left bundle-branch block (LBBB).Comparison of DSE and dipyridamole sestamibi myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (sestamibi).Tertiary-care cardiac referral center.Fifty-four consecutive patients (26 men mean [+/- SD] age, 59 +/- 7 years) with complete LBBB (14 patients with left ventricular [LV] dilatation) and intermediate probability of CAD.Simultaneous single photon emission CT scan (20 mCi technetium Tc 99m stress/rest sestamibi) and echocardiography (second harmonic imaging) during a two-step (0.56 to 0.84 mg/kg) dipyridamole infusion protocol. Two sestamibi readings were performed. The first reading considered only those studies with reversible defects (sestamibi-1) to be positive. The second reading considered those studies with any defect (sestamibi-2) to be positive. CAD was defined as a >or= 50% reduction in diameter in at least one major vessel seen on coronary angiography.CAD was present in 17 patients (31.5%). The global predictive accuracy for CAD was significantly higher for DSE (87.0%) and sestamibi-1 (79.6%) than for sestamibi-2 (57.4%) [p < 0.01 vs DSE p < 0.05 vs sestamibi-1]. No significant differences in sensitivity were present, but specificity was significantly higher for DSE (94.6%) and sestamibi-1 (81.1%) than for sestamibi-2 (43.2%DSE is at least as accurate as dipyridamole sestamibi scintigraphy for predicting CAD in patients with complete LBBB and tends to be more specific in those patients with underlying LV dilatation.
