A review of the efficacy of bone scanning in prostate and breast cancer. Bone scintigraphy has provided valuable data in the assessment and management of neoplastic disease since being first described in the early 1960s. There have been many developments in imaging techniques and radiopharmaceuticals over the years allowing more reliable detection of metastatic spread to bone. Other imaging modalities are also evolving roles in the detection of metastatic spread including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). Despite this, isotope bone scans continue to have a central role in detection and surveillance of bone metastases in breast and prostate cancer. Paralleling developments in imaging there have been enormous changes in the treatment options available for cancers of the breast and prostate that have metastasised to bone. Bone specific treatments including radionuclides and bisphosphonates as well as high dose chemotherapy provide potential improvement in disease control. There is also evidence that earlier treatment of bone metastases may prolong survival. This increases the need for efficient methods of detection and monitoring of disease. In this article we discuss the efficacy of bone scintigraphy in breast and prostate cancer from the point of view of staging, systematic follow-up of asymptomatic patients, evaluation of symptomatic patients and the assessment of response to therapy.
