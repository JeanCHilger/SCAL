Community-acquired pneumonia--from medical technologist. The main causative microorganisms of Community-acquired pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Especially the causative microorganisms affecting whole body basic disease, persons of advanced age, and alcoholic patients are Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., Aspergillus spp., Pneumocystis carinii and anaerobic bacteria. Other microorganisms involved in epidemic disease, action condition (travel around hot springs etc.) and pet breeding environments are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pnumophila, Chlamydia spp., respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and adeno virus. We suggest methods of advancing the microscopic and microbiological examination and report, and quickly obtaining clinical information and extracting the clinical specimen. We also describe the inspection method for a case "Legionella pneumonia" that was discussed during this symposium.
