Brain perfusion in autism varies with age. Our subjects consisted of 14 autistic individuals and 14 controls ranging in age from 3 to 37 years. A (99m)Tc HMPAO single photon emission computed tomogram (SPECT) was used to examine blood flow variations between autistic subjects, compared to an age- and gender-matched control group. We found significant hypoperfusion in the prefrontal areas of autistic individuals as compared to normals in every case (p < 0.01). As the age of the autistic individuals increased the hypoperfusion of verbal-associated areas in the left temporal lobe and frontal areas became more evident. The findings were significant at the p < 0.001 level. The changes in perfusion over time correlated with language development and acquisition as individuals matured. We conclude that autistic individuals have a deficiency in prefrontal areas associated with word identification and language formation skills. This subsequently prevents development of true verbal fluency and development in the temporal and frontal areas associated with speech and communication.
