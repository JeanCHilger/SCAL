Dexamethasone incorporating liposomes: an in vitro study of their applicability as a slow releasing delivery system of dexamethasone from covered metallic stents. To investigate the possibility of covering PET-covered commercially available metallic stents, with liposomal dexamethasone that will act as a slow releasing drug-depot at the site of interest.Large multilamellar (MLV), sonicated (SUV) and dried reconstituted (DRV) liposomes entrapping dexamethasone were prepared by thin film hydration, sonication and the DRV method, respectively, and applied on stents using a simple evaporation technique. Drug encapsulation and retention in liposomes were measured by HPLC. The presence of liposomes on the stent surface was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, while the release of dexamethasone and lipid from the liposome-covered stent was evaluated under different conditions (flow rate, presence of plasma proteins), in an in vitro assembly that was developed to simulate in vivo conditions.The release of dexamethasone from liposome-covered stents ranged from 25% to 50% after 48 h of incubation in buffer, depending on the type of liposome. The release was highest from stents covered with DRV liposomes. When increasing the flow rate from 2 to 6 ml/min a slight increase in release of drug was observed, while a higher release was measured when stents were incubated in plasma proteins. Liposome size does not affect liposome placement on stents.The basic characteristics that should be considered when preparing liposomes to cover stents should be their drug loading capacity and their stability under the conditions prevailing at the site of interest. By preparing the appropriate formulation, it is possible that liposomal drugs may be used to cover stents and serve as drug releasing depots at the site of interest. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed in order to exploit the possible applications of this methodology.
