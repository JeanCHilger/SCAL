Electrical resection: new concept in management of focal epilepsy. Focal epilepsy secondary esp to scar or injured cortical tissue forms a source of constant depolarisation site with or without emitting negative charges (current of injury) into the surrounding area. This focal site is localised by EEG, MRI and if required, by PET and/or SPECT studies. The author postulates to implant electrical source of opposite charge overlying the focal site to nullify the constant depolarisation site (electrical resection) or short-circuit the current of injury to an inert site to alleviate focal epileptic attack. Preliminary trials in the form of scalp application of positivity have markedly improved EEG picture in terms of occurrence of epileptiform activity.
