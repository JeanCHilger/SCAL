Poor agreement between dipyridamole-stress technetium-99m-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography and two-dimensional echocardiography in Kawasaki disease. To establish a noninvasive diagnostic method for early assessment of cardiac involvement in Kawasaki disease (KD), 28 children with KD were included in this study. Two-dimensional echocardiography (2D-Echo) to detect the aneurysms of coronary arteries (CA), as well as rest and dipyridamole-stress technetium-99m tetrofosmin (Tc-TF) myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to detect abnormal myocardial perfusion were performed in all of the 28 children with KD and to compare each other. The results showed that (1). 42.9% of cases had no aneurysm and 57.1% had significant aneurysms detected by 2D-Echo (2). 42.9% of cases had normal perfusion and 57.1% of cases had abnormal myocardial perfusion assessed by Tc-TF myocardial perfusion SPECT
