Evaluation of liver tumors using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET: characterization of tumor and assessment of effect of treatment. To evaluate glucose metabolism in patients with tumors involving the liver, 35 patients with liver lesions had PET using 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). FDG (148 MBq) was injected and radioactivity of the tumor was scanned dynamically by PET. The rate constants (k1, k2, k3, k4) of FDG in a metabolic model were calculated. The results were compared to hexokinase activity in the excised tumor specimens. k3 was found to reflect tumor hexokinase activity. When k3 was used as an index (cut-off value: 0.025), it was possible to distinguish benign and malignant tumors. k4 was significantly higher in hepatocellular carcinoma. By using k3 and k4 as indices, one could assess the degree of differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma. After treatment, k3 decreased according to the effectiveness of therapy and thus may be a useful index for quantitatively assessing tumor viability.
