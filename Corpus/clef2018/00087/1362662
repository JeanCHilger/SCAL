Mode of action of the triazolobenzodiazepines in the treatment of panic attacks: a hypothesis. Alprazolam (Xanax) or 8-chloro-1-methyl-6-phenyl-4H-S-triazolobenzodiazepine is a potent drug for the treatment of anxiety disorders. The chemical structure differs from the classical benzodiazepines by incorporation of the triazoloring. Due to the triazolo ring, the drug can have additional modes of action than the normal benzodiazepines. The triazolobenzodiazepines are potent inhibitors of the platelet-activating factor. This factor is a potent stimulator of the corticotropin-releasing hormone. This hormone has an effect on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis but the corticotropin-releasing hormone is also known to be a stimulator of the locus coeruleus. The corticotropin-releasing hormone in patients with panic attacks is elevated. This could be a result of the hyperactive metabolism which is observed by positron emission tomographic (PET) studies of the right parahippocampal area.
