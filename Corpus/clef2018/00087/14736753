Subthalamic nucleus stimulation and dysarthria in Parkinson's disease: a PET study. In Parkinson's disease, functional imaging studies during limb motor tasks reveal cerebral activation abnormalities that can be reversed by subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation. The effect of STN stimulation on parkinsonian dysarthria has not, however, been investigated using PET. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of STN stimulation on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during speech production and silent articulation in patients with Parkinson's disease. Ten Parkinson's disease patients surgically implanted bilaterally in the STN and with significant improvement of their dysarthria induced by STN stimulation were included. Ten healthy control subjects also participated in this study. Control subjects performed six sessions of [15O]H2O-PET scanning corresponding to three duplicated conditions externally cued by an auditory signal. The conditions were: (i) rest (ii) production of a short, simple sentence
