Visualization of extrastriatal dopamine D2 receptors in the human brain. [123I]Epidepride, a potent and selective dopamine D2 radioligand, was administered to a 27 year old normal male volunteer. Single photon tomography revealed that peak striatal uptake occurred at 4 h after injection with a striatal:cerebellar ratio of 7.8 rising to over 100 at 18 h post injection. Uptake above the levels seen in cerebellum was also noted in the thalamus, pituitary, hypothalamus and temporal lobe, particularly medially. Single photon tomography with [123I]epidepride allows visualization of extrastriatal dopamine D2 receptors in man.
