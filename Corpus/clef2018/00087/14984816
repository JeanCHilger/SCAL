Regional cerebral hypoperfusion in patients with celiac disease. Neurological and psychiatric disorders occur in approximately 10% of patients with celiac disease. Although some of these alterations respond to a gluten-free diet, the etiology of these abnormalities is uncertain. Because of a case report that cerebral hypoperfusion in a celiac patient resolved after a gluten-free diet, we studied brain perfusion changes in untreated celiac patients, treated celiac patients, and healthy controls.A total of 15 untreated celiac patients without conditions affecting brain perfusion were enrolled none had neurological or psychiatric disorders other than anxiety or depression. We also studied 15 celiac patients who were on a gluten-free diet for almost 1 year, and 24 healthy volunteers of similar sex and age. All subjects underwent cerebral single photon emission computed tomography examination.Of the 15 untreated celiac patients, 11 (73%) had at least one hypoperfused brain region, compared with only 1 (7%) of the 15 celiac patients on a gluten-free diet and none of the controls (P = 0.01). Cerebral perfusion was significantly lower (P <0.05) in untreated celiac patients, compared with healthy controls, in 7 of 26 brain regions. No significant differences in cerebral perfusion were found between celiac patients on a gluten-free diet and healthy controls.There is evidence of regional cerebral blood flow alteration in untreated celiac patients.
