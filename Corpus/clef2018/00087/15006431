Once-daily high-dose pindolol for SSRI-refractory depression. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) augmentation with the 5-HT1A antagonist pindolol has met with mixed results. Recent studies using positron emission tomography (PET) suggest that pindolol doses used in these studies were too low to effect 5-HT1A autoreceptor blockade. To test the hypothesis that a single higher dose of pindolol would effectively augment antidepressant responses in SSRI-refractory patients, nine subjects with major depression unresponsive to paroxetine 40 mg/day given for 2 months or more were randomized to AM pindolol 7.5 mg (n=4) or placebo (n=5). Subjects were administered the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), the Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale, and the Zung Depression Inventory at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4. Subjects receiving pindolol exhibited significant improvements in all ratings beginning at week 2 which continued through week 4. Aside from transient dizziness and a five-point decrease in systolic/diastolic blood pressure associated with pindolol, no adverse effects were reported. Although results must be verified in a larger sample, these findings support previous studies indicating that pindolol can accelerate antidepressant responses during SSRI therapy. In addition, results reported here suggest that a single high dose of pindolol (7.5 mg) is a more effective augmentation strategy in SSRI-refractory patients compared with the same total dose given at 2.5 mg tid.
