Indium-111 antimyosin antibody imaging: a promising new technique in the diagnosis of M.I. Extensive clinical research has demonstrated that the administration of indium-111 antimyosin antibodies is useful in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. It is specific for acute myocardial necrosis, as opposed to ischemia or chronic infarction, and therefore identifies patients who have had an acute MI. It is most useful in patients whose ECGs are indeterminate for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (eg, left bundle branch block or permanent pacemaker) or those with inconclusive CK or CK-MB. Diagnostic accuracy and safety of antimyosin imaging has been established. This new cardiac imaging agent holds great potential for future clinical use in the diagnosis and management of patients with known or suspected acute myocardial infarction. Presuming FDA approval, the critical care nurse will see antimyosin used as an innovative and viable alternative in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. Critical care nurses need to continually increase their knowledge of technologic advances and clinical applications for their own professional development, as well as to provide accurate information to patients and their families. In the area of nuclear cardiology, this includes antimyosin imaging and other state-of-the-art imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and computed tomography.
