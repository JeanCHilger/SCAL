Functional changes after partial left ventriculectomy and mitral valve repair assessed by gated perfusion SPECT. A myocardial remodeling in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) after partial left ventriculectomy (PLV) has been previously discussed. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional changes in the follow-up of patients with DCM undergoing PLV using electrocardiographically triggered perfusion SPECT (gated SPECT).Twelve DCM patients (10 men, 2 women 56 +/- 9 y [mean +/- SD]), after successful PLV and mitral valve repair (PLV-MVR), were monitored by gated SPECT and echocardiography. Gated SPECT quantified end-diastolic volumes (EDV), end-systolic volumes (ESV), myocardial and scar volumes, as well as ejection fraction (EF) preoperatively, early (38 +/- 28 d), and late (296 +/- 130 d) after PLV-MVR.EDV and ESV showed an immediate reduction after PLV-MVR (EDV from 542 +/- 90 mL to 350 +/- 81 mL, P < 0.001 ESV from 452 +/- 91 mL to 254 +/- 79 mL, P < 0.001) with no significant change in the late follow-up (EDV late, 316 +/- 63 mLIn this highly selected DCM patient group, gated perfusion SPECT assessed early responses in volumes and EF after PLV-MVR. However, although statistically nonsignificant in the small patient group, ESV and EDV were further decreased, whereas EF improved toward 1 y, coinciding with the improvement of clinical symptoms (New York Heart Association), potentially indicating a functional remodeling after PLV-MVR. Further studies in larger patient cohorts and longer follow-up are warranted.
