The effect of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia on postischemic left ventricular diastolic filling. To determine whether exercise-induced ischemia impairs left ventricular diastolic filling in the postischemic period in humans, 101 men (mean age 57 +/- 10 years) were studied before and 2 h after a symptom-limited thallium-201 tomographic treadmill with pulsed Doppler echocardiography of mitral valve inflow. In the postischemic period 2 h after exercise, diastolic filling was significantly impaired in the ischemia group (reversible thallium defect n = 24) as reflected by a decrease in the peak early filling velocity (44.5 +/- 10.1 to 39.9 +/- 9.9 cm/s, p less than 0.01), peak early to atrial filling velocity ratio (0.91 +/- 0.27 to 0.76 +/- 0.25, p less than 0.001), and deceleration rate of early filling (281 +/- 104 to 245 +/- 86 cm/s2, p less than 0.01). Similar alterations in the postischemic period occurred in the myocardial infarction-ischemia group (partially reversible defect
