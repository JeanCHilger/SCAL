An integrative approach to gain insights into the cellular function of human ataxin-2. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by a trinucleotide expansion in the SCA2 gene, encoding a polyglutamine stretch in the gene product ataxin-2 (ATX2), whose cellular function is unknown. However, ATX2 interacts with A2BP1, a protein containing an RNA-recognition motif, and the existence of an interaction motif for the C-terminal domain of the poly(A)-binding protein (PABC) as well as an Lsm (Like Sm) domain in ATX2 suggest that ATX2 like its yeast homolog Pbp1 might be involved in RNA metabolism. Here, we show that, similar to Pbp1, ATX2 suppresses the petite (pet-) phenotype of Deltamrs2 yeast strains lacking mitochondrial group II introns. This finding points to a close functional relationship between the two homologs. To gain insight into potential functions of ATX2, we also generated a comprehensive protein interaction network for Pbp1 from publicly available databases, which implicates Pbp1 in diverse RNA-processing pathways. The functional relationship of ATX2 and Pbp1 is further corroborated by the experimental confirmation of the predicted interaction of ATX2 with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP) using yeast-2-hybrid analysis as well as co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that ATX2 and PABP co-localize in mammalian cells, remarkably, even under conditions in which PABP accumulates in distinct cytoplasmic foci representing sites of mRNA triage.
