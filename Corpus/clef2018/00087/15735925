Evaluation of 11C-methionine PET as a surrogate endpoint after treatment of grade 2 gliomas. The aim of the present study was to assess the usefulness of positron emission tomography (PET) as a surrogate endpoint by analysing the uptake variability of 11C-methionine (MET) in follow-up scans.A total of 96 PET MET scans were re-evaluated in 32 patients with histologically confirmed supratentorial grade 2 gliomas. In untreated patients, all follow-up PET scans showed an increased tumour volume after median 68 weeks, but only 46% of cases had an increased hot spot uptake. An improved outcome was observed in patients with stable hot spot uptake per se (P = 0.07) and in combinations with minor increase in tumour volume (P = 0.02). After conventional therapy, 52% of PET scans showed a reduced hot spot uptake the first year and 43% were reduced after more than a year. Successful MET decline after therapy did not correlate with outcome. PET MET may be a promising surrogate endpoint after treatment of grade 2 gliomas. Evaluation of both hot spot activity and uptake volume on PET may strengthen the association with clinical outcome.
