Low cerebellar metabolism in medicated patients with chronic schizophrenia. Because of the frequent association of cerebellar structural defects with schizophrenia, the authors reanalyzed the metabolic brain images of patients with chronic schizophrenia to assess if they had abnormalities in cerebellar metabolism. They used carbon-11-2-deoxyglucose and positron emission tomography to study 18 medicated patients with chronic schizophrenia and 12 normal comparison subjects. Patients with schizophrenia showed significantly lower absolute and relative metabolism in the cerebellum than normal subjects.
