PET/CT imaging of conus medullaris metastasis from lung cancer. An intradural extramedullary metastasis is usually detected at an advanced stage of the disease or during workup for manifestations of spinal cord compression. Early diagnosis of such a lesion is rare and mostly fortuitous. The authors present a case of treated nonsmall cell lung carcinoma with an asymptomatic conus medullaris metastasis, which was demonstrated by PET/CT imaging during restaging evaluation.
