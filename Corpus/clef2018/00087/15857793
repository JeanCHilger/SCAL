What is the best approach to diagnosing large-vessel vasculitis? Temporal arteritis, including large-vessel giant cell arteritis, and Takayasu's arteritis are the two primary large-vessel vasculitides. Patients with temporal arteritis often present with headache, swollen temporal arteries, impairment of vision or symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica. Clinical examination includes palpation of the temporal arteries and radial pulses, auscultation of the subclavian and axillary region, and fundoscopy. The presence of jaw claudication, diplopia and temporal artery abnormalities correlates with a high probability of positive histology. Duplex ultrasonography of the temporal arteries delineates a characteristic hypoechoic, oedematous wall swelling, stenoses and occlusions. It detects the same pathologies in the axillary arteries and other arteries in large-vessel giant cell arteritis. Angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, electron beam computed tomography, computed tomography angiography and positron emission tomography show characteristic changes in the aorta and its primary branches in large-vessel giant cell arteritis and Takayasu's arteritis. Takayasu's arteritis often begins with diffuse symptoms such as low-grade fever, arthralgia, fatigue and weight loss. Clinical examination is important to detect bruits, pulse reduction and blood pressure differences. Profound experience exists with angiography. Other imaging methods are interesting alternatives as they are less invasive and may depict the inflammatory wall swelling.
