Synthesis and C-11 labeling of three potent norepinephrine transporter selective ligands ((R)-nisoxetine, lortalamine, and oxaprotiline) for comparative PET studies in baboons. Three potent antidepressants, (R)-nisoxetine, lortalamine, and oxaprotiline, with high affinity and high selectivity for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) were synthesized and radiolabeled with C-11 via [11C]methylation. The reference compounds and their corresponding normethyl precursors were synthesized via multi-step synthetic approaches. The radiochemical syntheses were performed by simple alkylation of the corresponding normethyl precursors with no-carrier-added [11C]CH3I in DMF. After HPLC purification, (R)-[N-11CH3]nisoxetine, [11C]lortalamine, and [11C]oxaprotiline were obtained in 63-97% radiochemical yields, whereas (R)-[O-11CH3]nisoxetine was obtained in 23-29% radiochemical yields due to substantial formation of the undesired N-[11C]methylated byproduct (64-70%). These C-11 labeled tracers allowed us to carry out comparative studies of NET in baboons with positron emission tomography (PET) and evaluate their potential as PET tracers for imaging brain NET.
