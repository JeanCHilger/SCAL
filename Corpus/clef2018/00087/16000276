Sympathetic denervation and reinnervation after the maze procedure. We evaluated serial changes in cardiac sympathetic nerve distribution using 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) after the Maze procedure. The Maze procedure, in which multiple incisions are made in the atrium, has been concomitantly performed with mitral valve (MV) surgery in an attempt to eliminate atrial fibrillation (AF). Although attenuation of the sinoatrial node response to exercise and a reduction of left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]) in early stages after the Maze procedure have been suggested, factors leading to these changes have not been clarified.Thirteen patients with MV disease were enrolled in this study. Six of them had undergone MV surgery and the Maze procedure (Maze+), and 7 had undergone MV surgery without the Maze procedure (Maze-). All patients underwent cardiac 123I-MIBG imaging preoperatively and 10 d and 1 y after surgery to assess 123I-MIBG uptake (heart-to-mediastinum count ratio of early planar images [H/M]) and the washout rate (WR). Radionuclide ventriculography was also performed to calculate LVEF 3 d after each 123I-MIBG imaging.The LVEF of the Maze+ group significantly decreased 10 d after surgery (44.2 +/- 4.8 mean +/- SD) compared with that before surgery (60.3 +/- 6.9Cardiac sympathetic nerves were denervated at early stage and reinnervated at late stage after the Maze procedure. Such adrenergic nerve changes may be correlated, at least in part, with changes in left ventricular function after this procedure.
