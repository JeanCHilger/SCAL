Clinical applications of molecular imaging in sarcoma evaluation. A wide range of molecular imaging techniques are available that can provide complementary information to conventional, anatomical imaging for the evaluation of known or suspected bone and soft tissue sarcomas. In particular, positron emission tomography (PET), particularly in the form of hybrid PET/CT technology, offers many potential advantages over current imaging approaches by delineating not only the extent of disease but also the biological heterogeneity that can exist both between and within sarcomas. This review discusses the clinical situations where nuclear medicine techniques can aid in the management of patients with sarcoma. These include biopsy guidance, whole body staging, therapeutic response assessment and evaluation of residual mass lesions after treatment.
