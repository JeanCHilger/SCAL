Analysis of thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography after intravenous dipyridamole using different quantitative measures of coronary stenosis severity and receiver operator characteristic curves. The presence of significant coronary artery disease in individual vessels was assessed using thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) after intravenous dipyridamole. Coronary angiograms were analyzed using quantitative computer-assisted techniques in 81 men patients. Eleven men with a less than 3% probability of coronary artery disease were used as a control population. Three definitions of a hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis were studied independently: (1) a greater than 50% luminal diameter narrowing (2) an absolute cross-sectional area less than or equal to 2.0 mm2
