Cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in the Rett syndrome. Positron emission tomography (PET) was performed on six patients with the Rett syndrome and the results were compared with the concurrent clinical status of the patients. The cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) was low in five patients, and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) was low in four patients both had a tendency to decline with advancing age. Although the cause is unknown, it is suggested that impaired oxidative metabolism exists in the Rett syndrome. An analysis of the distribution among brain regions showed that the ratios of values for the frontal cortex to those for the temporal cortex for both the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CMRO2 were lower than those for the controls, which may indicate the loss of hyperfrontality in the Rett syndrome. Distribution of brain metabolism may be immature in the Rett syndrome.
