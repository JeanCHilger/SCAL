Brain perfusion disturbances in patients with vertigo -- a study with SPECT. The aim of our study was to evaluate brain perfusion in patients with vertigo using the SPECT technique.The study involved a group of 32 patients and was performed in the Neurological Department of the Medical University in Bialystok. Patients with vertigo of peripheral origin like middle ear pathology were excluded from the study. Tomographic pictures were taken with Nucline X-Ring camera after administration of Tc99m-ECD. Perfusion maps were estimated by qualitative and semi-quantitative methods.In 8 patients (25%) perfusion maps were normal in the hemispheres, cerebellum and subcortical structures. In 10 patients (31.2%) there was a substantial decrease in perfusion in the left temporal region, in 8 patients (25%) -- hypoperfusion was seen in the right temporal region. In 4 patients (12.5%) there was a substantial decrease in perfusion in the cerebellum, in two persons -- in the frontal lobes.The results obtained so far confirm the major role of ischemia in etiology of the central origin vertigo and balance disturbances. It involves not only the brainstem and cerebellar structures, but the temporal lobes as well. The test has also proved that the qualitative and semi-quantitative methods of assessing brain perfusion with a SPECT are satisfactory in diagnostics of vertigo.
