Evaluation of carbon-11-labeled 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-[4'-((Z)-2-iodoethenyl)phenyl]nortropane as a potential radioligand for imaging the serotonin transporter by PET. The nortropane cocaine analogue, 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-[4'-((Z)-2-iodoethenyl)phenyl]nortropane (ZIENT), is a high affinity, selective serotonin transporter (SERT) ligand that has shown promise as a SERT imaging agent for single photon computed tomography (SPECT) when labeled with I-123. Synthesis of the labeling precursor, radiosynthesis of [(11)C]ZIENT, and in vivo evaluation in anesthetized and awake monkeys have been performed to determine the suitability of [(11)C]ZIENT as a PET agent for SERT imaging.
