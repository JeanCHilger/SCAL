Prognostic value of normal exercise 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial tomography in patients with angiographic coronary artery disease. Previous studies have documented the prognostic value of normal exercise Tl myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD). However, data on exercise Tc-sestamibi myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are scant. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of normal exercise Tc-sestamibi SPECT in patients with angiographic CAD.We retrospectively investigated 90 consecutive patients who had a normal exercise Tc-sestamibi myocardial SPECT but angiographic CAD. A group of 69 consecutive patients with both normal exercise Tc-sestamibi myocardial SPECT and coronary arteries were included as control.During a mean follow-up of 50+/-19 months, a total of three hard cardiac events (non-fatal myocardial infarction) and seven soft cardiac events (late revascularization) were observed. The annual hard cardiac event rate between the two groups was not significantly different (0.6% vs. 0.3%, chi=0.47, P=NS), nevertheless the annual soft cardiac event rate was higher in patients with angiographic CAD (1.9% vs. 0, chi=5.74, P=0.02). Moreover, the annual hard cardiac events rate in patients with angiographic CAD who were treated medically was also not significantly different from that of the control group (0.8% vs. 0.3%, chi=0.77, P=NS). Among patients with angiographic CAD, the annual hard cardiac event rate was not statistically different between those treated medically and those who underwent revascularization (0.8% vs. 0, chi=0.53, P=NS).Our data demonstrate that normal exercise Tc-sestamibi myocardial SPECT despite angiographic CAD suggests a low rate of cardiac death or non-fatal myocardial infarction but a relatively high rate of late revascularization during an intermediate term of follow-up.
