PET studies in the primate brain and biodistribution in mice using (-)-5'-18F-delta 8-THC. Cannabinoids, the active constituents of marijuana, are known to have many therapeutic properties however, their exact mechanism of action is not well understood. In an effort to obtain more information concerning the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of psychoactive THC analogs we synthesized (-)-18F-delta 8-THC and studied its biodistribution in mice and baboon brains. The analog was obtained by nucleophilic fluorination of the ditriflate ester of (-)-5'-OH-delta 8-THC with K18F/Kryptofix followed by deprotection with LiAIH4 and purification with HPLC in 8% yield in a 90-min synthesis from EOB. The uptake of (-)-5'-18F-delta 8-THC in mouse tissue was high at 5 min, but radioactivity declined rapidly in almost all the tissues studied. Following IV administration, (-)-5'-18F-delta 8-THC uptake in baboon brain was similar in the basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebellum, and the clearance from these regions was relatively rapid. Also, a study from baboon plasma clearance of (-)-5'-18F-delta 8-THC showed rapid metabolism of the analog.
