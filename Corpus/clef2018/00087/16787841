The putative neuroprotective role of dopamine agonists in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is probably caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, which trigger a cascade of events that lead to the cell death of the dopamine-containing neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. These processes include oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity with excess of nitric oxide formation, glial and inflammatory abnormalities and apoptosis. Dopamine agonists are chemical compounds that act directly on the dopamine receptors without any previous enzymatic biotransformation. Besides their symptomatic antiparkinsonian effect, these drugs may have neuroprotective properties in Parkinson's disease through different possible mechanisms: (a) stimulation of dopamine auoreceptors, reducing thereby dopamine turnover (b) direct antioxidant effects
