In vivo biological activity of the histone deacetylase inhibitor LAQ824 is detectable with 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine positron emission tomography. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) are emerging as growth inhibitory compounds that modulate gene expression and inhibit tumor cell proliferation. We assessed whether 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine-positron emission tomography ([18F]FLT-PET) could be used to noninvasively measure the biological activity of a novel HDACI LAQ824 in vivo. We initially showed that thymidine kinase 1 (TK1 EC2.7.1.21), the enzyme responsible for [18F]FLT retention in cells, was regulated by LAQ824 in a drug concentration-dependent manner in vitro. In HCT116 colon carcinoma xenograft-bearing mice, LAQ824 significantly decreased tumor [18F]FLT uptake in a dose-dependent manner. At day 4 of treatment, [18F]FLT tumor-to-heart ratios at 60 minutes (NUV60) were 2.16 +/- 0.15, 1.86 +/- 0.13, and 1.45 +/- 0.20 in vehicle, and 5 and 25 mg/kg LAQ824 treatment groups, respectively (P < or = 0.05). LAQ825 at 5 mg/kg also significantly reduced both TK1 levels and [18F]FLT uptake at day 10 but not at day 2 (P < or = 0.05). [18F]FLT NUV60 correlated significantly with cellular proliferation (r = 0.68
