Effect of a cannabinoid agonist on gastrointestinal transit and postprandial satiation in healthy human subjects: a randomized, placebo-controlled study. Cannabinoid receptor (CBR) stimulation inhibits motility and increases food intake in rodents. Effects of CBR stimulation in human gastrointestinal (GI) tract are unclear. We compared effects of dronabinol (DRO) and placebo (PLA) on GI transit, gastric volume and satiation in humans. In a double-blind, randomized study, 30 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to DRO 5 mg b.i.d. or PLA for three doses. We measured GI functions noninvasively: day 0, Ensure satiation test to measure maximum tolerated volume (MTV) and 30-min post-Ensure symptoms day 1, scintigraphic transit ((111)In-egg meal) and fasting and postprandial gastric volume ((99Tcm)-SPECT)
