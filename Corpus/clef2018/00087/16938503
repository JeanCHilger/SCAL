Neuroimaging in psychiatry: An update. The introduction of neuroimaging techniques in the 1960s has revolutionized the study of the biology of psychiatric disorders with implications for psychiatric practice. These comprise structural (computerized axial tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) and functional (including neurochemical/neuropharmacological techniques such as single-photon emission computerized tomography, positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy) techniques. As a result, we now have a better understanding of the morbid anatomy, pathophysiology, and chemical pathology of organic brain disease, schizophrenia, addictions, and affective disorders. This selective review will focus on recent advances in the use and application of neuroimaging techniques in the study of addictions, schizophrenia, and depression. Reference will be made to studies conducted in the United Arab Emirates on Arab patients with depression, schizophrenia, and alcohol dependence. The refinement of these techniques and their application in the study of psychiatric disorders will redefine these disorders, promising their deconstruction and the development of novel and more specific treatments.
