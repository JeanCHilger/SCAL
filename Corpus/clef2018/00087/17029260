Hypoperfusion of the auditory and prefrontal cortices in Parkinsonian patients with verbal hallucinations. We examined patients with and without auditory hallucinations, using n-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine single photon emission computed tomographic imaging. We assessed verbal hallucinations in the present study: patients with nonverbal auditory hallucinations were excluded. A total of 11 patients with verbal and visual hallucinations and 17 patients with visual hallucinations only were enrolled. Patients with both verbal and visual hallucinations revealed significant hypoperfusion in the bilateral prefrontal cortex and right superior temporal gyrus compared to patients with visual hallucinations only. There were no significant hyperperfusion in patients with verbal plus visual hallucinations. These results may support the release hallucination theory in verbal hallucinations of Parkinson's disease, although another explanations may be more appropriate and further studies are required.
