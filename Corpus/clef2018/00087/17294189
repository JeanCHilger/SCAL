Myocardial pre-synaptic sympathetic function correlates with glucose uptake in the failing human heart. We have previously shown that the myocardium of patients with heart failure (HF) is insulin resistant. Chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation has been implicated in insulin resistance in cultured cardiomyocytes in vitro, where sustained noradrenaline stimulation inhibited insulin-modulated glucose uptake. As the failing heart is characterized by increased sympathetic drive, we hypothesized that there is a correlation between pre-synaptic sympathetic function and insulin sensitivity in the myocardium of patients with HF.Eight patients (aged 67 +/- 7 years) with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 44 +/- 10%) underwent function and viability assessment with cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Myocardial glucose utilization (MGU) was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Pre-synaptic noradrenaline re-uptake was measured by calculating [(11)C]meta-hydroxy-ephedrine (HED) volume of distribution (V (d)) with PET. Two groups of healthy volunteers served as controls for the FDG (n = 8, aged 52 +/- 4 years, p < 0.01 vs patients) and HED (n = 8, aged 40 +/- 6 years, p < 0.01 vs patients) data.MGU in patients was reduced in both normal remote (0.44 +/- 0.14 micromol.min(-1).g(-1)) and dysfunctional (0.49 +/- 0.14 micromol.min(-1).g(-1)) segments compared with controls (0.61 +/- 0.7 micromol.min(-1).g(-1) p < 0.001 vs both). HED V (d) was reduced in dysfunctional segments of patients (38.9 +/- 21.2 ml.g(-1)) compared with normal segments (52.2 +/- 19.6 ml.g(-1)) and compared with controls (62.7 +/- 11.3 ml.g(-1)). In patients, regional MGU was correlated with HED V (d).The results of this study provide novel evidence of a correlation between cardiac sympathetic function and insulin sensitivity, which may represent one of the mechanisms contributing to insulin resistance in failing human hearts.
