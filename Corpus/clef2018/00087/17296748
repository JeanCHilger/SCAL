Pet, a non-AB toxin, is transported and translocated into epithelial cells by a retrograde trafficking pathway. The plasmid-encoded toxin (Pet) of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli is a 104-kDa autotransporter protein that exhibits proteolytic activity against the actin-binding protein alpha-fodrin. Intracellular cleavage of epithelial fodrin by Pet disrupts the actin cytoskeleton, causing both cytotoxic and enterotoxic effects. Intoxication requires the serine protease activity of Pet and toxin endocytosis from clathrin-coated pits. The additional events in the intracellular trafficking of Pet are largely uncharacterized. Here, we determined by confocal microscopy that internalized Pet is transferred from the early endosomes to the Golgi apparatus and then travels to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Pet associates with the Sec61p translocon before it moves into the cytosol as an intact, 104-kDa protein. This translocation process contrasts with the export of other ER-translocating toxins, in which only the catalytic A subunit of the AB toxin enters the cytosol. However, like intoxication with these AB toxins, Pet intoxication was inhibited in a subset of mutant CHO cell lines with aberrant activity in the ER-associated degradation pathway of ER-to-cytosol translocation. This is the first report which documents the cell surface-to-ER and ER-to-cytosol trafficking of a bacterial non-AB toxin.
