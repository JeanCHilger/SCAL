Indoor environmental influences on children's asthma. The burden of asthma for children in the United States is substantial and has continued to rise for the past 2 decades. There is growing evidence that the indoor environment may play an important role in the pathogenesis of childhood asthma. This article first reviews the effects of indoor allergen exposure and sensitization on asthma incidence and morbidity, focusing on dust mite, cockroach, pet, and rodent allergens. It then addresses the effects of indoor air pollutants (ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, environmental tobacco smoke, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide) on asthma morbidity.
