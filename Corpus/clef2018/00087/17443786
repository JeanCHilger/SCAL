Hypothalamus region-specific global gene expression profiling in early stages of central endocrine disruption in rat neonates injected with estradiol benzoate or flutamide. To identify genes linked to early stages of disruption of brain sexual differentiation, hypothalamic region-specific microarray analyses were performed using a microdissection technique with neonatal rats exposed to endocrine-acting drugs. To validate the methodology, the expression fidelity of microarrays was first examined with two-round amplified antisense RNAs (aRNAs) from methacarn-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (PET) in comparison with expression in unfixed frozen tissue (UFT). Decline of expression fidelity when compared with the 1x-amplified aRNAs from UFTs was found as a result of the preferential amplification of the 3' side of mRNAs in the second round in vitro transcription. However, expression patterns for the 2x-amplified aRNAs were mostly identical between methacarn-fixed PET and UFT, suggesting no obvious influence of methacarn fixation and subsequent paraffin embedding on expression levels. Next, in the main experiment, neonatal rats at birth were treated subcutaneously either with estradiol benzoate (EB 10 microg/pup) or flutamide (FA
