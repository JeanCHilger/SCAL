Peritoneal transport kinetics of glucose, urea, and creatinine during infancy and childhood. Peritoneal handling of glucose and metabolites is reported to be higher in young children treated with CAPD than in older children. Reference curves for the standardized peritoneal equilibration test (PET) are not available for younger ages. The present study describes the results of the PET in 19 children (mean age 5.0 years, ranging from 0.3-15) during the first month of CAPD treatment. No age dependency for the handling of glucose, urea, and creatinine could be established when the group was subdivided into 1. children below the age of 3 years, and 2. children above that age. There was, however, a significant correlation between equilibration of creatinine and age, indicating more rapid equilibration at younger ages.
