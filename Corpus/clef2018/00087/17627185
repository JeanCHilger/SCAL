Ischemia in women with angina and normal coronary angiograms. Coronary artery disease is frequent in postmenopausal women. Myocardial ischemia has been induced with stress testing, and a relationship between endothelial dysfunction and perfusion defects has been reported.To evaluate whether myocardial ischemia can be evidenced both by perfusion and function abnormalities using gated single-photon emission computed-tomography myocardial scintigraphy with technetium-labeled compounds in women with typical angina, normal coronary angiography, and endothelial dysfunction.Fifty-nine postmenopausal patients were studied. Each underwent technetium-99m methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile myocardial scintigraphy (protocol: exercise stress-rest), brachial artery endothelial function measured by ultrasonography, lipidogram, and 24-h ambulatory ECG recording (Holter). Twenty-one patients (group I) showed perfusion defects in myocardial scintigraphy, whereas the other 38 patients (group II) did not. Group I patients exhibited endothelial dysfunction more frequently (57 vs. 29%) than those of group II. Among group I patients, 12 showed a reversible perfusion defect that, in 75% of the cases, was associated with poststress left ventricular ejection fraction reduction greater than 5% and a regional hypokinesis. Nine patients had fixed defects, which in 56% of the cases were associated with poststress left ventricular ejection fraction reduction greater than 5%. Left ventricular ejection fraction poststress minus left ventricular ejection fraction at rest was -5.2% in group I patients versus -1.8% in group II (P<0.001). Three patients in group I showed evidence of ischemia by Holter compared with four in group II.Stress-induced ischemia is associated with poststress left ventricular ejection fraction reduction in postmenopausal women with typical angina, normal coronary angiography, and a trend toward abnormal endothelial-mediated vasodilation.
