Evaluation of the status of cardiac perfusion after implantation of extra-cardiac conduits. The work discusses the findings of experimental study of perfusion of the myocardium after creation of a peculiar "new" outflow tract from the left ventricle of the heart. As a result, perfusion of a heart with an unnatural outflow tract from the left ventricle was found to be satisfactory. The authenticity of the results was determined by means of two, complementing each other, radioisotope methods--standard study with the use of 201Tl and a new method for producing a positron-emission image. It is concluded that the supply of blood to the myocardium after implantation of an ++apico-aortic conduit is sufficiently effective.
