Synthesis of [125I]iodoclorgyline, a selective monoamine oxidase A inhibitor, and its biodistribution in mice. A new radioiodinated monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) specific inhibitor, [125I]iodoclorgyline, was synthesized from its tin precursor by iododestannylation reaction using sodium [125I]iodide and hydrogen peroxide with high yield and site specificity. The product possessed a high radiochemical purity as well as high specific activity. The method can be readily applicable for labeling with 123I, a very suitable radioisotope for in vivo imaging with single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT). Biodistribution studies of the [125I]iodoclorgyline in mice showed high initial uptake in the brain, and brain radioactivity reached a constant level at 60 min after intravenous injection. The results suggested that [125I]iodoclorgyline might have potential as a radiopharmaceutical for MAO-A studies in the brain with SPECT.
