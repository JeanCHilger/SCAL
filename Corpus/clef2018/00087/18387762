Where there is no PET/CT. Technology assessment should touch upon four areas utility, target population, cost and alternatives. Hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) is a promising modality for oncologic imaging. However, reservations about its accessibility and affordability prevail. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an alternative with certain key advantages that can potentially prove equivalent if not better than PET/CT. We have highlighted the value of comparative studies between PET/CT and whole body MRI. Diffusion Weighted sequences may aid in better diagnosis of malignancies on MRI. The 'Eye of Medicine' should not have a restricted vision even where there is no PET/CT.
