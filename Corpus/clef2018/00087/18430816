Neuroimaging of tuberous sclerosis: spectrum of pathologic findings and frontiers in imaging. The purpose of this article is to present neuroimaging findings in tuberous sclerosis complex, including recently developed imaging techniques that have demonstrated clinical benefit to this patient population.Neuroimaging advances have improved the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex and the treatment of children with this condition. Superimposition of functional information from PET onto MRI allows accurate and noninvasive identification of epileptogenic tubers, improving surgical cure rates. Magnetic source imaging can also be used to localize epileptiform activity arising from tubers.
