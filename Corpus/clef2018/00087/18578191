Positron emission tomography in breast cancer. PET18FDG is an imaging diagnostic technique that shows changes in glycolitic metabolism that appear at a very early phases in the tumoral process. The main limitation of PET in breast cancer is the detection of small tumor lesions and axillary micrometastases. However it offers important information in the staging of high risk patients, in clinical relapse or in therapeutic evaluation. The new PET-CT devices offer advantages over conventional techniques. It provides a greater precision in the localization of tumoral foci. In spite of current difficulties for clinical applications, fluoro-estradiol (18F-ES) offers the possibilty of studying the presence of estrogenic receptors both in the primary and in the metastases. It may prove to be a useful tool to obtain information about therapeutic management and prognosis of breast cancer.
