Diagnosis of cerebrovascular disorders using nuclear magnetic resonance tomography. Regarding cerebrovascular diseases magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides informations which could not be obtained before by any other imaging method. MRI permits an early detection of ischemic infarctions, exact delineation of lesions near to skull base, and microangiopathy. Further diagnosis of arteriovenous malformations and venous thromboses can be done without using contrast media. Exclusion of acute hemorrhage or subarachnoidal hemorrhage is still a domain of computed tomography (CT). Other MR methods, like magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are expected to replace angiography and positron emission tomography (PET) in the near future, at least for some purposes.
