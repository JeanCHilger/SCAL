Reperfusion ventricular arrhythmia 'bursts' predict larger infarct size despite TIMI 3 flow restoration with primary angioplasty for anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Aims Successful epicardial reperfusion with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) can paradoxically evoke myocardial reperfusion injury, which may be signalled by temporally associated ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). We correlated reperfusion VA 'bursts' with final infarct size (IS) in patients with restored TIMI 3 flow following PCI for anterior STEMI. Methods and results All 128 anterior STEMI patients with final TIMI 3 flow had continuous 24 h digital 12-lead ECG with simultaneous Holter recording initiated prior to PCI, and Day 7/discharge SPECT imaging IS assessment. Angiography, SPECT imaging, continuous ST recovery, and quantitative rhythm analyses were performed. Reperfusion VA bursts were defined against patient-specific background VA rates and timed as concomitant with or following first angiographic TIMI 3 flow restoration associated with > or =50% stable ST recovery they were then correlated with IS and global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at Day 7/discharge. Bursts occurred in 81/128 (63%) patients and were significantly correlated with larger IS and worse LVEF (median: 21.0 vs. 10.0%, P < 0.001
