One-year follow-up of myocardial perfusion and function evaluated by gated SPECT MIBI in patients with earlier myocardial infarction and chronic total occlusion. Optimal treatment for chronic total occlusion (CTO) in the infarct-related coronary artery is not clear. Our aim was to assess myocardial perfusion, left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), and left ventricular size using gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging with 99mTc-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile in patients with CTO before and 1 year after recanalization.Thirty patients with earlier myocardial infarction and at least one CTO underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as nitrate-enhanced gated SPECT myocardial perfusion and dobutamine stress echocardiography before and 11 +/- 1 months after recanalization. They were divided into three groups based on the outcome of the follow-up angiography: (i) successful recanalization with no evidence of in-stent restenosis (n=13) (ii) successful recanalization with in-stent restenosis (n=7) and (iii) unsuccessful recanalization (n=10).Overall success of recanalization for CTO was 74%. In group 1, myocardial viability was preserved in 11 of 13 (85%) patients at baseline. Gated SPECT at 1 year showed a significant decrease in perfusion abnormalities (29 +/- 12 to 23 +/- 14%, P < 0.05) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV) (168 +/- 47 to 151 +/- 47 ml, P < 0.05). Improvement in EF (51 +/- 11 to 54 +/- 13%, P > 0.05) and reduction in left ventricular end-systolic volume (ESV) (84 +/- 37 to 77 +/- 40 ml, P > 0.05) did not reach the level of significance. Myocardial viability was preserved in only two of seven patients (28%) in group 2. Neither mean perfusion abnormalities (37 +/- 24 to 35 +/- 22%, P > 0.05) nor global left ventricular parameters (EF 41 +/- 15 vs. 42 +/- 19%, EDV 298 +/- 33 vs. 299 +/- 57 mL, ESV 197 +/- 12 vs. 195 +/- 32 ml P > 0.05) changed at the follow-up. In group 3, myocardial viability was preserved in seven of 10 patients (70%) at baseline, but no significant changes in perfusion (40 +/- 18 vs. 41 +/- 19%, P > 0.05) and left ventricular function (EF 42 +/- 17 vs. 44 +/- 14%, EDV 228 +/- 101 vs. 227 +/- 81 ml, ESV 143 +/- 87 vs. 146 +/- 8 mlMyocardial perfusion and EDV may significantly improve 1 year after PCI provided recanalization of CTO was successful. Our preliminary findings suggest that successful recanalization of CTO may have favorable outcome on left ventricular perfusion and function, particularly in patients with viable myocardium before PCI. The gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging with 99mTc-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile may be useful for monitoring long-term functional outcome of PCI in patients with CTO.
