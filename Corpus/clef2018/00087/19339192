An improved synthesis of 4-[18F]-ADAM, a potent serotonin transporter imaging agent. An improved synthesis of N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-[(18)F]fluorophenylthio)benzylamine (4-[(18)F]-ADAM, 2) as a potent serotonin transporter (SERT) imaging agent is described. Molecular orbital (MO) calculation predicts that N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-nitro-4-trimethylammoniumtrifluoromethanesulfonylphenylthio)benzamide (8) is probably a better precursor than N,N-dimethyl-2-(2,4-dinitrophenylthio)benzylamine (1) for preparing 2. Radioligand 2 was synthesized by the reaction of either precursor 1 or precursor 8 with K[(18)F]/K(2.2.2) at 120 degrees C followed by reduction with BH(3) at 80 degrees C. The radiochemical yield (EOB) of 2 synthesized from precursor 1 and 8 was 5.7+/-2.4% (n=6) and 14.8+/-4.0% (n=5), respectively, in a synthesis time of 120 min from EOB. The specific activity of 2 was 3 Ci/micromol or 111 GBq/micromol (EOB). Thus, this new synthetic method has significantly improved the radiochemical yield of 4-[(18)F]-ADAM and makes this radioligand more accessible to PET Centers without a cyclotron.
