Use of single-photon emission computed tomography/low-resolution computed tomography fusion imaging in detecting an unusually presenting osteoid osteoma of the lumbar vertebra. In this article, we describe an unusual presentation of osteoid osteoma of the lumbar vertebra in a woman in her early 30s. Single-photon emission computed tomography/low-resolution computed tomography (SPECT/CT) fusion imaging was used to detect the osteoma, precisely localize the pathology site, and guide surgical excision of the lesion. In recent years, SPECT/CT fusion imaging has helped make interpretations of scintigraphic images significantly more accurate.
