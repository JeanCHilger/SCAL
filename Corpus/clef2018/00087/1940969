PET studies of cortical diaschisis in patients with motor hemi-neglect. Six patients presenting with multimodal, predominantly motor hemi-neglect, were investigated by 15O2 or 18F-DG and PET to study the local cerebral metabolism in intact regions. All had suffered from an acute right-sided (n = 5) or left-sided (n = 1) focal hemispheric lesion (cortico-subcortical and purely subcortical in three patients each). Frontal and parietal cortices on the side of the lesion were significantly hypometabolic relative to the other side in each case, presumably as a result of diaschisis, whereas thalamic hypometabolism was significant in only 4 patients. Compared to absolute metabolic rates for controls, the uninjured hemisphere showed a trend towards hypometabolism. Hence, true hyperactivity of the contralateral hemisphere with respect to the ipsilateral cerebral cortex was not associated with motor hemineglect in this series. On the contrary, hemineglect was associated with a widespread hypometabolism of the entire ipsilateral cerebral cortex in the context of a moderately reduced metabolism of the ipsilateral thalamus and contralateral cerebral cortex. These findings are consistent with the implication of a cortico-subcortical network serving attention.
