A flexible drug delivery chip for the magnetically-controlled release of anti-epileptic drugs. A flexible drug delivery device was designed and fabricated using electrophoretic deposition of drug-carrying magnetic core-shell Fe(3)O(4) at SiO(2) nanoparticles onto an electrically conductive flexible PET substrate. The PET substrate was first patterned to a desired layout and subjected to deposition. In doing so, a uniform and nanoporous membrane could be produced. After lamination of the patterned membranes, a final chip-like device of thickness less than 0.5mm is formed that is used for controlled delivery of an anti-epileptic drug, i.e., ethosuximide (ESM). The release of useful drugs can be controlled by directly modulating the magnetic field, and the chip is capable of demonstrating a variety of release profiles (i.e., slow release, sustained release, step-wise release and burst release profiles). These profiles can follow a wide spectrum of patterns ranging from zero to pulsatile release kinetics depending on the mode of magnetic operation. When the magnetic field was removed, the release behavior was instantly ceased, and vice versa. A preliminary in-vivo study using Long-Evans rat model has demonstrated a significant reduction in spike-wave discharge after the ESM was burst released from the chip under the same magnetic induction as in-vitro, indicating the potential application of the drug delivery chip. The flexible and membrane-like drug delivery chip utilizes drug-carrying magnetic nanoparticles as the building blocks that ensure a rapid and precise response to magnetic stimulus. Moreover, the flexible chip may offer advantages over conventional drug delivery devices by improvement of dosing precision, ease of operation, wider versatility of elution pattern, and better compliance.
