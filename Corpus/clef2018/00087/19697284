Osteocutaneous free flap including medial and lateral scapular crests: technical aspects, viability, and donor site morbidity. The aims of the present study were to check for metabolism of the bony segments of osteocutaneous free flaps that included lateral as well as medial scapular crests by 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) examinations and to assess donor site morbidity. Twenty patients were included in the study. In 10 patients, osteocutaneous free flaps were harvested that included lateral as well as medial scapular crests. Seven days after surgery, an 18F-fluoride PET/CT examination was performed to assess the metabolism and viability of the bony segments. In the additional 10 patients, flaps were harvested that only included the lateral scapular crest. All patients were asked to fill in the disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) questionnaire 1 and 6 months after surgery. In the 10 free flaps that included lateral as well as medial scapular crests, 18F-fluoride PET/CT examinations revealed metabolism and viability of both bony segments. The DASH scores for the two patient groups did not differ significantly at 1 and 6 months after surgery (p(1 month) = 0.520, p(6 months) = 0.545). It seems that scapular osteocutaneous free flaps adopting lateral as well as medial scapular crests are a viable option for mandibular reconstruction and may be an alternative to the fibular double barrel.
