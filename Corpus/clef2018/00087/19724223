Cardiac assessment in chronic kidney disease. Patients with chronic kidney disease are well recognized to develop a wide range of cardiac structural and functional abnormalities. These changes may be progressive and relate directly to a grossly aggravated risk of cardiovascular events and reduced survival. Although conventional methods of cardiac assessment have been shown to be useful, they are limited by insufficient sensitivity and specificity, to fully appreciate the overall degree of myocardial distress that is common in these patients. This article aims to review the use of established and emerging cardiac imaging tools and, in particular, their application in patients with chronic kidney disease.
