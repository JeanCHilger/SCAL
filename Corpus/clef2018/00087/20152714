Formulation of 68Ga BAPEN kit for myocardial positron emission tomography imaging and biodistribution study. Tris(4,6-dimethoxysalicylaldimine)-N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)-N,N'-ethylenediamine (BAPEN), a tris(salicylaldimine) derivative, is a heart positron emission tomography (PET) agent when labeled with (68)Ga. However, its labeling requires complicated and time-consuming procedures. In this study, the authors formulated a new BAPEN kit for convenient (68)Ga labeling.BAPEN (0.25 mg) kits were prepared by dispensing its solution in 1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) into sterile vials and lyophilization. The prepared kits were labeled with generator-eluted (68)Ga in 0.1 N HCl. Stability in human serum was tested. Expiration date was determined by accelerated testing according to US Food and Drug Administration guidelines. A Biodistribution study was performed in normal mice after injection via tail vein.The prepared kits achieved radiolabeling efficiencies in excess of 95% and showed a shelf-life of 98 days at 25 degrees C and 64.3 months at 4 degrees C. (68)Ga-BAPEN was found to be stable in human serum at 37 degrees C for at least 1 h. Furthermore, a biodistribution study revealed high heart uptake (10.8% ID/g, 1 h).The authors developed a BAPEN kit for convenient labeling with (68)Ga. The (68)Ga-BAPEN showed high stability and excellent biodistribution results in normal mice, which is required for myocardial PET imaging.
