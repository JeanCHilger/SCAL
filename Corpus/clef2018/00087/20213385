Imaging assessment of osteosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: diagnosis, staging, and evaluating response to chemotherapy. Osteosarcoma is an aggressive tumor of mesenchymal origin, capable of producing osteoid and immature bone. It is the most frequent primary malignant skeletal neoplasm in children and adolescents. Imaging studies play a major role in initial diagnosis, staging, and assessment of tumor response to chemotherapy. Conventional radiography is the prime imaging modality for diagnosis of bony tumors. Radionuclide bone scan is used in detection of metastatic lesions in the other bones. Computed tomography may be used as an adjunct to conventional radiography, but its main role is detection of pulmonary metastasis. The standard magnetic resonance imaging is the most specific modality for local staging and monitoring response to chemotherapy, and distinguishing postsurgical changes from residual tumor. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging has been introduced to quantify the percentage of tumor necrosis, identify early responders, and thus predict survival. The role of 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) in the staging and management of osteosarcoma is evolving. It has the advantage of total body imaging and may have an overall role in tumor staging and grading, detection of early response, and therefore, in the prognosis and detection of recurrence.
