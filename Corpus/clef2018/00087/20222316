Particularities of Hodgkin's lymphoma. A risk-adapted strategy for adult patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma is based on risk factors at diagnosis. First line chemotherapy with the gold standard ABVD regimen, with 3 or 4 courses for patients without or with risk factors, respectively, followed by radiation therapy targeting the initially affected areas (involved-field RT), at a dose of 30 Gy, is the treatment of choice for all early-stage supradiaphragmatic disease. Treatment for disseminated disease is based on chemotherapy alone. According to prognostic index, 8 cycles of ABVD or more intensive regimen like BEACOP are indicated. At the present time, clinical trials including PET scans to evaluate early response to chemotherapy, aim to treat early stages with chemotherapy alone and modern radiation techniques are being developed to restrict the target volume to initially involved nodes only. For advanced stages, PET scan may help to define optimal treatment and primary failures from first line chemotherapy.
