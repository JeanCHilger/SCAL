Sequence analysis, expression and antigenicity detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus NS3 gene. In this study, we cloned the NS3 gene from bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) VEDEVAC strain. The result showed that the average P-distance of Pestivirus NS3 amino acid sequence was 0.07 and the VEDEVAC strain was classified to BVDV type 1. Using pET-30a(+) as vector and Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) as host, we obtained purified recombinant NS3 protein by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that both BVDV positive serum and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) positive serum were able to recognize the recombinant NS3 protein. Indirect-ELISA assay indicated that the protein could be used as detection antigen.
