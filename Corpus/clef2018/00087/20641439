 Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a unique type II, transmembrane-bound glycoprotein that is overexpressed on prostate tumor cells and in the neovasculature of most of the solid tumors, but not in the vasculature of normal tissues (1, 2). This unique expression of PSMA makes it an important biomarker as well as a large extracellular target of imaging agents (3, 4). 7E11-C5, a monoclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of PSMA, was found to be specific to prostate tumor tissues in humans when conjugated with glycyl-tyrosyl-(
