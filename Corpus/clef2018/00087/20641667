. Phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid are the most abundant anionic molecules found on the internal surface of the cellular plasma membrane, including that of the vascular tissue (1). Maintenance of the membrane phospholipid topology is an energy-dependent process that involves the ATP-dependent activity of enzymes such as the aminophospholipid translocases, floppases, and scramblases (2, 3). The activity of these enzymes is altered under a variety of pathological conditions and results in the redistribution of membrane phospholipids because PS is exposed to the outer surface of the cell membrane (4). A variety of stress conditions (such as acidity, hypoxia, etc.) and molecules (cytokines, thrombin, oxygen free radicals, etc.), including Ca
