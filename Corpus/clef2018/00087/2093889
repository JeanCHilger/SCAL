Diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities of meta-iodobenzylguanidine in neuroblastoma. MIBG is taken up preferentially by neuroblastoma cells. Owing to its high concentration in the neuroblastoma lesions, *I-MIBG scan is one of the most specific and effective tools in the diagnosis and staging of the disease. For most imaging purpose 123I-MIBG is the optimal agent. A rational approach 131I-MIBG has the potential for specifically delivering very large radiation doses to the malignant cells. The results obtained in more institutions are encouraging and this therapeutic modality should be included in the therapeutic strategy of neuroblastoma.
