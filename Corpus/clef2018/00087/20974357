Imaging of uterine malignancies. This article reviews the role of imaging in malignant neoplasms of the uterine corpus. Endometrial cancer is the most common uterine malignancy, and diagnosis is made by histology. Staging of these tumors remain surgical-pathologic on the 2009 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system. However, imaging is important in treatment planning, with magnetic resonance imaging providing the best staging for the primary tumor more advanced disease may be evaluated with computed tomography or positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Uterine sarcomas are uncommon and heterogeneous group of malignancies. International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics have introduced a new staging system for uterine sarcoma that is also surgical-pathologic. Imaging is used in evaluating these tumors and in defining the extent of disease. Other malignant tumors involving the uterus and discussed here include lymphoma and metastases.
