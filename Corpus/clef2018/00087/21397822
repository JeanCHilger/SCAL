Concerning non muscle invasive bladder cancer, endoscopic diagnosis seems improved by the NBI and immunofluorescence. The staging of pT1 tumors may evolve. The poor prognosis of Cis was stressed. The indication of cystectomy for BCG failure has been clarified. For muscle invasive bladder cancer, the prognostic impact of lympho-vascular invasion was reported.
