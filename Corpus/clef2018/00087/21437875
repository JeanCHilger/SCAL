Imaging of activated macrophages in experimental osteoarthritis using folate-targeted animal single-photon-emission computed tomography/computed tomography. Evaluation of macrophage activation may provide essential information about the etiology and progression rate of osteoarthritis (OA). Activated macrophages abundantly express folate receptor β (FRβ), which can be targeted using radioactive-labeled folic acid. This study was undertaken to investigate whether macrophage activation can be monitored in small animal models of OA using a folate radiotracer and to determine whether macrophage activation differs in different models of OA with different OA progression.Two rat models of OA were used: the mono-iodoacetate (MIA) model, which is a fast-progressing biochemically induced model, and the anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) model, which induces OA at a slower pace. Images were obtained using high-resolution small animal single-photon-emission computed tomography/computed tomography. The specificity of the technique was tested by eradicating macrophages using clodronate-laden liposomes and blockade of FRβ by cold folic acid.The MIA model had high initial macrophage activation, with a peak after 2 weeks which disappeared after 8 weeks. The ACLT model showed less activation but was still active 12 weeks after induction. The technique allowed monitoring of the disease process over time, in which late stages of the disease showed less macrophage activation than early stages, especially in the fast-progressing MIA model of OA.Our findings indicate that macrophage activation in experimental OA can clearly be demonstrated and monitored by the folate radiotracer. The high resolution, high sensitivity, and high specificity of the technique allow clear localization of macrophage activity in a disease model that is not known for abundant macrophage involvement.
