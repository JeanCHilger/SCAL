Radiofrequency ablation of medically inoperable stage IA non-small cell lung cancer: are early posttreatment PET findings predictive of treatment outcome? The purpose of this study was to evaluate initial experience with (18)F-FDG PET/CT after pulmonary radiofrequency ablation of stage IA non-small cell lung cancer to determine whether treatment success or residual disease can be predicted with early postablation PET.Thirty patients with medically inoperable stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (12 men, 18 women median age, 76 yearsEarly PET/CT images, obtained within 4 days of RFA, were evaluable for 26 patients (23 at 6 months). Patients with a complete metabolic response at early PET/CT had a 1-year event rate of 43%, whereas those with partial or no response or disease progression had a 1-year event rate of 67% (p = 0.27). Patients with a complete metabolic response at 6-month PET/CT had a 1-year event rate of 0%. Those with a partial response and those with disease progression had an overall event rate of 75% (p = 0.001).Early post-RFA PET/CT is not necessary and 6-month post-RFA PET/CT findings correlate better with clinical outcome at 1 year.
