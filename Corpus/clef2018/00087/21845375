Advances in small bowel imaging. The small intestine has been difficult to examine by traditional endoscopic and radiologic techniques. Within the past 10Â years, advances have led to an explosion of technologies that facilitate examination of the entire small intestine. Wireless video capsule endoscopy, deep enteroscopy using balloon-assisted or spiral techniques, computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) enterography have facilitated the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of patients with small intestinal diseases. These technologies are complementary, each with its advantages and limitations. Capsule endoscopy provides a detailed view of the mucosal surface and has excellent patient acceptance, but does not allow therapeutics. Deep enteroscopy allows careful inspection of the mucosa and therapeutics, but is time consuming and invasive. Enterography (CT or MR) allows examination of the small bowel wall and surrounding structures. The initial best test for detecting small intestinal disease depends on clinical presentation and an astute differential diagnosis.
