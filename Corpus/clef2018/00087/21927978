Left ventricular mechanical synchrony from stress and rest 82Rb PET myocardial perfusion ECG-gated studies: differentiating normal from LBBB patients. We have previously reported normal values for LV mechanical synchrony from post-stress exercise (99m)Tc SPECT studies the goal of this study was to develop normal values for mechanical synchrony from pharmacologic stress and rest (82)Rb PET studies and compare these values to a population of LBBB patients.The normal population consisted of 40 patients with a low likelihood of coronary artery disease. The LBBB population consisted of 23 patients with ECG evidence of LBBB. All patients were imaged with pharmacologic stress and processed using SyncTool™ (Emory Cardiac Toolbox™). Means and standard deviations were calculated for the stress and rest phase parameters. Normal male and female phase standard deviation were 15.0 ± 7.0 and 13.2 ± 7.7, respectively, for stress (P = NS), and 22.7 ± 13.2 and 16.6 ± 14.3 for rest (P = NS). Normal male and female histogram bandwidth were 38.1 ± 13.3 and 32.0 ± 13.5, respectively, for stress (P = NS) and 50.8 ± 18.7 and 44.4 ± 44.9 for rest (P = NS). ROC analysis yielded a sensitivity/specificity as high as 80%/90% for males, and 92%/75% for females (P = NS).Normal values for LV mechanical synchrony have been developed for (82)Rb pharmacologic stress and rest PET studies furthermore, the stress pharmacologic values do not differ significantly from our previously reported exercise post-stress SPECT normal values. Finally, ROC analysis confirmed that these normal values were able to differentiate normal and LBBB populations.
