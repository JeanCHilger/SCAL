Brain aging research at the close of the 20th century: from bench to bedside. Remarkable and continued growth in the field of brain aging research has been fueled by a confluence of factors. Developments in molecular biology, imaging, and genetics coupled with the imperative caused by the aging of the population has created fertile ground for improved understanding of the interaction between brain function and behavior. Aging changes in neurochemical systems may account for the spectrum of cognitive and behavioral states of successfully aged pen sons, but may also contribute to enhanced vulnerability to depressive or dementing illness. In particular, the refinement of in vivo imaging approaches to investigating the structure and function of the aging brain has provided the opportunity to strengthen our knowledge of the biological substrate of the aging brain and neuropsychiatrie disorders, and translate these into therapeutics.
