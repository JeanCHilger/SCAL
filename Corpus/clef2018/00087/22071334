Evolution of the diagnostic criteria for degenerative and cognitive disorders. This review describes the evolution of the clinical criteria for Alzheimer's disease over the past 25 years, with special emphasis on those recently published that have incorporated the use of biomarkers.One of the most important advances in the knowledge of Alzheimer's disease was the development of cerebrospinal fluid, PET and MRI biomarkers. These have shown that the Alzheimer's disease is present in cognitively normal individuals, suggesting that there is a long incubation process that precedes the onset of the symptoms. Although there are diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease, the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association has proposed a set of diagnostic criteria oriented to provide a unified vision of the pathological process from preclinical, to mild cognitive impairment, and to full-blown dementia. These new criteria take advantage of different biomarkers to support the clinical diagnosis of the different stages of the disease.The new guidelines provide a definition of the dementia syndrome and core diagnostic features to be used in research and clinical practice, although they caution about the use of biomarkers, since they still require validation, and the longitudinal interaction and dynamics of these biomarkers in relationship to the manifestation of the symptoms are not fully understood.
