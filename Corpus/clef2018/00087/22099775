Evaluation of segmental pancreatic function using 11C-methionine positron emission tomography for safe living donor operation of pancreas transplantation. For a safe living pancreas donoration for transplantation, we evaluated the function of the residual pancreas head using 11C-methionine positron emission tomography (PET) in 13 cases before and after distal pancreatectomy. After 6 hours of fasting, we intravenously administered 11C-methionine (370 to 740 MBq), performing PET at 30 minutes thereafter. 11C-methionine PET uptake in the pancreas head was expressed as a standardized uptake value (SUV) for comparison before versus after surgery: 17.3 ± 2.5 versus 17.4 ± 4.9, respectively, demonstrating no significant difference. However, the changes in SUVs of the residual pancreas head showed three patterns after surgery. The SUVs were elevated in three donors after surgery, hypermetabolite type maintained in five donors, normometabolite type
