 The process of programmed cell death (apoptosis) involves the interaction of several signaling pathways in the cell, and the presence of apoptotic cells is a characteristic feature of diseases such as cancer, ischemia, and neurodegeneration (1, 2). Interestingly, the induction of apoptosis with chemotherapy or radiotherapy is essential for the treatment of cancer, and the imaging of this process can be used to monitor disease progression or the response of tumors to different therapies. Although several types of imaging agents have been evaluated to investigate apoptosis, the tracers that are most frequently used to visualize this phenomenon are radiolabeled probes based on annexin V because they have a strong affinity for phosphatidylserine (PS), which is exposed on the surface of apoptotic and necrotic cells (in normal cells PS is present mainly on the inner side of the cell membrane bilayer) (3). These probes have been reviewed by Vangestel et al. (4). As an alternative to using annexin-based probes to detect apoptotic tissues, Wang et al. identified an apoptosis-targeting peptide-1 (ApoPep-1 amino acid (aa) sequence: CQRPPR), a hexapeptide that was shown to bind the histone H1 protein in the nucleus (the nucleus is permeable to ApoPep-1), from a phage-display peptide library (2). The peptide was labeled with
