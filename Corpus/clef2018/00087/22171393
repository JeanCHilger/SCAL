 Peripheral amyloidosis is the extracellular deposition of insoluble protein fibrils in various organs of animals, including humans, and these deposits are considered to be biomarkers for diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), light chain amyloidosis (AL), etc (1). The fibrils are made up of disease-specific aggregated proteins or peptides (e.g., Aβ peptides for AD, light chains for AL or multiple myeloma, and reactive amyloidosis (AA)) that incorporate heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG heparin belongs to the heparan sulfate family of proteoglycans that contain the (GlcNS6S-IdoA2S)
