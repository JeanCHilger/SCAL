Portal vein embolization: what do we know? Portal vein embolization (PVE) has been developed to increase the size of the future remnant liver (FRL) left in place after major hepatectomy, thus reducing the risk of postoperative liver insufficiency. PVE consist in embolizing preoperatively portal branches of the segments that will be resected. Indication is based on preoperative measurements of the FRL by computed tomography and its ratio with either the theoretical liver volume or by direct measurement of the functional liver volume. After PVE, the volume and function of the FRL increases in 3 to 6Â weeks, permitting extensive resections in patients otherwise contraindicated for liver resection. The PVE technique is variable from one center to another however n-butyl-cyano-acrylate provides an interesting compromise between hypertrophy rate and procedure risk.
