Development and validation of a paediatric oral formulation of clonidine hydrochloride. Many drugs are unavailable in suitable paediatric dosage forms. We describe the development and validation of a stable paediatric oral formulation of clonidine hydrochloride 50 Î¼g/ml, allowing individualised paediatric dosing and easy administration. Stability of the extemporaneously compounded formulation of clonidine hydrochloride was assessed using a validated HPLC method. Clonidine hydrochloride was stable in the buffered aqueous solution at room temperature for up to 9 months. The described formulation is chemically stable for at least 9 months when stored in brown 100 ml PET bottles at room temperature, enabling adequate oral treatment in paediatric patients.
