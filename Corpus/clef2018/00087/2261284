Delineation of gliomas with magnetic resonance imaging using Gd-DTPA in comparison with computed tomography and positron emission tomography. Fourteen patients with cerebral gliomas were investigated by MR imaging using Gd-DTPA (Magnevist), CT with the contrast agent iohexol (Omnipaque) and, as a reference, positron emission tomography (PET) using 11C-L-methionine. Tumour areas with disruption of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) as seen on MR and CT were compared with areas increased accumulation of methionine in PET. There were 6 patients with high-grade astrocytoma (grade III-IV), 5 with low-grade astrocytoma (grade I-II) and 3 with oligodendroglioma. In 4 high-grade tumours, PET showed a larger tumour or tumour tissue in additional areas, compared with enhancement on MR and CT, while in 2 cases the tumour extension was similar in the three modalities. In the low grade tumour group, the findings on PET differed from those on post-contrast MR or CT in 7 cases. In 3 of these cases, no disruption of the BBB was seen either on MR or on CT. In 2 of our 14 patients CT showed larger enhancement extension than MR and in 2 cases MR was superior to CT in this respect. The enhancement intensity was higher on MR in 4 patients and on CT in 2 patients. No definite difference in the delineation of tumour tissue between the T1 weighted SE sequences was found. The gradient echo sequences FLASH and FISP gave limited information that was less than that provided by the T1 weighted SE sequences. A greater increase in signal intensity in T1 weighted images was usually seen 5 min post-contrast in the high-grade tumours than in the low-grade ones.
