Insight into the dynamics, localization and magnitude of antigen-specific immune responses by [(18)F]FLT PET imaging. In order for cellular therapeutics to succeed, comprehensive monitoring of the transplanted cells in vivo is required i.e., their localization, functionality and numbers in a longitudinal manner. Recently, dendritic cell based vaccines have been monitored by their effect on lymphocyte activation using [(18)F]FLT PET in cancer patients.
