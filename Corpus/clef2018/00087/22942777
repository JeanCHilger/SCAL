Fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT Findings Following Bone Marrow Harvesting. Two patients demonstrated an unusual pattern of intense bone and surrounding soft tissue hypermetabolic uptake in the posterior pelvis on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography PET-CT scans. After further investigation, we found that both patients underwent uncomplicated autologous bone marrow harvesting several weeks before imaging. These two cases illustrate a distinctive PET-CT appearance following bone marrow harvesting that the radiologist needs to recognize to not confuse the findings with metastatic disease.
