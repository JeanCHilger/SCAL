Tc-99m HMPAO brain perfusion tomography atlas using a high resolution SPECT system. Excellent SPECT images of brain perfusion with Tc-99m HMPAO were obtained by the use of a three-head rotating gamma camera SPECT system with high resolution (FWHM 7mm) in a normal volunteer. These images should be clinically effective for evaluating various neurologic disorders. Transverse, coronal, and sagittal sectional HMPAO-SPECT images are correlated with corresponding brain MRI images of the same normal volunteer in this atlas.
