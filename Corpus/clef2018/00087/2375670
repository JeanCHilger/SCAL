Rehabilitation therapy for patients with long-term spinal cord injuries. The functional effects of three types of therapy for subjects with long-term incomplete cervical spinal cord injuries were investigated. Men and women, aged 18 to 45 years, were assigned to one of four groups using a restricted randomization process. The training period was divided into two consecutive eight-week time blocks where subjects received either (1) supervised physical exercise therapy (PET), (2) neuromuscular stimulation (NMS), or (3) electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback. Group 1 received EMG biofeedback followed by PET Group 2 received EMG biofeedback followed by NMS
