The role of I-131-MIBG in the diagnosis and therapy of carcinoids. The successful use of 131I-MIBG for the diagnosis and treatment of pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma has led to its application in patients with carcinoid, another neural crest tumor. The present report describes the scintigraphic findings, in correlation with clinical and biochemical parameters, in 20 patients with histologically proven carcinoids. 131I-MIBG total body scintigraphy was positive in 12 and equivocal in 1 of 19 patients with metastases. The necessity of delayed imaging and the possible advantage of single photon emission tomography for the detection of this tumor are emphasized. The results of 131I-MIBG treatment in five patients with progressive carcinoid metastases are discussed. It is concluded that 131I-MIBG has a role in the work up of patients with proven carcinoid and can be used for palliative treatment of this tumor.
