131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) for bronchial oat cell cancer and melanoma detection? The neuroendocrine features of bronchial oat cell carcinoma and melanoma indicate the possibility of positive imaging by means of radiolabelled metaiodobenzylguanidine. However, only four out of seven patients with bronchial oat cell carcinoma and three out of seven with melanoma were correctly diagnosed. Only false negative and no false positive results were obtained. The findings demonstrate a limited diagnostic value of the tracer in the tumor types examined.
