Effects of coronary artery bypass surgery on regions showing persistent defects in thallium myocardial images. The indications for revascularization surgery and its effects on myocardial regions showing persistent defects in thallium myocardial images are controversial. The effects of aortocoronary bypass surgery on myocardial perfusion and wall motion in the regions with persistent defects were evaluated in 47 patients with thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography and left ventriculography. In areas showing persistent thallium defects preoperatively the rate of improvement of perfusion was only 24% by postoperative thallium imaging, and 57% by wall motion analysis. These results were significantly inferior to those of regions with transient defects, which were 84% and 82%, respectively. A persistent defect may not be a definitive marker of a non-viable scar, but the results of surgery on such regions were unsatisfactory. It is concluded, therefore, that revascuralization surgery in regions with persistent defects is not always recommended and that the indications for surgery should be individually determined with operative risk balanced against benefits.
