Correlation of SPECT, EEG and CT in patients with epilepsy. A preliminary report. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were performed in 14 patients with epilepsy. Among 6 patients with GTC, five had no focal abnormalities in EEG and CT scan, SPECT also showed no changes of regional cerebral perfusion. In another one patient EEG was normal, CT scan showed hypodensity in right frontal area, SPECT showed decreased regional cerebral perfusion in right frontotemporal area. AVM in frontal lobe was found at operation. In 3 patients with complex partial seizures and 5 patients with complex partial seizures and GTC, SPECT showed regional cerebral perfusion coincided with the area of focal epileptic form discharges in EEG. In one patient with complex partial seizures and GTC EEG showed right antero-temporal focal sharp wave discharges, discrete calcification in superior suprasella cisterna on CT, SPECT showed decreased regional perfusion in right temporal area, pathological examination revealed hematoma in right temporal lobe. SPECT is useful for localizing epileptogenic foci in epileptics.
