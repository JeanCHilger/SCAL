Noninfectious diseases, metabolic diseases, toxicities, and neoplastic diseases of South American camelids. Although the SAC generally are healthy and tolerant of a wide variety of management schemes, a number of noninfectious diseases have been documented to occur, affecting all body systems. Gastrointestinal diseases appear to be the most common afflictions, particularly dental diseases, indigestion, ulceration of the third compartment, and the various causes of colic, such as enteritis, peritonitis, and intestinal accidents. Diseases of the urinary system (urolithiasis, amyloidosis, and glomerulonephritis in particular), the nervous system (especially various compressive lesions of the spinal cord), and the respiratory system (such as obstructive pulmonary diseases) are not uncommon. Diseases of the cardiovascular system (other than congenital defects), hemolymphatic system, and nonsurgical diseases of the musculoskeletal system only rarely are encountered. Heat stress appears to be a very common problem in certain areas, but other metabolic diseases (ketosis, hypocalcemia, and hypothyroidism) are of minor importance. It is assumed that SAC are susceptible to most of the same toxicities that affect domestic livestock species. The best documented examples appear to be the Ericaceae family of plants (laurels, rhododendrons, and so on) and the organophosphate chlorpyrifos. Neoplasia occasionally is seen examples include lymphosarcoma, gastric squamous cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma. As the longevity of these species increases because of their pet status, neoplasia can be expected to become more common. The treatment of most of these conditions is based upon extrapolation from domestic ruminants.
