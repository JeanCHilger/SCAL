Positron emission tomographical studies of 1-11C-acetoacetate, 2-18F-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose, and L-1-11C-tyrosine uptake by cat brain with an experimental lesion. In cat brain with a freezing injury, the uptake of 1-11C-acetoacetate (11C-ACAC), 2-18F-fluorodeoxy-D-glucose (18FDG), and L-1-11C-tyrosine (11C-TYR) was monitored by positron emission tomography following intravenous administration of the tracers, at 1 day, and 1-3 weeks after the injury. The development and further course of the cold-induced oedema was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging. In the fresh (1 day old) lesion there was increased uptake of 11C-ACAC, probably due to release of the restrictive influence of the blood-brain barrier upon passage of the substance into brain. The uptake of 18FDG, which normally occurs by carrier-mediated transport at the barrier, was decreased in the fresh lesion, probably as a result of damage of the carrier mechanism. In the 3 week old lesion 18FDG uptake was still reduced, and 11C-ACAC uptake was still increased, although barrier function to Evans blue had recovered. It is suggested, that the increased 11C-ACAC uptake in the chronic lesion bears upon the proliferation of macrophages and reactive glial cells in the lesion. This is supported by the increased uptake of 11C-TYR in the 2 weeks old lesion, while in the fresh lesion 11C-TYR uptake was unchanged.
