Effect of exercise level on the ability of thallium-201 tomographic imaging in detecting coronary artery disease: analysis of 461 patients. This study examined the effect of the level of exercise on the ability of thallium-201 imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to detect coronary artery disease. Patients in group 1 (n = 164) achieved adequate exercise end points, defined as positive exercise electrocardiograms or greater than or equal to 85% of maximal predicted heart rate. Patients in group 2 (n = 108) had submaximal exercise. The SPECT thallium-201 images showed perfusion defects in 74%, 88%, and 98%, respectively, of patients with one, two and three vessel coronary artery disease in group 1, compared with 52%, 84% and 79%, respectively, of such patients in group 2 (p less than 0.05). Perfusion defects showed partial or complete redistribution consistent with ischemia in 56%, 80% and 88%, respectively, of patients with one, two and three vessel coronary artery disease in group 1 compared with 35%, 58% and 56%, respectively, of such patients in group 2 (p = 0.08, less than 0.03 and less than 0.001, respectively). Of 58 patients with normal coronary angiograms or less than 50% diameter stenosis, 36 (62%) had normal SPECT images. In a separate group of 131 patients with less than 5% pretest probability of coronary artery disease, the specificity was 93%. The sensitivity of exercise SPECT imaging in group 1 was higher than that of ST segment depression (p less than 0.001). Thus, the level of exercise affects the results of SPECT thallium imaging in the localization and evaluation of the extent of coronary artery disease and the detection of ischemia.
