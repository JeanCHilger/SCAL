In vivo PET and SPECT receptor imaging: new technology and tactics for receptor measurement. PET and SPECT approaches to radiolabelled neurotransmitter receptors provide a new and complimentary tool to existing receptor and neurotransmitter studies. They provide information which will extend other current in vitro and in vivo non imaging procedures while likely requiring the types of resolution and sensitivity which are possible with the latter methods to help in the interpretation of the PET studies.
