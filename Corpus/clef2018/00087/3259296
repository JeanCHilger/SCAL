Longitudinal studies of regional cerebral metabolism in Alzheimer's disease. Measurement of cerebral glucose metabolism in six patients with Alzheimer's disease using positron emission tomography demonstrated that hypometabolism remained relatively more severe in parietal cortex than in frontal cortex over time. Lateral metabolic asymmetries were preserved in less severely involved brain regions, but were less stable in parietal cortex.
