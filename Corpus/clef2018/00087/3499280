SPECT gallium scanning for lymphoma and infection. Thirty gallium scans, using currently acceptable dosage levels (5-6 mCi) and a conventional rotating gamma camera, were performed on 20 patients with lymphoma or infection. Compared to planar scans, SPECT increased sensitivity and lesion detection from 48% to 89% in lymphoma, and from 50% to 80% in infection. The predictive value of a negative site was 81% in lymphoma and 67% in infection. Gallium utility is markedly increased by SPECT imaging. A normal gallium SPECT scan is highly accurate in ruling out disease.
