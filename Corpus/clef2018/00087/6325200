Segmental assessment on ordinary scintigrams and SPECT images of the liver. By examining the area of defect elucidated on the scintigrams and SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) images, the extension of the tumor into segments was assessed in cases where the SOL (space-occupying lesion) was determined by other methods. In this study, we followed the Couinaud 's segmentation. As a result, it was found that the segment with a SOL could be diagnosed fairly well on radionuclide images. Some incorrect assumptions were also found about the segments on ordinary scintigrams in previously published articles. These incorrect assumptions have been accepted for a long time. Although we do not deny that TCT (transmission X-ray computed tomography), echography, angiography, etc. are necessary for a precise judgment on liver segment and also that there are some cases in which the segmental assessment of these radionuclide images is impossible, we do believe that this kind of effort will improve the diagnostic capability of the radionuclide images.
