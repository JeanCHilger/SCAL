In vivo estimation of renal volume using a rotating gamma camera for 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal imaging. The in vivo renal volume was determined using SPECT for 99mTc -DMSA renal imaging. The total renal volume was derived by summing the DMSA distribution volumes of the transaxial slices in the whole kidney. In 20 healthy subjects the renal volume in the right kidney was 220 ml for men and 195.2 ml for women, while that in the left kidney was 213 ml for men and 193.7 ml for women. Differences in those values were not statistically significant. A good correlation was found between renal volumes in both kidneys and body surface area. In 106 kidneys including solitary and pathological kidneys, individual renal volume correlated well with individual DMSA renal uptake rate which demonstrates cortical functioning mass, depending on the cortical blood flow. Thus, SPECT enables an accurate noninvasive means of estimating in vivo functioning renal volume.
