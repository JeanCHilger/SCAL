A comparison of rotating slant hole collimator and rotating camera for single photon emission tomography of the heart. Measurements were made on the tomographic imaging abilities of a rotating slant hole collimator and a rotating scintillation camera system using a standard heart phantom and thallium-201. This allowed a comparison to be made between these and published results for conventional imaging and the seven pinhole technique under standardised conditions. Although better intraplanar resolutions were obtained with the rotating slant hole, the rotating camera was found to give superior definition of a defect and less propagation between reconstructed sections of the phantom.
