An overview of a camera-based SPECT system. Camera-based single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides increased information about the organ scanned by eliminating superpositioned radionuclidic activity in the reconstructed images. Current literature contains little detail regarding the potential of and the technical aspects involved in using this emerging imaging modality. A description of the instrumentation supplements a general, but practical, background for nuclear medicine personnel. Some of the considerations for successfully utilizing a SPECT system are described, along with a discussion of the basis for these procedures. Pitfalls are mentioned and clinical images from our SPECT imaging system are included.
