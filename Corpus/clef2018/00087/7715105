Carbon-11 labeled diacylglycerol for signal transduction imaging by positron CT: evaluation of the quality and safety for clinical use. To elucidate the synaptic transmission in the neural system, we have been developing fundamental studies for intracellular signaling. For clinical application of carbon-11 labeled diacylglycerol (1-[1-11C]butyryl-2-palmitoyl-rac-glycerol: 11C-DAG) using positron emission computed tomography (PET), we evaluated the quality and the safety of 11C-DAG as the solution for injection. As a result, 11C-DAG was synthesized within 50 minutes, including the preparation step for injection. The half life time and energy spectrum of 11C-DAG were the same as the physical character of carbon-11, and other radioisotopes were not detected. In the quality control, 11C-DAG solution was negative in the examination of bacterial contamination and the pyrogen test in three successive synthesis procedures. In the acute toxicity test by administration of 11C-DAG and 100 mumol/kg of non-radioactive DAG to the rat intravenously, the systemic condition of the rat was not changed and no abnormalities were found in any organ 24 hours after administration. These findings indicated the safety of 11C-DAG solution. Clinical application of 11C-DAG using positron emission tomography may be useful to elucidate the dysfunction of intracellular signaling in disorders of higher cortical function such as Alzheimer disease.
