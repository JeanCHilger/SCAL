Variability of normal coronary anatomy: implications for the interpretation of thallium-SPECT myocardial perfusion images in single-vessel disease. Standard criteria for assigning perfusion defects to a specific vascular territory often result in mistaken identification of the affected coronary artery due to the normal variability of coronary anatomy. A retrospective study was performed to determine the frequency of this type of error and to identify the most common perfusion patterns associated with specific coronary lesions.Records were reviewed of all patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) who had exercise or dipyridamole thallium SPECT myocardial perfusion studies since 1987. Patients with coronary artery bypass grafts and an interval between the two studies greater than 6 wk or interval change in medical status were excluded. Ninety-three studies were available for review. The size, severity and location of all perfusion defects were noted by three observers who had no knowledge of the angiographic data. Significant CAD was defined as luminal diameter stenosis greater than 50%.The diseased vessel was correctly identified in 85% of positive studies. Thallium SPECT, however, mistakenly predicted additional vessel involvement in 29% of those studies. Another 15% correctly predicted single-vessel disease but identified the wrong artery. Using standard criteria, thallium SPECT correctly predicted the arteriogram findings in only 56% of studies. Most of these findings could be correlated with variations in individual coronary anatomy.The accurate localization of coronary stenoses by thallium SPECT imaging requires close correlation with arteriography owing to the significant variability in normal coronary anatomy.
