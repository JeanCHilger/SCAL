Age and gender differences in normal myocardial adrenergic neuronal function evaluated by iodine-123-MIBG imaging. Myocardial sympathetic nervous function has been evaluated with 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging in various cardiac diseases. Heterogeneous distribution of this tracer has been reported. This study was undertaken to assess whether such heterogeneity is related to age and gender.Twenty-nine subjects (18 men, 11 women age range, 21 to 79 yrThere were no significant differences in the heart-to-mediastinum count ratio based on age or gender, but there was a significant inverse correlation between the inferior-to-anterior wall count ratio and age (r = -0.51 on late planar images and r = -0.69 on SPECT p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). This correlation was valid in men (r = -0.74 and -0.83, respectivelyInferior wall uptake of MIBG decreased with age in individuals without cardiac diseases, especially men. Such age- and gender-related heterogeneity should be considered in the interpretation of MIBG images.
