FDG-SPECT: correlation with FDG-PET. The clinical utility of FDG-PET imaging in the evaluation of patients with cardiac, oncologic and neurologic diseases is well documented. The major disadvantages of PET continue to be its high cost and limited availability.With the goal of providing equivalent diagnostic information using a widely available, less expensive modality, we evaluated the clinical utility of FDG-SPECT imaging with a conventional dual-headed camera as compared to PET in 21 patients.To compare the image quality of the two modalities, major physical parameters and phantom determinations were obtained. By using the 511-keV collimators, we achieved resolution and system volume sensitivity that were less than those for PET by factors of 2.6 and 8, respectively. The SPECT system, on the other hand, could easily resolve 2 x 0.5-cm cold defects in the heart phantom and 2-cm hot lesions in a 22-cm cylindrical phantom with a target-to-background ratio of 5:1. FDG-SPECT imaging of nine patients with heart disease yielded similar diagnostic information of the amount of viable myocardium present when compared to PET. In seven of eight patients, malignant tissue visualized with FDG-PET was seen equally well with SPECT. The lesions not visualized with FDG-SPECT were either small (< or = 1.5 cm) or benign. SPECT imaging of four patients with cerebral lesions was inconclusive due to the small sample size but seemed promising.FDG-SPECT with 511-keV collimation is less expensive, more available and technically simpler than PET. We believe that FDG-SPECT has achieved sufficient sensitivity and resolution to detect myocardial viability and diagnose malignant tumors > or = 2 cm in diameter.
