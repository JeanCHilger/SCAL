Perfusion of the left ventricular myocardium in patients with aortic valve diseases using single photon emission computerized tomography. To determine resting myocardial perfusion in 30 patients with aortic valve disease (AVD) TI-201 emission computer tomography (ECT) studies and heart catheterization were performed. 16 patients had a predominant aortic regurgitation (AR) an aortic stenosis (AS) was found in 14 patients at catheterization. Perfusion defects were documented in 10 of 16 patients with AR, and in 5 of 14 patients with AS. Regional determination demonstrated in 10 of these 15 abnormal cases at least one of the perfusion defects in the postero-basal segment. In patients with aortic valve disease and normal myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, the ejection fraction (EF) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) as compared to the patients with abnormal TI-201 ECT (EF 65.2 +/- 15.0% vs. 58.9 +/- 15.1%). Additionally, in the 15 patients with abnormal TI-201 ECT, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) and the left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) were both increased (LVEDVI in AVD: 130.3 +/- 15.3 ml/m2 vs. 107.4 +/- 13.6 ml/m2, LVESVI in AVD: 61.9 +/- 14.6 ml/m2 vs. 48.0 +/- 9.8 ml/m2). In conclusion, left ventricular perfusion defects at rest can be detected by TI-201 ECT in many patients with aortic valve disease. Such myocardial perfusion defects indicate left ventricular enlargement and impaired left ventricular function, especially in patients with aortic regurgitation.
