Discordance of dual-isotope (hybrid) myocardial perfusion imaging results in patients who have undergone revascularization procedures. Three hundred twenty-one separate acquisition dual-isotope myocardial perfusion scans were reviewed retrospectively. Studies performed in six patients demonstrated a relative improvement in Tc-99m sestamibi uptake during stress in segments that appeared abnormal on rest injected Tl-201 images. All patients who demonstrated this pattern had a prior history of myocardial infarction and interventional revascularization. While many factors may contribute to this appearance, the authors favor the presence of a patent infarct-related artery as being the most significant.
