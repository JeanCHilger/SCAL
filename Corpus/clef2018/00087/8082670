Dobutamine 99mTc-MIBI single-photon emission tomography: non-exercise-dependent detection of haemodynamically significant coronary artery stenoses. Dobutamine pharmacological stress testing in conjunction with technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile single-photon emission tomography (MIBI SPET) may be a useful alternative to convential exercise stress MIBI SPET for the detection and localisation of coronary artery stenoses. Therefore, 35 patients with stenoses (> or = 50% diameter reduction) of one or more coronary arteries were selected for dobutamine MIBI SPET. Each patient underwent MIBI injection at rest and during dobutamine infusion with incremental doses (5, 10, 15 and 20 micrograms kg-1 min-1). A conventional exercise stress test (EST) was performed in all patients. Peak double product during steady-state dobutamine infusion (18,200 +/- 4200 mmHg min-1) was lower (P = 0.0001) than during EST (21,700 +/- 4900 mmHg min-1). Image quality was good in all but one patient, who had to be excluded from data analysis due to excessive hepatobiliary MIBI activity. Dobutamine-induced perfusion abnormalities were observed in 30/34 MIBI SPET studies, resulting in an overall detection rate for coronary artery disease of 88%. A pathological EST was observed in 23/34 patients (68%). The detection rate of individual coronary artery stenoses was 85% (28/33) for stenosess with a severe diameter reduction (> 70%) and 50% (12/24) for stenoses with a moderate diameter reduction (> or = 50-70%). In particular, sensitivity and specificity for the detection of moderate and severe stenoses (> or = 50%) were 75%/100% for left anterior descending, 67%/95% for left circumflex and 67%/69% for right coronary artery stenoses. Dobutamine MIBI SPET is a well-tolerated, non-exercise-dependent test for detection and localisation of haemodynamically significant coronary artery stenoses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
