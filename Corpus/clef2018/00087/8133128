Single-day combined evaluation of regional myocardial perfusion and function at rest and peak exercise with 99mTc-MIBI in patients with coronary artery disease. 99mTc-labeled methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (MIBI) allows a simultaneous radionuclide assessment of regional heart function and perfusion. In this study the effectiveness of functional and perfusional images obtained with 99mTc-MIBI in the detection of coronary stenoses was compared with that of their combination. We studied 197 patients who underwent coronary angiography and a single-day radionuclide protocol including first pass angiography (multicrystal gamma camera) and single photon emission computed tomography, by means of 2 injections of 99mTc-MIBI at rest and at peak exercise. Fifteen patients had < 50% stenoses, 50 had 1-vessel, 69 2-vessel and 63 3-vessel disease, for a total of 377 pathological major coronary vessels 129 patients had previous myocardial infarction. Functional images, perfusional tomograms and their combination showed the same sensitivity (98%) and specificity (80%) in detecting coronary patients. Regional sensitivity and specificity of the combined analysis achieved 87% and 82%, respectively, vs. 94% (p < 0.005) and 60% (p < 0.001) of functional images, and 88% (p = N.S.) and 74% (p < 0.05) of perfusional tomograms. Thus, the combined analysis of regional functional and perfusional abnormalities increased significantly the specificity in the detection of coronary stenoses, in comparison with the separate evaluation of function and perfusion, achieving also a slightly higher diagnostic accuracy (85%, vs. 81% and 83%, respectively). The results confirm that a single-day protocol simultaneously assessing regional myocardial function and perfusion with 99mTc-MIBI represents a rapid and effective diagnostic method, that allows the physician to assess the presence and functional importance of coronary stenoses in less than 4 hours.
