Clinical evaluation of myocardial perfusion imaging with 99mTc-tetrofosmin. Myocardial perfusion imaging with Tc-99 m-1,2-bis (bis (2-ethoxyethyl) phosphino) ethane (Tc-99 m-tetrofosmin) was performed in 26 patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) or suspected to have IHD. The agent was administered both at rest and at peak exercise. Exercise and rest studies were performed on the same day or on different days. The injected dose ranged from 296 MBq-740 MBq. Image quality was adequate for diagnosis, and was superior to that of T1-201 scintigraphy. Results from the tetrofosmin imaging corresponded well with findings of T1 scintigraphy, with a segmental concordance of 87%. Sensitivity and specificity were 70% and 93%, respectively. Our results suggested that tetrofosmin could be a promising Tc-99m labeling agent for the evaluation of myocardial perfusion.
