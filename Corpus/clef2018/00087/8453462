Thalamic stimulation and suppression of parkinsonian tremor. Evidence of a cerebellar deactivation using positron emission tomography. Parkinsonian tremor can be abolished by chronic high frequency thalamic stimulation of the ventral intermediate nucleus. We have studied six patients with unilateral Parkinson's disease. The patients had an electrode chronically implanted in the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus. We measured changes in cerebral activity by positron emission tomography using an index of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Each patient was scanned in three states: (i) tremor without stimulation (condition A) (ii) tremor with ineffective stimulation (condition B)
