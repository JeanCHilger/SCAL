Effect of a standardized meal on the threshold of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with stable angina. This study was undertaken to determine the effect of a standardized meal on the ischemic threshold and exercise capacity in a series of 20 patients with stable angina, exercise-induced ischemia and reversible exercise-induced perfusion defects.It is generally accepted that exercise tolerance in patients with angina is reduced after a meal. However, studies that have addressed this phenomenon have yielded results that are contradictory and inconclusive.Two exercise tests using the Bruce protocol with technetium-99m (99mTc)-sestamibi were performed on consecutive days in a randomized order. One test was performed in the fasting state and the other 30 min after a 1,000-calorie meal.In the postprandial state, exercise time to ischemia was reduced by 20% from 248 +/- 93 s to 197 +/- 87 s (p = 0.0007), time to angina by 15% from 340 +/- 82 s to 287 +/- 94 s (p = 0.002) and exercise tolerance by 9% from 376 +/- 65 s to 344 +/- 86 s (p = 0.002). Rate-pressure products at these exercise test end points were not significantly different in the fasting and postprandial tests, and the quantitative 99mTc-sestamibi ischemia score was unchanged.In patients with stable angina, a 1,000-calorie meal significantly reduced time to ischemia, time to angina and exercise tolerance because of a more rapid increase in myocardial oxygen demand with exercise. The extent and severity of exercise-induced ischemia were unchanged.
