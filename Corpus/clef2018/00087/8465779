Diagnosis of right ventricular infarction by overlap images of simultaneous dual emission computed tomography using technetium-99m pyrophosphate and thallium-201. The validity of dual energy single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium-99m pyrophosphate (Tc-99m PPi) and thallium-201 for the diagnosis of right ventricular (RV) infarction, and the clinical features of RV infarction, were investigated in 190 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Diagnosis of RV infarction was performed by Tc-99m PPi accumulation in the RV myocardium on thallium-201 and Tc-99m PPi over-lay images at the dual SPECT with simultaneous imaging taken 2 to 9 days after the onset of myocardial infarction. Thirty RV infarctions were found among the 190 patients with left ventricular infarction (15.8%): 29 (97%) in association with the inferior and 1 (3%) with the lateral infarction. Tc-99m PPi accumulation was mostly observed in the posterior wall of the right ventricle. A total occlusion or a severe stenosis of the right coronary artery was demonstrated angiographically in 92% of the patients with RV infarction. The prevalence of RV infarctions was significantly lower in patients who achieved successful early reperfusion than in those who did not (26.7 vs 68.4%, respectively, p < 0.01). However, a successful early reperfusion therapy could not significantly decrease the rate of RV involvement in patients without significant collateral flow (p < 0.01). Thus, dual isotope SPECT with Tc-99m PPi and thallium-201 can be used as a reliable method for the diagnosis of RV infarction.
