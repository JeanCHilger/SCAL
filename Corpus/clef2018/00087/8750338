NMR studies of brain 13C-glucose uptake and metabolism: present status. One of the common features of epilepsy is a change in glucose metabolism at the site of seizure activity during and between seizures. The noninvasive in situ study of glucose transport and metabolism by NMR can potentially provide detailed information about this phenomena. In this short review, we will discuss the principles of 13C-glucose NMR studies of the brain and compare the advantages and disadvantages of this method to those of 18F-deoxyglucose studies using positron emission tomography (PET).
