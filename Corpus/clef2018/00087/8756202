Follow-up of left ventricular systolic function in the first year following previous infarction. To follow the left ventricular systolic function changes as assessed by global and regional ejection fraction during the first year of evolution after anterior myocardial infarction, as well as to analyse how the most relevant clinical and angio-graphic parameters influence them.Sixty-six consecutive patients with a first infarction of anterior location, completed 1 year of follow-up with radionuclide ventriculography, T1-SPECT after exercise or dypiridamole and cardiac catheterization before discharge radionuclide ventriculography was repeated 6 and 12 months later. Twenty-five patients underwent revascularization procedures at the time of predischarge, 16 using successful percutaneous angioplasty of the left anterior descending artery and 9 using aorto-coronary graft surgery. Dilated patients were controlled, from an angiographic point, of view 6 months after PTCA.Predischarge global EF (42.9 +/- 12.6) increased significantly between the 6-month (46.9 +/- 12.8 p < 0.001) and 12-month (47.6 +/- 12Global and regional ejection fraction of the infarcted area increased significantly during the first year after anterior myocardial infarction, mainly prior to six months patients with significant residual stenosis of the artery related to the infarct. Recovery is present both in patients who underwent thrombolysis or conventional treatment at admittance and revascularization or medical treatment before discharge and is inversely correlated to the predischarge global ejection fraction value. This evolution suggests that a significant amount of stunned myocardium is still present before discharge.
