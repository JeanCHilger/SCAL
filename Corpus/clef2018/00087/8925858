The role of positron emission tomography within the spectrum of medical imaging. The aim of the survey is to help to define the role of positron emission tomography (PET) as an investigative procedure, and to identify strategies to perfect PET and in vivo tracer studies in general so that their full potential is realised. Within this context, the sensitivity and specificity of PET are reviewed. The impact of PET through studies of regional cerebral activation based on blood flow measurements is discussed. Emphasis is placed on the role of PET in clinical research and as a means of assessing new therapeutic agents. This latter ability renders PET of much interest to pharmaceutical companies.
