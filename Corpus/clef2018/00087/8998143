Differentiating histologic malignancy of primary brain tumors: pentavalent technetium-99m-DMSA. This study assessed pentavalent 99mTc-DMSA uptake in primary brain tumors and evaluated the relationship between retention and histologic malignancy.SPECT images of the brain were obtained at 30 min and 3 hr after intravenous administration of approximately 555 MBq 99mTc(V)-DMSA in patients with brain tumors. Sixty studies were performed in 57 patients and 63 lesions were demonstrated: 11 glioblastomas, 13 anaplastic astrocytomas (Grade 3), 11 astrocytomas (Grade 2), 18 meningiomas and 10 schwannomas. Uptake ratios, retention ratio and retention index were calculated and compared with tumor histology and malignancy grade.Approximately 95% of both benign and malignant primary brain tumors were demonstrated by 99mTc(V)-DMSA SPECT images. False negative was noted in three cases. The early uptake ratios were closely related to the tumor vascularity but had no statistically significant difference in the tumor histology or histologic malignancy. The delayed uptake ratio, retention ratio and retention index were higher in the malignant tumors than the benign tumors.Technetium-99m(V)-DMSA washout from the tumor was highly dependent upon its histology and histologic malignancy. The delayed uptake ratio considerably reflected tumor histology and differentiated benign tumors from malignant tumors. The retention ratio and retention index significantly reflected tumor histology and histologic grade of primary brain tumors and clearly distinguished between benign and malignant tumors with statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). These results could suggest the clinical utility of 99mTc(V)-DMSA in imaging primary brain tumors and differentiating their histological malignancy grade noninvasively.
