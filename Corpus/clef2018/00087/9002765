SPECT imaging with 111In-octreotide for the localization of pancreatic insulinoma. We evaluated the sensitivity of 111In-Octreotide scintigraphy in the diagnosis of pancreatic insulinoma in a selected number of patients. In addition, we compared the results of scintigraphy with those of other conventional diagnostic techniques. Seven patients with surgically confirmed insulinoma (< 1.5 cm in diameter) of the pancreas were studied. Before surgery, patients underwent arteriography with Ca-gluconate, CT scan, and 111In-Octreotide scintigraphy. 111In-Octreotide scintigraphy showed a higher diagnostic specificity (85%) than selective arteriography (83%) or CT scan (57%). We conclude that 111In-Octreotide scintigraphy should always be performed before surgery in cases of pancreatic insulinoma and that a SPECT acquisition should be performed both 6 and 24 hours post-injection in order to increase the diagnostic sensitivity of the test.
