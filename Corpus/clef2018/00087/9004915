Biological studies of analogues of glucose iodinated in positions 1, 2, or 3. Analogues of glucose labeled with 123 iodine in positions 1, 2 or 3 have been synthesized. The aim of this study was to examine their biological behavior in four experimental models in order to assess whether they could be used to evaluate the uptake of glucose with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The results obtained have shown that none of these molecules enters the cell using the glucose transporter. Therefore, they cannot be used as tracers of glucose uptake.
