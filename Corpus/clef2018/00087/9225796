Adenosine coronary vasodilation in coronary artery disease: technetium-99m tetrofosmin myocardial tomography versus echocardiography. This study compared the results of adenosine 99mTc-tetrofosmin cardiac tomography with those of adenosine echocardiography in identifying patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and in localizing individual stenosed, coronary vessels.Twenty-six consecutive patients with suspected or known CAD had simultaneous adenosine (140 micrograms/Kg/min intravenously) 99mTc-tetrofosmin tomography and two-dimensional echocardiography. All patients had coronary angiography within 4 wk from imaging studies. Regional 99mTc-tetrofosmin activity was quantitatively measured in 78 coronary vascular territories and echocardiographic left ventricular function was assessed in corresponding regions.At coronary angiography one patient had normal coronary vessels, 12 patients one-vessel and 13 had multivessel disease (> or = 50% luminal stenosis). Among the 25 patients with CAD, 22 showed perfusion defects at adenosine 99mTc-tetrofosmin tomography (sensitivity 88%) and 17 had abnormal echocardiographic study (sensitivity 68%, p < 0.05 versus 99mTc-tetrofosmin). Agreement for the identification of patients with CAD between adenosine 99mTc-tetrofosmin tomography and echocardiography was observed in 21 (81%) of the total 26 patients, with a kappa value of 0.45. Overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy for detection of individual stenosed vessels were 79%, 88% and 83% for 99mTc tetrofosmin and 57%, 68% and 61% (all p < 0.05 versus 99mTc-tetrofosmin) for echocardiography. Concordance between adenosine 99mTc-tetrofosmin tomography and echocardiography in the detection of individual stenosed coronary vessels was observed in 57 (73%) of the 78 vascular territories, with a kappa value of 0.36.Adenosine-induced coronary vasodilation associated with quantitative 99mTc-tetrofosmin tomography is more accurate than adenosine echocardiography in identifying patients with CAD and in detecting individual stenosed coronary vessels.
