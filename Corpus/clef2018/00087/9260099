CD62, thromboxane B2, and beta-thromboglobulin: a comparison between different markers of platelet activation after contact with biomaterials. The authors examined the modifications of some markers of platelet activation after contact with biomaterials. Glycoprotein GMP-140 (CD62) was evaluated by flow cytometry beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) were determined by radioimmunoassay. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) induced a remarkable platelet adhesion and a significant increase in beta-TG and TXB2, with no increase in CD62 on the nonadherent platelets. Pyrolytic carbon-coated PET (PC) did not induce platelet adhesion after 15 min of contact, but a significant increase in CD62 was detected. After 30 min a significant increase in platelet adhesion as well as the release of beta-TG and TXB2 were noted. The increase was lower than that observed for uncoated PET, and after 30 min of contact with PC the increase no longer was observed.
