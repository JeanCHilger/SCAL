Randomised controlled trial: comparison of colloid or crystalloid for partial exchange transfusion for treatment of neonatal polycythaemia. To compare the efficacy of using isotonic saline (crystalloid) or 5% albumin (colloid) as replacement fluid in partial exchange transfusion (PET) for the treatment of neonatal polycythaemia.One hundred and two polycythaemic full term infants were randomly allocated to receive PET with either isotonic saline or 5% albumin. The criteria for PET were: (a) venous haematocrit > or = 0.7 or (b) venous haematocrit 0.65-0.69 with symptoms or signs attributable to polycythaemia.PET with either saline (n = 53) or 5% albumin (n = 50) resulted in a significant and sustained decline in haematocrit up to 24 hours after PET. Although the immediate haemodilution effect of isotonic saline was statistically smaller than that of 5% albumin (decline in haematocrit 19.3% vs 22.8% of pre-PET value), the difference was too small to be of any clinical significance, and the haematocrit at 4 or 24 hours after PET did not differ significantly between the two groups. PET with either replacement fluid was not associated with any complication. The serum sodium and potassium concentrations were not significantly affected by the PET in either group.Both isotonic saline and 5% albumin are effective when used as replacement fluid in PET for the treatment of neonatal polycythaemia. Isotonic saline, which is cheaper and free of infection, should be the replacement fluid of choice.
