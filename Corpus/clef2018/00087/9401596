The activation pattern in normal humans during suppression, imagination and performance of saccadic eye movements. The distribution of activated cerebral regions was examined in nine normal subjects during four different eye movement-related conditions: (1) fixation-fixation on a central light emitting diode (2) saccadic suppression-fixation on a diode in the presence of flashing lateral targets
