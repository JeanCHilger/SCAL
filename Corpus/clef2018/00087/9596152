Tc-99m sestamibi imaging in the diagnostic assessment of patients with lymphomas: comparison with clinical and radiological evaluation. Tc-99m MIBI imaging has been used in nuclear oncology, but its role in detecting lymphomas has not been widely investigated. In this study, 31 patients with lymphomas (20 non-Hodgkin's and 11 Hodgkin's) underwent Tc-99m MIBI whole-body imaging. A total of 74 tumor lesions were detected in 25 patients, while the remaining 6 patients were disease-free. The diagnostic accuracy of MIBI imaging for lesion detection was 85%. A total of 11 unknown tumor lesions in 3 patients were discovered on MIBI scans. Tumor size was significantly (p = 0.01) higher in lesions with increased MIBI uptake (3.5 +/- 2.0 cm) compared with those with no uptake (1.8 +/- 1.0 cm). No false positive MIBI findings were observed. The accuracy of MIBI scintigraphy in patients with Hodgkin's disease was lower (72%) compared to that of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (94%). However, this difference was not related to tumor type, but to lesion size. In fact, tumor size was significantly (p = 0.02) lower in lesions of patients with Hodgkin's disease (2.5 +/- 1.3 cm) compared to those of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (3.7 +/- 2.2 cm). MIBI imaging may be useful in patients with lymphomas for detecting tumor lesions and, hence, may be considered an alternative to gallium scanning, providing better imaging quality. However, the intense Sestamibi activity in the lower chest and abdomen as well as tumor size may limit the diagnostic sensitivity of this radionuclide technique in patients with lymphomas.
