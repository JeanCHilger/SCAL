Detection of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with head and neck Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT imaging. Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT imaging of the head and neck was performed on 10 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and 10 controls. There was no abnormal nasopharyngeal uptake of tetrofosmin in the 10 controls. In the patients with NPC, 3/10 (30%) of the cases had no abnormal uptake and 7/10 (70%) had increased nasopharyngeal uptake. Considering our preliminary study, we find that Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT of the head and neck may be helpful in the detection of NPC. However, further study with a larger number of patients is needed to ascertain the value of Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT in such cases.
