Evaluation of myocardial perfusion and fatty acid uptake using a single injection of iodine-123-BMIPP in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The purpose of this study was to clarify the possibility of simultaneous evaluation of myocardial perfusion and fatty acid metabolism using a single injection of 123I-beta-methyl-p-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) in patients with acute coronary syndromes.Thirty patients with unstable angina pectoris (UAP group) and 15 patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI group) were studied. BMIPP dynamic SPECT was performed 2 min after the injection of BMIPP (185 MBq), and images were obtained every 3 min for 15 min with a three-head gamma camera. Conventional BMIPP SPECT was also performed 30 min after the injection. Serial BMIPP and resting 201TI images were compared.A 201TI-BMIPP mismatch between 30-min BMIPP and resting 201TI images was observed in 27 of 30 patients in the UAP group and 8 of 15 patients in the MI group, respectively. However, a 201TI-BMIPP mismatch between early (2-5-min) BMIPP and resting 201TI images was observed in only 2 of 30 patients in the UAP group and in only 2 of 15 patients in the MI group, respectively. The kappa statistics of tracer uptake between early BMIPP and resting 201TI images showed good concordance in UAP (kappa = 0.823) and MI (kappa = 0.765) groups, respectively. These results indicated that initial distribution of BMIPP reflects myocardial perfusion in patients with acute coronary syndromes.Myocardial perfusion and fatty acid metabolism can be evaluated simultaneously using a single injection of BMIPP, when images are taken soon (2-5 min) and long after the injection in patients with acute coronary syndromes.
