Pulmonary fibrosis correlates with duration of tissue neutrophil activation. The role of inflammatory cells such as neutrophil granulocytes in the pathogenesis of pulmonary scarring is unclear. We determined the metabolic activity of neutrophils with positron emission tomography (PET) to measure regional uptake of (18F)-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG) following its intravenous injection. Fibrogenic or nonfibrogenic substances were instilled into the right upper lobe of rabbit lungs. Time course and intensity of the 18FDG signal in the affected region varied markedly, depending on the stimulus. Time to peak signal (Tmax) and rate constant for its decline (k) for the test substances were, respectively: C5a 10 h (Tmax), 0.045 +/- 0.030 h-1 (k) Streptococcus pneumoniae 15 h, 0.068 +/- 0.012 h-1
