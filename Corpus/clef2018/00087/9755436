Dual-isotope protocol for indium-111 capromab pendetide monoclonal antibody imaging. A dual-isotope imaging protocol using 99mTc-labeled red blood cells with 111In capromab pendetide monoclonal antibody imaging for detective and localizing nodal metastasis in prostate cancer is described.This protocol involves a single SPECT acquisition that is less time consuming and more comfortable for the patient than the currently recommended method, which requires two separate SPECT acquisitions performed on different days.Forty patients were studied with the dual-isotope protocol. Preliminary data suggest increased accuracy compared with the single-isotope technique.The dual-isotope technique assures the precise image registration needed for accurate comparison of blood pool and pelvic lymph node activity that is required for confident and accurate image interpretation.
