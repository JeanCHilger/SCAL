Pharmacokinetics of methyl palmoxirate, an inhibitor of beta-oxidation, in rats and humans. Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that methyl palmoxirate (MEP), an inhibitor of mitochondrial beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids, can be used to increase incorporation of radiolabeled palmitic acid into brain lipids and reduce beta-oxidation of the fatty acid. Thus, MEP allows the use of carbon labeled palmitate for studying brain lipid metabolism in animals and humans by quantitative autoradiography or positron emission tomography (PET). As it is essential to pretreat human subjects with an acute dose of MEP prior to intravenous injection of [1-11C]palmitate for PET scanning, this study was undertaken to determine the plasma elimination half-life of MEP in rats and human subjects and to provide insight about the drug's absorption and metabolism. A gas chromatographic method was developed to measure MEP in body fluids. Following oral administration of MEP to rats (2.5 and 10 mg/kg) and to humans, the unmetabolized drug could not be detected in plasma or urine (sensitivity of detection was 1 ng). However, when MEP was injected intravenously (10 mg/kg) in rats, a peak initial concentration could be measured in plasma (7.7 microg/mL), the clearance of the drug from plasma was rapid (t1/2 = 0.6 min), which indicates that MEP readily enters tissue lipid pools or is metabolized like long-chain fatty acids. As no adverse experience occured in the 11 human subjects studied, oral administration of a single dose of MEP was safe under the conditions of this study and may be used to increase the incorporation of positron labeled palmitic acid for studying brain lipid metabolism in vivo by PET.
