Cobalt-55 positron emission tomography of ipsilateral thalamic and crossed cerebellar hypometabolism after supratentorial ischaemic stroke. Cobalt-55 (55Co) is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer used to demonstrate brain damage, possibly associated to calcium-mediated processes. The degree of 55Co accumulation correlates with the severity of ischaemia in stroke patients. It is still a matter of debate whether ipsilateral thalamic hypometabolism (ITH) and crossed cerebellar hypometabolism (CCH), occurring after middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarcts, represent only a metabolic depression of these remote regions or can lead to structural damage. The present study investigates whether an increased 55Co influx can be demonstrated with PET in ITH and CCH after MCA infarcts. About half of the patients with ITH and CCH had a significant degree of 55Co uptake in, respectively, the ipsilateral thalamus and the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. It was observed in patients with severe signs of stroke on admission and poor clinical outcome, and correlated well with the degree of 55Co influx within the supratentorial infarct. The present study demonstrates that ITH and CCH after MCA infarction can represent structural damage in these remote areas that occurs during the second week after stroke onset.
