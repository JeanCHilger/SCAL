PET projects: providers like what they see. Advocates of positron emission tomography--PET--see a bright future for a technology that until now has been largely confined to research use because of cost and reimbursement issues. PET, which captures images of cellular activity, or metabolism, offers results that are a step beyond other imaging technologies. As the reimbursement picture changes and new applications are developed, the technology could see rapid growth.
