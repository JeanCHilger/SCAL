Examination of co-complexes for radiolabeling of platelets in positron emission tomographic studies. Oxine, tropolonate, and mercaptopyridine-N-oxide (MPO) have been widely used with 111In for platelet labeling. The use of positron emission tomography (PET) radioisotopes for platelet labeling would offer a higher sensitivity and resolution over conventional imaging. The medium half-life PET radioisotope 55Co (t1/2 = 18.2 hours) would enable quantitative uptake and cell kinetic studies with radiolabeled platelets. To identify the optimal complex for radiolabeling of platelets with 55Co, we investigated the platelet uptake of 57Co-oxine, 57Co-tropolonate, and 57Co-MPO in varying different parameters. The platelet uptake of Co-complexes was generally low (5-12%), dependent on time and temperature of incubation and density of platelets but independent of the amount of radioactivity. These findings are not promising for potential PET application.
