Positron tomography: the case for reimbursement. Positron emission tomography (PET) is now being used clinically in several institutions. It makes available unique information, which is important in managing patients with brain tumors, epilepsy, and dementia. PET provides information that is important in patients being considered for myocardial revascularization because it can differentiate ischemic, viable myocardium from infarcted myocardium. Third-party payers, including Medicare, are presently reviewing PET for reimbursement. Clinical PET centers are increasing in number, and they will continue to provide data to document the clinical information available from PET.
