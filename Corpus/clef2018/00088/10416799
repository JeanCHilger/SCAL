A standardized blood sampling scheme in quantitative FDG-PET studies. Quantitative estimation of brain glucose metabolism (rCMRGlc) with positron emission tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose involves arterial blood sampling to estimate the delivery of radioactivity to the brain. Usually, for an intravenous injection of 30 s duration, an accurate input curve requires a frequency of one sample every 5 s or less to determine the peak activity in arterial plasma during the first 2 min after injection. In this work, 13 standardized sampling times were shown to be sufficient to accurately define the input curve. This standardized input curve was subsequently fitted by a polynomial function for its rising part and by spectral analysis for its decreasing part. Using the measured, the standardized, and the fitted input curves, rCMRGlc was estimated in 32 cerebral regions of interest in 20 normal volunteers. Comparison of rCMRGlc values obtained with the measured and the fitted input curves showed that both procedures gave consistent results, with a maximal relative error in mean rCMRGlc of 1% when using the autoradiographic method and 2% using kinetic analysis of dynamic data. This input-curve-fitting technique, which is not dependent on the peak time occurrence, allows an accurate determination of the input-curve shape from reduced sampling schemes.
