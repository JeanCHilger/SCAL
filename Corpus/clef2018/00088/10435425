Tc-99m labeled red blood cells scintigraphy: a diagnostic method for orbital cavernous hemangioma. To evaluate Tc-99m labeled red blood cells scintigraphy (Tc-99m RBC scintigraphy) as a diagnostic method for orbital cavernous hemangioma.Retrospective analysis of the medical records of all patients who were diagnosed as suffering from orbital cavernous hemangioma over the last 16 years.Medical records of 12 patients with orbital cavernous hemangioma were identified. In all twelve patients, the tentative diagnosis of orbital cavernous hemangioma was made by CT scan. In all of them, the diagnosis was established by Tc-99m RBC scintigraphy, demonstrating a typical picture of "perfusion blood- pool mismatch" (This is normal radionuclide angiography, followed by a variable radionuclide uptake during the early blood-pool study and an intensive radionuclide uptake during the delayed blood-pool study). The tumor was surgically removed in all 12 patients. This diagnostic method was found to be reliable as no single case was recorded in which the preoperative diagnosis was not confirmed pathologically after surgical removal of the tumor.Tc-99m RBC scintigraphy is a reliable method for diagnosing orbital cavernous hemangioma. It should be included in our arsenal of diagnostic techniques, particularly for cases which are otherwise difficult to diagnose.
