Myocardial blood flow at rest and contractile reserve in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. The mechanisms that determine chronic left ventricular dysfunction in coronary artery disease (in particular, critical reductions in coronary artery blood flow leading to hibernating myocardium) may affect the ability of the myocardium to respond to inotropic stimulation with dobutamine. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between resting myocardial blood flow and contractile reserve in patients with coronary artery disease and chronic left ventricular dysfunction.Twenty-three patients (21 men and 2 women age 61 +/- 9 years) underwent transesophageal echocardiography during infusion of dobutamine (2.5 microg/kg to 40 microg/kg per minute) and positron emission tomography (PET) with 150-water (9 patients) or 13N-ammonia (14 patients). Systolic wall thickening at each dose of dobutamine and resting myocardial blood flow were quantitatively analyzed in 8 anatomically matched regions at mid-ventricular level. Myocardial regions with preserved contraction had higher blood flow compared with regions with basal dyssynergy (0.99 +/- 0.3 vs 0.65 +/- 0.3 mL/min/gmThese findings emphasize the importance of resting myocardial blood flow for the preservation of contractile reserve in patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. Because a positive inotropic response to dobutamine is more likely to occur in dyssynergic regions with preserved rather than reduced myocardial blood flow, regional perfusion may determine in which circumstances dobutamine echocardiography contributes to the assessment of myocardial viability.
