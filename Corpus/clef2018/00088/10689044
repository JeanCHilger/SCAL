Asymmetric frontal activation during episodic memory: the effects of stimulus type on encoding and retrieval. Recent functional neuroimaging studies have suggested that the left prefrontal cortex is preferentially involved in the encoding of episodic memory whilst the right prefrontal cortex is preferentially involved in the retrieval of episodic memory, irrespective of the type (e.g. modality) of information being remembered. In the present PET activation study, a 2 x 2 design was employed to investigate the relationship between encoding and retrieval of verbal and non-verbal material in episodic memory. Accordingly, seven healthy volunteers were scanned whilst encoding and then recalling stimuli which either emphasised visual or verbal processes. When encoding and retrieval tasks were compared directly, significantly greater prefrontal activation was observed in the encoding conditions, regardless of modality, although these changes were bilaterally distributed. In contrast when the verbal and visual memory tasks were compared directly, the former was associated with rCBF changes that were predominantly located in the left lateral frontal cortex whilst the latter was associated with rCBF changes that were predominantly located in the right lateral frontal cortex. These results suggest that encoding and retrieval may actually involve similar regions of the lateral prefrontal cortex when all factors relating to the type of stimulus material (i.e. modality), are appropriately controlled.
