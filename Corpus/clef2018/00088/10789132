Evaluation of diagnostic scores via intercategorial kappa coefficients. A study design for the evaluation and confirmed modification of diagnostic rules is described. Based on the assessment of intercategorial rater agreement, those categories, which cause confusion in multiple ratings, can be combined and the gain in rater agreement can be assessed by the computation of appropriately modified kappa measures. The proposal is illustrated by the analysis of an evaluation trial related to SPECT based classification of patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy.
