Standardized annotation of nuclear medicine images. There are no generally accepted standards for annotating nuclear medicine images. This is a potential problem whenever hardcopies from other centers are being evaluated, reinterpreted or compared to actual images of the same patient. Proposals for image annotation are elaborated to support image evaluation by a third party. In this paper, examples are given of lung scintigraphy, thyroid scintigraphy, bone scintigraphy both in planar and SPECT techniques, renal function scintigraphy, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, and PET. They are presented to stimulate discussion in the nuclear medicine community.
