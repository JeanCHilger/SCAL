Positron emission tomography with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose to evaluate response of early breast carcinoma treated with stereotaxic interstitial laser therapy. Stereotaxic interstitial laser therapy is a promising new alternative to surgery to treat early-stage breast cancer. With this, laser energy coagulates the tumor with controlled heat, leading to fibrosis. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) scanning was performed in four patients treated by this technique to determine the degree of necrosis after interstitial laser therapy. The results showed that FDG PET scanning was in close agreement with histopathologic findings, confirming complete necrosis in one patient and variable response in the other three patients. Uptake of FDG appears to be a reliable means to monitor treatment response after interstitial laser therapy and may be useful in the management of breast cancer when used with this new procedure.
