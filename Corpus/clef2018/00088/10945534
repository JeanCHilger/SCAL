Relative impact of scatter, collimator response, attenuation, and finite spatial resolution corrections in cardiac SPECT. We determined the relative effect of corrections for scatter, depth-dependent collimator response, attenuation, and finite spatial resolution on various image characteristics in cardiac SPECT.Monte Carlo simulations and real acquisition of a 99mTc cardiac phantom were performed under comparable conditions. Simulated and acquired data were reconstructed using several correction schemes that combined different methods for scatter correction (3 methods), depth-dependent collimator response correction (frequency-distance principle), attenuation correction (nonuniform Chang correction or within an iterative reconstruction algorithm), and finite spatial resolution correction (use of recovery coefficients). Five criteia were considered to assess the effect of the processing schemes: bull's-eye map (BEM) uniformity, contrast between the left ventricle (LV) wall and the LV cavity, spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and percent errors with respect to the known LV wall and liver activities.Similar results were obtained for the simulated and acquired data. Scatter correction significantly improved contrast and absolute quantitation but did not have noticeable effects on BEM uniformity or on spatial resolution and reduced the SNR. Correction for the depth-dependent collimator response improved spatial resolution from 13.3 to 9.5 mm in the LV region, improved absolute quantitation and contrast, but reduced the SNR. Correcting for attenuation was essential for restoring BEM uniformity (78% and 89% without and with attenuation correction, respectively [ideal value being 100%]) and accurate absolute activity quantitation (errors in estimated LV wall and liver activity decreased from 90% without attenuation correction to approximately20% with attenuation correction only). Although accurate absolute activity quantitation was achieved in the liver using scatter and attenuation corrections only, correction for finite spatial resolution was needed to estimate LV wall activity within 10%.The respective effects of corrections for scatter, depth-dependent collimator response, attenuation, and finite spatial resolution on different image features in cardiac SPECT were quantified for a specific acquisition configuration. These results give indications regarding the improvements to be expected when using a specific processing scheme involving some or all corrections.
