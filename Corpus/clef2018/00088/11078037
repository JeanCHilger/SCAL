Genetic studies of panic disorder: a review. A review of the studies examining the genetic etiology of panic disorder shows the familial nature of the disorder and demonstrates that the etiology is greatly influenced by genetic factors. Strong evidence for vertical transmission in family studies led to molecular genetic studies, of which association designs appear promising, particularly when based on trait markers.The MEDLINE and PsycLIT databases were searched for all reports published between 1966 and 2000 containing the keywords panic, genetic, twin, adoption, linkage, association, and QTL.We conclude that the multifactorial nature of panic disorder requires a multidisciplinary approach to gain insight into the determinants of the phenotype and the interaction of environmental and genetic factors.
