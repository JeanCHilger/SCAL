Noninvasive diagnosis of brain tumours in children. The author reviews the progress made during the last 25 years in noninvasive diagnosis of brain tumours in children. MRI has replaced all other modalities available at that time. The diagnosis is still based on a precise anatomical analysis of the lesion rather than on other specific findings. New techniques, such as spectroscopy and diffusion, may help to characterise further brain tumours in children preoperatively.
