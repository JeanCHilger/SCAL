The role of L-3-I-123-iodine-alpha-methyltyrosine SPECT in cerebral gliomas. L-3-I-123-iodine-alpha-methyltyrosine (IMT) is a I-123-labelled amino acid which has been used for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of cerebral gliomas for more than a decade. IMT-SPECT is able to detect tumor infiltration independent of disruptions of the blood-brain barrier which is often difficult with computed tomography or magnetic resonance tomography. The method is useful to detect tumor recurrences and helps to distinguish gliomas from non-neoplastic brain masses. IMT-SPECT is thus a valuable tool in the diagnostic evaluation and in therapy planning of patients with cerebral gliomas.
