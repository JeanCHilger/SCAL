99Tc(m)-ECD SPET perfusion changes by internal pallidum stimulation in Parkinson's disease. High-frequency stimulation of the internal pallidum is an effective surgical approach for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease suffering from motor fluctuations and L-dopa induced dyskinesia. To study the acute effects of internal pallidum stimulation, changes in cerebral blood flow were measured by means of a single-day split-dose protocol using 99Tc(m)-ECD SPET. Nine patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and with a clinical picture predominated by tremor and drug-induced dyskinesia, were imaged before and immediately after electrostimulation. Brain perfusion data were mirrored to the same electrode side (five left and four right implants), co-registered and analysed statistically on a voxel-by-voxel basis (Statistical Parametric Mapping) and by an automated volume-of-interest approach. Acute stimulation of the internal pallidum induced a significantly decreased perfusion in the ipsilateral thalamus and striatum, as well as in the right parietal cortex. For the subgroup of seven patients with effective motor score improvements, a significant correlation between thalamic and striatal perfusion changes and UPDRS III motor score was present (P = 0.04). These results suggest that effective stimulation of the internal globus pallidus may produce symptom relief through decreased activity in pallido-thalamo-cortical circuits.
