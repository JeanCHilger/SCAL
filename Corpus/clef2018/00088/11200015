Regional cerebral blood flow in schizophrenia before and after neuroleptic medication. In order to investigate cerebral perfusion changes induced by neuroleptic drugs, we performed 99Tc(m) hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPET). Fifteen patients (nine drug naive, six non-naive) diagnosed by using the DSM-III-R criteria, and 10 right-handed age and sex matched normal volunteers were included in this study. The SPET study was performed with 740 MBq 99Tc(m)-HMPAO by using a 128 x 128 matrix, 30 s/frame for a total 64 view over 360 degrees before and after 1 month of neuroleptic treatment. A semiquantitative method was used for the analysis. Patients were clinically assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). There was no significant regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) difference between the patient group and control group in whole-brain regions except in the left temporal lobe. Although clinical scores of the patients improved after neuroleptic treatment no statistically significant difference was found in the rCBF between pre- and post-treatment. Moreover, there was no statistically significant correlation between the rCBF and BPRS in any region. These results suggest that there was a discrepancy between the clinical situation and rCBF in schizophrenia and the lateralized temporal lobe blood flow, which may have important implications for the evaluation of patients with schizophrenia.
