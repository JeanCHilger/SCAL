Memory function in patients with Parkinson's disease: in relation to neuropsychological tests and cerebral blood flow. We conducted a neuropsychological comparison between Parkinson's disease (PD n = 24) and healthy control subjects (n = 12) using Rey's auditory-verbal learning test (RAVLT) and the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test (RCFT) assessing memory function. In addition, to determine the function of cortical and subcortical areas, we measured the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using N-isopropyl-p[123I]-iodoamhetamine (123I-IMP) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and analyzed the relationships between brain regions and memory function. On the RAVLT, significant group differences in recall words were found on all learning trials between patients with PD and control subjects, whereas recognition, learning rate and forgetting rate were basically the same. In addition, the primacy/recency effect was statistically equal for both groups. Results suggest faulty retrieval mechanisms in PD, whereas encoding and retention procesess did not prove to be affected. There were significant correlations between perfusion of the prefrontal and parietal cortices and total number of free recall in five trials. On the RCFT, recalls after 30 sec and 30 min were impaired in patients with PD although no significant difference in accuracy scores obtained in copy was noted. A percent recall score calculated using the formula 100 x [1 - (copy-recall)/copy] was also decreased in patients with PD. There were significant correlations between perfusion of the occipital and parietal cortices and percent recall score. Our data suggest that auditory memory deficits based on the RAVLT in PD may be mainly related to frontal and parietal cortical dysfunction, while visual recall deficits based on the RCFT may be related to the parieto-occipital cortical dysfunction.
