Enhanced oxygen extraction and reduced flow heterogeneity in exercising muscle in endurance-trained men. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of endurance training on skeletal muscle hemodynamics and oxygen consumption. Seven healthy endurance-trained and seven untrained subjects were studied. Oxygen uptake, blood flow, and blood volume were measured in the quadriceps femoris muscle group by use of positron emission tomography and [15O]O2, [15O]H2O, and [15O]CO during rest and one-legged submaximal intermittent isometric exercise. The oxygen extraction fraction was higher (0.49 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.12 P = 0.017) and blood transit time longer (0.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.1 min
