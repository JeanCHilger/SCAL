The contrast between chemotherapy via pelvic retroperitoneal cannulation and intraperitoneal chemotherapy in gynecological malignancies cancers with lymph node metastases. To contrast the pelvic retroperitoneal (RP) chemotherapy with intraperitoneal (i.p.) chemotherapy in gynecological malignancies with lymph node metastases.Fluorouracil (5-FU) was repeatedly injected into the pelvic retroperitoneal space of 43 patients and the abdominal cavity of 11 patients. High performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the drug concentration of 5-FU. 5-FU was repeatedly injected into the pelvic retroperitoneal space of 16 patients via cannulation to observe the nodal 5-FU concentration of injected side and the control side. 99mTc-Sb2S3, Isovist-300 were injected into the pelvic retroperitoneal space of two groups (each one has 3 patients) respectively via cannulation. Single proton emission computer tomography (SPECT) and X-Ray film were taken to observe the allocation of the drugs.(1) Pelvic and periaortic nodal 5-FU concentrations of RP were 60-106 and 76-119 times of that of i.p. respectively. (2) The nodal 5-FU concentrations on repeated injection side were 16-20 times of that on control sides of RP. (3) There was no complications or adverse effect observed. (4) 5-FU was allocated to the space including the external iliac, internal iliac, obturator, deep inguinal and common iliac lymph nodes and also up to the periaortic lymph nodes.RP was more effective than i.p. for the treatment of lymphatic metastasis of gynecologic cancer.
