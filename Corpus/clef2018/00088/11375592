Echo-enhanced color- and power-Doppler EUS for the discrimination between focal pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma. EUS is a precise method for detection and staging of pancreatic tumors. However, differentiation between inflammatory pseudotumor and pancreatic carcinoma remains difficult. The aim of this study was to evaluate contrast-enhanced EUS as a method of differentiating inflammation and carcinoma based on perfusion characteristics.Patients with solid pancreatic masses underwent EUS with a linear echoendoscope. Perfusion in the pancreatic tissue and the mass was assessed with native and contrast-enhanced EUS with power- and color-Doppler imaging. Examinations were evaluated by a blinded reader. A markedly hyperperfused lesion was considered an inflammatory pseudotumor whereas lesions that were hypoperfused compared with surrounding tissue were considered to be carcinoma.Fifteen of 23 patients had hypoperfusion within the mass and 8 patients had hyperperfused lesions. Of the 15 patients with hypoperfused masses, all had pancreatic adenocarcinoma 1 of 8 patients with a hyperperfused lesion also had adenocarcinoma. The remaining 7 patients had focal inflammation. Sensitivity for differentiation of pancreatic carcinoma versus inflammatory changes was 94%, specificity 100%.Echo-enhanced power-Doppler EUS reliably differentiates pancreatic neoplasm and focal pancreatitis. The diagnostic accuracy of this technique is comparable to CT, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and ERCP.
