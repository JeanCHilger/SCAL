Hippocampal formation glucose metabolism and volume losses in MCI and AD. We used MRI volume sampling with coregistered and atrophy corrected FDG-PET scans to test three hypotheses: 1) hippocampal formation measures are superior to temporal neocortical measures in the discrimination of normal (NL) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 2) neocortical measures are most useful in the separation of Alzheimer disease (AD) from NL or MCI
