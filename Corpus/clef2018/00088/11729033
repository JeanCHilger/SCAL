Pindolol augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: PET evidence that the dose used in clinical trials is too low. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to examine whether the dose of pindolol used to augment antidepressant medication achieves a significant occupancy of the serotonin type 1A (5-HT(1A)) autoreceptor in depressed patients receiving medication.The authors examined eight depressed patients on one of two regimes of pindolol (2.5 mg t.i.d. and 5.0 mg t.i.d.) with PET and [11C]WAY-100635.The 5-mg t.i.d. regime achieved a modest (19%) but significant occupancy of the 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor, while the regime used in the vast majority of clinical trials (2.5 mg t.i.d.) did not achieve a significant occupancy.The dose of pindolol used in clinical trials is suboptimal and may explain the inconsistent results. Therefore, a thorough test of pindolol's efficacy will necessitate doses higher than those used in present clinical trials.
