Impact of daily life myocardial ischemia in patients with chronic reversible and irreversible myocardial dysfunction. Repetitive myocardial ischemia during daily life has been suggested as the underlying mechanism of reversible myocardial dysfunction, which may progress into a hibernating state. Thirty-seven patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 35 +/- 7%) underwent positron emission tomography (N-13 ammonia and 18-F-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose [FDG]) and exercise testing before coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and 48- hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring to detect ischemia before CABG and 6 months postoperatively. Reversibility of regional myocardial dysfunction was detected by echocardiographic follow-up at 5 days, 2 months, and 6 months after the operation. Preoperatively, ischemic episodes during daily activities were more common (2 [25th to 75th percentiles 0 to 4] vs 0 episodes, p <0.01) and duration of ischemia longer (9 [25th to 75th percentiles 0 to 37] vs 0 [25th to 75th percentiles 0 to 1] minutes, p <0.02) in patients with reversible dysfunction (n = 15) than in patients with irreversible dysfunction (n = 22). The number of ischemic episodes per patient correlated with the numbers of reversibly dysfunctional segments (p = 0.003), viable segments as seen by positron emission tomography (p <0.05), and flow-metabolic mismatch segments (p <0.05). CABG eliminated ambulatory ischemic episodes in patients with reversible dysfunction (0 episodes, p <0.05 vs before CABG). Preoperatively, all patients with reversible dysfunction had a positive exercise test (14 of 15 patients), whereas daily life ischemia was present in 60% of patients. Reversibly dysfunctional segments in patients with ambulatory ischemia had faster recovery of function (15 of 28 patients vs 2 of 12 patients recovered at 5 days, p <0.05), higher FDG uptake (0.86 +/- 0.19% vs 0.71 +/- 0.24%, p <0.05) than in patients without ambulatory ischemia, whereas perfusion was similar (0.63 +/- 0.20 and 0.62 +/- 0.19 ml/g/min). Thus, exercise-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with reversibility of myocardial dysfunction, but not all patients with reversible ischemic cardiomyopathy have ischemic attacks during daily life.
