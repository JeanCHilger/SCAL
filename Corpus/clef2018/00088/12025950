Relationship between regional 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 13N ammonia uptake in normal myocardium assessed by positron emission tomography: patterns of mismatch and effects of aging. Increased regional myocardial 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) uptake in relation to 13N ammonia (13NH3) uptake--i.e. glucose metabolism-blood flow 'mismatch'--appears to be a strong indicator of myocardial viability in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and regionally reduced contractile function. Reference values of regional 18FDG and 13NH3 uptake have not been determined in healthy subjects with the target age for the development of IHD. We therefore studied healthy middle-aged and old men using positron emission tomography (PET). Twenty-three healthy men aged 51 to 83 years of age were studied. 18FDG and 13NH3 uptake was quantified in 16 myocardial segments with PET and circumferential profile analysis. The relative 18FDG/13NH3 uptake was considerably heterogeneous with 18FDG uptake consistently higher than 13NH3 uptake in the left lateral ventricular wall. This regional 'mismatch' pattern was observed in all subjects, but was most prominent in middle-aged men. The observed age-dependency was the result of a progressive increased in 13NH3 uptake with advancing age in the left ventricular lateral wall. Age-matched reference values of myocardial 18FDG and 13NH3 uptake appears to be important for the discrimination between physiological and pathological glucose metabolism-blood flow mismatch assessed by PET and circumferential profile analysis.
