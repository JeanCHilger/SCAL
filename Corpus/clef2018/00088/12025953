The use of Gd-DTPA as a marker of myocardial viability in reperfused acute myocardial infarction. At present, accurate assessment of the extent of myocardial viability after acute myocardial infarction is limited due to the spatial resolution of currently available imaging modalities. MR cardiac imaging, with its superior spatial resolution, would be used if viable and infarcted tissue could be separated based on signal intensity. In infarcted tissue, cell membrane breakdown allows the entry of the MR contrast agent Gd-DTPA which is normally extracellular. The increased space for Gd-DTPA distribution (partition coefficient, lambda) in this infarcted tissue results in increased Gd-DTPA concentration and hence increased signal intensity on T1-weighted MR images. In a canine model of ischemia/reperfusion injury, the partition coefficient in infarcted tissue increased as early as 1 min post reperfusion. lambda in infarcted tissue stayed increased over that in normal tissue for at least 8 weeks. The accuracy of contrast-enhanced MRI was confirmed by results of 201Tl SPECT and a cine MRI dobutamine wall motion study in a patient 1 week after an acute myocardial infarction. Thus, contrast-enhanced MRI shows great promise for the non-invasive determination of myocardial viability after acute myocardial infarction.
