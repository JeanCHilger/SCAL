Cloning and Expression of Targeting CuZn-SOD to Central Nervous System. Oxygen-derived free radicals are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of a wide range of neurological disorders. Targeted delivery of CuZn-SOD to neurons in central nervous system may have therapeutic value in such diseases. The gene encoding human CuZn-SOD was fused to tetanus toxin fragment C geneto construct a fusion gene, then it was cloned into prokaryotic expression vector pET-22b( ) and baculovirus vector pFastBacHTb, and was expressed in E.coli and Tn-5B1-4 cells, respectively. The recombinant fusion protein has a subunit molecular mass of 68 kD and is recognized by both anti-CuZn-SOD and anti-tetanustoxin antibody. By pyrogallol autooxidation assay, it is shown that the CuZn-SOD moiety retains substantial enzymatic activity, where the TTC moiety might deliver the fusion protein to neurons in central nervous system. So, CuZn-SOD/TTC may be a useful agent for the targeted delivery of CuZn-SOD to neurons.
