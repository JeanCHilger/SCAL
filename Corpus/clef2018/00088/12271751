Age-related differences in face processing: a meta-analysis of three functional neuroimaging experiments. Differences between young and old adults in brain activity, measured with positron emission tomography, were examined during three face processing experiments: episodic memory, working memory, and degraded face perception. Each experiment contained an easy face matching condition and a more difficult processing condition. Young adults showed greater activity in bilateral prefrontal cortex during the memory tasks, compared to face matching, but no difference in prefrontal activity between degraded and nondegraded perception. Older adults, on the other hand, had greater prefrontal activity in both memory and degraded perceptual tasks compared to matching. This suggests that increased prefrontal activity is task-specific in young adults, but, in old adults, is a more general response to increased cognitive effort or need for resources. These data are consistent with the dedifferentiation hypothesis of aging, and suggest a possible neural mechanism for this dedifferentiation, such that dependence on prefrontal activity across a greater number of tasks could also increase the amount of covariance across these tasks.
