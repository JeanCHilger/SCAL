Electromyography as a recording system for eyeblink conditioning with functional magnetic resonance imaging. This study was designed to develop a suitable method of recording eyeblink responses while conducting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Given the complexity of this behavioral setup outside of the magnet, this study sought to adapt and further optimize an approach to eyeblink conditioning that would be suitable for conducting event-related fMRI experiments. This method involved the acquisition of electromyographic (EMG) signals from the orbicularis oculi of the right eye, which were subsequently amplified and converted into an optical signal outside of the head coil. This optical signal was converted back into an electrical signal once outside the magnet room. Electromyography (EMG)-detected eyeblinks were used to measure responses in a delay eyeblink conditioning paradigm. Our results indicate that: (1) electromyography is a sensitive method for the detection of eyeblinks during fMRI (2) minimal interactions or artifacts of the EMG signal were created from the magnetic resonance pulse sequence
