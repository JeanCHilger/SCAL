FDG positron emission tomography in patients with systemic mastocytosis. Systemic mastocytosis is a hematologic neoplasm characterized by abnormal accumulation and growth of mast cells in one or more organ systems. We analyzed five patients with systemic mastocytosis referred for FDG positron emission tomography who had biopsy-proven mast cell infiltrates in various organs.Our findings indicate that FDG positron emission tomography is not useful for staging and follow-up of aggressive systemic mastocytosis.
