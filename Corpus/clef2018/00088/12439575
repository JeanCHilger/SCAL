Optimal inversion time for acquiring flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery images to quantify regional cerebral blood flow. The purpose of this study was to correlate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measured by I-123-IMP and flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) studies with different inversion time (TI) values to find out the optimum TI that gives comparable rCBF and images on FAIR study. Nine patients with symptoms and signs of internal carotid or major cerebral arterial stenosis were enrolled in this study. Both I-123-IMP single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and FAIR images were acquired in all patients. Single-slice FAIR images (with different TI values) were acquired using a 1.5-T MRI unit. The rCBF was calculated from all I-123-IMP and FAIR images. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to detect hypoperfused segments on FAIR images. The rCBF calculated from FAIR and I-123-IMP studies were compared and correlated with each other. The ROC analysis showed no significant differences among the readers or TI values, but a trend of higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy was observed with TI of 1400 ms. The rCBF values of FAIR and I-123-IMP studies significantly correlated with each other. The FAIR images with TI value of 1400 ms gave more comparable CBF. A TI value of 1400 ms might be optimum for 1.5-T MR strength to get high quality FAIR images and comparable CBF.
