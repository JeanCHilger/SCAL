New techniques for staging esophageal cancer. Correct staging is essential for treatment selection, discussion of prognosis, and scientific communication. The CT scan has long been the essential tool for staging esophageal cancer and still remains valuable for initial screening for distant metastases. The development of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), with EUS fine-needle aspiration, positron emission tomography, and minimally invasive surgical staging via thoracoscopy and laparoscopy has resulted in more precise staging. These new tools will allow better definition of patient subsets that may benefit from selected therapies and clinical investigations.
