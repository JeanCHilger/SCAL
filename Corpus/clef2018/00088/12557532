Review on image reconstruction for positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) is one of the most important applications in nuclear medicine and has become a powerful tool for scientific research. This paper is a symposium of the current status of image reconstruction for PET. The latest advances in the field of filtered-backprojection algorithm and expectation maximization algorithm are also introduced.
