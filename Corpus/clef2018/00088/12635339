Identification of chemical detected in kiwi fruit during analysis for residual pesticide. An unknown peak was detected in a GC chromatogram of many kiwi fruit extracts during analysis for pesticide residues. It was identified by GC/MS as diphenyl 2-ethylhexyl phosphate (DPEHP), used as a plasticizer and flame retardant. The concentration of DPEHP was investigated in 15 samples of kiwi fruit, and it was detected at between 0.02 and 0.14 microgram/g in 10 of the samples. It might be due to migration of DPEHP into the fruit from the printed portion of the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) package.
