Increased locoregional blood flow in brain tumors after cervical spinal cord stimulation. Patients with high-grade gliomas have poor prognoses following standard treatment. Generally, malignant brain tumors have a decreased blood flow that results in increased resistance to radiation and reduced delivery of chemotherapeutic agents and oxygen. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) on locoregional blood flow in high-grade tumors in the brain.Fifteen patients (11 with Grade III and four with Grade IV brain tumors) had SCS devices inserted prior to scheduled radiotherapy. Both before and after SCS, the patients underwent the following procedures: 1) single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scanning 2) middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow velocity measurements (centimeters/second) with the aid of transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonographyPreliminary data show that SCS can modify locoregional blood flow in high-grade malignant tumors in the brain, thus indicating that SCS could be used to improve blood flow, oxygenation, and drug delivery to such tumors and could be a useful adjuvant in chemoradiotherapy.
