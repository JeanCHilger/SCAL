A comparison of gallium-67 single photon emission computed tomography and computed tomography in mediastinal Hodgkin's disease. The role of gallium-67 single photon emission computed tomography (Ga-67 SPECT) in the assessment of mediastinal Hodgkin's disease was evaluated prospectively. Ga-67 SPECT and computed tomography (CT) were compared and correlated with clinical findings at initial presentation in 30 patients, 6 weeks after treatment, and 6 months later in 20 of the 30 patients. At initial presentation, active disease was detected on both imaging modalities on all occasions. 6 weeks after treatment CT showed residual mediastinal abnormality in 7 patients, whereas Ga-67 SPECT showed abnormal mediastinal tracer uptake in 3 patients. 6 months later CT showed residual mediastinal abnormality in 5 patients whereas all the Ga-67 SPECT studies were negative. Ga-67 SPECT imaging is a useful tool in assessing response to therapy in mediastinal Hodgkin's disease.
