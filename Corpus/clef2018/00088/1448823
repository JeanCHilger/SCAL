99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT with acetazolamide challenge to detect hemodynamic compromise in occlusive cerebrovascular disease. Insufficiency of collateral supply may lead to low-flow infarcts in severe occlusive cerebrovascular disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of technetium-99m-labeled hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to assess hemodynamic compromise in the anterior circulation.Cerebral blood flow before and after 1 g acetazolamide was analyzed by 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT in 21 symptomatic patients with documented extracranial obstructions. SPECT findings were correlated with the results of angiography, transcranial Doppler sonography, and computed tomographic scan.The acetazolamide-induced increase of cerebral blood flow could be reliably monitored by increase of cerebral 99mTc-HMPAO uptake, which varied between 11.4% and 47.6% in the less-affected hemisphere. Increment of hemispheric side-to-side asymmetry of tracer uptake after drug challenge revealed significant restriction of regional vasoreactivity in 11 patients. Agreement in assessing hemodynamic compromise was reached in 81% of patients with ophthalmic artery collaterals on angiography (p < 0.001), in 76% with low-flow infarcts on computed tomographic scan (p < 0.01), and in 91% with markedly reduced flow velocities on transcranial Doppler (p < 0.0001). One patient developed a low-flow infarct in the area predicted by SPECT during follow up.We conclude that 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT with acetazolamide challenge is a useful method for assessment of the adequacy of hemispheric collateral pathways in patients with severe occlusive cerebrovascular disease.
