Unilateral carotid stenosis and impaired cerebral hemispheric vascular reserve. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning with 99TcHMPAO (Ceretec) was used to demonstrate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in sixteen patients with hemodynamically significant unilateral carotid stenosis. All patients were demonstrated by cerebral computed tomography to be without cerebral infarction. When dysautoregulation was induced by intravenous acetazolamide, eight patients demonstrated a perfusion defect ipsilateral to carotid stenosis. Repeat SPECT scanning with dysautoregulation following carotid endarterectomy showed improved or normal cerebral perfusion in seven of these patients. The results suggest that a hemodynamic mechanism for cerebral ischemic events, including transient ischemic attacks (TIA) may be more common than previously suspected. Carotid disobliteration usually improves ipsilateral cerebrovascular reserve in patients with a preoperative perfusion defect.
