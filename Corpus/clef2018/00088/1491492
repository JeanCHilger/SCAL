Quantification of regional cerebral blood flow using 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT and intravenous 133Xe injection method. We converted an absolute value of 133Xe-CBF (initial slope index, ISI) to the three dimensional CBF-SPECT using the intravenous 133Xe injection technique and 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT according to the microsphere model (method A), and the three compartment model described by Lassen et al. (method B): [formula: see text] [formula: see text] where f = flow in the region of interest (ROI), fr = flow in the reference region, C = count density of 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT in the ROI, Cr = count density of 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT in the reference region, and alpha = conversion to clearance ratio of HMPAO. We used alpha value of 1.5, and the whole cerebrum as a reference region. Four asymptomatic subjects and 15 patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease were entered the study. In method A, excellent correlation was seen between ISI and SPECT-CBF in both of the cerebral hemisphere (r = 0.993 p < 0.001, n = 38) and the cerebellar hemisphere (r = 0.901
