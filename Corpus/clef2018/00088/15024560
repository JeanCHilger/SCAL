Fat-pad impingement after total knee arthroplasty with the LCS A/P-Glide system. Early follow-up (15.8 months1-48) of 230 knee replacements with an LCS A/P Glide component indicated an increased occurrence of anterior knee pain due to a fat-pad impingement, necessitating early revision surgery. Unsatisfactory results were observed in 28 knees (12.2%). Thirteen knees (5.7%) were revised on finding the fat-pad impingement, and four knees (1.7%) were scheduled for later revision surgery
