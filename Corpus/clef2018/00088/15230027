Positron emission tomography: a study of PET test-related anxiety. The objective of this study was to determine whether sending an information pamphlet to patients scheduled for a PET test two weeks prior to the appointment date significantly reduced patient anxiety and increased patient knowledge about the test. This study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial in which patients were randomly allocated to receive a mailed information pamphlet (intervention) or no mailed pamphlet two weeks prior to the appointment (usual care). The results of this study suggested that sending information pamphlets to patients scheduled for PET scans did not decrease pre-test levels of patient anxiety or result in increased patient knowledge about test preparation and procedures.
