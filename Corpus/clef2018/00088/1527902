Diagnostic accuracy of single photon emission CT in Alzheimer-type dementia. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 123I-IMP in Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD), we studied 46 ATD patients and 23 healthy controls. The patients fulfilled the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable or definite ATD and were classified as having mild, moderate, and severe ATD by neuropsychological examinations. To assess regional cerebral blood flow, we performed qualitative SPECT image analysis without any knowledge of the subject's clinical classification. The image was regarded as abnormal if cerebral blood flow was reduced in the unilateral or bilateral temporoparietal association areas, with or without any reduction of flow in other brain regions. The diagnostic sensitivity (abnormal image/patient) of 123I-IMP SPECT in mild, moderate, and severe ATD was 67%, 86%, and 92%, respectively. The specificity (normal image/control) was 91%, because an abnormal image was found in only 2/23 healthy controls. Eight ATD patients without reduced temporoparietal perfusion showed normal perfusion or frontal hypoperfusion. These results suggest that 123I-IMP SPECT may provide an accurate and sensitive diagnostic marker for ATD. The detection of these characteristic marker for ATD. The detection of these characteristic abnormalities of cerebral perfusion could well be applied to the clinical diagnosis of ATD.
