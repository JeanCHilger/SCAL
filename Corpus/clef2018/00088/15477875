Combining a targeted radiotherapy and gene therapy approach for adenocarcinoma of prostate. A targeted radiotherapy/gene therapy approach for prostate cancer, using the radiopharmaceutical [(131)I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine ([(131)I]MIBG), would restrict the effects of radiotherapy to malignant cells, thereby increasing efficacy and decreasing morbidity of radiotherapy. Prostate cancer cells were transfected with a transgene encoding the noradrenaline transporter (NAT) under the control of tumour-specific telomerase promoters, enabling them to actively take up [(131)I]MIBG. This led to tumour-specific cell kill. This strategy has the advantage of generating a radiological bystander effect, leading to the destruction of neighbouring tumour cells that have escaped transfection. This targeted approach could be a promising tumour-specific treatment option for prostate cancer.
