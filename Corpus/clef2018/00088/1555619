Exercise echocardiography versus thallium-201 SPECT for assessing patients before and after PTCA. This study was designed (1) to assess the relationship between stress exercise echocardiography (echo) and 201-Tl single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) applied simultaneously in 23 patients who were candidates to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), (2) to assess the relationship between the development of exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities, transient perfusion defects and the severity of quantitatively assessed coronary stenoses and (3) to compare the functional improvement after PTCA by exercise echo and SPECT. Before PTCA there was an agreement of 78% between stress echo (new wall motion abnormalities) and SPECT (transient perfusion defects) results. All patients with a percentage diameter stenosis greater than 70% had a positive echo and SPECT, while they were both negative if the percentage diameter stenosis was less than 50%. In 19 patients re-studied 4 weeks after PTCA, an ischaemic response at stress echo was found in two of the 13 patients who had a positive stress echo test before PTCA, and SPECT was still positive in three of the 10 patients who had a positive SPECT study before PTCA. Echo and SPECT were concordant in 17/19 cases. It is concluded that exercise echo and 201-Tl SPECT are useful non-invasive tools for the functional assessment of patients before and after PTCA, and that they provide highly concordant results.
