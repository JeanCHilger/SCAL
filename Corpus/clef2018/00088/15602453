Radionuclide examination of functional disorders in patients with acute abscess of lung. Potential of radionuclide examination for study of external respiratory function is discussed. Results of examination of 42 patients with lung abscess are analyzed. Procedure of perfusion and ventilating aerosol pulmonoscintigraphy with (99m)Tc-pentatex is described in detail. This procedure permits to examine alveolar-capillary diffusion. Variants of synchronous and asynchronous variations of indices of ventilating-perfusion correlations are demonstrated. These methods are safe and non-invasive. They may be recommended for functional assessment of regional and total characteristics of external respiration of each lung separately, and also for diagnosis of predominance of ventilating or perfusion dysfunction. Clearence of pentatex excretion from right and left lung characterizes integrity of epithelium and alveolar-capillary membrane. It is the index of alveolar-capillary permeability.
