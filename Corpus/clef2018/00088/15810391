Study on the orientation of PET three-dimensional crimp hollow fiber by IR-ATR. The variations of structure and orientation of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) three-dimensional crimp hollow fiber were investigated by infrared attenuated total reflection (IR-ATR) method. It was found that the carbonyl group of this PET hollow fiber orientates vertically to the fiber surface.
