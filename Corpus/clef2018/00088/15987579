Integration of [11C]methionine-positron emission tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging for image-guided surgical resection of infiltrative low-grade brain tumors in children. To evaluate the interest of integrating positron emission tomography (PET) images with the radiolabeled tracer [(11)C]methionine (Met) into the image-guided navigation planning of infiltrative low-grade brain tumors (LGBTs) in children.Twenty-two children underwent combined Met-PET with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in the planning of a navigation procedure. These children presented an LGBT (astrocytomas, 10 oligodendrogliomas, 4In 20 of the 22 children with ill-defined LGBTs, PET improved tumor delineation and contributed to define a final target contour different from that obtained with MRI alone. Met-PET guidance allowed a total resection of Met uptake in 17 cases that were considered total tumor resections because the operative margin left in place contained nontumor tissue.These data suggested that Met-PET guidance could help to improve the number of total resections and the amount of tumor removed in infiltrative LGBTs in children.
