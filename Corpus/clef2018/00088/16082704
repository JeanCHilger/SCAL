Proteomic analysis of protein adsorption: serum amyloid P adsorbs to materials and promotes leukocyte adhesion. Serum and plasma protein adsorption on materials was analyzed using gel electrophoresis and ion trap mass spectrometry. Following incubation of polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with 5% serum for longer than 4 h, we found unexpectedly high amounts of the pentraxin serum amyloid P. It was previously shown that serum amyloid P is constitutively expressed in humans, functions as an opsonin, and interacts with the Fcgamma receptors on leukocytes. We demonstrate that serum amyloid P adsorbed to tissue culture polystyrene, PDMS, and PET promotes the adhesion of granulocytes and monocytes in the presence of calcium. The methods developed for these studies may be useful for the large-scale study of protein adsorption and do not rely on radiolabeling or the availability of antibodies.
