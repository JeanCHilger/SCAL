Hughes syndrome, the antiphospholipid syndrome: a new chapter in neurology. The importance of cerebral disease in patients with the antiphospholipid (Hughes) syndrome (APS) is now becoming more widely recognized. The range of neuropsychiatric manifestations of APS is comprehensive and includes focal symptoms attributable to lesions in a specific area of the brain as well as diffuse or global dysfunction. Patients with APS frequently present with strokes and transient ischemic attacks, but a wide spectrum of other neurologic features, also including nonthrombotic neurological syndromes, has been described in association with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. In this review, we attempt to highlight the large variety of the neurological features of APS.
