Noninvasive targeted imaging of matrix metalloproteinase activation in a murine model of postinfarction remodeling. Time-dependent activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) after myocardial infarction (MI) contributes to adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling however, noninvasive methods to monitor this process serially are needed.MMP-targeted radiotracers were developed that displayed selective binding kinetics to the active MMP catalytic domain. Initial nonimaging studies were performed with a (111)In-labeled MMP-targeted radiotracer ((111)In-RP782) and negative control compound ((111)In-RP788) in control mice (Ctrl) and in mice 1 week after surgically induced MI. Localization of (111)In-RP782 was demonstrated within the MI by microautoradiography. A 334+/-44% increase (P<0.001 versus Ctrl) in relative retention of (111)In-RP782 was confirmed by gamma well counting of myocardium. Subsequent high-resolution dual-isotope planar and hybrid micro-single-photon emission computed tomography/CT imaging studies with an analogous 99mTc-labeled MMP-targeted radiotracer (99mTc-RP805) and 201Tl demonstrated favorable biodistribution and clearance kinetics of 99mTc-RP805 for in vivo cardiac imaging, with robust retention 1 to 3 weeks after MI in regions of decreased 201Tl perfusion. Gamma well counting yielded a similar approximately 300% increase in relative myocardial retention of 99mTc-RP805 in MI regions (Ctrl, 102+/-9% 1 week, 351+/-77%This novel noninvasive targeted MMP radiotracer imaging approach holds significant diagnostic potential for in vivo localization of MMP activation and tracking of MMP-mediated post-MI remodeling.
