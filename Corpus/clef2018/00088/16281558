Cloning and expression of human canstatin and its purification and bioactivity. Total RNA was extracted from placenta umbilical tissue and the canstatin cDNA was amplified from total RNA by net-RT-PCR technique. The amplified cDNA was cloned into pSP72 and sequenced. The canstatin cDNA was cut down from pSP72C with BamH I / Nde I and ligated into the vector pET-3c. The resultant plasmid pETC was then transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). The canstatin gene was efficiently expressed after IPTG induction as a 25 kD band on SDS-PAGE. The expressed product constituted approximately 27.9% of the total bacterial proteins estimated by densitometry and existed mainly as inclusion body. The inclusion bodies were washed, lysed, refolded and purified on the Sephadex G-75 gel filtration column to a purity of 91.4%. CAM assay showed that 10 microg purified canstatin is enough to inhibit the angiogenesis of chichen embryo microcapillary vessel.
