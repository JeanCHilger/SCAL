Cerebral perfusion imaging. There are multiple imaging techniques available to assess cerebral perfusion, including positron emission tomography (PET), xenon computed tomography (XeCT), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI), and perfusion computed tomography (PCT). Current interest has focused mainly on their use in the setting of acute brain ischemia. Perfusion imaging may be able to distinguish infarcted from salvageable ischemic tissue as a guide to treatment. Perfusion techniques may also be helpful in cases of chronic ischemia, post-subarachnoid hemorrhage vasospasm, trauma, and contemplated therapeutic carotid artery occlusion.
