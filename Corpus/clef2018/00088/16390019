Cold infarction areas of varying size in the presence of left ventricular dysfunction: the impact on left ventricular ejection fraction determination by gated SPECT compared to radionuclide ventriculography. The agreement in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) determination between the gated perfusion SPECT (GPS) and radionuclide ventriculography (RVG) methods has been reported to show a systematic reduction with increasing EF values. In some reports, this EF difference exceeds 5%, indicating a critical underestimation rate by GPS in terms of clinical reliability. Although the accuracy of endocardial edge detection by means of GPS proves to be reliable, even in patients with large perfusion defects, the accuracy of EF calculation seems to depend on the level of individual EF values. Our objective was to investigate the RVG-GPS agreement in EF determination specifically in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) having perfusion defects including extremely depleted areas and LV dysfunction. Our patients had a EF<50%, a population in which the best agreement values between the above two methods should be found according to the literature. The idea was to test the accuracy of QGS algorithm in the presence of cold perfusion defects and a low probability of EF level influence. Thirty-six patients (26 males 61.8+/-9.1 y and 10 female
