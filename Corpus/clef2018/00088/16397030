Value of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography in non-small-cell lung cancer for prediction of pathologic response and times to relapse after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. To determine the value of combined positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) during induction chemotherapy (CTx) followed by chemoradiotherapy (CTx/RTx) for non-small-cell lung cancer to predict histopathologic response in primary tumor and mediastinum and prognosis of the patient.Fifty consecutive patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer received induction therapy and, if considered resectable, proceeded to surgery (37 of 50 patients). Patients had at least two repeated 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-PET/CT scans either before treatment (t0) or after induction CTx (t1) or CTx/RTx (t2). Variables from the PET/CT studies [e.g., lesion volume and corrected maximum standardized glucose uptake values (SUV(max,corr))] were correlated with histopathologic response (graded as 3, 2b, or 2a: 0%, >0-10%, or >10% residual tumor cells) and times to failure.Primary tumors showed a percentage decrease in SUV(max,corr) during induction significantly larger in grade 2b/3 than in grade 2a responding tumors (67% versus 34% at t(1), 73% versus 49% at t(2) both P < 0.005). SUV(max,corr) at t(2) was significantly correlated with histopathologic response in tumors smaller than the median volume (7.5 cm(3)SUV(max,corr) values from two serial PET/CT scans, before and after three chemotherapy cycles or later, allow prediction of histopathologic response in the primary tumor and mediastinal lymph nodes and have prognostic value.
