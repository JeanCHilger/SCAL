The contribution of medical physicists and doctors in Aberdeen to the evolution of modern medical imaging--SPECT, PET and MRI, 1965-1992. From the beginnings of medical imaging with radioactivity, an account is given of the development in Aberdeen of Computed Tomography (CT) scanners in Nuclear Medicine, and their clinical value, leading to present-day gamma-cameras. The introduction and clinical use of the cyclotron and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imager in Aberdeen, has led to a national programme for the cancer patients in Scotland. Early animal work with electron magnetic resonance, which developed into a programme towards nuclear magnetic resonance of water, and then to a quest to build the first clinically-useful whole-body MRI, is described. Successful diagnostic images obtained with it have led to the present-day worldwide use of the MRI technique.
