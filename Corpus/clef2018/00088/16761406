Expression of the fusion protein CFP10-ESAT6 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the study of its immunogenicity. To express a recombinant fusion protein CFP10-ESAT6 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and obtain the polyclonal antibodies of this fusion protein by immune rabbit.The 630 bp cfpl0-esat6 fusion gene fragments were amplified from the genomic DNA of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis reference strain H37Rv and inserted into the expression plasmid pET32a (+) to generate the recombinant plasmid pET-cfp10-esat6. The recombinat expression plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). The fused protein CFP10-ESAT6 with His-tag was expressed after inducing with IPTG and purified with affinity chromatography. This protein was used to immune the rabbit to obtained the polyclonal antibodies, and been analyzed with Western-blot and ELISA.The recombinant plasmid pET-cfp10-esat6 was success fully constructed, the recombinant fusion protein CFP10-ESAT6 could be expressed at relatively high levels, and the polyclonal antibodies of fusion protein were obtained.The successful construction and expression of the recombinant fusion protein CFP10-ESAT6 and the obtained polyclonal antibodies will be very helpful for the development of new anti-tuberculosis vaccine and the clinical serologic diagnosis.
