Is there a benefit of 131 I-MIBG therapy in the treatment of children with stage 4 neuroblastoma? A retrospective evaluation of The German Neuroblastoma Trial NB97 and implications for The German Neuroblastoma Trial NB2004. (131)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-MIBG) therapy has been used in neuroblastoma treatment for many years but its value in high intensive first line treatment protocols is not exactly known.Stage 4 neuroblastoma patients >1 year with (123)I-MIBG positive residual disease (primary tumour and/or metastasis) after complete induction chemotherapy according to the German neuroblastoma trial NB97 were retrospectively analyzed.One-hundred-eleven patients had (123)I-MIBG positive residual disease after complete induction chemotherapy. Forty patients received (131)I-MIBG therapy using a median activity of 0.44 GBq/kg body weight. By univariate analysis, patients who underwent (131)I-MIBG therapy had a better 3-year event free survival (3-y-EFS 46 +/- 8%) and 3-year overall survival (3-y-OS 58 +/- 9%) than 71 patients without (131)I-MIBG therapy (3-y-EFS 19 +/- 5%, p = 0.003 3-y-OS 43 +/- 6%, p = 0.037). However, subgroup analysis of 66 patients who underwent high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) during treatment found a very similar outcome with (131)I-MIBG therapy (3-y-EFS 49 +/- 9%, 3-y-OS 59 +/- 10%) and without (131)I-MIBG therapy (3-y-EFS 33 +/- 9%, p = 0.171An independent advantage of I-131-MIBG therapy could not be proven in this retrospective analysis. The ongoing German Neuroblastoma Trial NB2004 will address the influence of (131)I-MIBG therapy with emphasis on tumour dosimetry.
