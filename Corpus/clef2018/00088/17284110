Current techniques used for the radiologic assessment of intracranial neoplasms. Radiologic studies are obtained for diagnostic and treatment planning purposes in the evaluation of patients with intracranial neoplasms. These studies are discussed at radiology/pathology working conferences and are often beneficial in the analysis of pathologic specimens for tissue diagnosis. Therefore, clinical pathologists should be aware of the current and evolving imaging techniques that are used in the radiologic assessment of intracranial neoplasms.To describe the imaging techniques used in the assessment of intracranial neoplasms and provide current references.We searched PubMed for articles published between 1995 and 2006 and also reviewed several textbooks on intracranial neoplasms, to prepare a discussion of basic modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging as well as advanced imaging techniques such as CT and MR angiography and venography, CT and MR perfusion, MR spectroscopy, functional MR imaging, and positron emission tomography.Knowledge of currently used imaging techniques for the assessment of intracranial neoplasms will assist the clinical pathologist in communications with neuroradiologists, surgeons, and referring clinicians. This review will also aid the pathologist in understanding the new and rapidly evolving imaging techniques that will likely become the standard of care in the future.
