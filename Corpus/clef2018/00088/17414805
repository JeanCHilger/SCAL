Exercise-induced decrease in insular cortex rCBF during postexercise hypotension. The insular cortex (IC), a region of the brain involved in blood pressure (BP) modulation, shows decreases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during postexercise hypotension (PEH).To determine whether changes in IC neural activity were caused by prior exercise or by changes in BP, this investigation compared patterns of rCBF during periods of hypotension, which was induced by prior exercise (i.e., PEH) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) infusion and a cold pressor (CP), to restore BP.Ten subjects were studied on three different days with randomly assigned conditions: i) resting baseline ii) PEHUsing ANOVA across conditions, there were differences (P<0.05 mean +/- SD) from baseline during PEH for HR (+12 +/- 3 bpm) and mean BP (-8 +/- 2 mm Hg) and during SNP-induced hypotension (HR = +15 +/- 4 bpmData show that reductions in IC neural activity are not caused by acute BP decreases. Findings suggest that exercise can lead to a temporary decrease in IC neural activity, which may be a significant neural factor contributing to PEH.
