The expanding role of PET technology in the management of patients with colorectal cancer. The therapeutic options and subsequent survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients has increased substantially over recent years. While surgical excision of the primary cancer results in cure of approximately 50% of patients, recurrence and metastatic disease still remains a significant cause of death. Although resection of liver or lung metastases can result in cure, relapse rates remain high, indicating that patient selection needs improvement. Positron emission tomography (PET) technology has a great deal to offer with respect to CRC management, particularly in the setting of patient selection for metastasectomy and in the evaluation of possible recurrent disease, however it has not yet become a routine part of the management of all CRC patients. This review article aims to discuss the current and future implications of PET technology in the optimal management of CRC patients throughout their care pathway.
