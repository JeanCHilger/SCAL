Positron tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Noninvasive imaging methods for medical diagnosis and biological investigations, have evolved from qualitative radiological techniques to quantitative methods of measuring biochemical and physiological processes in human body. In particular, new developments in emission tomography, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, and in vivo spectroscopy offer new horizons for medical research and clinical activities. These methods and their potentials are reviewed and contrasted.
