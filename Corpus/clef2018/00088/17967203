Correlation between delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance and nitrate myocardial Tc-99m tetrofosmin scintigraphy in myocardial infarction: a case report. Delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI) has been recently proposed as an alternative tool in identifying myocardial viability and transmural distribution of necrosis in the myocardium.We describe a case of a 71-year-old man admitted for ischemic-like chest pain in which DE-MRI and post-nitrate 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial scintigraphy equally contributed to the diagnosis of previous lateral myocardial infarction.In this patient with coronary artery disease, the absence of uptake of tracer at myocardial scintigraphy appeared to be closely correlated to DE-MRI data. Cardiologists can use SPECT or DE-MRI to obtain similar information about myocardial viability.
