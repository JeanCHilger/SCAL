Immuno-PET: a navigator in monoclonal antibody development and applications. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been approved for use as diagnostics and therapeutics in a broad range of medical indications, but especially in oncology. In addition, hundreds of new mAbs, engineered mAb fragments, and nontraditional antibody-like scaffolds directed against either validated or novel tumor targets are under development. Immuno-positron emission tomography (PET), the tracking and quantification of mAbs with PET in vivo, is an exciting novel option to improve diagnostic imaging and to guide mAb-based therapy. In this review, recent technical advances leading to a jump ahead in mAb imaging are discussed. The availability of proper positron emitters, sophisticated radiochemistry, and advanced PET and PET-computed tomography scanners is crucial in these developments. Immuno-PET might play an important future role in cancer staging, in the improvement and tailoring of therapy with existing mAbs, and in the efficient development of novel mAbs. An overview of the preclinical and first clinical immuno-PET studies is provided.
