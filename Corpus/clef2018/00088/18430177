Selective dose escalation of chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer. This phase II study assessed the use of concurrent continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil and weekly carboplatin plus paclitaxel with selective radiation dose escalation for patients with localized esophageal cancer. Patients with esophageal carcinoma were staged by thoracic and abdominal computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasound, and positron emission tomography scans. Patients received a continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil 225 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 38 and intravenous paclitaxel 45 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC 2 on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Radiotherapy was delivered in 1.8-Gy fractions, 5 d/wk for 5.5 weeks. Six to 8 weeks after initial therapy, patients without metastatic progression but with a positive biopsy, or less than partial response received a 9-Gy boost with the same concurrent chemotherapy. Twenty-four patients were enrolled: 18 patients were enrolled initially 6 additional patients were enrolled following a protocol amendment designed to reduce the esophagitis by adding the radioprotectant amifostine. Median follow-up was 30 months. Twenty (83%) patients had adenocarcinomas of the lower esophagus/gastroesophageal junction. Seventeen patients (81%) attained at least a partial response. Six patients received boost treatment. At 4 years, overall survival was 28%, cause-specific survival was 38%, locoregional control was 61%, and distant metastasis-free survival was 52%. Radiation delays ranged from 0 to 62 days (median, 8 d), primarily owing to esophagitis. In total, 28% of patients developed esophageal strictures requiring dilatations. There were no differences in esophageal strictures, local control, or survival with the addition of amifostine.
