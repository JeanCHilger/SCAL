Whole-body positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose is an effective method to detect extra-pelvic recurrence in uterine sarcomas. To assess the clinical use of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in the post-therapy surveillance of uterine sarcoma.Eight whole-body FDG-PET studies were performed in seven women with previously treated uterine sarcoma. Conventional image studies (computed tomography) and physical examinations were performed for follow-up. All FDG-PET studies were indicated to localize suspected recurrences noted by conventional methods.The per case sensitivity of the FDG-PET studies and CT scans was 85.7% (6/7) and 100% (7/7), respectively (p = 0.174). FDG-PET was able to detect seven extrapelvic metastastic sites below the diaphragm (7/7, sensitivity: 100%), including the liver, spleen, paraaortic lymph node, spine and paracolic gutter, as well as pulmonary lesions in five patients, while the CT scan detected only three lesions (3/7, sensitivity: 42.9% p = 0.070). FDG-PET detected only four recurrent pelvic lesions (4/6) and CT scan detected six (6/6) recurrent pelvic lesions (66.7% vs 100%, p = 0.455).The FDG-PET showed a better detection rate than the abdominal CT scan for extrapelvic metastatic lesions and a similar detection rate as well as abdominal CT scan. FDG-PET can serve as a useful detection tool for patients with uterine sarcomas because nearly 80% of recurrence involve an extrapelvic site.
