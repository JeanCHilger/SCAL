Synthesis and biodistribution of 34mCl-labeled 2-chloro-2-deoxy-d-glucose: a major impurity in [18F]FDG injection. No-carrier-added 2-[(34m)Cl]chloro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([(34m)Cl]ClDG) was prepared via nucleophilic displacement reaction of 1, 3, 4, 6-tetra-O-acetyl-2-trifluoromethansulfonyl mannose with K[(34m)Cl]Cl/kryptofix 222 complex using (34m)Cl(-) produced via the (nat)S(alpha, 2n) nuclear reactions. The synthesis time from enrichment of [(34m)Cl]Cl(-) was approximately 45min and the radiochemical yield was 79.6+/-6.7% (n=3) with decay correction. Animal PET studies showed that the behavior of [(34m)Cl]ClDG was quite different from that of [(18)F]FDG. [(34m)Cl]ClDG did not accumulate in any organ and was excreted as [(34m)Cl]ClDG.
