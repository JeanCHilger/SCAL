Molecular imaging of renal cell carcinoma. The recent identification of agents that have significantly influenced the therapy of clear cell renal carcinoma and the decreasing size of renal masses, usually detected serendipitously, have led to a resurgence in imaging for this condition. Although structural methods continue to be used routinely for identification of renal masses, functional and molecular techniques are showing considerable promise in their ability to characterize unique features of the renal cancer phenotype. This article discusses the evolving role of molecular imaging in the evaluation of renal cancer, including current and future applications.
