6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa metabolism in MPTP-treated monkeys: assessment of tracer methodologies for positron emission tomography. 6-[18F]Fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA) is an L-DOPA analog that is used to assess the functional integrity of central dopaminergic systems in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET). FDOPA metabolites from putamen of normal and MPTP-treated monkeys were characterized to correlate FDOPA metabolism changes with those of the endogenous dopamine system. In MPTP-lesioned putamen, 6-[18F]fluorodopamine and dopamine levels were less than 2% those of controls. Increases in endogenous dopamine metabolism were reflected by similar increases in 6-[18F]fluorodopamine metabolites. These results suggest that changes in the central dopamine system biochemistry can be monitored in vivo with FDOPA and PET.
