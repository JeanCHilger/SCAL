Single photon emission tomography imaging of myocardial oxidative metabolism with 15-(p-[123I]iodophenyl) pentadecanoic acid in patients with coronary artery disease and aorto-coronary bypass graft surgery. A total of 29 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) were investigated with 15-(p-[123I] iodophenyl)pentadecanoic acid (123I-IPPA) and sequential single photon emission tomography (SPET). Of these, 19 were studied after aorto-coronary bypass graft surgery. Some 13 patients without evidence of CAD served as a control group. Two SPET studies (early and late) were carried out within 45 min after intravenous administration of 200 MBq 123I-IPPA at peak sub-maximal exercise. Semi-quantification of uptake (related to perfusion) and turnover (linked to metabolism) was obtained by segmental comparison of oblique slices. Taking coronary arteriography as the "gold standard", 123I-IPPA scintigraphy had the following figures of merit for sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of CAD: for the left anterior descending artery territory 93% and 95%, for the left circumflex artery region 96% and 92%, and for the right coronary artery territory 77% and 92%, respectively. In all, 90% of the reperfused myocardial segments showed an improvement of uptake. Of these, 61% exhibited increased turnover after revascularization and 39% had pathologic turnover and thus a dissociation of improvement of perfusion and oxidative metabolism after surgery.
