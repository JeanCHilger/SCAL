Whole-body 18FDG PET-CT imaging of systemic sarcoidosis: ophthalmic oncology and uveitis. To describe whole-body 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed radiographic tomography (PET-CT) imaging of ophthalmic patients with systemic sarcoidosis.Four systemic sarcoidosis patients were evaluated with PET-CT for staging. Two had been treated for conjunctival melanoma and two had been referred for atypical choroidal tumors. PET-CT images were studied for presence of tumor or tissue with increased standardized uptake values, indicating increased metabolic activity.In all cases, PET-CT revealed focal systemic lesions with increased uptake (SUV range 1.7-5.9 kg/mL). Cases 1 and 2 had a previous diagnosis of sarcoidosis (without ocular involvement), while cases 3 and 4 were diagnosed during their work-up. PET-CT revealed the presence and distribution of systemic sarcoid granulomas.In this series, PET-CT staged patients with eye cancer and systemic sarcoidosis and aided in differentiating between a metastatic choroidal tumor and uveal sarcoid granuloma. PET-CT offers a method to assess the presence and distribution of systemic sarcoidosis.
