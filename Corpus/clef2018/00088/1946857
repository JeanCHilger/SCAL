The pattern of cerebral activity underlying verbal fluency shown by split-dose single photon emission tomography (SPET or SPECT) in normal volunteers. Uptake of 99mTc-Exametazime, a marker of relative regional cerebral blood flow has been determined with Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPET or SPECT) in 20 healthy, elderly female subjects during neuropsychological challenge. Each subject was studied under basal conditions after injection of 125 MBq 99mTc-Exametazime. Without moving the head of the subject, they were scanned again after injection of 375 MBq 99mTc-Exametazime. The second injection was made in 10 subjects during a test of verbal fluency, usually regarded as a test of the integrity of function of the left frontal cortex. In the other 10 subjects the second injection was made during simple verbalization (counting). This method of splitting the normal full dose of 99mTc-Exametazime allows a novel comparison between basal and active conditions for different brain regions. Verbal fluency was associated with reduced uptake bilaterally in the region of the basal ganglia and in left temporal (peri-sylvian) cortex when compared with calcarine cortex, an unstimulated reference sensory area. By contrast, counting produced relative activation, greatest in frontal and parietal areas. Thus, a clinically relevant neuropsychological test can be characterized metabolically by a pattern of regional brain activity, whose localization cannot readily be predicted from classical studies of brain lesions. Reduction of regional uptake may suggest an important role for deactivation or inhibition of function in human cognition. The involvement of basal ganglia and temporal areas is of particular interest in relation to the investigation of functional psychiatric illness.
