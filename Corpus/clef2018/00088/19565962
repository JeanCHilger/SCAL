Single photon emission computerized tomography and histological evaluation in the validation of a new technique for closure of oro-antral communication: an experimental study in pigs. Various bone regeneration techniques have evolved recently but controversies regarding vascularization and integration of such bone grafting techniques have led occasionally to animal experiment to validate such techniques. The objective of this study was to evaluate the evidence of vascularization and osseo-integration of a new bone regeneration technique utilized for the closure of oro-antral communication (OAC) by an experimental model in which Single Photon Emission computerized Tomography and histological studies were conducted in pigs. We conclude that the sandwich technique used for the closure of OAC results in a vascularized new bone formation which eventually osseo-integrate with the surrounding bone. Also, this experimental study confirmed that autogeneous bone graft was superior to xenografts when used within the sandwich unit.
