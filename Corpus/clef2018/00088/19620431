CT and PET/CT findings of T-cell lymphoma. The purpose of this study was to describe the extranodal features of T-cell lymphoma at CT and PET/CT.The extranodal features of T-cell lymphoma are not specific and usually cannot be used to differentiate T-cell lymphoma from other aggressive types of lymphoma. Noncutaneous subtypes frequently manifest with visceral involvement. The goal of CT in initial staging is to exclude visceral involvement. Evidence on the utility of PET/CT is promising, showing high diagnostic value in evaluation of occult disease and treatment response, but the role of PET/CT is evolving.
