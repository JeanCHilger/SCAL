Brown fat: atypical locations and appearances encountered in PET/CT. The purpose of this article is to review the physiology and describe the typical and atypical presentations of brown fat on (18)F-FDG PET.The presence of brown fat on FDG PET has the potential to lead to misinterpretation and unneeded invasive tests, which can be avoided by using measures such as ensuring the patient is warm, reducing FDG uptake in brown fat before the procedure, and correlating PET uptake to a specific anatomic location with PET/CT fusion imaging.
