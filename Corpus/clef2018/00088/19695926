Radiotherapy indications in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Actually, radiation-therapy indications in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma tends to decrease in favour of exclusive chemotherapy, especially in aggressive localized diseases. In this situation, PET scan imaging would be a promising tool to identify candidates to complementary radiotherapy after initial chemotherapy. To decrease long-term morbidity, radiation doses and treated volumes should be as small as possible. New radiation technologies could contribute to reduce this risk as well. However, there are still indications for radiotherapy. Radiation therapy could be delivered with curative-intent in localized indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and could be helpful in symptom relief in advanced or relapsed indolent lymphoma.
