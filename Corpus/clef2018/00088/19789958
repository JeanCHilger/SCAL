Imaging of superficial and deep fibromatosis. The purpose of this paper was to illustrate the role of diagnostic imaging in superficial and deep fibromatosis through a review of the use of different imaging modalities, including radiography, ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), angiography and scintigraphy. In particular, in agreement with published data, it emphasises the crucial role of MRI as the primary modality providing the information needed for management decisions, preoperative planning and follow-up of these lesions.
