Tumor uptake of 68Ga-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate: animal PET studies of tumor flow and acute somatostatin receptor modulation in the CA20948 rat model. Factors determining the in vivo uptake of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs by neuroendocrine tumors are poorly known. The aim is to evaluate in vivo tumor perfusion and regulation of somatostatin receptors (sstr) following acute exposure to octreotide, in an animal model of neuroendocrine tumor.H(2)(15)O flow studies were performed in 8 CA20948 tumor-bearing rats and another 36 rats underwent three [(68)Ga]-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate imaging sessions at 24-h intervals. After baseline (Day 0) imaging, scanning was repeated on Day 1 after octreotide injection (175 microg/kg), with a variable delay: no injection (controls, n=7), coinjection (n=6), and octreotide injection 20 min (n=7), 2 h (n=8) and 4 h (n=8) before imaging. Repeat images without octreotide was performed at Day 2 followed by sacrifice and tumor counting.H(2)(15)O studies failed to measure quantitative tumor perfusion in this model. On Day 1, ratio of tumor uptake to Day 0 was 1.2+/-0.3 in controls 0.6+/-0.2 in the coinjection groupAcute exposure to unlabeled octreotide in this neuroendocrine tumor model results in a rapid recycling or resynthesis of sstr. Positron emission tomography (PET) allowed to reliably assess quantitative uptake of [(68)Ga]-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate over time in the same animal, but failed in this model to measure tumor perfusion.
