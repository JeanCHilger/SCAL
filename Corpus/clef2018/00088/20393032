Correlation between [18f]fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography scan and histology of pelvic nodes in early-stage cervical cancer. The histological results of pelvic lymphadenectomy were studied in patients treated for early-stage cervical cancer (<4 cm) who had no nodal uptake on [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography combined with integrated computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT).Patients treated between 2005 and 2008 for stage IB1 cervical cancer cancer <4 cm who underwent a FDG-PET/CT followed by surgical evaluation of pelvic nodes were reviewed.A total of 16 patients were studied. The median age of patients was 43 (range 29-62) years. Surgery was performed laparoscopically and by laparotomic approach in 13 and 3 cases, respectively. Two patients had histologically proven pelvic involvement. The false-negative rate and negative predictive value of PET-CT imaging for pelvic nodal involvement were 13% and 87%, respectively.The accuracy of PET-CT imaging in predicting the pelvic nodal status is very low in patients with early-stage cervical cancer and is not able to replace lymphadenectomy.
