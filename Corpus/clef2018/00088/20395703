Ga-68 DOTATOC PET, endoscopic ultrasonography, and multidetector CT in the diagnosis of duodenopancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: a single-centre retrospective study. In this report, we compared endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), multidetector CT (MDCT), and Ga-68 DOTATOC PET/CT in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). We report our experience with use of these methods in patients suspected to have duodenopancreatic primitive NET.Nineteen consecutive patients (mean age, 56 21-80), who underwent both Ga-68 DOTATOC PET/CT and EUS between March 2007 and November 2008 were retrospectively included in the study (16 underwent MDCT). Suspicion of NET was confirmed by EUS-FNA and/or surgery. Operative characteristics of PET, EUS, and MDCT were compared.Twenty-three neuroendocrine lesions were diagnosed in 13/19 patients. EUS, PET, and MDCT correctly identified as affected 13/13 (100%), 12/13 (92%), and 10/11 (91%) patients, respectively. On a lesion basis, EUS, PET, and MDCT identified correctly as NETs 22/23 (96%), 20/23 (87%), and 13/18 (72%) lesions (P = 0.08 EUS vs. CT). Both on a patient and on a lesion basis, specificity was 67%, 83%, and 80% for EUS, PET, and MDCT, respectively.EUS, Ga-68 DOTATOC PET, and MDCT seem to have comparable accuracy in diagnosis of duodenopancreatic NET and their combination may allow an optimal preoperative diagnosis.
