Behavior disorders in dogs--study of their classification. Introductory reflections are represented on the present human-canine relationship which often is disturbed respectively characterized by man's overdoings in any direction. Definition and differentiation of the multicausal variability of canine behaviour is given by a critical literature review and own studies on breed - specific behaviour differences and differences in human-canine relationships. The most common forms of canine abnormal behaviour are classified after BUCHHOLTZ (1989). Relation to man plays the main role in canine development. Isolation of man, for example, by growing up living in kennel and not within the family causes canine abnormal behaviour nearly predictable, as my results of sequence analysis verify. Congenital disorders with pathologic manifestation are still rare, relatively increasing is acquired abnormal behaviour following genetic disposition. Sensitive developmental phases as well as the human relationship are important for environmental adaptation. Aggression in dogs towards human for example often refers to isolated development in kennels. Nevertheless abnormal canine behaviour is often overdiagnosed. In many cases the underlying cause is a form of "ritualized misunderstanding" between dog and man depending on unrealistic conceptions and expectations of men about canine behaviour. This type of "abnormal" behaviour is easily curable by therapy.
