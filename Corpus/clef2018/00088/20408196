Functional reorganization induced by endovascular embolization of a cerebral AVM. We mapped motor function in a patient with a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) before and after treatment with endovascular embolization. Functional activation using technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine single photon emission tomography (99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT) demonstrated a redistribution of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) that correlated with clinical improvement. Intravascular feeding artery pressure measurements, serial angiography, and challenge with a pharmacological vasodilator enabled us to explore possible mechanisms of functional reorganization.
