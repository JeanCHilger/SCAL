14C]deoxyglucose uptake and imaging in malignant melanom. Since malignant tumors utilize more glucose than normal tissues, tumor uptake and autoradiographic imaging studies using the 14C-labeled glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose (DG) provide a useful preclinical system to determine if similar human tumors will image in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-labeled DG (FDG-PET). We studied B16 murine melanomas of increasing metastatic potential (F1, low BL-6, intermediate
