. One of the mechanisms of tumor cells to escape the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents, such as adriamycin, vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, actinomycin D, and paclitaxel, is to limit their presence inside the cells by a multidrug resistance (MDR-1) gene protein (1, 2). The MDR-1 gene encodes a transmembrane P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as an ATP-dependent multidrug transporter that is capable of actively pumping a variety of agents out of the cells. Injection of unlabeled efflux pump substrates increases the retention of the radioactivity in the tumor rather than less radioactivity as seen with receptor binding radiotracers. Over-expression of P-gp in tumor cells (such as renal carcinoma, hepatoma, pheochromocytoma, and colon carcinoma) leads to resistance to anticancer drugs (3). P-gp is also present in a variety of normal cells, such as intestinal mucosal cells, hepatocytes, renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, and endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier (BBB) (4, 5). Calcium channel blockers, cyclosporin and its non-immunosuppressive analogue PSC 833 are MDR modulators inhibiting transport of P-gp substrates out of the cells (6, 7). Sestamibi (MIBI) is a substrate for P-gp.
