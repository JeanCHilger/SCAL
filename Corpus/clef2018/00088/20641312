. Cellular death can occur through two different chemical pathways: apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptosis is a highly regulated mechanism involving an externalization process of amino-phospholipids, primarily phosphatidylserine (PS), that normally face the cytoplasm (1). Through this process, PS residues are exposed at the outer plasma membrane and face the extracellular fluid (2). Necrosis, on the other hand, is a chaotic, unregulated mode of cell death followed by invasion of inflammatory cells (3). Imaging of apoptosis through PS exposure using annexin V has been a growing trend over recent years (4,  5). However, because PS inversion occurs in both necrosis and apoptosis, the imaging strategy of quantifying the exposed PS does not differentiate between necrosis from apoptosis. For that reason, other imaging approaches using targeted pathways that are specific to each mechanism are currently under investigation.
