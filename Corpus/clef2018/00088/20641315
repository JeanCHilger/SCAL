Hyperpolarized [ The signal of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is proportional to the thermal equilibrium polarization of nuclear spins. As a function of magnetic field strength and temperature, the thermal equilibrium polarization is normally very low. For instance, the polarization level (the population difference) is 5 Ã— 10
