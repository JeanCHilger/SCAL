Pretransplantation functional imaging predicts outcome following autologous stem cell transplantation for relapsed and refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. To identify prognostic factors for patients transplanted for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma we carried out a combined analysis of patients followed prospectively on 3 consecutive protocols at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. One hundred fifty-three patients with chemosensitive disease after ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide)-based salvage therapy (ST) proceeded to high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Patients were evaluated with computed tomography and functional imaging (gallium or fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography) prior to ST and again before ASCT. Functional imaging status before ASCT was the only factor significant for event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival by multivariate analysis and clearly identifies poor risk patients (5-year EFS 31% and 75% for FI-positive and negative patients respectively). Administration of involved-field radiotherapy with ASCT was marginally significant for EFS (P = .055). Studies evaluating novel STs, conditioning regimens, post-ASCT maintenance, or allogeneic stem cell transplantation are warranted for patients who fail to normalize pre-ASCT functional imaging.
