Ealuation of thrombolytic treatment of acute myocardial infarct using myocardial scintigraphy with Tc-99-MIBI. Immediate results and follow-up after one year. The aim of the study was to investigate Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) with technetium-99m esakis-2-methoxy isobutyl isonitrile (Tc-99m-MIBI) as a means of evaluating the results of intravenous thrombolytic treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction. In addition, the evolution of myocardial perfusion pattern was studied. The study group included 15 patients (12 males and 3 females, mean age 57 +/- 8 years) with acute myocardial infarction admitted to the coronary care unit within 4 hours of the onset of symptoms. All patients were injected with 740 MBq of Tc-99m-MIBI before starting the thrombolytic therapy (rt-PA 100 mg i.v. in 3 hours) SPECT was performed 3 to 6 hours later. The tomographic study was repeated 5 days later. Ten patients were re-examined using Tc-99m-MIBI SPECT one year after the acute event. Taking into account the clinical, electrocardiographic and enzymatic data and the findings of two-dimensional echocardiography performed both on the fifth day and after one month, patients were divided into two groups: group A (8 patients) with probably effective reperfusion, group B (7 patients) probably unaffected by therapy. The infarct related vessel was patent in all group A patients and in 2 of the 7 patients of group B. The percent decrease in the perfusion defect size between the first and second scintigraphic studies showed a significant difference between the two groups: group A 61.2 +/- 6.8, group B 4.7 +/- 2.4% (p less than 0.002). A significant difference was also found when the results of the admission scintigraphy were compared with those of the control 1 year after: group A 80.8 +/- 8.7%, group B 20.8 +/- 13.8% (p less than 0.02). The percent decrease in the perfusion defect size between the 5-day and 1-year images was also significantly different in the two groups: group A 52.9 +/- 20.9%
