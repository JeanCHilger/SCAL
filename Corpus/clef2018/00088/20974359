Cervical tumors. Imaging the cervix for benign and malignant disease can be achieved using transvaginal ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. The best established role of imaging is in cervical carcinoma where magnetic resonance imaging, CT and increasingly positron emission tomography-CT are the most frequently used imaging modalities. These have a role in staging, treatment selection, recurrent disease, and imaging complications of treatment. Histopathological diagnosis of cervical disorders cannot be made on the basis of imaging alone but certain imaging features may provide an indication as to the underlying diagnosis. We describe the imaging features of some malignant tumor subtypes in which a preoperative diagnosis may alter management. Benign lesions of the cervix are usually detected incidentally or during investigations for dysfunctional vaginal bleeding. We describe the imaging features of the commonly encountered benign cervical lesions.
