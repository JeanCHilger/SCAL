¹²³I-NKJ64: a novel single photon emission computed tomography radiotracer for imaging the noradrenaline transporter in brain. Dysregulation of noradrenergic function has been implicated in a variety of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including depression and Alzheimer's disease. The noradrenaline transporter (NAT) is a major target for antidepressant drugs, including reboxetine, a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor. Therefore, the development of a radiotracer for imaging of the NAT is desirable. In this study, NKJ64, a novel iodinated analog of reboxetine, was radiolabeled and evaluated as a potential single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) radiotracer for imaging the NAT in brain. Biological evaluation of the novel radiotracer, ¹²³/¹²⁵I-NKJ64, was carried out in rats using: in vitro ligand binding assays in vitro and ex vivo autoradiography
