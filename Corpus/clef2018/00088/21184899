Imaging of the thyroid and parathyroid glands. Current multimodal imaging techniques offer practicing providers the adequate framework to plan and accomplish care for patients with thyroid and parathyroid disorders. Available imaging modalities include ultrasonography (US), nuclear scintigraphy, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). US remains the most cost-effective and the safest approach for the initial evaluation of the thyroid gland. Parathyroid subtraction scintigraphy provides localization of pathologic parathyroid glands with the greatest sensitivity. Localizing imaging studies allow for surgical planning with minimal risk and morbidity to the patient. CT scan and MRI play an adjunctive role in the further characterization of neck pathology.
