Brain imaging: towards a more detailed knowledge of the central nervous system. Functional imaging allowed the knowledge of the brain to progress significantly. Recent findings about modeling of the activity and the interactivity measured by functional imaging are presented, they allow to apprehend brain functioning and brain plasticity both in normal and pathophysiological conditions. The study of specific circuits in networks should make it possible to define more realistically the dynamic functioning of the central nervous system which underlies numerous brain functions.
