Adrenal imaging: from Addison to algorithms. Despite their small size, pathologic condition of the adrenal glands is often far from insignificant. Imagers should therefore be familiar with the principles and techniques that underpin the ability of imaging to characterize most lesions. Ignorance of these techniques fails to deliver the necessary imaging value to referrers and patients alike. This article, outlines the range of possible abnormalities encountered in the adrenal gland, the imaging modalities and specialized techniques used to detect and characterize them, the principles based on which these techniques are used, and finally a working imaging algorithm that can be readily used in daily practice.
