 The majority of individuals suffering from pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) do not survive for more than 1 year after diagnosis and fewer than 1% of these patients live beyond 5 years (1). Although surgical resection of the cancer is a possible intervention for this disease only 10 â€“ 25% of the patients are considered suitable for this treatment because usually by the time that neoplasm is detected the malignancy has metastasized to other organs and the tumor load in the patient is too high to warrant surgery (1). Patients with nonresectable PAC are treated either with gemcitabine or radiotherapy or a combination of the two, however, these treatments are not curative because they only prolong survival and improve the quality of life of the patient during that time (1). The detection of this cancer at an early stage can facilitate proper staging of the disease so that a suitable treatment regimen can be initiated to possibly improve patient prognosis (2). In this regard the monoclonal antibody (mAb), PAM4, which specifically targets mucin 1 (MUC1), a glycoprotein, overexpressed only in PAC tumors was developed, radiolabeled with
