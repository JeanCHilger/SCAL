Improved treatment outcomes with (18) F-FDG PET/CT for patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of (18) F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18) F-FDG) PET/CT on survival for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma correlated with a matched patient cohort.In all, disease in 58 patients was initially staged using (18) F-FDG PET/CT. A case-control analysis was done with 63 patients who disease was staged without (18) F-FDG-PET/CT.Disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) did not show significant differences between both groups. Statistical analysis revealed no difference in DSS and OS between the 2 groups for patients treated by radiochemotherapy (p = .975 and p = .671). In the analysis of survival in patients treated by a combined approach (surgery + radiochemotherapy), a significant difference in favor of patients evaluated by (18) F-FDG PET/CT was found (p = .05 and p = .027).Addition of (18) F-FDG PET/CT in patients treated by surgery and conformal radiochemotherapy improves outcome. This may be due to the more comprehensive topographic orientation of the primary tumor for the surgeon.
