 (1 Dopamine, a neurotransmitter, plays an important role in the mediation of movement, cognition, and emotion. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with a loss of dopamine-containing neurons in the striatum, resulting in a loss of dopamine transporter (DAT) in the presynaptic nerve terminals (1, 2). Reduction of DAT density is inversely correlated with the severity of motor dysfunction in PD patients. Several (-)-cocaine analogs were developed for the evaluation of DAT density in neurons of PD patients. Radiolabeled 2β-carboxymethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (β-CIT) and
