Intravenous dipyridamole thallium-201 SPECT imaging methodology, applications, and interpretations. Dipyridamole TI-201 imaging is an ideal alternative to exercise TI-201 scintigraphy in patients who are unwilling or unable to perform maximum exercise stress. The use of intravenous dipyridamole, alone or in combination with exercise, has not been approved for clinical practice by the Food and Drug Administration. Once approval is granted, the test will become a widely used and important component of the cardiac work-up. The indications, methodology, side effects, and utility of dipyridamole cardiac imaging in the clinical setting are discussed and a variety of examples presented.
