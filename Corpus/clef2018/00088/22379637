IRDye800CW-anti-CD105 TRC105 chimeric monoclonal antibody Angiogenesis is an essential process in the development of new blood vessels both in normal physiological states and diseases (1, 2). Targeting of tumor vasculature is a promising strategy for tumor imaging and therapy because tumor growth and metastasis largely depend on angiogenesis (3-5). Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine that modulates blood vessel development, angiogenesis, and tumor progression (6). There are three isoforms of TGF-β (β
