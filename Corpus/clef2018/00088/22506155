Treatment of transient osteoporosis of the hip with intravenous zoledronate - a case report -. Transient osteoporosis of the hip (TOH) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology that is characterized by acute onset of disabling bone pain. The locally increased bone turnover and low bone mineral density (BMD) associated with this disorder indicate a potential role for an antiresorptive agent such as bisphosphonate as a treatment. A previously healthy 46-year-old man developed the sudden onset of pain in his right buttock and inguinal area, especially during walking and caused him to limp. A thorough medical workup including X-ray, MRI, and bone SPECT revealed transient osteoporosis of the hip, and he was treated with an infusion of zoledronate (5 mg). Two weeks later, he was fully recovered from pain and the gait disturbance. A follow-up MRI of the hip joint taken after 6 months showed complete resolution. The use of intravenous zoledronate provided a successful outcome in the treatment of TOH. The possibility of TOH should be considered in patients complaining of sudden hip pain and a limping gait. MR imaging played an important role for differentiation of TOH from other aggressive conditions with long term sequelae.
