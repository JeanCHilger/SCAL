A fluorescent dipyrrinone oxime for the detection of pesticides and other organophosphates. An N,N-carbonyl-bridged dipyrrinone oxime has been synthesized and studied as a potential sensor for organophosphates. The molecular sensor underwent a drastic colorimetric response upon formation of the adduct. The pesticide dimethoate was found to produce the biggest spectral response, with a limit of detection equal to 4.0 ppm using UV-visible spectroscopy. Minimal fluorescence "turn on" via a PET mechanism was seen, and molecular modeling studies were used to explain the lower than expected PET response. The X-ray crystal structure of the fluorescent dipyrrinone oxime was also obtained.
