PET: Is myocardial flow quantification a clinical reality? Positron emission tomography (PET) enables quantitative measurements of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial flow reserve (MFR). Recent developments and improved availability of PET technology have resulted in growing interest in translation of quantitative flow analysis from mainly a research tool to routine clinical practice. Quantitative PET measurements of absolute MBF and MFR have potential to improve accuracy of myocardial perfusion imaging in diagnosis of multivessel coronary artery disease as well as definition of the extent and functional importance of stenoses. This article reviews recent advances and experience in the quantitative myocardial perfusion imaging together with issues that need to be resolved for quantitative analysis to become clinical reality.
