Spectrum of 18F-FDG PET/CT findings in patients presenting with fever of unknown origin. The objective of this article is to provide an illustrative tutorial highlighting the clinical utility of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for imaging patients presenting with fever of unknown origin (FUO).FDG PET/CT is a powerful tool in localizing an inciting source in patients with FUO. The high sensitivity of FDG PET/CT for diagnosing infective, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes can be exploited in this setting because these processes are often the common causes of FUO.
