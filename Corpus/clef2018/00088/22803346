Cloning, expression and characterization of a gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase gene bbh from Pseudomonas sp. L-1. Gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase is an enzyme that catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of L-carnitine. We cloned, expressed and characterized a gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase gene bbh from Pseudomonas sp. L-1, to facilitate the production of L-carnitine using microorganisms.We cloned bbh gene by PCR, and then cloned the open reading frame of bbh into pET-15b vector and expressed by Isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction. After His-Bind Resin purification, the characteristics of BBH were studied. The three-dimensional structure of BBH monomer was modeled by SWISS-MODEL Workspace and resting cells were used for L-carnitine transformation.We cloned a gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase gene bbh (GenBank: JQ250036) from Pseudomonas sp. L-1 and expressed the gene in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). BBH fusion protein was a homodimer, and the molecular weight of subunit was about 46.5kDa. The optimal temperature and pH was 30 degrees C and pH 7.5. The enzyme was stable below 45 degrees C. The enzyme was most stable at pH 6.0. We used resting cells of recombinant E. coli for L-carnitine biotransformation, after incubated at 30 degrees C and pH 7.0 for 31 h, the concentration of L-carnitine reached 12.7 mmol/L.The bbh gene from Pseudomonas sp. L-1 strain is remarkably different from that of reported one. The gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase expressed by this gene could effectively transform gamma-butyrobetaine for L-carnitine production. Beside by reporting of a bbh gene from bacteria, this research also provided a new process for biotransformation of L-carnitine.
