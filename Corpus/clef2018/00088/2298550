A method for evaluating the bronchial circulation. Preliminary observations. Due to the small size of the bronchial arteries, the bronchial circulation is difficult to study and remains poorly understood. We have utilized single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as a noninvasive means of studying the bronchial circulation. Imaging studies were performed in sheep before and after the introduction of a single pulmonary embolus. Digital bronchial arteriograms demonstrated the dilatation of the bronchial artery which is present on studies one week after embolization. SPECT bronchial perfusion scans reveal a wedge of increased activity that corresponds to a wedge of decreased activity on SPECT pulmonary perfusion images. Axial images available with SPECT provide information about regional alterations of bronchial perfusion not readily apparent on bronchial arteriograms.
