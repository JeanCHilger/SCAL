99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single photon emission CT in poststroke depression. In this pilot study of poststroke depression, the authors evaluated regional cerebral blood flow and depression in 14 stroke patients. Volume of ischemia was measured by two methods, which were highly correlated. Depression scores correlated with lesion volume as measured by single photon emission CT.
