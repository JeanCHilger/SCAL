The value of computerized tomography in the assessment of hepatic iron overload in genetic hemochromatosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of single-energy computed tomography in determining iron overload in idiopathic hemochromatosis, with special reference to slightly overloaded cases. Liver attenuation was determined in 100 patients (46 cases of idiopathic hemochromatosis, 32 cases of chronic liver disease, and 22 normal controls). The iron load was determined for the first two groups by biochemical determination of liver iron concentration (performed in all but 12 subjects in the chronic liver disease group) and hepatic histologic grading. The main results for liver attenuation (upper normal limit, 72 Hounsfield units) showed that despite a high specificity (0.96), this parameter was of low sensitivity (0.63). Although mean liver attenuation in idiopathic hemochromatosis (77 +/- 14) was significantly higher than in chronic liver diseases (53 +/- 17 p less than 10(-4], and normal controls (66 +/- 3
