A method for determining bone mineral content using Fourier image reconstruction and dual source technique. The basic principles of a quantitative tomographic technique for bone mineral determination are considered. The bone mineral content could be evaluated from a single reconstruction using projection data from two different energies. Beam hardening effects and photon counting statistics are studied by computer simulation and found to be the limiting factors in precision and accuracy.
