Ethological foundations in relation to animal husbandry technics. Ethological reflections concerning animal management and handling because of efficiency have to consider different factors of influence as for example animal/man-relationship, economy of labor and working conditions for men. Definitions of ethological methods were given, and the complexity between animal behavior and animal management were described. The quantification of men's ability to handle animals is treated. The evaluation of a cattle-keeping facility by the ethological concept of 'meeting of requirements and avoiding of damage' is reviewed.
