Behavior of dogs. The present results of comparative ethology in different dog breeds make plain their very variable demands in social life as in other environmental criteria. Dog breeds differ as greatly in behaviour characteristics that environmental demands in dogs are less to be described as "species typical" rather than as breed specific. Characteristics in behaviour that are typical of certain dog breeds could be proved especially in the following fields: 1. Ontogeny of behaviour does not develop in a "domestic dog typical" way, rather it is characterized by significant differences among dog breeds concerning the rate of development of certain behavioural characters and physiological processes (both relative retardation and relative acceleration compared to the ontogeny of behaviour in wolves). 2. There are breed typical differences in expressive behaviour and in communication. 3. Dog breeds show differences in social behaviour and bonding behaviour toward humans.
