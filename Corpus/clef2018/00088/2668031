Secretion of endothelin and related peptides from renal epithelial cell lines. Using specific radioimmunoassays (RIAs) for endothelin (ET) and big ET, we have studied whether ET and related peptides are secreted from renal epithelial cell lines (LLCPK1 and MDCK) of non-endothelial origin. Dilution curves of extracts of conditioned media from both LLCPK1 and MDCK cell lines were parallel to those of standard porcine (p) ET and big pET in each RIA. Both cell lines incubated in serum-free medium secreted ET- and C-terminal fragment (CTF)-like immunoreactivity (LI) of big ET as a function of time. Reverse-phase HPLC coupled with both RIAs of the extracted media from both cell lines revealed a single component with ET-LI coeluting with pET(1-21) and several components with CTF-LI, one corresponding to the elution position of big pET(1-39), one to its CTF(22-39), and the others eluting earlier than CTF. These data indicate that endothelin and related peptides are synthesized by and secreted from cells other than endothelial cells.
