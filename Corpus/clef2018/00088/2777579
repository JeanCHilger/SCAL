Thin layer chromatographic detection of kryptofix 2.2.2 in the routine synthesis of [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. A simple procedure for the detection of 4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxa-1,10-diazabicyclo (8.8.8) hexacosane (Kryptofix 2.2.2) in the final solution of [18F]FDG prepared by the aminopolyether supported nucleophilic substitution of 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl 2-O-trifluoromethanesulfonyl-beta-D-mannopyranose (Hamacher et al., 1986) has been developed. Presence of Kryptofix 2.2.2 in the routine production of [18F]FDG was detected using methanol/ammonium hydroxide (9:1) solvent system. A method to remove Kryptofix from [18F]FDG solution has been suggested.
