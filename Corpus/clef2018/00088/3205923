A comparison of scintigraphy with radioiodinated MIBG and CT in localizing pheochromocytomas. In order to define the diagnostic roles of MIBG imaging and CT in the detection of pheochromocytomas (pheos), the results obtained in 45 patients suspected of bearing pheo and studied with both modalities were analyzed and compared. Scintigraphy was correctly negative in 22/23 cases, correctly positive in 11/12 adrenal and 5/5 extra-adrenal pheos, and in 4/5 malignant pheos (metastases present in 2 cases were also identified). CT was correctly negative in 20/23 cases (a mass other than a pheo was detected in 3 patients) correctly positive in 12/12 adrenal and 4/5 extra-adrenal pheos and in 5/5 malignant pheos. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of scintigraphy and CT were 91% and 95.4%, 95.6% and 87%, 93.3% and 91.1% respectively (differences were not statistically significant). The overall data emphasize the complementary role of 123/131I-MIBG imaging and CT in the location of pheochromocytomas. A flow-chart essentially grounded on the combined use of both these diagnostic modalities is proposed which includes 123/131I-MIBG scintigraphy as a first choice examination.
