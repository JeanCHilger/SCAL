Positron emission tomography in assessment of regional stereospecificity of drugs. PET imaging has much to offer the pharmaceutical industry in the design and development of drugs, beginning with the radiolabelling of drugs to facilitate pharmacokinetic studies and extending to measurement of the effects of drugs on regional metbolism, such as that of glucose and oxygen, or in stimulating or blocking receptors, occupying enzymes or affecting substrate transport processes.
