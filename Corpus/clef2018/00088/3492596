Technetium-99m d,l-HM-PAO: a new radiopharmaceutical for SPECT imaging of regional cerebral blood perfusion. Following investigation of a large number of new ligands based upon propylene amine oxime (PnAO) the d,l-diastereoisomer of hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HM-PAO) was selected as the preferred ligand for 99mTc as a tracer for cerebral perfusion imaging. The neutral, lipophilic 99mTc complex of d,l-HM-PAO was formed in high yield by stannous reduction of 99Mo/99mTc generator eluate using a kit formulation of the ligand. Two minutes following i.v. administration of this complex in rats, 2.25% of the injected dose appears in the brain. Little washout of the tracer is observed up to 24 hr postinjection. By qualitative autoradiographic comparison with iodoantipyrine this new radiopharmaceutical displays blood flow dependent brain uptake with little redistribution of the tracer over time. The lipophilic 99mTc complex converts slowly in vitro to a secondary complex. This conversion process may account for the ability of [99mTc]d,l-HM-PAO to be retained within the brain without redistribution.
