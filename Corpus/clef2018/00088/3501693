Positron emission tomography study of human brain functional development. From over 100 children studied with 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose and positron emission tomography we selected 29 children (aged 5 days to 15.1 years) who had suffered transient neurological events not significantly affecting normal neurodevelopment. These 29 children were reasonably representative of normal children and provided an otherwise unobtainable population in which to study developmental changes in local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (lCMRGlc). In infants less than 5 weeks old lCMRGlc was highest in sensorimotor cortex, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellar vermis. By 3 months, lCMRGlc had increased in parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices basal ganglia
