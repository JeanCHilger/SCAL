Results of scintigraphy with m-[123I]iodobenzylguanidine in neuroblastoma in children. From 46 [123I]m IBG scans performed in 33 children, excellent specificity (96%) and good sensitivity (90%) appeared in the detection of neuroblastoma less differentiated non catecholamine-excreting tumours remained undetected. As any localization to be seen was clearly visualized on the 24-h scan, the use of the [123I]m IBG (p, 5n) is recommended for the diagnosis, staging and follow-up of neuroblastoma in children.
