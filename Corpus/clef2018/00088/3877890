Cerebral uptake and retention of 99Tcm-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99Tcm-HM-PAO). A new radiopharmaceutical, 99Tcm-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99Tcm-HM-PAO) is described. This agent displays considerable promise for imaging cerebral blood flow. In studies in rats and one human volunteer, 99Tcm-HM-PAO demonstrates good brain uptake, prolonged retention of activity in the brain, and slow regional redistribution. These properties suggest that this new radiopharmaceutical is ideal for single photon emission tomographic (SPECT) imaging of cerebral blood flow.
