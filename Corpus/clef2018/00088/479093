Automated fluorometric determination of vitamin C in foods. Two automated fluorometric methods were compared with the official AOAC methods for determining vitamin C in fortified ready-to-eat cereals, fruits, vegetables, baby foods, flour products, pet foods, meats, frozen dinners, juices, and nutritional health bars. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate on 2 days and included a recovery study on all products. Egberg's semiautomated method (Method 1) and Roy's automated method (Method 2) were compared with the manual AOAC tritrimetric and fluorometric methods. The correlation factor for Methods 1 and 2 were 0.999 and 0.979, respectively, when compared with the AOAC methods. The recovery study showed average recoveries of 97.8% for Method 1, 99.3% for Method 2, and 100.6% for the AOAC methods. The results suggest that Method 1 is the method of choice for the majority of the products analyzed.
