Cryptococcus neoformans in fecal matter of birds kept in cages--Control of Cr. neoformans habitats. The occurrence of cryptococcosis in predamaged persons in whom the fecal matter of caged birds had been suspected as the source of infection has led to the present investigation. In the excreta of only four out of a total of 142 bird species kept by the Berlin Zoological Gardens, Cryptococcus neoformans could be demonstrated with the aid of Guizotia abyssinica creatinine agar: Twany Frogmouth (Podargus strigoides, G. Eulenschwalm) Palm Cockatoo (Probosciger aterrimus, G. Arakakadu)
