Nuclear cardiology, current applications in clinical practice. The clinical applications of nuclear cardiology have rapidly expanded since the introduction of suitable imaging cameras and readily applicable isotopes. The currently available methods can provide useful data on estimates of ventricular function and detection of myocardial ischemia for adequate patient management. Two standard procedures are routinely used: (1) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, eg, with thallium 201 and (2) radionuclide angiocardiography by using technetium 99m-labeled red blood cells. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy provides information on regional viability and estimates regional myocardial perfusion by measuring regional tracer activity. Thallium 201 is the agent used for noninvasive assessment of myocardial perfusion and for improving the results of exercise electrocardiography. Alternative tests, such as pharmacologic stress testing with dipyridamole, have been proposed as a reliable substitute for exercise testing. Additional quantitative analysis and computed tomography have increased the sensitivity and specificity of thallium scintigraphy. Radionuclide angiography techniques are used for the noninvasive evaluation of cardiac function, right and left ventricular function, and wall motion abnormalities. As in perfusion scintigraphy, radionuclide angiography has proven its value for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD). Abnormal regional wall motion abnormalities are specific for CAD.
