Cerebellar diaschisis in pontine infarctions: a report of five cases. We evaluate regional cerebral and cerebellar perfusion to prove the occurrence and follow the persistence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis in infratentorial pontine infarction. Six consecutive patients exhibiting mild hemiparetic symptoms or a heavy feeling in the head (mean age 65 years four women, two men) and diagnosed as having pontine infarction by magnetic resonance imaging were subjected to evaluation. Lesions due to infarction were located at the upper basis pontis in five patients and the upper tegmentum pontis in one, and medially at the paramedian portion in four and laterally in two. Regional cerebral and cerebellar perfusion was evaluated semiquantitatively by iodine-123 N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (IMP) single-photon emission tomography (SPET)
