Serial myocardial perfusion imaging with dipyridamole and rubidium-82 to assess restenosis after angioplasty. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients at high risk for clinical restenosis, following coronary angioplasty, could be identified by myocardial perfusion imaging performed with dipyridamole- 82Rb PET.Forty-five patients (34 men, 11 women mean age 58.5 yr) who had successful single-vessel angioplasty and were asymptomatic had dipyridamole-82Rb PET at 1 and 3 mo after the procedure. Abnormal flow reserve in the distribution of the angioplasty artery on PET was considered to be a decrease of > or = 1 perfusion grade in response to dipyridamole (assessed qualitatively from tomographic images and polar coordinate maps). Follow-up was performed for 6 mo postangioplasty. Clinical restenosis was defined as recurrent angina similar to that occurring before angioplasty and/or > or = 50% stenosis at the angioplasty site documented angiographically. We analyzed abnormal flow reserve in the distribution of the angioplasty vessel to identify which patients were at high risk for clinical restenosis.Fourteen patients developed clinical restenosis between 1 and 6 mo postangioplasty. Abnormal relative flow reserve in the distribution of the angioplasty vessel was present prior to the development of symptoms in 13 of 14 patients with clinical restenosis and in 8 of 31 patients without clinical restenosis (sensitivity 93%, specificity 74%, p < 0.0001). PET imaging successfully separated postangioplasty patients into groups with high (62%) and low (4%) risk of clinical restenosis.Abnormal relative flow reserve in the distribution of the angioplasty vessel on dipyridamole PET identifies asymptomatic postangioplasty patients at risk for clinical restenosis.
