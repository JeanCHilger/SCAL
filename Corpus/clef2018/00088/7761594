Calculating local doses in the area of a positron emission tomograph. The assessment of local doses in the vicinity of a planned positron emission tomograph is an important aspect of site planning.Using a fictitious site plan for a positron emission tomograph and assuming realistic protocols for patient studies, a complete dose calculation was carried out. The calculation was based on 960 patient studies per year and included 380 cardiological, 290 neurological, and 290 oncological studies.The calculation resulted in local doses between 0.7 and 16.0 mSv/y at different positions in the environment of the PET system. Based on these results, the radiation exposure of the personnel working in the PET area was assessed, and additional shielding or protection measures were proposed.The method presented can easily be applied to any PET site plan and any study protocol. It enables the user to do a detailed and sophisticated assessment of local doses and easily to include modifications of the study protocols or of the site geometry.
