Combined rest thallium-201/stress technetium-99m-tetrofosmin SPECT: feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of a 90-minute protocol. Technetium-99m tetrofosmin is a recently developed compound that clears from background organs rapidly. Tetrofosmin has a good correlation with 201Tl. This study assesses the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of a combined protocol involving rest 201Tl SPECT and stress imaging with 99mTc-tetrofosmin.Twenty-five patients (23 men, 2 women aged 36-73 yr) with known coronary artery disease underwent the combined protocol. Twenty minutes after the resting injection of 201Tl, resting SPECT data were acquired using low-energy, high-resolution collimators. A stress test using adenosine infusion combined with low-level dynamic exercise was performed. The stress data were collected 20 min later. The reconstructed vertical long-axis, horizontal long-axis and short-axis slices were analyzed qualitatively. Analysis was carried out using nine segments of the left ventricle. The segments were reported either as fixed or reversible. The results were compared to coronary angiography results.The sensitivity and specificity for the detection of diseased coronary vessels were 85% and 70% for the left anterior descending territory, respectively, 78% and 71% for the right coronary artery, and 69% and 70% for the left circumflex. Overall, the sensitivity was 80% and the specificity 70%.Combined rest 201Tl/stress 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT provides a protocol of short duration which displays similar diagnostic accuracy to a protocol using tetrofosmin as a single agent.
