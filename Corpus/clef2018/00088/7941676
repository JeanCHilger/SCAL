Cardiopulmonary capacity in patients with coronary heart disease. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) allows a non-invasive control of the cardiopulmonary exercise capacity. In this study, we wanted to investigate if the CPX can be securely, practicably, and accurately performed in patients with invasively documented coronary heart disease (CHD). Furthermore, we wanted to find out the clinical value of CPX in CHD diagnosis. The CPX measurements (symptom-limited ramp program with 20 Watts increase/min
