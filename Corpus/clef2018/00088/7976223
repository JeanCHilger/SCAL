Brain glucose metabolism in postanoxic syndrome due to cardiac arrest. Using positron emission tomography (PET), thirteen studies of regional brain glucose utilization were performed in 12 patients with postanoxic syndrome due to cardiac arrest. Investigations were carried out at least one month after brain anoxia. Seven subjects were in a persistent vegetative state. The others had regained normal consciousness with various residual neurological signs. When compared with normal values obtained in 16 normal, age-matched subjects, mean cerebral glucose metabolism was drastically decreased (+/- 50%) in vegetative cases, and to a lesser degree (+/- 25%) in conscious subjects. The most consistent regional alterations were observed in the parieto-occipital cortex (9 cases), the frontier between vertebral and carotid arterial territories. Other selective anomalies were found in the frontomesial junction (5 cases), the striatum (3 cases with dystonia), and the visual cortex (2 cases with cortical blindness). This study suggests that cerebral anoxia results in a global brain hypometabolism, which appears related to the vigilance state, as well as in regional disturbances preferentially located in arterial border zones. Although our findings remain to be confirmed in larger series, they suggest that PET provides a useful index of residual brain tissue function after anoxia and may assist in the monitoring of postanoxic encephalopathies.
