Decreased dopamine transporters with age in health human subjects. The effects of aging on brain dopamine transporters was evaluated in 26 healthy male volunteers (age range, 21-63 years) using positron emission tomography and [11C]cocaine. The ratio of the distribution volume for [11C]cocaine in basal ganglia to that in cerebellum was used as a model parameter for dopamine transporter availability and showed a significant negative correlation with age (r = 0.65, p < 0.0005). This results document an age-related decline in dopamine transporters in healthy individuals.
