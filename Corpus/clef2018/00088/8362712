Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in left bundle branch block: a perspective on the issue from image analysis in a clinical context. Among selected study populations, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) has been reported to show a low specificity for the diagnosis of coronary disease. However, the stress electrocardiogram (ECG) is nondiagnostic in this setting. To place this method in its appropriate clinical context, we evaluated MPS in all 69 consecutive patients with LBBB studied with scintigraphy for clinical reasons during a 4-year period. Among 32 patients who underwent coronary angiography for clinical indications, per patient sensitivity, 96% per vessel sensitivity, 84%, 50%, and 100% for left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX), and right coronary artery (RCA) involvement, respectively
