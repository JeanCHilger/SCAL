A computerized three-dimensional atlas of the human skull and brain. To develop an anatomic atlas of the human head based on a volume model derived from MR and CT.Every voxel of this model was labeled by a neuroanatomist concerning its membership to a structural and/or functional region. A computer program was written that, instead of displaying precomputed images, allows the user to choose and compose arbitrary views.The user can subtract parts and ask for annotations just by using the mouse. Conversely, one can compose images by choosing objects from the list of anatomical constituents which is displayed on the screen. A set of dissection tools allows a "look and feel" that comes near to a true dissection. Operations that are not possible in a real dissection, such as reassembly or filling cavities, can be performed.The authors have developed a computerized model that can be used for anatomy teaching and also as a reference for radiologists or surgeons. To replace classical atlases, the spatial resolution must be improved and speed must approach real time. Functional imaging data (position emission tomography and single photon emission CT) can be added to the system. The system is mobile and can be situated in classrooms, operating rooms, reading rooms, and libraries.
