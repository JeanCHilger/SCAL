Cardiotoxic properties of cocaine: studies with positron emission tomography. This study documented marked accumulation of cocaine in the human and baboon heart, which was not inhibited by desipramine pretreatment. However, cocaine inhibited 6-[18F]fluoronorepinephrine uptake in heart to the same degree as did desipramine (Fowler et al. 1994). Since uptake of [18F]norepinephrine in the heart is a function of its uptake by the NE transporter (Fowler et al. 1994), its inhibition by cocaine corroborates in vivo a significant interaction of cocaine with this transporter.
