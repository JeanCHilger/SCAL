Increased QT dispersion and cardiac adrenergic dysinnervation in diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy. Diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy showed an increase in QTc dispersion correlated with cardiac adrenergic dysinnervation. A larger prospective study in a diabetic population is needed to assess whether QT dispersion increases the risk of arrhythmogenicity through autonomic dysfunction.
