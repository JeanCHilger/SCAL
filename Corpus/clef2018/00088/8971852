Synthesis and preliminary evaluation of (S)-(2-[18F]fluoro-4,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-methyl L-alanine, (S)-[18F]-FMEDOPA, a potentially improved imaging agent for the presynaptic dopaminergic nervous system. The synthesis and preliminary rat biodistribution studies of (S)-(2-[18F]fluoro-4,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-methyl L-alanine, (S)-[18F]-FMEDOPA, a potentially improved imaging agent for the presynaptic dopaminergic nervous system, are reported. (S)-[18F]-FMEDOPA produces a higher striatum-to-cerebellum (S/C) radioactivity ratio than the currently used PET imaging agent, (S)-[18F]-FDOPA, does at 180 min after administration.
