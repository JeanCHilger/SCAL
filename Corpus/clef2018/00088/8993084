Venlafaxine or bupropion responders but not nonresponders show baseline prefrontal and paralimbic hypometabolism compared with controls. In this study, 11 unipolar depressed outpatients received baseline (medication-free) fluorine-18 deoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans prior to randomization to double-blind venlafaxine or bupropion monotherapy, with the option of a subsequent medication crossover. Based on Clinical Global impressions ratings, 6 of 11 responded to at least one medication. Regional cerebral glucose metabolic rate (rCMRglu) for these 6 responders was compared with 18 age- and gender-matched healthy controls the 5 nonresponders were compared with 15 matched healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, responders showed decreased (normalized > absolute) left middle frontal gyral, bilateral medial prefrontal, and bilateral temporal rCMRglu. In contrast, nonresponders showed decreased (normalized > absolute) cerebellar rCMRglu. These preliminary data suggest that among never-hospitalized unipolar depressed out-patients, those showing baseline prefrontal and paralimbic hypometabolism may be more likely to show a positive response to standard antidepressant treatments such as venlafaxine or bupropion.
