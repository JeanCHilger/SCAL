Possible nosocomial transmission of psittacosis. To investigate a cluster of seven pneumonia cases among persons exposed to a pet-shop worker hospitalized with psittacosis.Epidemiological study of the outbreak, sero-diagnostic evaluation of exposed persons with pneumonia and retrospective review of the pneumonia cases.450-bed teaching community hospital.Employees of the nursing unit where the patient with psittacosis was hospitalized.The index case had laboratory and clinical evidence of psittacosis. Four of the seven exposed persons who developed pneumonia had serologic results that met criteria for a diagnosis of psittacosis, and three met criteria for Chlamydia pneumoniae infection, possibly reflecting cross-reactivity between the microimmunofluorescence assays for the two diseases. The epidemiological graph suggested a relationship between the index case and the cluster of pneumonias in exposed individuals.Psittacosis may have been transmitted person to person in a hospital setting.
