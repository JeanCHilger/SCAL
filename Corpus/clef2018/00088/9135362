Regional cerebral blood flow (SPECT) during anaesthesia with isoflurane and nitrous oxide in humans. Nitrous oxide and isoflurane have different effects on absolute cerebral blood flow (CBF) and regional distribution of CBF in humans. In this study we examined the effects of isoflurane in combination with nitrous oxide on CBF. We studied 10 patients (two groups of five patients, ASA I) anaesthetized with 50% nitrous oxide and either 0.5 or 1.0 MAC of isoflurane during normocapnia (PaCO2 5.7 kPa) using two-dimensional CBF measurement (CBFxenon) (i.v. 133xenon washout technique) and a three-dimensional method for measurement of regional CBF (rCBF) distribution with SPECT (single photon emission computer-aided tomography with 99mTc- HMPAO). The results were compared with 1.0 MAC of isoflurane from a previous study performed in exactly the same way as the present investigation. During normocapnia, anaesthesia with 50% nitrous oxide and 0.5 MAC of isoflurane resulted in a mean CBFxenon of 45 (SEM 5) ISI units. Increasing the isoflurane concentration to 1.0 MAC had no significant effect on mean CBFxenon (53 (5) ISI units). Both flow values were significantly (P = 0.01) higher than the CBFxenon value obtained when 1 MAC of isoflurane was administered alone (33 (3) ISI units). There were no significant differences in rCBF distribution regardless of whether or not isoflurane was given alone or together with nitrous oxide at 0.5 or 1 MAC. In all situations there were higher relative flows in subcortical regions (thalamus and basal ganglia, 10%) and in the pons (7-10% above average). rCBF in the cerebellum was approximately 10% greater than average. In summary, we have found that mean CBF was greater with combined nitrous oxide and isoflurane anaesthesia than previously found with isoflurane alone however, relative flow distribution was similar.
