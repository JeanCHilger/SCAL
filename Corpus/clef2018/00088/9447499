EEG power correlates with subcortical metabolic activity in AIDS. The authors studied the relationship between brain metabolic activity and quantitative electroencephalographic power in AIDS. Basal ganglia and thalamic metabolic activity, measured with positron emission tomography, correlated positively with EEG power in the 6-10-Hz band across most head regions. Metabolic activity of anatomically defined cortical regions did not correlate with EEG power recorded over each region. These results support previously reported associations between abnormalities in subcortical metabolic activity and EEG activity. The lack of correlation between cortical metabolic activity and EEG activity suggests that previously observed abnormalities in EEG activity are primarily subcortical in origin.
