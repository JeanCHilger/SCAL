Noninvasive measurement of a input function using beta camera for 15O-water injection method. Dynamic images of positron distribution in artery were measured for noninvasive measurement of input function using beta camera. The beta camera was attached from the skin surface on the artery of arm during the PET measurement using the 15O-water injection method. Beta camera used had a field of view of 20 mm in diameter. After injection of 15O-water, time sequence images of the artery of 10 sec interval 15 frames were obtained. Regions of interest (ROIs) were set on the artery and on the adjacent area of the artery. By subtracting average counts in the latter ROI from in the former ROI, time activity curve similar to input function was noninvasively obtained.
