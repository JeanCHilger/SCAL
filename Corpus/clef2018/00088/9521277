Absence of normal activation of the left anterior fusiform gyrus during naming in left temporal lobe epilepsy. Patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often have impaired naming. We studied 13 patients with left TLE and 10 healthy control subjects with [(15)O]H2O PET during visual confrontation naming. Statistical mapping detected multiple regions of significant cerebral blood flow increases within individuals. The left fusiform gyrus was activated in nine healthy subjects, but only in two patients with TLE (a significant difference, p < 0.001). Other activation sites were more variable in healthy subjects and those with TLE. Impaired naming ability may be associated with a lack of increased cerebral blood flow in the left fusiform gyrus in TLE.
