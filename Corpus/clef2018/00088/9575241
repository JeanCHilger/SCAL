Monoamine oxidase B single-photon emission tomography with [123I]Ro 43-0463: imaging in volunteers and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Imaging of monoamine oxidase of subtype B (MAO B) is of interest in various neurological diseases. In the past non-invasive assessment of MAO B has only been possible with positron emission tomography (PET) ligands. Given the limited availability of PET, a single-photon emission tomography (SPET) ligand would be desirable. In this study SPET imaging with the new MAO B inhibitor [123I]Ro 43-0463 was performed in five volunteers and nine patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In two volunteers a second study was performed 12 h following blockade with deprenyl. In the TLE patients the tracer was administered as bolus (n = 4) or as prolonged infusion (n = 5). The regional uptake pattern correlated well with the known distribution of MAO B. In the two blocking studies ligand uptake was substantially reduced compared with baseline. In the TLE patients increased uptake was found in the ipsilateral mesial temporal lobe and, surprisingly, in the ipsilateral putamen. This study indicates the potential of the new SPET ligand [123I]Ro 43-0463 to map MAO B concentration in the human brain. The new finding of increased MAO B in the putamen of TLE patients needs further studies to elucidate its exact pathophysiology.
