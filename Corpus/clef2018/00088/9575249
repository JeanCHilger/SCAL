Regional myocardial wall thickening and global ejection fraction in patients with low angiographic left ventricular ejection fraction assessed by visual and quantitative resting ECG-gated 99mTc-tetrofosmin single-photon emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. We investigated the use of visual and quantitative technetium 99m tetrofosmin ECG-gated single-photon emission tomography (SPET) for the assessment of regional myocardial wall thickening (WT) and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) in comparison with gated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with a low angiographic LVEF. Gated SPET using 99mTc-labelled flow tracers offers potential for simultaneous assessment of myocardial perfusion and LV function. Few data are available on the use of visual and quantitative gated SPET in patients with low LVEF. In this study 21 patients with low angiographic LVEF (mean 37%+/-5%) were studied. Resting gated 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPET and gated MRI were performed within 48 h. WT was assessed by visual interpretation (five point score) and quantitative analysis based on count increase. There was good agreement for EF measurements by MRI and gated SPET (mean EF: 33%+/-12% vs 35%+/-11%, r = 0.86, P<0.001). Areas under receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC) for differentiation between MRI WT score points ranged from 0.60 to 0.66 for visual SPET WT analysis, from 0.59 to 0.71 for delta count increase values and from 0.46 to 0.60 for % WT, indicating substantial overlap between WT categories. Absolute agreement for visual WT between MRI and gated SPET ranged from 25% to 57% (kappa 0.03-0.25) depending on tracer uptake, and was limited in areas with moderate to severe perfusion defects (kappa 0.03-0.13). It is concluded that gated SPET provided reliable estimates of regional WT and global function in patients with low angiographic LVEF.
