Impact of exercise rehabilitation on cardiac neuronal function in heart failure: an iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy study. Exercise training can induce important haemodynamic and metabolic adaptations in patients with chronic heart failure due to severe left ventricular dysfunction. This study examined the impact of exercise rehabilitation on cardiac neuronal function using iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy, Fourteen patients (11 men, 3 women mean age 48 years
