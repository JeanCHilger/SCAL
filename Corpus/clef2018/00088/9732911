Hemodynamic effects of arbutamine. This study examined the hemodynamic effects of arbutamine, a synthetic catecholamine, in 12 patients with and 7 patients without coronary artery disease. Arbutamine produced a balanced positive inotropic (increase in left ventricular dp/dt) and chronotropic effect (increase in heart rate).
