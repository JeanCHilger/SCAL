Relatively preserved hippocampal glucose metabolism in mild Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of this study was to clarify the changes in hippocampal glucose metabolism in mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) using positron emission tomography (PET) and 2-(18F)fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). Forty-one patients with probable mild AD (age: 69.0 +/- 8.0 years MMSE: 22.6 +/- 2.1) and 22 normal volunteers (age: 67.7 +/- 7.1 years) were studied. The regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRglc) was measured using FDG and PET. Although the mean CMRglc in the parietal region was significantly lower in the AD group (right: 6.35 +/- 1.26 mg/100 g/min
