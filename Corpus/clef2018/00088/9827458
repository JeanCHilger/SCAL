Disorders of microcirculation in coronary heart disease. Disturbances of microcirculation in coronary artery disease can be seen in the presence of critical stenosis of epicardial coronary arteries, as a result of endothelial dysfunction in the absence of significant stenosis or during recovery of ischaemic myocardium after successful angioplasty of stenosed or occluded coronary arteries. Diagnostic methods are morphologic/morphometric analyses, measurement of the global coronary reserve, measurement of the regional coronary microcirculation (scintigraphy, positron emission tomography) and laboratory analysis of haemorheological alterations (plasma, erythrocytes, leucocytes). After successful angioplasty, normalisation of glutamate extraction rate takes three to six months. In patients with unstable angina, changes in plasma viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation and neutrophil activation occur. Neutrophils are activated after successful angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction and even after elective angioplasty (when measured in the coronary sinus). Therapeutic improvements of disturbed microvascular flow can be obtained by increasing perfusion pressure (by revascularisation, nitrates, calcium antagonists, physical training), by improving the fluidity of the blood and by reducing the extravascular component of coronary vascular resistance (by antihypertensive treatment).
