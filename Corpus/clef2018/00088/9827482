Treatment strategies in therapy refractory angina pectoris: transmyocardial laser revascularization. Does transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMLR) as a new surgical technique for treating patients with otherwise intractable angina pectoris improve myocardial perfusion or contractility?Sixty-seven patients transferred for TMLR were evaluated by clinical evaluation, treadmill stress testing, echocardiography, ventriculography, and hybrid positron emission tomography preoperatively and in patients treated with TMLR at 6 and 12 month follow up. Hemodynamic assessment and clinical evaluation were performed perioperatively.In 28/67 cases (42%) CABG, in 9/67 patients (13%) CABG in combination with TMLR (combined group), and in 30/67 patients (45%) only TMLR (sole group) were performed. Perioperative mortality in the sole group was 13%, in the combined group zero, and in the CABG group 11%. In all groups a significantly improved clinical status (p < or = 0.01) 1 week postoperatively and in TMLR groups also at 6 and 12 months was observed. In the TMLR groups treadmill tolerance (p < 0.05) improved, although function, perfusion, and metabolism did not change significantly at the 6 and 12 month follow up.TMLR significantly improves clinical status and treadmill stress tolerance, but does not change function, perfusion, and metabolism.
