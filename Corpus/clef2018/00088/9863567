New iodinated progestins as potential ligands for progesterone receptor imaging in breast cancer. Part 1: Synthesis and in vitro pharmacological characterization. Five putative iodinated progesterone receptor (PR) binding ligands were synthesized and evaluated as potential imaging agents for PR-positive human breast tumours. Two compounds (E- and Z-17-hydroxy-21-iodo-19-nor-17alpha-pregna-4,20-dien-3-one E- and Z-IPG1) were previously described, but are re-evaluated. The other three were novel compounds: two nortestosterone analogues derived from ORG 3236 (E- and Z-13-ethyl-17-hydroxy-21-iodo-11-methylene-18,19-dinor-17alpha-pre gna-4,20-diene-3-one
