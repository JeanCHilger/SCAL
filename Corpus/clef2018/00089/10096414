Characterization of cerebral blood oxygenation and flow changes during prolonged brain activation. The behavior of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation during prolonged brain activation was studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sensitized to flow and oxygenation changes, as well as positron emission tomography sensitized to flow. Neuronal habituation effects and hemodynamic changes were evaluated across tasks and cortical regions. Nine types of activation stimuli or tasks, including motor activation, vibrotactile stimulation, and several types of visual stimulation, were used. Both flow and oxygenation were evaluated in separate time course series as well as simultaneously using two different MRI methods. In most cases, the activation-induced increase in flow and oxygenation remained elevated for the entire stimulation duration. These results suggest that both flow rate and oxygenation consumption rate remain constant during the entire time that primary cortical neurons are activated by a task or a stimulus.
