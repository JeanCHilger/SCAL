Follow-up of radial arterial catheterization for positron emission tomography studies. Radial arterial catheterization is needed for repeated arterial blood samples to construct tracer input curves of positron emission tomography (PET) scans (Herscovitch [1993]: Rheum Dis Clin North Am 19:765-794). Complications resulting from such short-term catheterizations are rare. Sixteen investigators followed 106 subjects who had arterial lines placed in the context of a PET study. Abnormalities were reported in 8 of 106 (7.5%) cases. Of these eight cases, three (37.5%) were inpatients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, a condition that may represent a risk factor. All abnormalities were benign, did not affect motor function, and did not require medical intervention.
