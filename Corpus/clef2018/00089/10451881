Clinical significance of denervated but viable myocardium in patients with recanalized acute myocardial infarction. In patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI), myocardial sympathetic innervation evaluated by 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy is more sensitive to ischaemia than the associated perfusion abnormality of 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the scintigraphic indices related to the recovery of left ventricular function after acute MI. 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine and 201Tl-chloride imaging were performed in 15 patients (mean age 60 years, 13 men and 2 women) 2 weeks after the onset of acute MI. Using a 20-segment visual interpretation of the 201Tl image, myocardial segments were classified into persistent defect, redistribution or reverse redistribution, and normal 201Tl uptake. The extent of denervated segments showed a fair correlation with the ejection fraction on admission (r = -0.53, P = 0.04), whereas the extent of persistent defect had a close correlation with the ejection fraction at 4 months (r = -0.79, P = 0.01). There was a good correlation between the extent of denervated but viable myocardium and the change in ejection fraction from admission to 4 months (r = 0.68, P = 0.01). Thus, denervated but viable myocardium is a scintigraphic index related to the functional recovery of left ventricular pump function after acute MI.
