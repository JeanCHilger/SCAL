Hypofrontality and negative symptoms in patients with dementia of Alzheimer type. The purpose of the current study was to examine the relation between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and negative symptoms (NS) in patients with dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT).Negative symptoms in neuropsychiatric disorders were associated with altered rCBF in frontal cortex.Twenty-five subjects with a diagnosis of DAT were administered the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Mini-Mental State Examination. The subjects were divided into two groups by means of a median split with regard to NS severity (high NS group, N = 12 low NS group, N = 13). Each patient underwent a single photon emission tomography scan using 99mTc-HMPAO at rest. Cortical and subcortical regions of interest were symmetrically defined in each hemisphere. Cortical-to-cerebellar perfusion ratios were established quantitatively using ADAC software.High NS group subjects had a significantly lower rCBF than low NS group subjects in the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus (MANOVA: p = 0.022) as a result of differences in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally (right: F = 12.12, p = 0.002 left: F = 6.55, p = 0.02) and in the frontal cortex, mainly in the right hemisphere (right: F = 6.33, p = 0.02This study indicates that decreased perfusion in the frontal cortex is associated with NS severity but not with measures of cognitive impairment or depressive symptoms in DAT patients. These results support the hypothesis that the frontal lobes may be involved in the cause of NS in DAT, and they underscore the importance of NS evaluation in neuroimaging studies.
