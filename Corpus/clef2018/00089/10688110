When is hilar uptake of 67Ga-citrate indicative of residual disease after CHOP chemotherapy? The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and characterize the patterns of hilar uptake (HU) on 67Ga-citrate imaging after cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy regimens for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), to differentiate hilar lymphoma (HL) from HU of benign etiology.A total of 930 studies (698 planar, 232 thoracic SPECT) was reviewed retrospectively in 100 NHL patients (29 low-grade, 60 intermediate-grade, and 11 high-grade) treated with CHOP and followed up longitudinally with serial gallium studies (planar: median, 7 range, 3-16 studies in 100 patientsHU after CHOP was present in 79% of patients (90% confidence interval [CI], 71%-85%), with 33% showing HU on SPECT alone. Once present, HU persisted for a median of 27 mo (range, 2-84 mo) from onset. The prevalence of HU and HL at various time points was as follows: baseline HU, 52% with HL 60% mid-CHOP HU, 59% with HL2%HU after CHOP is common (overall incidence, 79%), often seen only on SPECT, and most likely of benign etiology when symmetric and less intense than the original disease. Asymmetric HU that equals the intensity of the original disease, however, is a possible indicator for HL.
