Iodinated free fatty acid and 201T1 uptake in chronically hypoperfused myocardium: histologic correlation study. 123I-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) is a tracer for the evaluation of ischemic heart disease. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between 1231-BMIPP uptake and myocardial fibrosis.Fifteen patients who underwent cardiac surgery were examined by imaging with 201TI and 123I-BMIPP, and histologic specimens were taken during surgery. The relative uptake of 201TI (%TI) and that of 123I-BMIPP (%BMIPP) were calculated. The percentage of fibrosis (%fibrosis) was analyzed with the specimen.%TI correlated strongly with %fibrosis (r = -0.94 P < 0.001). %BMIPP also correlated significantly with %fibrosis (r = -0.88123I-BMIPP gave specific information about metabolic changes that occurred in ischemic myocardium without severe fibrotic changes.
