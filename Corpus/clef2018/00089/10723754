Evaluation of hemodynamics in cerebral infarction using MRI with FAIR sequence. In comparison with 99mTc-ECD SPECT, the usefulness for evaluation of cerebral blood flow by the perfusion images using MRI with FAIR sequence was studied in ischemic stroke patients. Among 27 cases, 15 patients showed lacunar infarctions and 12 patients showed cortical infarctions determined by T2 weighted MR images. FAIR images were obtained as single images at the slice position running through the basal ganglia or corona radiata. The inversion times(TI) were varied, ranging from 800 to 1,400 msec. In 15 patients without definite low perfusions in the SPECT study, FAIR images showed sequentially proxymal arterial branches in early phase and distal arterial branches or capillary beds in the cortical tissues in a late phase as the TI was elongated. Nine of the 12 patients with low cerebral perfusions in the SPECT study showed perfusion defects in FAIR imaging. Five of the 12 patients with a small low cerebral perfusion area in the SPECT study showed a delay of the depiction of cortical arteries along with TI elongation. In 3 patients, ischemic lesions demonstrated by the SPECT study was not shown in the MRI study because of motion artifacts. In conclusion, FAIR imagings are considered to be useful in the evaluation of cerebral flow dynamics in the ischemic stroke patients.
