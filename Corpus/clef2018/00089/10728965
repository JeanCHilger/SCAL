Single-photon emission computed tomographic myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with mitral valve prolapse. The possibility of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia due to mitral valve prolapse (MVP) in the absence of coronary artery disease was evaluated with single-photon emission computed tomographic analysis using thallium-201 and technetium-99m sestamibi in 72 patients with MVP. Exercise electrocardiography was positive in 5 patients (8%), but single-photon emission computed tomography was found to be normal in all patients, and exercise-induced chest pain, electrocardiographic changes, and arrhythmias were found not to be related to myocardial ischemia in patients with MVP.
