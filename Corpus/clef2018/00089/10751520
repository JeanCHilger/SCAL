Body position and cardiac dynamic and chronotropic responses to steady-state isocapnic hypoxaemia in humans. Neural mediation of the human cardiac response to isocapnic (IC) steady-state hypoxaemia was investigated using coarse-graining spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). Six young adults were exposed in random order to a hypoxia or control protocol, in supine and sitting postures, while end-tidal PCO2 (PET,CO2) was clamped at resting eucapnic levels. An initial 11 min period of euoxia (PET,O2 100 mmHg 13.3 kPa) was followed by a 22 min exposure to hypoxia (PET,O2 55 mmHg
