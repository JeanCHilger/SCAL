Reverse redistribution of thallium-201 myocardial single photon emission tomography and contractile reserve. The present study investigated the contractile reserve of myocardium exhibiting reverse redistribution (RRD) of thallium-201 (201Tl) after acute myocardial infarction. Forty patients experiencing their first acute myocardial infarction underwent resting 201Tl single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and low-dose (5-10 microgxkg(-1)xmin(-1)) dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) within 4 weeks after the onset of infarction. The left ventricle was divided into 13 segments for analysis. The severity of defects in 201Tl SPECT and the extent of wall motion abnormality in DSE were visually assessed and scored. The sum of each defect score and wall motion score of infarct-related segments were defined as total defect score (TDS) and total wall motion score (TWM), respectively. Quantitative analysis of 201Tl uptake was also performed. Resting 201Tl SPECT revealed RRD in 16 patients (group RRD), fixed defect (FIX) in 23 patients (group FIX), and redistribution in one. There was a significant difference in improvement of TWM between rest and stress in TWM in both the RRD and FIX groups (p<0.0001, each case). The improvement of TWM with dobutamine was significantly greater in RRD than in FIX (1.6+/-1.0 vs 0.6+/-0.7, p=0.001). There was a positive correlation between the magnitude of RRD and improvement of TWM with dobutamine (r=0.48, p=0.002). Myocardium exhibiting RRD on 201Tl SPECT in patients with acute myocardial infarction has greater contractile reserve than that exhibiting a fixed defect.
