The Place of Whole-Body PET FDG for the Diagnosis of Distant Recurrence of Breast Cancer. Purpose: To study the role of positron emission tomography 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (PET FDG) imaging in patients with a suspicion of breast cancer recurrence.Procedures: Whole-body PET FDG was performed in 39 women. Thirty-four were included because of asymptomatic tumor marker increase. PET findings were confirmed by oriented imaging or by biopsy. Follow-up data were collected over a period of at least 12 months.Results: PET FDG depicted 37/39 sites in 31/33 patients with recurrence. PET missed one locoregional recurrence and in one patient peritoneal carcinomatosis developed 6 months after a negative PET. False positive PET FDG corresponded to lung infection, degenerative bone disease, and reconstruction artifact. The conventional imaging work-up depicted sites of recurrence in 6/33 patients.Conclusion: Whole-body PET FDG is highly sensitive for the detection of distant breast cancer recurrence. Prospective studies are mandatory to address its potential impact on patient management and survival.
