Myocardial scintigraphy. Myocardial scintigraphy allows the assessment of myocardial perfusion and viability and has been validated in tens of thousands of patients. This article reflects current developments of radiopharmaceuticals as well as of acquisition systems additionally, comparisons are drawn with stress echocardiography and myocardial positron emission tomography. Furthermore, the prognostic value and the cost-efficiency of this technique are demonstrated.
