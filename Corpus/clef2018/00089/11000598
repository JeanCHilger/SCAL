Diagnostic and prognostic value of myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of complications and death in the United States and other Western countries, and stress myocardial perfusion study is an important component of the clinical evaluation, stratification, and management. This imaging technique is a well-established modality and has been widely used for the past three decades. New quantitative techniques for the assessment of ventricular function using quantitative gated single-photon emission computed tomography in addition to myocardial perfusion will potentially enhance the role of nuclear cardiology in the management of these patients. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the diagnostic and prognostic uses of stress myocardial perfusion imaging using exercise and pharmacological stress in patients with stable coronary artery disease.
