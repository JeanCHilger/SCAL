Nuclear cardiology in the evaluation of acute chest pain in the emergency department. Only a minority of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute chest pain will eventually be diagnosed with an acute coronary syndrome. The majority will have an electrocardiogram that is normal or nondiagnostic for acute myocardial ischemia or infarction. Typically, these patients are admitted to exclude myocardial infarction despite a very low incidence of coronary artery disease. However, missed myocardial infarctions in patients who are inadvertently sent home from the ED have significant adverse outcomes and associated legal consequences. This leads to a liberal policy to admit patients with chest pain, presenting a substantial burden in terms of cost and resources. Many centers have developed chest pain centers, using a wide range of diagnostic modalities to deal with this dilemma. We discuss the methods currently available to exclude myocardial ischemia and infarction in the ED, focusing on the use of myocardial perfusion imaging as both an adjunct and an alternative to routine testing. We review the available literature centering on the ED evaluation of acute chest pain and then propose an algorithm for the practical use of nuclear cardiology in this setting.
