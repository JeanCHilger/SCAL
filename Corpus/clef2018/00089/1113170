Application of annihilation coincidence detection to transaxial reconstruction tomography. A study was carried out to investigate the use of annihilation coincidence detection (ACD) in emmision transaxial reconstruction tomography. The ACD was evaluated in terms of spatial resolution and sensitivity with depth, detection efficiency, effect of pulse-height analysis on resolution and efficiency, correction for attenuation, and cold spot contrast. A prototype positron emission transaxial tomograph (PETT) consisting of a hexagonal array of 24 Nal (Tl) detectors employing ACD was constructed. A fast Fourier transform algorithm was employed to generate the reconstructed image. Computer simulations and phantom and animal studies were carried out to demonstrate that this approach yields tomographic radionuclide images that have high resolution and contrast (hot and cold spot) and that are independent of activity above and below the plane examined. The ACD yields a quantitative nuclear medicine imaging device with high detection efficiency. Comparisons are presented between the ACD and the scintillation camera and scanner. Discussion of the possible applications of the PETT in nuclear medicine is included.
