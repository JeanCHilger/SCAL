Degradation of human brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) by contact activation of blood coagulation system. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were added to venous blood samples from healthy volunteers, and incubated in tubes made of various materials. The residual immunoreactivity was measured with radioimmunoassay for BNP and ANP. In blood samples stored in glass tubes, immunoreactivity of ANP was more stable than that of BNP. In siliconized glass or PET tubes, however, BNP immunoreactivity was more stable than ANP. The activation of blood coagulation factors was evaluated from the kallikrein activity in plasma. Kallikrein activity was increased in plasma stored in glass tube while it was negligible in plasma stored in siliconized glass or PET tubes. In kaolin-activated plasma, more rapid BNP degradation and higher kallikrein activity were observed. Our results indicated that the blood coagulation factors, especially kallikrein, played an important role in digestion of BNP.
