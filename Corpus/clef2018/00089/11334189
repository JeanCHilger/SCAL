Poly(ethylene terephthalate) yarn with antibacterial properties. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) yarn with grafted poly(acrylic acid) (poly(AA)) was loaded with [6R-[6alpha,7beta(Z)]]-7-[[2-amino-4-thiazolyl)(methoxy-imino)acetyl]aminol-8-oxo-3-[[(1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-2-methyl-5,6-dioxo-1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)thio]-methyl]-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0] oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid (Lendacin), a cephalosporin-type antibiotic. Immobilization of Lendacin was due to ionic interactions. Drug loading was varied from 0.61 to 5.29% wt/wt. The release of Lendacin from the modified PET fibers to water was monitored for 550 h. Variations of Lendacin concentration in water were approximated with a double exponential equation (CL = Cinfinity[a[1 - exp(-k1tau)] + b[1 - exp(-k2tau)]]) describing fast initial burst followed by slow release of Lendacin. In vitro studies revealed that the drug loaded fibers were bioactive against Staphylococcus auras, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aureginosa.
