Comparison of (18)F-FDG, (131)I-Na, and (201)Tl in diagnosis of recurrent or metastatic thyroid carcinoma. There are several reports about the usefulness of (18)F-FDG PET in thyroid cancer. However, few studies have compared FDG PET with (131)I and (201)Tl scintigraphy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of whole-body FDG PET in differentiated thyroid cancer and to compare the results with those obtained from (131)I and (201)Tl scintigraphy.Whole-body FDG PET was performed on 32 patients (10 men, 22 women age range, 30-77 yThe number of lesions totaled 47. Forty-one (87%) were detected by all scintigraphic methods. FDG uptake was concordant with (131)I uptake in only 18 lesions (38%). FDG uptake was concordant with (201)Tl uptake in 44 lesions (94%). Only one lesion was negative for FDG uptake and positive for (201)Tl uptake, and two lesions were positive for FDG uptake and negative for (201)Tl uptake. A significant correlation was seen between the TBR of (201)Tl and that of FDG (r = 0.69 P<0.05).These data indicate that for detecting metastatic lesions, FDG PET and (131)I scintigraphy may provide complementary information, whereas FDG PET may provide results similar to those of (201)Tl scintigraphy. Thus, the combination of (131)I scintigraphy and FDG PET (or (201)Tl scintigraphy) is the method of choice for detecting metastatic thyroid cancer after total thyroidectomy.
