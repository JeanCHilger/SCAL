Relationship between regional cerebral blood flow and verbal fluency in Alzheimer's disease. Category and letter verbal fluency tests are widely used for dementia detection and severity measure. Performances of these tasks have been regarded to be mainly associated with the left frontal lobe function. However, some recent studies suggest that there are different neuropsychological bases between these two tasks, and the brain region which contributes to these performances still remains unclear in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To clarify the neural basis of verbal fluency in AD, we examined the relationship between performances of these tasks and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Twenty-five AD patients were administered verbal fluency tasks and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans. Thirteen cortical regions of interest were symmetrically defined in each hemisphere. Letter fluency scores were correlated significantly only with the left prefrontal (Brodmann's area (BA) 10-46) regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). In contrast, category fluency scores were correlated most strongly with the left temporal rCBF and also with the left prefrontal (BA 10-46) rCBF. In conclusion, the present study suggests that left prefrontal (BA 10-46) dysfunction contributes to decline in both letter and category fluency scores in AD, while typical posterior dysfunction of AD has a closer relationship with decline in category fluency scores.
