Improved image interpretation with registered thoracic CT and positron emission tomography data sets. The purpose of this study was to determine if nonlinear registration of clinically acquired thoracic CT and FDG positron emission tomography (PET) data sets supports more detailed interpretation of metastatic thoracic disease when compared with interpretations from nonregistered PET studies.In 11 of 16 data sets of patients imaged for detection of metastatic disease, interpretations from PET studies were correctly altered with registration information. All changes were either improvements in tumor localization or correct interpretation of less metastatic involvement.
