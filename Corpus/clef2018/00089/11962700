Polyethylene terephthalate recycling for food-contact applications: testing, safety and technologies: a global perspective. Studies were undertaken to determine the composition of five different types of post-consumer polyethylene terephthalate (PET) feedstreams to ascertain the relative amounts of food containers and non-food containers. Deposit post-consumer PET feedstreams contained approximately 100% food containers, whereas curbside feedstreams contained from 0.04 to 6% non-food containers. Analysis of the PET containers from the different type feedstreams after the containers were subjected to a commercial PET wash system and after processing with a proprietary decontamination technology was accomplished to determine the levels of compounds in the post-consumer PET after the various stages of processing. Comprehensive thermal desorption/GC/MS, purge and trap GC/MS purge and trap GC quantitation, PET dissolution and extraction GC analysis and PET dissolution HPLC analysis established the types and concentrations of compounds that absorb in the PET from the various types of postconsumer feedstreams. A total of 121 compounds were identified in the five different feedstreams. The concentration of absorbed compounds remaining in the deposit material and the non-food applications material after the commercial wash was 28 and 39mgkg(-1) respectively. Analysis of the feedstreams after subjecting the material to a proprietary decontamination process demonstrated the ability of removing all the absorbed compounds to a level below the level of the threshold of regulation. The safety of sourcing of post-consumer PET from food use applications verses non-food use applications of PET has been established.
