Usefulness of a three-dimensional stereotaxic ROI template on anatomically standardised 99mTc-ECD SPET. We have constructed a three-dimensional stereotaxic ROI template (3DSRT) on anatomically standardised cerebral blood flow (CBF) single-photon emission tomography (SPET) images to objectively estimate regional CBF (rCBF). The 3DSRT is composed of 259 regions of interest (ROIs) in 11 segments (1, superior frontal 2, middle and inferior frontal
