Preparative separation of thiamine di- and triphosphates by ion-exchange chromatography. The conditions were developed for preparative isolation of thiamine triphosphate (TTP) from a mixture of phosphoric acid esters of thiamine (PET) (40-80 mg thiamine). The Dowex 1 x 4 resin (acetate form) and triethylammonium acetate (TEAA), pH 4.5 as an eluent were used. The employment of volatile TEAA instead of acetate buffer facilitates the obtaining of concentrated TTP preparations and their subsequent identification. This method is successfully used for purification of commercial cocarboxylase preparations (TDP) (80 mg by PET). In comparison with electrophoresis and paper chromatography, the preparative isolation of TTP and TDP by the ion-exchange chromagraphic method is less laborious and permits larger amounts of PET to be separated for a single run.
