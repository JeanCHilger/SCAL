Noninvasive evaluation of women with coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in women. More women than men die of CAD each year, and unlike men, the death rate has not declined for women but has remained stable over the last 20 years. Despite these statistics, much less is known about the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of CAD in women. The noninvasive diagnosis of CAD in women is difficult secondary to differences in physiology, etiology, presenting symptoms, risk factor prevalence, comorbid conditions, hormonal status, and body habitus between women and men. Echocardiography and Tc-99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography imaging are two noninvasive imaging techniques commonly combined with exercise or pharmacologic agents (dobutamine, adenosine, dipyridamole) that have recently evolved to address these differences. These evolutions and the role of both techniques in the diagnosis and prognosis of women with CAD will be reviewed in this article.
