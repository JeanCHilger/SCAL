Early impairment of coronary flow reserve is not associated with Chlamydia pneumoniae antibodies. Chlamydia pneumoniae infection has been associated with atherosclerosis by sero-epidemiological, histopathological and interventional studies, and animal experiments. We hypothesized that if chlamydial infection is causative of atherosclerosis, the occurrence of antibodies against C. pneumoniae should be associated with coronary vasomotor dysfunction - an early sign of atherosclerosis.To study the association between C. pneumoniae infection and coronary vasomotor function in young men without signs of ischemic heart disease.Serum IgG and IgA antibody concentrations against C. pneumoniae were determined in 125 clinically healthy subjects undergoing positron emission tomography (PET) studies. Myocardial blood flow was measured at rest and during pharmacologically induced hyperemia using [15O]H2O Coronary flow reserve was calculated as the ratio of hyperemic blood flow to resting blood flow.No association was found between serum C. pneumoniae antibody concentrations and myocardial blood flow parameters. In contrast, more conventional risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, were inversely associated with hyperemic flow and flow reserve.We found no association between C. pneumoniae antibodies and coronary vasomotor function in subjects without ischemic heart disease. Thus, these results do not support the role of C. pneumoniae infection as an early phase risk factor for coronary artery disease.
