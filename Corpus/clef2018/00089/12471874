Imaging of intrathoracic metastases of nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. Radiologic imaging is crucial in the evaluation of intrathoracic metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. Helical CT is the workhorse of radiologic staging and is sensitive in the detection of parenchymal nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. CT may also demonstrate other less common sites of metastatic disease. Although, currently, no radiologic procedure is effective in distinguishing viable tumor or teratoma from residual fibrosis and necrosis, cross-sectional imaging remains essential in the presurgical evaluation of potential metastatic disease. FDG PET and CT-guided needle biopsy may be useful in select, high-risk patients.
