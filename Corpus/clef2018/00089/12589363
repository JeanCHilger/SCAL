Current mite, cat, and dog allergen exposure, pet ownership, and sensitization to inhalant allergens in adults. Simultaneous exposure to more than one allergen might modify the effect of individual allergens.The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of current exposures to mite, cat, and dog allergen and pet ownership on sensitization in adults.Questionnaires, skin tests, and home visits (Der p 1, Fel d 1, and Can f 1, ELISA mattresses, living room floors) were performed in 2502 adults. Allergen exposure was treated as a continuous variable and divided into quartiles. To investigate the interaction between allergens, quartiles for 3 allergens were added, creating arbitrary combined exposure categories.In the univariate analysis, mite sensitization was associated with Der p 1 in mattresses (odds ratio [OR], 1.10 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.19Sensitization to dust mites increased with the increasing combined exposure. Cat ownership was associated with a lower prevalence of sensitization to cat and dog but not to mite and grass pollen.
