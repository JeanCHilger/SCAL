Design and performance characteristics of a whole-body positron transaxial tomograph. A whole-body positron-emission transaxial tomograph (PETT III) is described in detail and evaluated in terms of resolution, accuracy, and efficiency. The PETT III utilizes annihilation coincidence detection to provide spatial resolution high sensitivity is achieved by using 48 Nal(tl) detectors set in a hexagonal array with a multiple-coincidence logic. The assumptions and approximations made in the reconstruction and their effect on image quality are discussed. Phantom studies shows the depth-independent resolution and response of PETT III, as well as its ability to recover activity distribution quantitatively in the cross section measured. Images obtained with patients and normal volunteers show the potential clinical utility of PETT III.
