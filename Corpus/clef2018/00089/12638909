Seroepidemiological survey of Bordetella bronchiseptica and canine parainfluenza-2 virus in dogs in Sweden. The prevalence of antibodies against Bordetella bronchiseptica and canine parainfluenza-2 virus (CPiV-2) was investigated in a population of 302 pet dogs in Sweden. Sera were analysed for B bronchiseptica-specific immunoglobulin G by means of an ELISA, and for CPiV-2 specific neutralising antibody by means of a haemagglutination inhibition test. B bronchiseptica had a seroprevalence of 22 per cent and CPiV-2 had a seroprevalence of 28 per cent. The two pathogens did not appear to circulate together. The crowding of dogs together was significantly associated with the seroprevalence of CPiV-2, but not with the seroprevalence of B bronchiseptica. The dogs' ages, gender or their Fédération Cynologique Internationale breed group affiliation was not correlated with the seroprevalence of either pathogen.
