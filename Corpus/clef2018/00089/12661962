Photocyclization of N,N-phthaloylanthranilic amides coupled to omega-amino acids with increasing chain lengths. Medium-sized heterocyclic ring systems are available via a photo-electron transfer (PET)-induced decarboxylation-cyclization sequence using a triad composed of electronically excited acceptor, linker and electrondonor A*-L-D with target ring sizes varying from 8-16.
