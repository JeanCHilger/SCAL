From normal morphology and function to the breast pathophysiology. At present mammography is the only method validated by trials performed over several decades however it is burdened by some limitations which at times make its integration with other diagnostic imaging procedures necessary. These procedures are able to enhance the organ morphology (digital galactography) or the organ function (US, color-Doppler US, MRI, PET, scintigraphy). Among the methods of "functional" support, an emerging role is played by nuclear medicine with the use of specific radiopharmaceuticals for breast scintigraphy, PET and-lymphoscintigraphy of sentinel lymph node.
