New design concept to improve medical application software. Up to now, there has been no software model available that adequately addresses the growing importance of flexibility in using different information tools. Based on Java, Jini technology provides distributed and therefore robust software architecture. In case of an application crash, Jini is able to minimize the damage by adding functions that reverse the effects of the crash. Owing to increasing user mobility, it is necessary to be able to receive location-independent information. The growing use of powerful telecommunications suggests the application of 'wireless application protocol' (WAP) mobile telephones also for medical purposes. This paper presents the application of these new software trends (Jini and wireless application protocol).
