The capacities of autoleukocyte-labelled scintigraphy in the detection of foci of inflammation and suppuration. The diagnostics of occult inflammation foci up to day remains the major and complicated problem in almost each clinical discipline. Whole-body scintigraphy and SPECT studies with 99mTc-autoleucocytes show silent foci of inflammation and infection. 68 patients (24 females and 44 males) aged 14-59 years with non-localized inflammatory diseases were evaluated. Each patient underwent routine clinical and laboratory investigation. But because of the inadequacy of other diagnostic procedures, the Tc-99m-WBC scans may be of great clinical importance. For the determining of the SPECT of thorax were performed using Tc-99m-HMPAO (hexametylpropilenaminoxime) labeled autoleucocytes. In 1, 3 and 24 hours post injection inflammatory foci were seen as the areas of pathogenic activity. In 24 patients the circumscribed activity seen in relation to heart convincingly demonstrated endo- and/or myocarditis. 16 patients showed acute inflammation in postoperative wound, empyema of pleura and mediastinitis as the consequences of cardiosurgery. In 16 patients whole-body scanning and SPECT of the head revealed chronic infection in nasopharynx and accessory nasal sinuses dental infection and the rest 7 patients had abdominal and pelvic inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, intraabdominal and retroperitoneal septic foci, tubo-ovarial inflammatory disease. The data demonstrated that Tc-99m-leucocytes imaging is a highly sensitive and specific for the detection of inflammatory diseases of different localization.
