The value of 99mTc-MIBI myocardial perfusion spect imaging in detecting coronary artery disease in patients with valvular disease before operation. The aim of this study was to detect coronary artery disease using 99mTc-MIBI myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with valvular disease.Thirty patients with valvular disease confirmed by echocardiography underwent 99mTc-MIBI myocardial perfusion imaging using multiSPECT 1h after stress test (exercise, dipyridamole or dobutamine test) and were performed coronary angiography within 1 month before valvular operation.For 29 out of the 30 patients, the results of 99mTc-MIBI myocardial perfusion imaging were similar with those of coronary angiography, the concordance rate was 96.7% and the negative predictability was 100%.99Tc-MIBI myocardial perfusion imaging is a reliable non-invasive method for detecting coronary artery disease in patients with valvular disease and so as to draw up suitable operation programs for them.
