Viability of neocortical function shown in behavioral activation state PET studies in Alzheimer disease. Twenty subjects with mildly to moderately severe Alzheimer disease (AD) and 14 normal elderly control subjects were studied using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate regional cerebral glucose metabolism during both a resting state and a behavioral activation state, utilizing a reading memory task (RMT). The RMT produced significant global metabolic activation of 15 +/- 15% in normal subjects and 11 +/- 13% in AD subjects. The occipital regions were preferentially activated, but all regions in both groups were also significantly activated. The RMT did not allow a better discrimination of AD patients from normal controls on the basis of regional metabolic deficits. Regions in the AD group that were individually classified as hypometabolic during rest also exhibited metabolic activation. The apparent viability of hypometabolic regions in AD patients challenges current hypotheses regarding the cause of abnormal metabolism in AD.
