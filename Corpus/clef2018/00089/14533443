Detection of recurrent or residual nasopharyngeal carcinomas after radiotherapy with technetium-99m tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography and comparison with computed tomography--a preliminary study. The effectiveness of technetium-99m tetrofosmin (Tc-TF) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the head and neck for detecting recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) was evaluated and compared with computed tomography (CT). Both Tc-TF SPECT and CT of the head and neck were performed in 36 NPC patients 4 months after radiotherapy. All 36 then underwent histopathological examinations of nasopharyngeal biopsies. Based on the histopathological results, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of visually interpreted Tc-TF SPECT images, to differentiation of recurrent NPC from benign lesions, were 64%, 96%, and 86%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT for detecting recurrent NPC were 73%, 88%, and 83%, respectively. The Tc-TF SPECT has a better specificity but a lower sensitivity to differentiate benign lesions and recurrent/residual NPC when compared with CT. Combined Tc-TF SPECT and CT sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 88%, respectively. There are much better either test alone. However, further studies, including a larger NPC patient population, are warranted to determine the exact role and clinical usefulness of Tc-TF SPECT to differentiate benign lesions and recurrent/residual NPC.
