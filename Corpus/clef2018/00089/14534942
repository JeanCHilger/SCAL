Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. The aim of this review was to recall the relevance of the myocardial perfusion scintigraphy procedure in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy is undergone after treadmill exercise or pharmacological stress by infusion of Dipyridamole. Thallium-201, sestamibi-Tc99m and tetrofosmine-Tc99m are the most frequently used tracers. Gated single photon emission computed tomography provides a combined evaluation of both myocardial perfusion and function. Myocardial perfusion imaging is an accurate tool for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease with a high sensitivity 93% and good specificity 80%. Its prognostic value is now well established among patients with known coronary artery disease. In particular for risk stratification and patient management decisions. Thallium-201 SPECT is clinically accurate in assessing myocardial viability. As it is for assessment after myocardial revascularisation. Thus myocardial perfusion scintigraphy is a reliable and a cost-effective investigation for coronary artery disease.
