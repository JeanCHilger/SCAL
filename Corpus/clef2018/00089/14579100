From PET detectors to PET scanners. This review describes the properties of available and emerging radiation detector and read-out technologies and discusses how they may affect PET scanner performance. After a general introduction, there is a section in which the physical properties of several different detector scintillators are compared. This is followed by a discussion of recent advances in read-out electronics. Finally, the physical performance of the several commercial PET scanners is summarized.
