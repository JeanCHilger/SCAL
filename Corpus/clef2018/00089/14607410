A new filter-eluting solution that facilitates improved recovery of Cryptosporidium oocysts from water. Cryptosporidium is a zoonotic coccidian parasite associated with diarrhea, and the disinfectant-resistant oocysts are threats to public health even in industrialized countries. In order to make an accurate assessment of the risk to public health, a detection method that has a high recovery rate of oocysts in water is required. In this study, we developed a new filter-eluting solution that facilitates more efficient recovery of Cryptosporidium oocysts from different kinds of water samples. The filter-eluting solution, referred to as PET, consists of sodium pyrophosphate (0.02%), Tween 80 (0.01%) and trisodium EDTA (0.03%). By using PET instead of conventional filter-eluting solutions, the average recovery rate significantly increased from 25.5+/-15.1% to 43.1+/-13.9% (p<0.05). The improved oocyst recovery was likely due to the increased separation of the oocysts from debris trapped on the filter membrane as well as increased capture of the oocysts by immunomagnetic beads. We recommend that PET be used as the filter-eluting solution for detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts in environmental water.
