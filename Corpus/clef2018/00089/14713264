Targeted radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours. Evidence supporting the potential contribution of targeted radiotherapy to the management of neuroendocrine tumours is now strong. Acting systemically, this is an effective option for patients with inoperable or multi-site disease. Toxicity is generally low, being limited to reversible myelosuppression and theoretical nephrotoxicity. Prerequisites for treatment success include demonstration of high tumour uptake relative to non-target tissues on quantitative diagnostic radionuclide imaging and stable haematological and biochemical function. In addition to (131)I metaiodobenzylguanidine therapy, which is now well established, there is growing interest in radiolabelled peptide therapy using a range of somatostatin receptor analogues such as (90)Y DOTATOC and (90)Y lanreotide. The results of clinical experience are summarised and the direction for future research is discussed.
