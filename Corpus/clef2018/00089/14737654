Rapid methylation of terminal acetylenes by the Stille coupling of methyl iodide with alkynyltributylstannanes: a general protocol potentially useful for the synthesis of short-lived 11CH3-labeled PET tracers with a 1-propynyl group. The Pd(0)-mediated rapid coupling (trapping) reaction of methyl iodide with an excess amount of alkynyltributylstannane has been developed with the aim to incorporate a short-lived (11)C-labeled methyl group into biologically active organic compounds with a 1-propynyl structural unit.
