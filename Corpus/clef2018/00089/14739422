Crossed cerebellar diaschisis in patients with cortical infarction: logistic regression analysis to control for confounding effects. Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) refers to reduced metabolism and blood flow in the cerebellar hemisphere contralateral to a cerebral lesion. Many cortical areas have been reported to cause CCD without consideration of confounding factors. We performed single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with cortical infarction to identify regions independently related to CCD, controlling for possible confounding effects.Patients with unilateral cortical infarction (n=113 75 male, 38 femaleFor dichotomized variables, hypoperfusion of postcentral (odds ratio [OR]=7.607 95% CI, 2.299 to 25.174) and supramarginal (OR=3.916Many cortical areas apparently do not contribute to CCD. Correspondence of CCD between dichotomized and continuous analyses suggests that location of a lesion, not severity, is the main determinant of CCD.
