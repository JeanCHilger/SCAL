Metal uptake in neurone cultures: a systematic study. We present the first comparative study of the uptake of metal ions by neurons, performed for Zn, Cr, Co, Mo, Al, Ni, Mn and Cd. The study reveals substantial differences in the uptake of different metals, under similar exposure procedures. In particular, we found very large uptakes for aluminium and molybdenum. We also found significant effects of excitatory substances, in particular kainate, as stimulants of uptake of some of the metals.
