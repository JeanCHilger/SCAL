Synthesis, biodistribution and micro-PET imaging of radiolabeled antimitotic agent T138067 analogues. Radiolabeled antimitotic agents [11C]T138067 and [18F]T138067 have been synthesized for evaluation as new potential positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers for cancer imaging. In vivo biodistribution and micro-PET imaging of [11C]T138067 were performed in breast cancer animal models MCF-7 transfected with IL-1alpha implanted athymic mice and MDA-MB-435 implanted athymic mice. The results suggest that the uptakes of [11C]T138067 in both MCF-7 transfected with IL-1alpha tumor and MDA-MB-435 tumor are non-specific binding.
