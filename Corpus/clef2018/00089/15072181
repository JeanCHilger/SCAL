Diagnosis of tumor in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses with [11C]choline PET: comparative study with 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET. [11C]choline (11C-choline) positron emission tomography (PET) was performed to evaluate its clinical utility in the diagnosis of tumors in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. We studied 22 patients with suspicion of malignant tumors in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Tumor uptake of 11C-choline was measured with standardized uptake value (SUV) and correlated with the pathological diagnosis. 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET was performed in all patients for comparison. Both 11C-choline and FDG PET depicted squamous cell carcinoma showing an increased activity significantly higher than that of normal tissue, and these SUVs were significantly higher than those of benign lesions. FDG uptake in malignant tumors as a whole was variable. Although 11C-choline uptake in squamous cell carcinoma was lower than FDG uptake, 11C-choline uptake in malignant tumors was relatively uniform and statistical significance was found. PET with 11C-choline may be useful to diagnosis tumors in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.
