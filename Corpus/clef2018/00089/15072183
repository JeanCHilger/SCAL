Accurate scatter correction for transmission computed tomography using an uncollimated line array source. We investigated scatter correction in transmission computed tomography (TCT) imaging by the combination of an uncollimated transmission source and a parallel-hole collimator. We employed the triple energy window (TEW) as the scatter correction and found that the conventional TEW method, which is accurate in emission computed tomography (ECT) imaging, needs some modification in TCT imaging based on our phantom studies. In this study a Tc-99m uncollimated line array source (area: 55 cm x 40 cm) was attached to one camera head of a dual-head gamma camera as a transmission source, and TCT data were acquired with a low-energy, general purpose (LEGP), parallel-hole collimator equipped on the other camera head. The energy spectra for 140 keV-photons transmitted through various attenuating material thicknesses were measured and analyzed for scatter fraction. The results of the energy spectra showed that the photons transmitted had an energy distribution that constructs a scatter peak within the 140 keV-photopeak energy window. In TCT imaging with a cylindrical water phantom, the conventional TEW method with triangle estimates (subtraction factor, K = 0.5) was not sufficient for accurate scatter correction (micro = 0.131 cm(-1) for water), whereas the modified TEW method with K = 1.0 gave the accurate attenuation coefficient of 0.153 cm(-1) for water. For the TCT imaging with the combination of the uncollimated Tc-99m line array source and parallel hole collimator, the modified TEW method with K = 1.0 gives the accurate TCT data for quantitative SPECT imaging in comparison with the conventional TEW method with K = 0.5.
