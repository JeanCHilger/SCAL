Diagnostic imaging in pleural diseases. Imaging plays a major role in the diagnosis and management of pleural diseases. Generally chest radiography remains the initial examination, however, today with digital technique. Depending on first imaging findings and the clinical aspect the diagnostic course may be followed by ultrasound, computed tomography examinations, or magnetic resonance imaging. Radionuclide imaging has not been played a significant role up to now, until positron emission tomography (PET) has gained clinical relevance. However, the role of PET in pleural diseases is not yet defined and scientific works are still in progress.
