MRI of the breast. Techniques and current values. Breast MR imaging and PET allow physiopathological tissular approach of breast tumors through tumoral angiogenesis. All these series published agreed in the high sensitivity of breast MRI for detecting invasive breast cancers whereas the sensitivity varies from 60 to 85% in detecting ductal carcinoma in situ. However, its specificity reported varies between 60 and 97%, mainly due to some entities such as fibroadenomas and fibrocystic disease. Clinical indication are the diagnosis of local relapses, the evaluation of pre-operative chemotherapy, the diagnosis of an isolated axillary lymphadenopathy, pre-operative evaluation of breast cancer and follow up of breast prothesis.
