The evaluation of underlying cardiovascular disease among patients with end-stage renal disease. Although coronary artery disease (CAD) is highly prevalent among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), interventions proven to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality are underutilized in this population of patients. Given the burden of CVD in this population, knowledge of specific diagnostic tests for detection and evaluation of CAD in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and their correlation with outcomes is imperative for the practicing nephrologist. Studies that examine the use of exercise electrocardiography testing, pharmacologic stress imaging, single-photon emission computed tomographic myocardial perfusion imaging, electron beam computed tomography, and dobutamine stress echocardiography among patients with ESRD are detailed with recommendations for the noninvasive evaluation of CAD in this population.
