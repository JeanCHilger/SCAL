Contribution of (18)fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography to the work-up of patients with fever of unknown origin. Background: Recent studies have suggested that (18)fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) may be useful in the work-up of patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO), but its exact diagnostic yield has not been established. Methods: From January 1999 through December 2001, 74 (67%) of 110 prospectively collected patients who fulfilled the revised criteria of classic FUO underwent a FDG-PET scan. The diagnostic yield of this technique was assessed after diagnostic work-up and follow-up. Abnormal FDG-PET scans that pointed to the final diagnosis were categorized as helpful all other scans were considered noncontributory. Results: A final diagnosis was established in 39 (53%) of the 74 patients who underwent FDG-PET. Fifty-three (72%) of the 74 FDG-PET scans were abnormal
