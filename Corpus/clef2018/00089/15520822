Evaluation of hypoxia in an experimental rat tumour model by [(18)F]fluoromisonidazole PET and immunohistochemistry. This study aimed to evaluate tumour hypoxia by comparing [(18)F]Fluoromisonidazole uptake measured using positron emission tomography ([(18)F]FMISO-PET) with immunohistochemical (IHC) staining techniques. Syngeneic rhabdomyosarcoma (R1) tumour pieces were transplanted subcutaneously in the flanks of WAG/Rij rats. Tumours were analysed at volumes between 0.9 and 7.3 cm(3). Hypoxic volumes were defined using a 3D region of interest on 2 h postinjection [(18)F]FMISO-PET images, applying different thresholds (1.2-3.0). Monoclonal antibodies to pimonidazole (PIMO) and carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), exogenous and endogenous markers of hypoxia, respectively, were used for IHC staining. Marker-positive fractions were microscopically measured for each tumour, and hypoxic volumes were calculated. A heterogeneous distribution of hypoxia was observed both with histology and [(18)F]FMISO autoradiography. A statistically significant correlation (P<0.05) was obtained between the hypoxic volumes defined with [(18)F]FMISO-PET and the volumes derived from the PIMO-stained tumour sections (r=0.9066 P=0.0001), regardless of the selected threshold between 1.4 and 2.2. A similar observation was made with the CA IX staining (r=0.8636
