Hemorrhagic myocardial infarction after reperfusion detected by X-ray CT--experimental and clinical study. The purpose of this study was to determine whether computed tomography (CT) can detect hemorrhagic infarction occurring after intracoronary thrombolytic therapy (ICT) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In an experimental study, 12 dogs underwent 2-4 h of left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion, followed by reperfusion, and infusion of contrast material into the LAD. After CT examination, the heart was cut into transverse sections. A good correlation was obtained between the CT-enhanced area and the hemorrhagic area in the sliced heart section (r = 0.895, p less than 0.001). In a clinical study, we applied CT immediately after ICT in 25 patients with AMI. In 13 of 25 patients, the CT showed post-ICT myocardial enhancement areas. To evaluate the relationship of the enhancement areas shown by CT to the viability of the myocardium, we compared enhancement areas by CT with the corresponding perfusion defect areas of Thallium-201 imaging (SPECT) one month later. There was no significant correlation between the enhancement areas and perfusion defect areas (r = 0.38, p greater than 0.1). The SPECT defect areas were consistently smaller than the CT enhancement areas. These results indicate that CT can detect hemorrhage into the myocardium after ICT, and that after ICT half the AMI patients showed hemorrhagic infarction. However, hemorrhage did not cause complete deterioration of the myocardium.
