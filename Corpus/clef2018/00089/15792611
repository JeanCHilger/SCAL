Early evaluation of the response to radiotherapy of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck using 18FDG-PET. The aim was to evaluate the efficacy of positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-[F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) in early discrimination of response to definitive radiotherapy (RT) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Twenty-four patients who underwent FDG-PET scans before and after radiotherapy for nondisseminated SCCHN at the Asan Medical Center between August 2001 and September 2002 were prospectively evaluated. Initial FDG-PET scans were performed within 1 month before RT, and follow-up FDG-PET scans were performed 1 month after completion of RT. FDG-PET images were analyzed by standard uptake value (SUV). All patients were followed for more than 6 months. Pretreatment SUV ranged from 3.4 to 14.0 (median, 6.0), while posttreatment SUV ranged from ground level to 7.7 (median, 2.0). In evaluating residual tumors in these SCCHN patients, the overall sensitivity of FDG-PET was 100%, while its overall specificity was 87%. FDG-PET is effective in evaluating the response to radiation in patients with SCCHN. Timing the follow-up FDG-PET scan 1 month after completion of RT was not too rapid for evaluating the response to radiation.
