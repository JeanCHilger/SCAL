Cerebral PET imaging and histological evidence of transglutaminase inhibitor cystamine induced neuroprotection in transgenic R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease. To investigate efficacy of cystamine induced neuroprotection, we conducted PET imaging studies of cerebral glucose metabolism with [(18)F]FDG (2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose) and striatal dopamine D2 receptor function with [(11)C]raclopride in R6/2 transgenic Huntington mice. In the control mice, exponentially decreasing glucose utilization was observed in the striatum N(str) [SUV]=(41.75+/-11.80)(58,str)*exp(-(0.041+/-0.007)*t [days]) cortex N(cort) [SUV]=24.14+/-3.66)(58,cort)*exp(-(0.043+/-0.007)*t [days])
