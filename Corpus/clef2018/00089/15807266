Cloning and expression of superoxide dismutase gene from Deinococcus radiodurans in E. coli. To construct expressing recombinant of Mn-SOD of Deinococcus radiodurans and express the target protein in E. coli BL21(DE3).SOD gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of Deinococcus radiodurans and inserted into expression plasmid pET-30a(+) to create the recombinant pET-SOD. After being analyzed by the restriction endonuclease, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and the recombinant protein was expressed after induction by the isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and was analyzed with SDS-PAGE.The recombinant plasmid pET-SOD was obtained, and the recombinant protein was highly expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). The activity of recombinant superoxide dismutase was 51,800 U per gram of wet bacteria.This study has provided a foundation for further studies and applications of the recombinant Mn-SOD.
