Association of small fiber neuropathy with cardiac sympathetic dysfunction in sarcoidosis. Recently we found that small fiber neuropathy (SFN) occurs frequently in sarcoidosis. Autonomic dysfunction may be a feature of SFN. Since cardiac autonomic dysfunction has been identified as a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality, recognition of cardiac autonomic involvement is of clinical relevance. It was hypothesised that SFN might be related to cardiac sympathetic denervation in sarcoidosis.In the present study 45 consecutive sarcoidosis patients (13 without SFN assessed by thermal threshold testing (TTT), 32 with SFN (abnormal TTT) were enrolled. To rule out bias due to myocardial ischemia, cases with abnormal Thallium (201Tl) perfusion scintigraphy were excluded (n = 2). Cardiovascular autonomic function testing (Ewing tests) and 123I-MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) scintigraphy were used to assess cardiac autonomic function. Further cardiac diagnostic work-up included ECG, Holter recording and echo Doppler cardiography.Mild to moderate heterogeneity of 123I-MIBG uptake regional in the myocardium was demonstrated in a substantial number of the studied sarcoidosis population, especially in those with SFN (abnormal TTT). Mean inferior-anterior ratios were 0.85+/-0.17 (SFN) and 1.0+/-0.17 (no SFN p = 0.003), respectively. Four out of the 14 cases with abnormal MIBG scintigraphy and SFN showed an abnormal Ewing test.Cardiac sympathetic dysfunction assessed by use of 123I-MIBG myocardial scanning appeared to be heterogeneous in sarcoidosis patients and dependent on the presence or absence of SFN. MIBG scintigraphy may be of additional value in the management and follow-up of sarcoidosis patients. Future study is warranted to explore possible prognostic and therapeutic implications of these findings in sarcoidosis.
