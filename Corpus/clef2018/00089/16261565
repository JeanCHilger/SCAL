Preclinical Huntington's disease: compensatory brain responses during learning. Motor sequence learning is abnormal in presymptomatic Huntington's disease (p-HD). The neural substrates underlying this early manifestation of HD are poorly understood. To study the mechanism of this cognitive abnormality in p-HD, we used positron emission tomography to record brain activity during motor sequence learning in these subjects. Eleven p-HD subjects (age, 45.8 +/- 11.0 years CAG repeat length, 41.6 +/- 1.8) and 11 age-matched control subjects (age, 45.3 +/- 13.4 years) underwent H(2) (15)O positron emission tomography while performing a set of kinematically controlled motor sequence learning and execution tasks. Differences in regional brain activation responses between groups and conditions were assessed. In addition, we identified discrete regions in which learning-related activity correlated with performance. We found that sequence learning was impaired in p-HD subjects despite normal motor performance. In p-HD, activation responses during learning were abnormally increased in the left mediodorsal thalamus and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC
