Diagnosis of right ventricular acute myocardial infarction by dual isotope thallium-201 and indium-111 antimyosin SPECT imaging. To assess the diagnostic value of indium-111 antimyosin for detecting right ventricular (RV) wall acute infarction, 30 patients with electrocardiographic-documented left ventricular inferior (posterior) wall acute myocardial infarction underwent simultaneous dual isotope indium-111 antimyosin and thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) within 2 days of admission. RV necrosis was defined as uptake of indium-111 antimyosin anterior and to the right of septal thallium uptake. Twenty-nine of the 30 patients (97%) had indium-111 antimyosin uptake in the inferior, posterior or lateral walls of the left ventricle and 14 of 30 (47%) had additional RV antimyosin uptake. Three different patterns of RV uptake of indium-111 antimyosin were observed: crescent-shaped, focal and apical. Twenty-seven patients underwent gated blood pool scanning before hospital discharge. Twelve of the 14 patients with RV antimyosin uptake had gated blood pool scintigraphy and 7 of 12 had RV dysfunction 5 had normal RV function. Except for 1 patient who had questionable RV antimyosin uptake and had RV dysfunction, no patient without RV antimyosin uptake had RV dysfunction. In summary, right and left ventricular necrosis can be detected on tomographic images of indium-111 antimyosin uptake in patients with inferior infarctions when simultaneous uptake of a perfusion tracer, thallium-201, is imaged and used as an aid to reconstruction and anatomic localization.
