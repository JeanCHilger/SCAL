Synthesis of [18F]fluoro-labeled progestins for PET. The synthesis of 21-[18F]fluoro-16 alpha-methyl-19-norprogesterone, 21-[18F]fluoro-16 alpha-ethyl-19-norprogesterone, 21-[18F]fluoro-16 alpha-methylprogesterone and 21-[18F]fluoro-16 alpha-ethylprogesterone is described. These compounds are prepared with a specific activity greater than 200 TBq/mmol (5000 Ci/mmol) from the corresponding tosylates in 10% radiochemical yield (EOB). A remote controlled system has been developed for this synthesis.
