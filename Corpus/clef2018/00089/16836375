A simple and general strategy for the design of fluorescent cation sensor beads. [Structure: see text] Chenodeoxycholic acid based PET sensors for alkali metal ions have been immobilized on Merrifield resin and on Tentagel. The fluorescence of the sensor beads is enhanced upon binding the cations. The modular nature of the sensor allows designing different sensors based on this concept.
