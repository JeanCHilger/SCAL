A GABAA receptor mutation causing generalized epilepsy reduces benzodiazepine receptor binding. Understanding the consequences of newly discovered single gene mutations causing human epilepsy has the potential to yield new insights into the underlying mechanisms of this disorder. A mutation of the gamma2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor, which substitutes glutamine for arginine at position 43 (R43Q) has been found in a familial generalized epilepsy. We tested the hypothesis that individuals affected by the GABRG2(R43Q) mutation have reduced binding to the GABA(A) receptor complex using positron emission tomography (PET) and the benzodiazepine receptor ligand [(11)C]-flumazenil. Fourteen subjects with the GABRG2(R43Q) mutation and 20 controls were studied. Benzodiazepine receptor binding was reduced in subjects with the mutation (mean whole brain binding potential for [(11)C]-flumazenil: GABA(A) mutation 0.66+/-0.1 controls 0.89+/-0.1
