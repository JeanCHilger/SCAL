Correlation of thalamic aphasia and cerebral blood flow. Relations between linguistic deficits and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were studied in 20 cases of thalamic aphasia due to hemorrhage. Language analysis was based on BDAE, verbal intelligence quotient and verbal subtest of the memory quotient (Wechsler). CBF analysis (and of asymmetry index: AI) was done with 133 Xenon by SPECT technique in tomographic slices and in 15 areas of interest, i.e. cortical and deep areas. Relationships were analyzed by multiple correlations procedure and stepwise regression. Significant correlations were observed between linguistic results and AI of cortical but also deep areas (lenticular). Dynamic anomalies (fluency) were correlated with the IA and/or CBF of the frontal cortex. Verbal comprehension, naming and paraphasia were related to the AI of deep structures (insula and lenticular nucleus) and the AI of posterior cortex (temporo-occipital). Several correlations were found significant between results on verbal IQ of the WAIS and IA of the insula and lenticular nucleus.
