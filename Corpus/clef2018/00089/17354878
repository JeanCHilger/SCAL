4D shape priors for a level set segmentation of the left myocardium in SPECT sequences. We develop a 4D (3D plus time) statistical shape model for implicit level set based shape representations. To this end, we represent hand segmented training sequences of the left ventricle by respective 4-dimensional embedding functions and approximate these by a principal component analysis. In contrast to recent 4D models on explicit shape representations, the implicit shape model developed in this work does not require the computation of point correspondences which is known to be quite challenging, especially in higher dimensions. Experimental results on the segmentation of SPECT sequences of the left myocardium confirm that the 4D shape model outperforms respective 3D models, because it takes into account a statistical model of the temporal shape evolution.
