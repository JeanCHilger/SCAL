Recent advances in SPECT imaging. SPECT is a rapidly changing field, and the past several years have produced new developments in both hardware technology and image-processing algorithms. At the component level there have been improvements in scintillators and photon transducers as well as a greater availability of semiconductor technology. These devices permit the fabrication of smaller and more compact systems that can be customized for particular applications. New clinical devices include high-count sensitivity cardiac SPECT systems that do not use conventional collimation and the introduction of diagnostic-quality hybrid SPECT/CT systems. While there has been steady progress with reconstruction algorithms, exciting new processing algorithms have become commercially available that promise to provide substantial reductions in SPECT acquisition time without sacrificing diagnostic quality. Preclinical small-animal SPECT systems have become a major focus in nuclear medicine. These systems have pushed the limits of SPECT into the submillimeter range, making them valuable molecular imaging tools capable of providing information unavailable from other modalities.
