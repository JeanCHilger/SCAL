Whole body positron emission tomography in follow-up of high risk melanoma. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical impact of whole body positron emission tomography (FDG PET) to detect clinically silent metastases in the follow-up of patients with high risk melanoma. FDG PET was performed to 30 asymptomatic melanoma patients (AJCC stage IIB-IIIC) 7-24 months after the primary surgery and sentinel node biopsy. FDG PET was able to detect six of seven recurrences, constituting 20% of all study patients. One patient presented with a negative FDG PET finding at the very first scanning, but was positive later in a repeated scan after manifestation of palpable mass in the axilla. The positive PET finding had an impact on treatment decisions in every case: three patients underwent surgical resection and four patients received chemotherapy or interferon. The mean follow-up time was 27 months (range, 12-48 months) and during that time the other 23 patients with true negative FDG PET were disease-free. One of the seven recurrences was in remission after surgical metastasectomy. In conclusion, whole body FDG PET is a valuable follow-up tool in high risk melanoma to diagnose recurrences and to select the patients, who are suitable for surgical metastasectomy.
