Application of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc-MAA in evaluation of perfusion patterns during hepatic infusion chemotherapy. In 6 patients receiving hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy for liver metastases, planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images of the abdomen were obtained after intravenous injection of 99mTc-phytate, and intra-catheter injection of 99mTc-MAA in the same geometrical settings. With this method, the three-dimensional intra- and extra-hepatic distribution of the agents during hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy can be evaluated.
