Pure amusia reavealing an ischaemic lesion of right temporal planum. Participation of the right temporal lobe in perception of music. Amusia is the impaired perception and performance of music due to brain lesions that do not affect motor or sensory skills. Amusia is usually associated with other neuropsychological disorders. We report an exceptional case of pure amusia of sudden onset in a professional choir conductor, following right-sided temporal planum infarction revealing internal carotid occlusion. We describe this patient's symptoms in relation to published observations and to the conclusions of PET scanning. This clinical case confirms that singing disorders and impaired timbre and melodic perception are particularly linked to the right temporal lobe, whereas rhythm perception involves the left temporal lobe.
