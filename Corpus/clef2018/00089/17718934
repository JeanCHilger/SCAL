Synthetic approaches and bio-distribution studies of [11C]methyl-phenidate. The purpose of this study was a) to present a facilitated method for the preparation and workup of [11C]d-threo-methylphenidate ([11C]d-threo-MP) (a ligand that was shown to bind selectively to the presynaptic dopaminergic transporters) from [11C]methyliodide ([11C]CH3I), b) to demonstrate that the ligand can as well be produced by an alternative labeling method employing [11C]diazomethane as the labeling agent and c) to present biodistribution data for this tracer obtained in rats.11C-labeling with [11C]CH3I was performed using either [d-threo-1-(2-nitrophenylsulfanyl)piperidin-2-yl]phenyl-acetic acid (d-threo-N-NPS-ritalinic acid) under addition of sodium hydroxide as base or the previously prepared sodium salt of d-threo-N-NPS-ritalinic acid. The two approaches were compared with regard to radiochemical yield and purification procedures needed in order to obtain a sufficiently pure tracer solution for human use. For the alternative reaction pathway using [11C]diazo-methane as the labeling agent the reaction was performed with d-threo-N-NPS-ritalinic acid. The biodistribution of [11C]d-threo-MP was determined in rats at 5, 10 and 30 min post injection of the tracer.The application of the sodium salt of d-threo-N-NPS-ritalinic acid as precursor resulted in higher radiochemical yields than the use of the free acid under basic conditions, the yields were 20 +/- 8% and 6 +/- 3%, respectively for the final isolated product (based on [11C]CH3I starting activity). The alternative labeling approach by means of [11C]diazomethane as the labeling agent was demonstrated to give radiochemical yields of 76 +/- 8% (based on [11C]diazomethane starting activity, determined by HPLC analysis of the crude reaction mixture before final work-up) within shorter process times. Based on [11C]methane starting activity both approaches result in similar yields (17% and 15%, respectively) Biodistribution studies in rats revealed a low blood activity (0.09% injected dose/g (% ID/g)) at 5 min post injection (p.i.), as well as a relatively high liver uptake (15.9% ID at 30 min) compared to a lower kidney uptake (3.2% ID at 30 min). Brain uptake was 0.9% ID/g already 5 and 10 min p.i..The application of the sodium salt of d-threo-N-NPS-ritalinic acid as precursor for the radiosynthesis of [11C]d-threo-MP reduces the amount of [11C]methanol formed from the reaction of [11C]CH3I with sodium hydroxide, that is added to generate the carboxylic anion of d-threo-N-NPS-ritalinic acid needed for labeling with [11C]CH3I. The purification process could be simplified (omission of one solid phase extraction step), resulting in an easily automated process for the production of the tracer. The preparation of [11C]d-threo-MP by means of [11C]diazomethane as the labeling agent appears to be an interesting alternative to the [11C]CH3I methods because of shorter overall process times and high labeling yields. Biodistribution data show a rapid extraction of the tracer from the blood pool. Tracer excretion seems to take place predominantly via the hepatic pathway since liver uptake at 30 min was considerably higher than kidney uptake. [11C]d-threo-MP exhibits a rapid and sufficiently high brain uptake in rats.
