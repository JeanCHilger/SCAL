Aerobic bacterial culture of used intravenous fluid bags intended for use as urine collection reservoirs. Numerous studies have shown a relationship between indwelling urinary catheters and bacterial urinary tract infection. Some veterinary hospitals utilize stored, used intravenous (IV) fluid bags as part of the urine collection system. The authors cultured 95 such bags to see if they were potential sources of bacterial contamination. Forty-two unused IV bags were emptied of their contents for use as controls. Results indicated no aerobic bacterial growth in either group. The authors conclude that properly stored, used IV bags are unlikely sources of aerobic bacterial contamination when used in a urine collection system.
