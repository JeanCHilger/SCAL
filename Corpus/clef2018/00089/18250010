Imaging of recurrent lung cancer. Local, regional and distant tumor recurrence is common following surgical resection for non-small cell lung cancer. It is important to be familiar with the patterns of recurrence and to differentiate them from the normal post-operative appearance and post-radiation changes. The risks and types of recurrence are influenced by various factors including preoperative tumor stage, histological type and type of surgical resection. Treated patients are at risk for developing a second lung primary, reported to be 1-4% per year, and therefore follow-up must be aimed at detecting not only recurrent cancer, but also a new, primary lung cancer. Different follow-up imaging strategies have been suggested, including conventional radiography, CT and/or PET scanning.
