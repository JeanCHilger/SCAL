Asthma counselling targeted to removal of domestic animals. To create and evaluate the efficacy of a short individualized educational intervention program, based on Prochaska's transtheoretical model, for a six-month period in a population of adult asthma patients living with domestic animals but sensitized to these pets.A randomized, controlled study using a pretested questionnaire was conducted at three different times (pretest, and at three and six months postintervention).Eleven members (29%) of the intervention group and eight members (21%) of the control group removed their pets within six months (X(2)=3.23 P>0.35). The two groups showed similar improvements in their perception of the benefits of pet removal and in their level of belief that they could do it. The experimental group showed a greater improvement in knowledge acquisition about asthma and allergies than the control group (P<0.05). Both experimental and standard educational interventions were effective in facilitating progression through the stages of behavioural change.Overall, the results do not support the utility of behavioural change educational intervention, tailored to the transtheoretical model stage of the individual, in the context of convincing patients to remove their pets from their homes. However, the decision-making aid appears to be helpful in raising awareness of the problem of asthma and allergy in the patient, and in developing appropriate knowledge.
