Clinical objectives, tracer constraints and technological requirements for in vivo imaging. The aim of this paper is to identify future directions for developing instrumentation to measure the tissue kinetics of tracers labelled with positron emitting isotopes. A principal theme developed is the need to realise increased sensitivity for detection. In order to present the case for these improvements, examples are shown of current procedures which would improve with increased sensitivity.
