Normalisation and reconstruction of PET data acquired by a multi-ring camera with septa retracted. Emission scan data acquired by a multi-ring PET camera operated with septa retracted must be corrected for (1) geometrical and detector sensitivity variations between the different lines of response (normalisation), (2) photon attenuation, and (3) mispositioned events due to photon scattering. These corrections must be applied to the full 3-D set of lines of response before reconstruction. The standard normalisation and attenuation correction procedures for 2-D scans increase the statistical noise in the emission scan, a problem which becomes even more serious in 3-D because of the large number of LORs involved (approximately 8 million). This paper will describe a fully 3-D reconstruction algorithm for multi-angle PET data incorporating a practical normalisation and attenuation correction procedure which minimises the increase in emission scan statistical noise. The correction factors are derived from 2-D, septa extended scans. The algorithm is currently used to reconstruct 3-D emission data from an ECAT 953B, a sixteen-ring PET camera with retractable septa.
