PET evaluation of pulmonary vascular permeability: a structure-function correlation. We compared regional measurements of the pulmonary transcapillary escape rate (rPTCER) for 68Ga-transferrin, obtained by positron emission tomography (PET), with morphometric data obtained from corresponding tissue samples in six anesthetized mechanically ventilated dogs, 1 h after oleic acid administration to either the left caudal lobe (0.015 ml/kg Lobar group, n = 3) or the right atrium (0.08 ml/kg
