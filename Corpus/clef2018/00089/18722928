Regional infusion-radioembolization. Selective internal radiation therapy involves the intra-arterial delivery of radioactive beads to the tumor while minimizing dosing to the adjacent organ. Because this technique invariably results in some degree of embolization, it has also been termed radioembolization. More than 8000 patients have been treated worldwide, with a large body of experience with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastatic colorectal carcinoma (MCRC) and growing experience with other tumors (metastatic neuroendocrine, breast carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma). Response rates by FDG-PET are 80% to 90%. Complications are uncommon and most often consist of self-limited malaise. More significant complications, including radiation-induced liver disease, ischemic cholecystitis, and gastrointestinal ulceration may be seen in up to 10% of patients. This underscores the critical importance of patient selection and meticulous technique. Median survival times in patients who have HCC and MCRC are significantly improved compared with historic controls. Further study is required to determine the appropriate role of radioembolization in the context of state-of-the-art chemotherapy and other liver-directed therapies.
