Elevated medial-frontal cerebral blood flow in obsessive-compulsive patients: a SPECT study. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured with single photon emission computed tomography in 10 obsessive-compulsive patients and eight comparison subjects. The patients had a significantly higher ratio of medial-frontal to whole cortex blood flow this was unrelated to symptom severity but was correlated negatively with anxiety. No differences in orbital-frontal blood flow were found.
