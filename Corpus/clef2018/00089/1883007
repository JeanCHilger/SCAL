Effects of fluoxetine on regional cerebral blood flow in obsessive-compulsive patients. Six drug-free obsessive-compulsive patients were given single photon emission computerized tomography scans before and during treatment with fluoxetine. The treatment significantly reduced the patients' "hyperfrontality," as determined by the ratio between medial-frontal and whole cerebral cortex blood flow, and significantly lowered ratings of obsessive-compulsive and anxiety symptoms.
