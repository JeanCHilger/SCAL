Prolonged treatment of porcine pulmonary artery with nitric oxide decreases cGMP sensitivity and cGMP-dependent protein kinase specific activity. A cultured porcine pulmonary artery (PA) model was used to examine the effects of prolonged nitric oxide (NO) treatment on the response to acutely applied NO, cGMP analog, or atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Twenty-four-hour treatment with the NO donor (Z)-1-[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DETA-NO) resulted in >10-fold decrease in the response to acutely applied DETA-NO. In parallel with this, the relaxant response to acutely applied cGMP analog, beta-phenyl-1,N(2)-etheno-8-bromoguanosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Sp isomer (Sp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS), and ANP decreased. The reduction in ANP responsiveness in PA was not associated with a reduction in cGMP levels evoked by 10(-6) M ANP. Twenty-four hours in culture and treatment with DETA-NO decreased total cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGKI) mRNA level compared with that in freshly prepared PA (1.05 +/- 0.12, 0.42 +/- 0.08, and 0.11 +/- 0.01 amol/mug, respectively). Total cGKI protein levels were decreased to a lesser extent by 24 h in culture and further decreased by 24-h DETA-NO treatment compared with that in freshly prepared PA (361 +/- 33, 272 +/- 20, and 238 +/- 25 ng/mg total protein, respectively). Maximal cGMP-stimulated phosphotransferase activity was reduced in 24-h cultured and DETA-NO-treated PA (986 +/- 84, 815 +/- 81, and 549 +/- 78 pmol P(i).min(-1).mg soluble protein(-1)), but the cGMP concentration resulting in 50% of maximal phosphotransferase activity was not. cGKI specific activity (maximal cGMP-activated phosphotransferase activity/ng cGKI) was significantly reduced in PA treated with DETA-NO for 24 h compared with freshly prepared and 24-h cultured PA (1.95 +/- 0.22, 2.64 +/- 0.25, and 2.85 +/- 0.28 pmol P(i).min(-1).ng cGKI(-1), respectively). We conclude that prolonged NO treatment induces decreased acute NO responsiveness in PA in part by decreasing cGMP sensitivity. It does so by decreasing both cGKI expression and cGKI specific activity.
