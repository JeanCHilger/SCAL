Synthesis of the positron-emitting radiotracer [(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose from resin-bound perfluoroalkylsulfonates. A new approach to the synthesis of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG, [(19/18)F]-) is described, which employs supported perfluoroalkylsulfonate precursors , where the support consists of insoluble polystyrene resin beads. Treatment of these resins with [(19)F]fluoride ion afforded protected FDG [(19)F]- as the major product, and the identities of the main byproducts were determined. Acidic removal of the acetal protecting groups from [(19)F]- was shown to produce [(19)F]FDG. The method has been applied to the efficient radiosynthesis of the imaging agent [(18)F]FDG, and was shown to produce the radiochemical tracer in good radiochemical yield (average 73%, decay corrected).
