Three-dimensional SPECT simulations of a complex three-dimensional mathematical brain model and measurements of the three-dimensional physical brain phantom. We have developed a three-dimensional computer simulation of SPECT imaging. We have applied the simulation procedure to the realistic mathematical Hoffman three-dimensional brain model to generate the projection data (in the absence of attenuation, scatter, or noise) of both a parallel-hole and a multidetector SPECT system with point-focusing collimators. The simulated projection data were then reconstructed using standard software. The projection data resulting from the distribution of grey matter alone, or grey and white matter, were simulated. The results of these simulations indicate the existence of significant qualitative and quantitative artifacts in reconstructed human brain images. For example, the reconstructed values for grey matter along a cortical circumferential profile in a transverse slice through the basal ganglia varied by a factor of 2.40 (parallel-hole) and 2.99 (point-focusing), although the original grey matter values were identical in all cortical regions in the model. We have compared the simulated reconstructed images with those obtained by imaging the physical three-dimensional Hoffman brain phantom, which was constructed based upon the same set of data from which the mathematical three-dimensional Hoffman brain model was derived. Although the simulation did not include all of the degrading factors present in the physical imaging, the two images were in good agreement, indicating the applicability of the simulation to a realistic situation and the importance of the detector resolution effect.
