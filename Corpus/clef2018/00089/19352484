Total en bloc lumbar spondylectomy of follicular thyroid carcinoma. The presence of distant metastases from differentiated thyroid carcinoma decreases the 10-year survival rates of patients by 50%. This is a report of a 61-year-old female with follicular thyroid carcinoma who presented initially with low back pain. 2-deoxy-2-[18F] fluoro-D-glucose whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) demonstrated a hypointensity lesion in the left thyroid gland with malignant uptake in L1 vertebra and magnetic resonance images revealed paravertebral and epidural extension of mass in L1 vertebra. After thyroidectomy, histopathological study showed a follicular carcinoma. We performed L1 total en bloc spondylectomy with expandable cage for long-term local control. The technical details of total en bloc spondylectomy in follicular carcinoma are described herein.
