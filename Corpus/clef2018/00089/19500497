Study on the cloning, in vitro expression and bioactivity of Ailuropoda melanoleuca Qinling subspecies interleukin-2. To identify if any difference exisit between the population of Sichuan and Qinling giant panda. express IL-2 protein in BL21(DE3)with biological activity.IL-2 was amplified by RT-PCR from adult Qinling giant panda peripheral blood lymphocyte which was induced by ConA, and cloned into prokaryotic expression vector of pET32a-IL-2. The fusion protein was expressed in BL21(DE3)/pET system and identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot inoculate rabbit with purified expression products to prepare polyclonal antibodyThe protein of IL-2 was obtained by recombination expression, molecule weight is 34 000 .The specificity of polyclonal antibody was obtained, in vitro activity test indicated that the recombinant protein IL-2 having an activity of promoting the proliferation of lymphocytes. The effect can be stopped by polyclonal antibody which was prepared before.The IL-2 gene of Qinling giant panda was cloned and expressed in E.coli successfully, and the homology of IL-2 gene in these two population is 99.4% and the recombination protein can promote the proliferation of lymphocytes in vitro from giant panda.
