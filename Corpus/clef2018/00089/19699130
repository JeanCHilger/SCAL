Positron emission tomography in the management of cervix cancer patients. Since its introduction in clinical practice in the 1990's, positron emission tomography (PET), usually with (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG), has become an important imaging modality in patients with cancer. For cervix carcinoma, FDG-PET is significantly more accurate than computed tomography (CT) and is recommended for loco-regional lymph node and extrapelvic staging. The metabolic dimension of the technique provides additional prognostic information. Ongoing studies now concentrate on more advanced clinical applications, such as the planning of radiotherapy, the response evaluation after the induction of therapy, the early detection of recurrence. Technical innovations, such as PET cameras with better spatial resolution and hybrid positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET-CT), available now on the whole territory, provide both anatomic and metabolic information in the same procedure. From the point of view of biological metabolism, new radiopharmaceutical probes are being developed. Those hold promise for future refinements in this field. This article reviews the current applications of FDG-PET in patients with cervix cancer.
