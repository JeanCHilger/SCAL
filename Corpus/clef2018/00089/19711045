New developments in computer-assisted surgery (CAS). From intraoperative imaging to ultrasound-based navigation. Ever faster processor capacity is having an impact on computer-assisted or computer-aided surgery (CAS). The fusion of different imaging modalities enables functional data such as PET-CT, for example, to be available in image-guided surgery. Referencing of image data is the key to precise navigation. Intraoperative data acquisition is a new approach to improving accuracy. Thus, intraoperative CT conducted under navigational support enables automatic referencing of up-to-date image data. Alternatively, intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging or intraoperative sonography can be performed. Ultrasound systems have already been successfully integrated in existing navigational systems to compensate for intraoperative tissue shifting. Ultrasound systems may play a role in the future as a single modality in image-guided surgery in soft tissue of the neck and skull bone.
