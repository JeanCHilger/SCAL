EANM procedure guidelines for PET brain imaging using [18F]FDG, version 2. These guidelines summarize the current views of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine Neuroimaging Committee (ENC). The purpose of the guidelines is to assist nuclear medicine practitioners in making recommendations, performing, interpreting, and reporting the results of fluorine-18 fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) PET imaging of the brain. The aim is to help achieve a high standard of FDG imaging, which will increase the diagnostic impact of this technique in neurological and psychiatric practice. The present document replaces a former version of the guidelines that were published in 2002 [1] and includes an update in the light of advances in PET technology, the introduction of hybrid PET/CT systems and the broadening clinical indications for FDG brain imaging. These guidelines are intended to present information specifically adapted for European practice. The information provided should be taken in the context of local conditions and regulations.
