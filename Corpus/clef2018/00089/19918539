An unusual presentation of a sarcoidosis that mimicked lymphatic metastatize non small cell lung carcinoma in positron emission tomography: a case report. In the last decade, several sophisticated and accurate imaging methods such as positron emission tomography have been developed in order to evaluate malignant potential in enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. This case illustrates an unusual presentation of sarcoidosis that mimicked lymphatic metastases of non small cell lung carcinoma. The reported high specificity and sensitivity of positron emission tomography-Computer Tomography regarding mediastinal staging could lead in same cases of false positives to a delaying of stage adapted therapy of non small cell lung carcinoma, showing that despite the recent advances of imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography-computer tomography, several limitations of this imaging technique are still existing.
