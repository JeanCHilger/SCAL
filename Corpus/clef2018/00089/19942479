Tumour response and secondary resectability of colorectal liver metastases following neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cetuximab: the CELIM randomised phase 2 trial. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for unresectable colorectal liver metastases can downsize tumours for curative resection. We assessed the effectiveness of cetuximab combined with chemotherapy in this setting.Between Dec 2, 2004, and March 27, 2008, 114 patients were enrolled from 17 centres in Germany and Austria three patients receiving FOLFOX6 alone were excluded from the analysis. Patients with non-resectable liver metastases (technically non-resectable or > or =5 metastases) were randomly assigned to receive cetuximab with either FOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and folinic acid56 patients were randomly assigned to group A and 55 to group B. One patient in each group were excluded from the analysis of the primary endpoint because they discontinued treatment before first full dose, one patient in group B was excluded because of early pulmonary embolism. A confirmed partial or complete response was noted in 36 (68%) of 53 patients in group A, and 30 (57%) of 53 patients in group B (difference 11%, 95% CI -8 to 30 odds ratio [OR] 1.62, 0.74-3.59Chemotherapy with cetuximab yields high response rates compared with historical controls, and leads to significantly increased resectability.Merck-Serono, Sanofi-Aventis, and Pfizer.
