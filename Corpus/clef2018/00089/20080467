Contribution of hypoxia-measuring molecular imaging techniques to radiotherapy planning and treatment. Hypoxia is related to poor prognosis because it is associated to chemo- and radioresistance. During recent years the evolution of imaging methods like PET/CT and MRI has meant the appearance of new perspectives with direct implications in radiation therapy. We discuss previous experiences in staging, planning and in the follow-up process with these techniques for measuring tumour hypoxia.
