Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in patients with chronic schizophrenia: a PET study with [11C]DAA1106. Inflammatory/immunological process and glial contribution are suggested in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We investigated peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in brains of patients with chronic schizophrenia, which were reported to be located on mitochondria of glial cells, using [11C]DAA1106 with positron emission tomography. Fourteen patients and 14 age- and sex-matched normal controls participated in this study. PET data were analysed by two-tissue compartment model with metabolite-corrected plasma input. Clinical symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. There was no significant difference between [11C]DAA1106 binding of the cortical regions of normal controls and patients with schizophrenia, whereas the patients showed a positive correlation between cortical [11C]DAA1106 binding and positive symptom scores. There was also a positive correlation between [11C]DAA1106 binding and duration of illness. Although the correlations need to be interpreted very cautiously, involvement of glial reaction process in the pathophysiology of positive symptoms or progressive change of schizophrenia might be suggested.
