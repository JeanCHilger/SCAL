Myocardial wall motion and thickening assessment in early gated SPECT images of acute coronary syndrome patients likely to have inferolateral perfusion defects. The purpose of this study was to compare semi-quantitative visual scores of perfusion, motion and thickening with an automated hypoperfusion index (HI) in patients with suspected acute inferolateral perfusion defects. In the absence of perfusion defects motion and thickening abnormalities were assessed. Sixty-eight patients with chest pain at rest and either ST depression ≥0.1 mV in ≥1 of leads I, aVL, V1-V6 on 12-lead ECG or ST elevation ≥0.05 mV in ≥1 posterior lead on the body surface map comprised the study population. A rest gated perfusion scan was performed within 24 h of symptoms. Scans were scored for perfusion, motion and thickening semi-quantitatively. The scores were compared to the automated HI. A 12 h Troponin T >0.09 ng/ml indicated myocardial infarction (MI). Sixty-five patients (96%, 65/68) had MI. The summed perfusion score correlated well with the HI (ρ = 0.90, P < 0.01) and agreement between scorers was good (κ = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.57-0.94). The summed motion score correlated with the HI (ρ = -0.61, P < 0.01) and agreement between scorers was moderate (κ = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.52-0.79). Summed thickening score correlated with HI (ρ = -0.67, P < 0.01) and agreement between scorers was good (κ = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.64-0.88). Of the 1156 segments assessed (68 × 17), 542 had normal perfusion. Of these normally perfused segments, 113 (21%, 113/542) had a motion abnormality and 102 (19%, 102/542) had a thickening abnormality. Three patients with proven myocardial infarction had normal myocardial perfusion (HI ≤ 5) but exhibited wall motion and thickening abnormalities. In conclusion, assessment of wall motion and thickening in addition to perfusion in acute myocardial perfusion imaging may improve the diagnostic sensitivity for acute MI. Of the scores addressing motion and thickening, interobserver agreement was better for the summed thickening score.
