7-[  Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is a mitochondrial enzyme which inactivates dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin in the brain (1, 2). Two isoforms (A and B) of the enzyme have been identified. MAO-A preferentially oxidizes serotonin and noradrenaline, whereas MAO-B preferentially oxidizes phenethylamine. Dopamine is a substrate for both enzymes. MAO-A is predominately associated with depression and anxiety disorders while MAO-B is predominately associated with neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) as indicated by studies with specific MAO isoform inhibitors (3-5). For measurements of MAO-A activity, MAO-A inhibitor harmine (HAR) was radiolabeled as [
