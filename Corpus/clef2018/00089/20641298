TA138-conjugated  Integrins are a broad family of glycoprotein, transmembrane cell surface receptors that are formed by the association of an α and a β subunit. These receptors are involved in cell-matrix interactions and also play a role in cell signaling and migration (1, 2). Because of their role in cell migration, the α
