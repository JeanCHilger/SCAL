 Interleukin-8 (IL-8) has a molecular mass of 8.5 kDa and is an inflammatory chemokine secreted by many cell types (1). It activates neutrophils and monocytes and also serves as a chemoattractant. Therefore, IL-8 plays an important role in cell recruitment during acute inflammation and infection. Two types (CXC1 and CXC2) of high-affinity (0.3â€“4 nM) IL-8 receptors (IL-8Rs) have been identified abundantly on the cell surface of neutrophils (2).
