3-{4-[2-[Benzoxazol-2-yl-methylamino]ethoxy]phenyl}-2-(2-[ Peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors (PPARs), once considered orphan receptors, are now believed to be the primary modulators of glucose and lipid metabolism in animals. PPARs are also believed to regulate the storage and catabolism of dietary fat (1). There are three subtypes of the receptors, designated as PPAR-α, PPAR-β/δ, and PPAR-γ (2). Among these, PPAR-γ is the most extensively investigated and has been cloned from a variety of species including fish, amphibians, rodents, and mammals (2). PPAR-γ has been shown to be an important transcription factor receptor that regulates adipocyte differentiation (3), represses the
