 Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is commercially available in the United States (US) and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer (BC). This immunopharmaceutical is also being evaluated in combination with other anti-cancer drugs in clinical trials for the treatment of metastatic BC. In the clinical setting, the overexpression or amplification of HER2 is determined in tumor biopsies and indicates a poor prognostic outcome for the BC patient (1). Usually, the HER2 status of a tumor is established in the primary tumor after a biopsy, but the HER2 levels may not be the same at all locations in the tumor, and the receptor levels can change after the initiation of BC therapy (2). Although repeated determination of HER2 levels in tumor biopsies during the course of therapy could be a good indicator of treatment effectiveness, taking biopsies is an invasive process, and clinicians and patients are averse to using this technique. In addition, it is difficult to biopsy small and inaccessible tumors of the patient (1). Recently, as an alternative to biopsies, whole-body HER2 immunoscintigraphy with
