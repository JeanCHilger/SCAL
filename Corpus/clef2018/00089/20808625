Role of myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography in pediatric cardiology practice. Diagnostic and prognostic power of myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with coronary artery disease has been demonstrated with planar imaging which was further improvised with addition of gated SPECT and newer Technetium labeled myocardial perfusion tracers like SestaMIBI, Tetrofosmin. Myocardial perfusion abnormalities at rest and after stress are considered to be the best predictors of cardiac event-free survival in adults with ischemic heart disease. This article highlights various myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) radiopharmaceuticals, exercise procedures, pharmacological stress protocols, indications for MPI and myocardial perfusion patterns in children with some of the common congenital and acquired heart diseases.
