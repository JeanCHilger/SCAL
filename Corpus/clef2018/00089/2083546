Semi-automatic quantification of regional cerebral perfusion in primary degenerative dementia using 99m technetium-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime and single photon emission tomography. A new semi-automatic method for quantifying regional cerebral uptake of 99m technetium-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) was used to assess single photon emission tomograms from 5 normal subjects, 14 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 14 patients with dementia of frontal lobe type and 4 patients with dementia with motor neurone disease. Uptake in both posterior cortical regions, although not in other regions, was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in Alzheimer's disease than in normal controls. Conversely in both dementia of frontal lobe type and dementia with motor neurone disease, uptake was significantly reduced (P less than 0.05) compared with controls in all anterior cortical regions but not in posterior regions. Numerical findings in each disease mirrored the pattern of reduced tracer uptake previously reported by visual assessment. Nine patients were re-examined after an interval of at least 1 year. Comparison of follow-up scans with original images showed significant decreases in mid-anterior, left anterior and left posterior cortical uptake (P less than 0.01) in patients with Alzheimer's disease and in left middle, left posterior and right posterior cortical uptake (P less than 0.01) in patients with dementia of frontal lobe type. The method of quantification may be a useful adjunct to the visual assessment of single photon emission tomograms.
