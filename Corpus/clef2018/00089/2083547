Infarct sizing by scintigraphic techniques and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Assessment of myocardial infarct size is the cornerstone in the evaluation of interventions designed to salvage myocardium, such as thrombolytic therapy and urgent coronary angioplasty. Enzymatic methods have probably the highest accuracy but can only be used in the very early phase of infarction. The electrocardiogram allows a reasonable estimate of infarct size, but its confidence limits are wide, and in inferior wall infarction the estimates are unreliable. In recent years, radionuclide techniques have been successfully used to identify, localize and determine infarct size in the course of acute myocardial infarction. These scintigraphic measurements have provided important diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic information based on the extent of myocardial damage. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, particularly with contrast enhancement, is one of the methods that have the greatest potential in accurately delineating myocardial infarct size. Nuclear medicine procedures, on the other hand, employ more biologically oriented tracers and offer promise in view of their ability to monitor biochemical alterations as an effect of therapy in the course of myocardial infarction.
