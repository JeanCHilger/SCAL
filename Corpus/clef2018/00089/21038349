Effect of sterilization on non-woven polyethylene terephthalate fiber structures for vascular grafts. Non-woven polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers produced via melt blowing and compounded into a 6 mm diameter 3D tubular scaffold were developed with artery matching mechanical properties. This work compares the effects of ethylene oxide (EtO) and low temperature plasma (LTP) sterilization on PET surface chemistry and biocompatibility. As seen through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, LTP sterilization led to an increase in overall oxygen content and the creation of new hydroxyl groups. EtO sterilization induced alkylation of the PET polymer. The in vitro cytotoxicity showed similar fibroblastic viability on LTP- and EtO-treated PET fibers. However, TNF-Î± release levels, indicative of macrophage activation, were significantly higher when macrophages were incubated on EtO-treated PET fibers. Subcutaneous mice implantation revealed an inflammatory response with foreign body reaction to PET grafts independent of the sterilization procedure.
