Hydroxyapatite coating enhances polyethylene terephthalate artificial ligament graft osseointegration in the bone tunnel. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether hydroxyapatite (HAp) coating could induce polyethylene terephthalate (PET) artificial ligament graft osseointegration in the bone tunnel. Twenty-four New Zealand white rabbits underwent artificial ligament graft transplantation in bilateral proximal tibia tunnels. One limb was implanted with HAp-coated PET graft, and the contralateral limb was implanted with non-HAp-coated PET graft as control. The rabbits were randomly sacrificed at four and eight weeks after surgery. The loads to failure of the experimental group at eight weeks were significantly higher than those of the control group (p = 0.0057). Histologically, application of HAp coating induced new bone formation between graft and bone at eight weeks compared with the controls. Real-time polymerase chain reaction examination revealed significantly elevated messenger ribonucleic acid expression levels of osteopontin and collagen I in the grafts of the HAp group compared with the controls at four weeks (p < 0.05). The study has shown that HAp coating on the PET artificial ligament surface has a positive effect in the induction of artificial ligament osseointegration within the bone tunnel.
