Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors: a review covering basic principles to loco-regional and targeted therapies. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a complex group of malignancies with variable prognosis and response to treatment. For pancreatic neuroendocrine and carcinoid tumors, traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies have demonstrated minimal activity. Current approaches for treatment of metastatic disease use a combination of loco-regional and targeted biological therapies. Clinical trials remain critical for evaluation of new and promising therapeutic options for patients with NETs.
