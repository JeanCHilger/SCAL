Technical solutions to ensure safe yttrium-90 radioembolization in patients with initial extrahepatic deposition of (99m)technetium-albumin macroaggregates. To evaluate the incidence of extrahepatic deposition of technetium-99m-labeled albumin macroaggregates ((99m)Tc-MAA) after pretreatment angiography, before yttrium-90 radioembolizaton ((90)Y-RE), and to report on technical solutions that can be used to ensure safe delivery of (90)Y-microspheres in patients with initial extrahepatic deposition.A retrospective analysis of 26 patients with primary and secondary liver malignancies, who were scheduled for treatment with (90)Y-RE in our institution in 2009, was performed. The angiograms and single-photon emission computed tomography images of all patients were reviewed by an interventional radiologist and a nuclear medicine physician, respectively, to identify and localize extrahepatic deposition of (99m)Tc-MAA when present. Subsequently, the technical solutions were used to successfully perform (90)Y-RE in these patients were evaluated and described.Extrahepatic deposition of (99m)Tc-MAA was observed in 8 of 26 patients (31%). In 7 of 8 patients, a second pretreatment angiography was performed to detect the cause of extrahepatic deposition. The technical solutions to enable safe (90)Y microspheres delivery included more distal placement of the microcatheter in the proper/right hepatic artery in 4 of 7 (57%) patients (super)selective catheterization of multiple segmental branches in 2 of 7 (29%)Extrahepatic deposition of (99m)Tc-MAA after pretreatment angiography did occur in 8 of 26 (31%) patients. The technical solutions as presented allowed safe (90)Y-RE delivery in 25 of 26 (96%) patients.
