Human salmonellosis and pet turtles. Turtles have long been implicated as carriers of salmonella species, which can and do infect humans. This report reviews the British Columbia Provincial Laboratory's experience with turtle-associated salmonellosis from 1964 to 1985. The author identifies the salmonella serotypes that were most often associated with turtles during this period and discusses the impact that public-health measures may have had on human salmonellosis.
