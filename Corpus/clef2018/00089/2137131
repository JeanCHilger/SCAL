In vitro pharmacological profile of 3-N-(2-fluoroethyl)spiperone. The binding affinities of spiperone and 3-N-(2-fluoroethyl)spiperone (FESP) have been compared for several rodent brain receptor sites and for inhibition of monoamine release and uptake sites. FESP and spiperone have almost identical profiles, namely a high affinity for dopamine-D2 and serotonin-S2 receptors, a low affinity for alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, and negligible binding to other sites. These results suggest that available data on spiperone binding may be applied to the interpretation of PET data obtained with FESP.
