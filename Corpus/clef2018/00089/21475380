Long-term outcome of patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma treated with first-line intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are infrequent subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The clinical course is aggressive and the median survival is about 2-3 years. An optimal first-line chemotherapy protocol has not been established and the role of high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is still unclear.To analyze the long-term outcome of unselected PTCL patients treated with intensive first-line chemotherapy with high-dose therapy and ASCT.Here we report our experience with 29 patients with PTCL. The histological subtypes were as follows: peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified n=13 anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) ALK-negative n=5Nineteen (66%) patients achieved complete remission, 3 (10%) partial remission and 7 (24%) patients failed the treatment. The overall response rate was 76%. PET negativity (complete metabolic response) after therapy was achieved in 8/12 (75%) individuals. After a median follow-up of 55.1 months, 14 (48.3%) patients relapsed or progressed and nine patients died (lymphoma progression). Eleven patients (50% of chemosensitive patients) survived more than 50 months. Three of the long-term survivors were treated with allogeneic SCT. The 2-year event-free survival (EFS) was 52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.71) the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate reached 65% (95%CI, 0.47-0.84). PET negativity was associated with a lower probability of relapse (chi-square p=0.09).Our data show that intensive first-line therapy with etoposide-doxorubicine-based regimens and ASCT consolidation may lead to long-term disease control in about a half of patients with chemosensitive PTCL. Achievement PET negativity is probably an essential prerequisite for long-term complete remission.
