Imaging of neuroendocrine tumors. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) constitute a large group of diverse neoplasms with a wide spectrum of clinical, imaging, and pathologic findings. Imaging diagnosis of NETs can be challenging, and several complementary imaging modalities may be needed during the diagnostic workup. Accurate interpretation of the imaging findings is important to facilitate diagnosis and contribute to patient management. This article discusses the gastrointestinal site-specific features and the tumor-specific features of several NETs and the role of several imaging modalities such as computed tomography, MR imaging, ultrasonography, and positron emission tomography in the evaluation of these NETs.
