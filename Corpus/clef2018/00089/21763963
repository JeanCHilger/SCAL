Imaging in renal cellÂ carcinoma. Imaging plays a central role in the detection, diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Most renal masses are incidentally detected with modern, high-resolution imaging techniques and a variety of management options exist for the renal masses encountered today. This article discusses the role of multiple imaging modalities in the diagnosis of RCC and the imaging features of specific pathologic subtypes and staging techniques. Future directions in RCC imaging are presented, including dynamic contrast-enhanced and unenhanced techniques, as well as the development of novel tracers for positron emission tomography.
