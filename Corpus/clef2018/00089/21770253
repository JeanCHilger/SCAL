The progress of nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance molecular imaging of atherosclerotic vulnerable plaques. The major goal of atherosclerotic molecular imaging is to target specific plaque-associated molecules with molecular probe that provide sensitive and specific imaging contrast and acquire molecular imaging. This method will greatly improve detection and characterization of atherosclerotic lesions, especially plaque components. The plaque components are highly associated with plaque rupture and vulnerability to rupture as well as the consequences followed plaque rupture. Thus, the knowledge about plaque composition will have tremendous clinical utility in terms of the treatment and prognosis judgment of patients with atherosclerosis.
