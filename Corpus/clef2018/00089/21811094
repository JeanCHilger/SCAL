Metformin abolishes increased tumor (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake associated with a high energy diet. Insulin regulates glucose uptake by normal tissues. Although there is evidence that certain cancers are growth-stimulated by insulin, the possibility that insulin influences tumor glucose uptake as assessed by ( 18) F-2-Fluoro-2-Deoxy-d-Glucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) has not been studied in detail. We present a model of diet-induced hyperinsulinemia associated with increased insulin receptor activation in neoplastic tissue and with increased tumor FDG-PET image intensity. Metformin abolished the diet-induced increases in serum insulin level, tumor insulin receptor activation and tumor FDG uptake associated with the high energy diet but had no effect on these measurements in mice on a control diet. These findings provide the first functional imaging correlate of the well-known adverse effect of caloric excess on cancer outcome. They demonstrate that, for a subset of neoplasms, diet and insulin are variables that affect tumor FDG uptake and have implications for design of clinical trials of metformin as an antineoplastic agent.
