Iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine cardiac imaging as a method to detect early sympathetic neuronal dysfunction in chagasic patients with normal or borderline electrocardiogram and preserved ventricular function. The indeterminate form of Chagas disease represents the most common chronic presentation. The aim of this study was to assess cardiovascular autonomic system function with I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy in chagasic patients with normal or "borderline" electrocardiographic alterations and preserved left ventricular function evaluated by echocardiography.A total of 40 chagasic patients and 19 control subjects were included in this study. Patients had normal echocardiogram and chest radiography no arrhythmias or myocardial ischemiaVariables analyzed in the regression tree were age, sex, 20 minutes and 3 hours H/M uptake after injection of I-123 MIBG, washout rate, and single photon emission computed tomography imaging. The 3 hours H/M ratio was the only significant variable (P<0.001) and for 95% of chagasic patients, this value was less than 2.19.This study presents evidence that cardiac autonomic sympathetic modulation may be affected in chagasic subjects with preserved ventricular function evaluated by echocardiography, especially in those with "borderline" electrocardiogram.
