Nigrostriatal dopaminergic function in subjects with isolated action tremor. Isolated action tremor (IAT) is the hallmark clinical feature of essential tremor (ET), but it may also be a prominent feature of some individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) suggesting a pathogenic relationship between these two disorders.We investigated the integrity of the striatal presynaptic dopaminergic system in subjects presenting IAT to improve the diagnostic accuracy and to explore any putative relationships between ET and PD.The striatal dopaminergic system was examined by means of dopamine transporter imaging using (123)I-(fluoropropyl)-2ß-carbomethoxy-3ß-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane ([123I]-FP-CIT) single-photon emission tomography (DAT-SPECT) in a clinical series of individuals with IAT, excluding those with associated resting tremor and bradykinesia.Among 167 incidental individuals with IAT eligible for DAT-SPECT (Male/Female = 58.9/41.1% Age = 67.8 ± 14.3 years), reduced striatal uptake was observed in 114 out of 167 (68.3%), whereas normal striatal binding was observed in the remaining 53 subjects (31.7%). Onset of tremor after 50 years and asymmetrical distribution of tremor were predictive variables of nigrostriatal denervation, whereas gender, family history and the presence of intentional, cephalic or voice tremors were not associated with nigrostriatal denervation.Our findings suggest that IAT is a frequent presenting symptom in a subset of individuals with PD, often misdiagnosed as ET, and that DAT-SPECT can help differentiate between these two disorders. Current diagnostic criteria for ET should be revised to include asymmetry and late-onset tremor as predictors of nigrostriatal denervation.
