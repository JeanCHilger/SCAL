Statistical mapping analysis of brain metabolism in patients with subcortical aphasia after intracerebral hemorrhage: a pilot study of F-18 FDG PET images. This study was aimed to evaluate the brain metabolism in patients with subcortical aphasia after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and the relationship between the severity of aphasia and regional brain metabolism, by using statistical mapping analysis of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-18 FDG PET) images.Sixteen right-handed Korean speaking patients with subcortical aphasia following ICH were enrolled. All patients underwent Korean version of the Western Aphasia Battery and the brain F-18 FDG PET study. Using statistical parametric mapping analysis, we compared the brain metabolisms shown on F-18 FDG PET from 16 patients with subcortical aphasia and 16 normal controls. In addition, we investigated the relationship between regional brain metabolism and the severity of aphasia using covariance model.Compared to the normal controls, subcortical aphasia after ICH showed diffuse hypometabolism in the ipsilateral cerebrum (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, putamen, thalamus) and in the contralateral cerebellum (P (corrected)<0.001), and showed diffuse hypermetabolism in the contralateral cerebrum (frontal, parietal, temporal) and in the ipsilateral cerebellum (P (FDR corrected)<0.001). In the covariance analysis, increase of aphasia quotient was significantly correlated with increased brain metabolism in the both orbitofrontal cortices, the right hippocampal and the right parahippocampal cortices (P (uncorrected)<0.01).Our findings suggest that frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, which are parts of neural network for cognition, may have a supportive role for language performance in patients with subcortical aphasia after ICH.
