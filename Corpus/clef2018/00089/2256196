Therapeutic possibilities of 131I-MIBG in metastatic carcinoid tumors--preliminary report. The poor results of traditional therapy in advanced carcinoid tumors and the well-proven uptake of 131I-MIBG shown by some of these tumors induced us to attempt a radiometabolic approach. We selected for the treatment 5 patients (3 men and 2 women) who showed progression of disease, a fairly good uptake of 131I-MIBG with severe related symptoms, and a poor response to traditional therapy. A cumulative radioactivity of 5.5-29.6 GBq was given. Acute side effects after 131I-MIBG administration or late radiation-induced damages were not observed. Symptoms increased during the first 2-4 weeks in 2 patients: in one of these relief was achieved with drugs. Results concerning objective remission of the disease were unsatisfactory. In contrast, definite improvement of symptoms was shown in 2 of 5 patients, resulting in a better quality of life.
