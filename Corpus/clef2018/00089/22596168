Hitting the target in MCL. One of the major challenges in the evaluation of new therapies for lymphoma and other hematologic malignancies has been the ability to demonstrate changes in important biomarkers and pharmacodynamic end points in the tumor cell population.In this issue of Blood, Leonard et al provide an elegant evaluation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor PD0332991 in patients with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma. Their results suggest that the combination of functional imaging using fluorothymidineâ€“positron emission tomography (FLT-PET) and immunohistochemistry can provide important information about target inhibition in tumor cells, and the effects this inhibition has on proliferation and metabolism.
