Seroprevalence of Encephalitozoon cuniculi in dogs in the United States. Encephalitozoon cuniculi is an obligate intracellular microsporidian parasite that can result in clinical and subclinical infection in many species. It is also considered the cause of a potential zoonotic disease. In the present study, a serological survey was conducted using samples from pet dogs in the state of Florida. Twenty-seven of 125 serum samples, or 21.6%, were found to demonstrate reactivity by ELISA, with titers ranging from 1:32 to 1:512. There were no significant differences by age or sex. This is the first report on the detection of E. cuniculi antibodies in dogs in the United States.
