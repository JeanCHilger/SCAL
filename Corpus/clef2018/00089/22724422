Copper-62 labeled ReCCMSH peptide analogs for melanoma PET imaging. High-specific activity radiolabeled melanocortin peptide preparations are necessary for optimal melanoma imaging due to the relatively low number of melanocortin-1 receptors (MC1-Rs) per tumor cell. In this study, a one-step synthesis of 62Cu-labeled MC1-R targeting peptide Re(Arg11)CCMSH was developed, which yielded high specific activity radiolabeled peptide preparations that required no post-labeling purification. DOTA and NOTA conjugated Re(Arg11)CCMSH peptides were synthesized and examined for 62Cu radiolabeling and cell binding properties. Biodistribution and PET imaging studies were performed to assess the in vivo tumor targeting and imaging characteristics of the optimal radiolabeled peptide. Melanoma cell binding affinities for NOTA-, NOTA-GGG-, and NOTA-GSG- conjugated Re(Arg11)CCMSH were determined to be 1.3×10-9 M, 1.9×10-9 M and 6.0×10-9 M. The 62Cu radiolabeling efficiencies of DOTA- and NOTA- conjugated Re(Arg11)CCMSH analogs were 30% and > 98% after 2 min at 24° C, while 0.5 μg of NOTA-GGG-peptide could be labeled to > 95% with a maximum specific activity of 138 Ci/μmol. Tumor uptake of 62Cu- NOTA-GGG-Re(Arg11)CCMSH in B16/F1 melanoma bearing mice was 4.65±0.48% ID/g and 9.43±2.69% ID/g at 20 and 40 min post injection and was visualized by PET imaging. High specific activity 62Cu-NOTA-GGG-Re(Arg11)CCMSH was prepared in a one-step procedure at 24°C in 6 min. 62Cu-NOTA-GGG-Re(Arg11)CCMSH exhibited MC1-R selective binding and rapid tumor uptake in B16/F1 melanoma bearing mice that was confirmed by PET imaging studies. High specific activity 62Cu from a 62Zn/62Cu generator coupled with simple one step radiolabeling procedures makes 62Cu an attractive radionuclide for PET imaging of low-density receptor targets.
