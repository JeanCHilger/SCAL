Synthesis and evaluation of novel α-fluorinated (E)-3-((6-methylpyridin-2-yl)ethynyl)cyclohex-2-enone-O-methyl oxime (ABP688) derivatives as metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 PET radiotracers. In the search for an optimal fluorine-18-labeled positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for imaging metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5), we have prepared a series of five α-fluorinated derivatives based on the ABP688 structural manifold by application of a two-step enolization/NFSI α-fluorination method. Their binding affinities were evaluated in vitro, and the most promising candidate (Z)-16 exhibited a K(i) of 5.7 nM and a clogP value of 2.3. The synthesis of the precursor tosylate (E)-22 revealed a preference for the (E)-configurational isomer (K(i) = 31.2 nM), and successful radiosynthesis afforded (E)-[(18)F]-16 which was used as a model PET tracer to establish plasma and PBS stability. (E)-[(18)F]-16 (K(d) = 70 nM) exhibited excellent specificity for mGluR5 in autoradiographic studies on horizontal rat brain slices in vitro.
