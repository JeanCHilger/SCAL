The frontal lobes, basal ganglia, and temporal lobes as sites for schizophrenia. Positron emission tomography studies with fluorodeoxyglucose in patients with schizophrenia are reviewed and findings in the frontal lobes, basal ganglia, and temporal lobes summarized from more than 20 published studies. Despite methodological and clinical population differences between studies, most reports indicate that patients with schizophrenia are more likely to be low in these areas than in the occipital lobe, cerebellum, or in white matter. This is consistent with blood flow and some neuroanatomical findings. Cluster analysis on our own sample suggests that patients may be low in all three areas rather than a pattern of three distinct clusters. Further study of individual symptom differences, medication effects, and of psychophysical tasks salient for these brain areas is indicated.
