Quantitative comparison of cerebral glucose metabolic rates from two positron emission tomographs. The rapid progress in positron emission tomography technology has created the dilemma of how to compare data from old and new tomographs. We examined cerebral metabolic data from two scanners, with different spatial resolutions and methods of attenuation correction, to see if data from the lower resolution tomograph (ECAT II) could be "corrected" and then compared to data from the higher resolution scanner (Scanditronix PC1024-7B). Nine subjects were scanned on both tomographs after a single injection of [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. Regional and lobar gray matter metabolic rates for glucose were obtained from comparable images from each scanner. Ratios of lobar to global gray matter metabolism also were calculated. Regression coefficients and percent differences were computed to compare ECAT II and PC1024 data. Twenty-four of the 36 regions showed significant regression slopes, and PC1024 measures of glucose utilization ranged from 30% to 120% higher than those from the ECAT II. Lobar differences between the two machines were less variable (50% to 80%), and ratios generally differed by only +/- 5%. Since there was no simple and consistent relation between regional metabolic rates on the two tomographs, an overall adjustment of regional ECAT values for comparison to PC1024 values would be impossible. A region-by-region adjustment would be necessary. On the other hand, ratios are sufficiently similar that direct comparisons could be made.
