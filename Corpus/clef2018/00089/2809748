A new zinc-62/copper-62 generator as a copper-62 source for PET radiopharmaceuticals. A new 62Zn/62Cu generator system was designed to provide a readily available 62Cu source for positron emission tomographic radiopharmaceuticals, based on the differences of complex formation between Zn and Cu. Noncarrier added 62Cu was selectively eluted as a glycine complex from 62Zn-adsorbed cation-exchange resin (CG-120, Amberlite), when a glycine solution (200 mM) was used as the eluant. The elution efficiency and radionuclidic purity of 62Cu were 70% and greater than 99.9%, respectively. Copper in glycine solution showed rapid complex formation with dithiosemicarbazone, which is one of the established Cu-binding agents for bifunctional chelating radiopharmaceutical.
