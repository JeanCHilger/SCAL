Kinetics of copper-PTSM in isolated hearts: a novel tracer for measuring blood flow with positron emission tomography. Copper(II) pyruvaldehyde bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) ([Cu]PTSM) has shown potential as a flow tracer and can be labeled with the generator-produced positron emitting radionuclide 62Cu as well as with other copper radioisotopes. To define the myocardial handling of [Cu]PTSM, the externally detected single pass extraction and retention of [67Cu]PTSM was characterized after bolus administration in 12 isolated rabbit hearts perfused with erythrocyte-enriched modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer which permitted physiologic flow rates. The myocardial residual (extraction) fraction at control flow rates (approximately 1.5 ml/g/min) was 45 +/- 7(s.d.)% (n = 12), and was invariate with ischemia (flow = 0.15 ml/g/min, n = 4), hyperemia (flow = 3 ml/g/min, n = 4) or with hypoxia induced by perfusion at control flow rates with hypoxic buffer (n = 4) (residual fraction 45 +/- 20, 43 +/- 8, and 49 +/- 8%, respectively, p = N.S.). Once extracted, the tracer was retained with a biologic t1/2 of greater than 3600 min in all groups. The high single-pass extraction, which is not influenced by flow, and the prolonged retention of this tracer under diverse conditions indicate that [Cu]PTSM could be a useful tracer for measuring blood flow with positron emission tomography.
