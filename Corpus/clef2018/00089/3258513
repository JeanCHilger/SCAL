HIPDM-SPECT in patients with medically intractable complex partial seizures. Ictal study. Both interictal and ictal N,N,N'-trimethyl-N'-(2-hydroxy-3-methyl-5-iodobenzyl)-1,3,propanediamine -single photon emission computed tomography (HIPDM-SPECT) were performed in 16 patients with medically intractable complex partial seizures. Ictal HIPDM-SPECT localized epileptic foci in 13 of 14 patients with unilateral temporal focus and provided confirmative evidence of epileptic focus in 11 patients by demonstrating maximally increased regional cerebral perfusion (rCP) in epileptic foci that had shown decreased rCP in a previous interictal study. Ictal HIPDM-SPECT in two patients with bitemporal foci showed more complicated patterns consisting of slightly increased rCP in bilateral multifocal regions. Ictal HIPDM-SPECT was particularly useful for investigating epileptic foci, and correlation with simultaneously recorded ictal electroencephalograms provided further insight for localizing epileptic foci.
