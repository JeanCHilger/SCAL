Measurement of absolute bone blood flow by positron emission tomography. A method of measuring bone blood flow has been developed using 18F sodium fluoride and positron emission tomography. The blood flow levels are in line with those obtained experimentally from microsphere embolisation. This investigative method could be applied to elucidate a number of clinical questions involving bone perfusion.
