Proportional localization system for anatomical interpretation of cerebral computed tomograms. The existence of individual variations in size and shape of the human brain constitutes a problem for the anatomical interpretation of brain reconstructed images obtained from scanning devices it is, for example, responsible for most of the inaccuracies in reading CT scans. One way to account for these variations is to use a proportional localization system. In the 1960s a group of neurosurgeons developed such a system based on two pivotal intracerebral structures, the anterior and the posterior commissures
