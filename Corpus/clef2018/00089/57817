Immunological studies in pre-eclamptic toxaemia. Although five patients with severe pre-eclamptic toxaemia (PET) had increased anticomplementary activity in their serum, there was no evidence of complement activation in the plasma of four of the five patients. These results are not implicated in the pathogenesis of PET. No significant correlation was found between anticomplementary activity and pregnancy-associated alpha2-glycoprotein.
