Assessment of membrane damage in continuous cultures of mammalian cells. The present studies were aimed at evaluating procedures for assessing the effect of chemicals on the integrity of the plasma membrane in continuous cell cultures. The degree of membrane damage was monitored by determining the 'leakage' of alpha-[3H]aminoisobutyric acid ([3H]AIB) and [14C]deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose ([14C]FdG) from the prelabelled cells. These parameters were compared to the loss of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from the cells and the decrease in the intracellular level of K+. Triton X-100, sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), phospholipase C and nystatin which are known to affect membranes by different mechanisms served as test agents. In parallel, we monitored the effects of the chemicals on the viability of the cells. The following results were obtained: (1) The two radioactive markers [3H]AIB and [14C]FdG were found to be suitable to probe for damages of the plasma membrane in a variety of continuous cell lines which differ widely in their phenotype, rate of growth and degree of differentiation. (2) The leakage of the two markers could conveniently be monitored by double labelling techniques. (3) The loss from the cells of the 3 markers of smaller molecular size, K+, [3H]AIB, [14C]FdG, differed considerably depending on the test agent used. (4) Intracellular K+ level and [3H]AIB leakage generally appeared to follow a similar pattern, whereas [14C]FdG leakage may have shown a distinctly different response. (5) The leakage of LDH was an insensitive indicator for membrane damage. (6) No clear relationship was detectable between a particular leakage pattern of the markers and the loss of cellular viability.
