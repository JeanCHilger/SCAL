Contribution of PET in the diagnosis of recurrent colorectal cancer: comparison with conventional imaging. The clinical value of total body PET with FDG was evaluated in 76 patients presenting with or suspected of recurrent local or distant colorectal cancer. PET results were compared to those of routine imaging (CT pelvis, CT/US liver and CXR). The accuracy of PET for local disease was 95% which was superior to CT-pelvis (accuracy 65%). PET accuracy for liver metastases (98%) compared favourably to CT/US-liver accuracy (93%). Unexpected extra-hepatic mestastases were detected by PET in 14 locations in 10 patients. Also, a primary breast cancer was found in one patient. The main value of PET appeared an improved staging of apparently resectable, local or distant recurrent disease. Thereby, a more adequate indication of major secondary surgery could be attained.
