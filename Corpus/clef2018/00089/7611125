Results of adenosine single photon emission computed tomography thallium-201 imaging in hemodynamic nonresponders. Systolic blood pressure typically decreases during adenosine infusion because of stimulation of A2b receptors, resulting in systemic vasodilation. This study examined the results of adenosine single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) thallium-201 imaging in patients who did not show such a decrease in blood pressure during peak adenosine effect (nonresponders). The 102 nonresponders and 341 responders had no significant differences in age, gender, history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or previous myocardial infarction. The extent of coronary artery disease (CAD) by angiography was also similar. The sensitivity of SPECT thallium-201 imaging in patients with one-vessel disease was 82% in nonresponders and 84% in responders (p value not significant [NS]) in patients with multivessel disease, it was 90% in nonresponders and 94% in responders (p = NS) and for all CAD, it was 87% in non-responders and 91% in responders (p = NS). Thus lack of hemodynamic systemic response during adenosine infusion does not affect sensitivity for detecting CAD.
