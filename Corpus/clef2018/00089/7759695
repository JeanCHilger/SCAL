Quantitative angiographic measurements of isolated left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis. Correlation with exercise echocardiography and technetium-99m 2-methoxy isobutyl isonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography. This study sought to assess the value of quantitative coronary arteriography in predicting an ischemic response at exercise echocardiography and technetium-99m 2-methoxy isobutyl isonitrile (mibi) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with single-vessel disease of the left anterior descending coronary artery.The relation between severity of coronary stenosis and ischemic response to exercise echocardiography and perfusion scintigraphy in patients with single-vessel left anterior descending coronary artery disease is not well established.Thirty-one patients without a previous myocardial infarction who had isolated stenosis of varying degrees in the proximal or midportion of the left anterior descending coronary artery were studied. Quantitative arteriographic analysis was used for measurements of percent diameter stenosis and minimal lumen diameter. Exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities by echocardiography and transient perfusion defects by mibi SPECT were considered a positive response. The analysis of sensitivity/specificity and receiver operating characteristic curves was applied to establish the diagnostic power of quantitative coronary arteriography to predict an ischemic response to exercise echocardiography and mibi SPECT:The "best" angiographic cutoff values for predicting a positive exercise echocardiographic and scintigraphic response were similar (diameter stenosis 52%, minimal lumen diameter 1.12 mm for echocardiography diameter stenosis 49%, minimal lumen diameter 1.20 mm for SPECT). However, the sensitivity/specificity at the cross point was slightly higher (even if not statistically significant) for echocardiography than for SPECT, both for diameter stenosis (81% vs. 67%) and minimal lumen diameter (81% vs. 74%), suggesting that quantitative coronary arteriographic measurements are more closely related to echocardiographic than scintigraphic exercise test results.The functional significance of a proximal/mid-left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis measured by quantitative coronary arteriography is slightly better related to echocardiographic than scintigraphic markers of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia.
