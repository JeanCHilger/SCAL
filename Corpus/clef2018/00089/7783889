MRI and PET studies of manganese-intoxicated monkeys. Using MRI and PET, we investigated the consequences of manganese intoxication in a primate model of parkinsonism and dystonia. Three rhesus monkeys were injected intravenously with doses of 10 to 14 mg/kg of MnCl2 on seven occasions, each a week apart. Two animals became hypoactive with abnormal extended posturing in the hind limbs. These motor disturbances did not improve with administration of levodopa. In all three monkeys, T1-weighted MRI demonstrated high signal intensities in the regions of the striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra. No significant changes were found on [18F]6-fluoro-L-dopa, [11C]raclopride, or [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET. These results are consistent with the pathologic findings, which were primarily confined to the globus pallidus, and indicate that manganese intoxication is associated with preservation of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, despite clinical evidence of parkinsonian deficits. Chronic manganese intoxication may cause parkinsonism by damaging output pathways downstream to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. This is consistent with the demonstrated lack of therapeutic response to levodopa.
