Blood flow measurement in extremity soft tissue sarcoma with technetium-99m hexamethyl-propyleneamineoxime and single photon emission computed tomography. Blood flow measurements were made in 28 patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities to investigate the prognostic significance of tumour vascularity. Four patients with benign tumours also underwent blood flow measurement. Mean and maximum tumour blood flow was calculated from technetium-99m hexamethyl-propyleneamineoxime uptake measured using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), tumour volume measured from SPECT transaxial image reconstructions and cardiac output assessed with Doppler ultrasonography. Twenty-seven malignant lesions and one benign tumour showed increased uptake of isotope relative to surrounding tissues. Mean sarcoma blood flow varied between 1 and 33 ml per 100 ml tumour per min, and maximum flow between 5 and 57 ml per 100 ml per min. Fourteen patients developed progressive disease during the first year of follow-up. Eight of 11 patients with a high isotope uptake ratio, eight of 12 with a high mean blood flow and eight of 14 with a high maximum blood flow relative to the respective medians for the series showed disease progression.
