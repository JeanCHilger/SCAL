D2-dopamine receptor occupancy differs between patients with and without extrapyramidal side effects. To investigate whether the occurrence of extrapyramidal side effects was related to D2 dopamine receptor occupancy, iodobenzamide single positron emission computed tomography was carried out in 27 schizophrenic patients and 10 controls. Eighteen patients were treated with haloperidol 9 patients were treated with clozapine. Our data suggest a relationship between D2 receptor occupancy and extrapyramidal side effects as well as the existence of a neuroleptic threshold of a striatal:frontal cortex ratio of 1.2, below which drug-induced exptrapyramidal side effects can be expected.
