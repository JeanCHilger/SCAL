Input functions for 6-[fluorine-18]fluorodopa quantitation in parkinsonism: comparative studies and clinical correlations. PET has been used to quantify striatal 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa (FDOPA) uptake as a measure of presynaptic dopaminergic function. Striatal FDOPA uptake rate constants (Ki) can be calculated using dynamic PET imaging with measurements of the plasma FDOPA input function determined either directly or by several estimation procedures.We assessed the comparative clinical utility of these methods by calculating the striato-occipital ratio (SOR) and striatal Ki values in 12 patients with mild to moderate PD and 12 age-matched normal volunteers. The plasma FDOPA time-activity curve (KiFD) the plasma 18F time-activity curve (KiP)Mean values for all striatal Ki estimates and SOR were significantly lower in the PD group. Although all measured parameters discriminated PD patients from normals, KiFD and KiEFD provided the best between-group separation. KiFD, KiEFD and KiOCC measures correlated significantly with quantitative disease severity ratings, although KiFD predicted quantitative clinical disability most accurately.These results suggest that KiFD may be an optimal marker of the parkinsonian disease process. KiEFD may be a useful alternative to KiFD for most clinical research applications.
