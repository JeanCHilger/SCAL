Quantitative analysis of brain perfusion using radionuclide angiography with 99mTc-HMPAO. A noninvasive simple method for quantitative radionuclide angiography with 99mTc-dl-hexamethyl propylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO). The method of graphical analysis was employed for the evaluation of the unidirectional influx constant (Ku) from the blood to the brain for the tracer. The Ku values were standardized to represent objective and comparable values, brain perfusion indices (BPI), among studied subjects by setting the ratio of ROIbrain size to ROIaorta size to 10. The mean +/- SD of the whole-brain BPI values for the 41 normal controls was 11.15 +/- 2.61, and biphasic reduction with advancing age was observed. The mean of the whole-brain BPI of 7.95 with SD of 2.35 in 103 patients with cerebrovascular disorders was significantly lower than that in normal controls. The right to left ratio of BPI showed wider dynamic range than that of the total counts of SPECT. This technique is quite easy to apply as an adjunct to SPECT and may be helpful in the quantitative evaluation of brain perfusion in routine clinical studies.
