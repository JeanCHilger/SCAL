Postischemic functional recovery and BMIPP uptake after primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction. To correlate asynergic wall motion after primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with myocardial perfusion and fatty acid metabolism, quantitative tomographies using thallium and radioiodinated 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-R,S-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) were performed during the acute and recovery stages in 56 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction, of whom 32 underwent primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (group A) and 24 were conservatively treated (group B) 44 patients (79%) had 1-vessel disease. Reduced myocardial uptakes of thallium and BMIPP and regional wall motion were quantified with a bull's eye technique and a centerline method using contrast left ventriculography, respectively. BMIPP activity was significantly lower than that of thallium at an acute stage in both groups. Abnormal BMIPP activities and the difference in thallium and BMIPP abnormalities (perfusion metabolism mismatch) at an acute stage decreased significantly during follow-up in group A (111 +/- 13 to 99 +/- 12 and 30 +/- 10 to 15 +/- 10, respectively), and not in group B (129 +/- 31 vs 118 +/- 29 and 29 +/- 13 vs 30 +/- 10, respectively). Improvement in regional wall motion abnormality correlated closely with the improved uptakes of thallium and BMIPP (y = 0.64x + 26.4, r = 0.56, p < 0.05
