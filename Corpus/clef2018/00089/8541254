Glucose metabolic correlates of continuous performance test performance in adults with a history of infantile autism, schizophrenics, and controls. Twenty-five schizophrenic patients, fourteen adults with a history of infantile autism, and twenty normal controls performed a test of sustained attention, the degraded stimulus continuous performance test (CPT), during the 35 minute 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose uptake period preceding positron emission tomographic (PET) scan acquisition. This is the first analysis comparing correlations between glucose metabolic rate (GMR) for selected regions and CPT performance. CPT performance differed in controls and schizophrenics, but autistics did not differ from either group. In controls and schizophrenic patients, task performance correlated with GMR in medial superior frontal gyrus and lateral inferior temporal gyrus, suggesting that activation of those regions is important in the normal performance of the task and that damage to those regions, which also showed low GMR in schizophrenics, contributes to the attentional dysfunction in schizophrenia. Also, schizophrenics showed negative correlations of task performance with anterior cingulate activity suggesting that overactivity of that region, which is involved in mental effort and whose GMR was low in our larger study of schizophrenia, impairs task performance in schizophrenics. Autistic patients showed negative correlations of medial frontal cortical GMR with attentional performance, suggesting that neuronal inefficiency in that region may contribute to poor performance.
