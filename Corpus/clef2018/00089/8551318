Unimanual motor learning impaired by frontomedial and insular lesions in man. We correlated impaired unimanual motor learning with the lesion site in 53 patients with chronic lesions predominantly of the frontal lobe. The lesions were assessed using computed tomography (CT), then transferred to standard templates of nine slices parallel to the canthomeatal plane and digitized with a raster matrix of 3 mm by 3 mm width. The learning task was to track a moving target on a computer screen with a dot guided by the preferred hand, while the horizontal coupling between hand movement and screen was inverted. The mean tracking error was recorded over eight successive trials of 80s duration. If the mean error of the last three trials was not lower than that of the first three trials, impaired motor learning was assumed. We correlated performance and lesion with a contingency table analysis for each raster element. Impaired motor learning was associated with a lesion within the supplementary motor area and adjacent anterior cingulate, and within the anterior insular region. Our results indicate that these regions are critical for motor learning and functional plasticity in man. Our data support activation patterns obtained with positron emission tomography.
