Peritoneal equilibration test results are different in infants, children, and adults. Peritoneal equilibration test (PET) curves have been standardized in adult peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. However, it appears that norms for pediatric PD patients may be different. A series of PET in 29 stable, chronic PD patients < or = 14 yr old performed at dwell volumes of 33 +/- 6 mL/kg with 2.5% Dianeal is reported. PET results for glucose and creatinine transport were compared between patients age < or = 2 and those 3 to 14 and published adult values by analysis of variance. Children < or = 2 transport glucose and creatinine more rapidly than do children 3 to 14 and adults. Children 3 to 14 transport glucose more rapidly than do adults creatinine transport is not significantly different. These data demonstrate that transport characteristics differ between very young children, older children, and adults. Because PET are usually performed to plan mode of therapy, to address inadequate ultrafiltration, or to increase clearance, awareness of these results should assist in the clinical care of children on PD.
