The graft flow and 201Tl-myocardial scintigram in patients with saphenous vein graft or left internal thoracic artery graft. To evaluate myocardial perfusion in patients with saphenous vein graft (SVG) or internal thoracic artery graft (ITA-G), we studied 38 patients (14: SVG, 10 males and 4 females, mean age 66 +/- 9 y-o 24: ITA-G, 18 males and 6 females, mean age 64 +/- 7 y-o) by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of ITA-G or SVG, and thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy on exercise or dipyridamole stress. The grafting sites were left anterior descending artery (LAD) in all patients. Normal controls (n = 22) were defined by normal coronary angiogram and no evidence of myocardial ischemia. The graft flow and flow reserve on dipyridamole were measured by Rutishauser's formula. The basal blood flow of native normal ITA, SVG and ITA-G were respectively 72 +/- 24 ml/min, 51 +/- 23 ml/min, and 36 +/- 20 ml/min. The basal ITA-G flow was significantly lower than SVG-flow (p < 0.05). The flow reserves of SVG and ITA-G were respectively 2.32 +/- 0.65 and 1.78 +/- 0.59 (p < 0.02). The incidence of moderate hypoperfusion of thallium-201 SPECT was 14.3% in SVG and 12.5% in ITA-G on exercise stress, and 35% in SVG and 50% in ITA-G on dipyridamole stress. The incidence of reversible myocardial ischemia on dipyridamole stress was significant. The graft flow in patients with normal and abnormal thallium-201 SPECT were respectively 61 +/- 21 ml/min and 33 +/- 15 ml/min in SVG (p < 0.01), 46 +/- 19 ml/min and 27 +/- 16 ml/min in ITA-G (p < 0.02). The graft flow reserve were respectively 2.69 +/- 0.38 and 1.65 +/- 0.49 in SVG (p < 0.001), 2.25 +/- 0.40 and 1.31 +/- 0.28 in ITA-G (p < 0.001). We concluded that the basal blood flow and flow reserve of ITA-G were significantly lower than those of SVG. The myocardial ischemia was occasionally documented by the thallium-201 myocardial SPECT on dipyridamole stress in patients with patent ITA-G.
