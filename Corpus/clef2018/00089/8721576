111IN-octreotide and 123I-MIBG scintigraphy in the diagnosis of small intestinal carcinoid tumors--results of a comparative investigation. This study compares the diagnostic value of 111In-Octreotide- and 123I-MIBG scintigraphy in the diagnostic imaging of carcinoids and correlates the results with CT findings.Twenty-eight patients underwent octreotide-, MIBG scintigraphy and CT examination within a short time period.In 13/15 preoperatively examined patients somatostatin receptor expression of the tumor was demonstrated MIBG-uptake was found in 8/15 cases. Octreotide and MIBG scintigraphy revealed liver metastases in 26 and 19 cases, respectively. CT-examinations detected liver metastases in 22 cases. The number of metastatic lesions found by MIBG and CT was lower than with octreotide. In 3 patients unknown mediastinal lesions were detected by the octreotide scan, 2/3 did not show MIBG uptake. In 5 non-hormone secreting tumors shown by octreotide scintigraphy, no MIBG uptake was found. With respect to the diagnostic accuracy octreotide scintigraphy appeared superior to MIBG.MIBG scans do not provide additional diagnostic information compared to octreotide scintigraphy. MIBG scintigraphy may be potentially useful in terms of planning 131I-MIBG therapy only.
