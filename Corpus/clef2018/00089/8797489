Global brain dysfunction in an infant with pyridoxine dependency: evaluation with EEG, evoked potentials, MRI, and PET. Pyridoxine dependency often presents with intractable seizures in neonates and infants. We describe an infant with pyridoxine-dependent seizures and report the first PET and evoked potential results and EEG and MRI findings. All studies show either diffuse structural or functional abnormality. Our data suggest this coenzyme deficiency causes a generalized disease process.
