Normal cerebral perfusion of 99mTc-ECD brain SPECT--evaluation by an anatomical standardization technique. A single photon emitter labeled tracer, 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer (99mTc-ECD), has now been used for rCBF studies with SPECT. However, normal distribution pattern of this agent in the brain still remains unclear. Therefore, the specific purpose of this study was to investigate the normal distribution pattern of 99mTc-ECD SPECT image. Regional cerebral distribution was measured with SPECT and 984 +/- 17 MBq of 99mTc-ECD in ten normal subjects. During the SPECT measurement, subjects were placed comfortably in a supine position with their eyes closed. Each SPECT image was anatomically standardized using a computerized brain atlas system of Roland et al. (HBA: Human Brain Atlas) and X-CT image. Anatomically standardized SPECT images were globally normalized to 100 count/voxel. Then, the mean and SD images of brain SPECT were calculated voxel-by-voxel basis. The highest radioactivity was found in the medial aspect of the occipital lobe. The results indicate that the normal distribution pattern of 99mTc-ECD in the human brain may be not simply reflect the regional cerebral blood flow.
