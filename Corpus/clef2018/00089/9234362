High performance liquid chromatography of carbon-11 labeled thymidine and its major catabolites for clinical PET studies. The identity and pharmacology of the rapidly formed radiolabeled metabolites formed following i.v. injection of C-11 thymidine (TdR) labeled in the 5-methyl-position are being studied in animal models and patients with cancer. A high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure has been developed for the separation of these metabolites including thymine, dihydrothymine, beta-ureidoisobutyric acid, and beta-aminoisobutyric acid from plasma and tissue extracts. Information obtained regarding the pharmacokinetics of the metabolites are being used to generate mathematical models for C-11 TdR incorporation rates into DNA.
