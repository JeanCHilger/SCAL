Imaging of remyelination. Now that the concept of remyelination is gaining acceptance in MS, there is a need for a paraclinical marker to monitor remyelination in MS, for example to study the effect of therapeutical interventions. At present there is no known imaging marker for remyelination. While positron emission tomography (PET) has ample sensitivity and specificity, an appropriate tracer is locking and spatial resolution is poor. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has superior sensitivity and spatial resolution, but the standard techniques lack specificity. Conventional T2-weighted images will most probably still appear abnormal in an area of remyelination. Among several newer MR techniques that are more specific, magnetization transfer contrast is the best candidate with regards to imaging remyelination. There is a strong need for an appropriate animal model and for histopathological confirmation to be able to further develop both PET and MR.
