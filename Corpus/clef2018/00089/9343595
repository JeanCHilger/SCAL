Retinotopic maps in human prestriate visual cortex: the demarcation of areas V2 and V3. We have used PET (positron emission tomography) to chart the mapping of the retina in human occipital visual cortex and hence to locate the secondary and tertiary visual areas, V2 and V3. A group of four non-selected male volunteers was presented with dynamic stimuli that were aligned with either the vertical or the right horizontal meridians (VM or HM) from 0 degree to 29 degrees eccentricity the vertical stimuli were restricted to either the inferior or the superior hemifields. PET scans were performed using intravenous infusion of H215O and a Siemens-CTI 953B PET scanner with 3D data acquisition. Subjects received 18 scans, divided equally among the right HM, the superior VM, and the inferior VM. Data were analyzed with SPM software. The group average result confirmed our experimental hypothesis that human occipital visual cortex has retinotopic maps similar to those of the macaque monkey. Thus human areas V2 and V3 can be defined on the basis that the border between them is formed by the HM and that the outer border of V3 is demarcated by a second representation of the VM that runs approximately parallel to the primary representation of the VM at the V1/V2 border. Furthermore, as in many mammals, the extrastriate representation of the HM is "split", such that the superior contralateral quadrant is mapped in lower V2 and V3, occupying the ventral surface of human cortex, and the inferior contralateral quadrant is mapped in upper V2 and V3, which extend over the lateral and medial surfaces of each hemisphere. After stereotaxic normalization, the position of V3 defined by retinal topography was found to correspond to that surmised from our previous PET studies employing moving stimuli.
