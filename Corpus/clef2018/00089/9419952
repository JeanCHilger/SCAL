Role of foramen ovale electrodes in presurgical evaluation of intractable complex partial seizures. The value of intracranial electrodes such as depth electrodes and subdural grids for intracranial electroencephalographic (EEG) recording in patients with intractable epilepsies has been well recognized. A new technique, foramen ovale electrode (FOE) implantation, was first introduced by Wieser in 1984 for the lateralization of bilateral mesiotemporal lobe (MTL) onset of seizures.Since October 1993, a multipolar, three-contact FOE has been used in 12 intractable epileptic patients for presurgical evaluation. The reasons for FOE implantation included bilateral MTL onset of seizures recorded by extracranial EEGs in nine patients, and extracranial EEG abnormalities inconsistent with the results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomogram (PET) or Wada test in three patients. Under general anesthesia, the FOEs were implanted according to the technique introduced by Kirschner, using Barters landmarks.After long-term telemetry recording with FOE, seven patients revealed clear onset of seizures originating from one side of the MTL and underwent anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL). Two patients had seizures of bilateral MTL onset. However, they received ATL due to predominantly unilateral interictal epileptiform discharges (EDs) and/or MRI and PET abnormalities. Seven (78%) of the nine operated patients became seizure-free after ATL. Three patients were considered not operable because two had multifocal onset of seizures and one had seizures with independent bilateral MTL onset. No serious complication resulted from implantation of FOE in this series.The semi-invasive technique of FOE is reliable for lateralization of bilateral MTL onset of seizures which are often not clearly recorded by extracranial EEGs. This procedure is safe and can be an alternative to invasive implantation of depth electrodes and subdural grids.
