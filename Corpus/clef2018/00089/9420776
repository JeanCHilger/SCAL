The Canadian exercise technetium 99m-labeled teboroxime single-photon emission computed tomographic study. Canadian Exercise Teboroxime SPECT Study Investigators. 99mTc-labeled teboroxime undergoes rapid washout from the myocardium. For this reason, its use has been favored in conjunction with pharmacologic stress, which enables patient positioning before tracer administration, and multidetector single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), which enables rapid acquisition. We evaluated treadmill exercise 99mTc-labeled teboroxime SPECT with single-detector systems for the detection of coronary artery disease.Treadmill exercise 99mTc-labeled teboroxime SPECT was compared with analogous 201Tl-labeled imaging in 108 patients. Teboroxime was injected first during exercise and then at rest. Nine myocardial segments per study were scored with respect to uptake of activity during stress and at rest (teboroxime) or after redistribution (201Tl). Perfusion was defined as normal, reversible, or fixed. Overall agreement of 201Tl versus teboroxime segmental perfusion (normal vs abnormal) was 772/961 (80.3% chi 2 = 25899mTc-labeled teboroxime is amenable to simple modifications of routine treadmill exercise SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging protocols with widely available single-detector SPECT systems. This modality provides results similar to those of exercise 201Tl SPECT and is significantly faster.
