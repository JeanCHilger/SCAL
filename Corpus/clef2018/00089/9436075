Optimum protocol of technetium-99m tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion imaging for the detection of coronary stenosis lesions in Kawasaki disease. The clinical usefulness of a new myocardial perfusion imaging agent, technetium-99m tetrofosmin, was assessed in 58 patients for a total of 76 times (mean age 9.7 years, 1-15 years) including 20 with and 26 without significant coronary stenotic lesions in Kawasaki disease. Pharmacological (dobutamine or adenosine triphosphate disodium) or exercise stress technetium-99m tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography was performed under stress and at rest on the same day. The sensitivity for detection of stress-induced perfusion defects by this method was 90% (18/ 20) and the specificity was 85% (22/26). The dose was 9.3 +/- 2.5 MBq/kg under stress and 18.7 +/- 5.6 MBq/kg at rest. No significant correlation was recognized between the dose and the image quality. Adequate image quality was provided by projection time 20-40 sec per frame. Increased liver accumulation was seen in 24% (18/76), especially in younger and pharmacological stress cases. The acquisition starting time after tetrofosmin injection was 58.4 +/- 18.7 min in the negative increased liver accumulation group and 43.7 +/- 18.3 min in the positive group (p < 0.01). We recommend that the following protocol is used for pediatric imaging. 1) The standard tetrofosmin dose is rougly 10 MBq/kg (upper limit 370 MBq) at stress and the double dose for the rest imaging. 2) SPECT projection time of 20-40 sec per frame. 3) In practice, the patient should be fasting prior to stress injection, and the imaging should be done 1 hour after eating. The rest injection should be done immediately thereafter, and the rest image should be obtained 1 hour later.
