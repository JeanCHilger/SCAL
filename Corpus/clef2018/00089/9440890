Use of Ga-67 SPECT in patients with malignant lymphoma after primary chemotherapy for further treatment planning: comparison with spiral CT. To compare the diagnostic value of gallium scintigraphy using a SPECT technique with spiral CT for evaluating activity following chemotherapy in patients with malignant lymphoma and to determine treatment options.The results of gallium scintigraphy in 28 patients with malignant lymphoma (19 Hodgkin's disease, 9 high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) following curative treatment were compared with the CT morphology in relation to inactive regions and residual masses.Ga-67-SPECT proved superior to CT for evaluating the activity in 85 initially involved nodes (sensitivity 94.4% against 83.3% specificity 100% against 92.5%). It was, however, inferior for demonstrating organ involvement in 28 instances. In seven patients with residual masses, Ga-67-SPECT directly affected staging and further therapy.The increasing use of secondary treatment schemes for curative purposes makes Ga-67-SPECT a suitable method for the early recognition of residual activity in Hodgkin's disease and high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
