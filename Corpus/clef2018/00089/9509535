Reducing the influence of the partial volume effect on SPECT activity quantitation with 3D modelling of spatial resolution in iterative reconstruction. Quantitative parameters such as the maximum and total counts in a volume are influenced by the partial volume effect. The magnitude of this effect varies with the non-stationary and anisotropic spatial resolution in SPECT slices. The objective of this investigation was to determine whether iterative reconstruction which includes modelling of the three-dimensional (3D) spatial resolution of SPECT imaging can reduce the impact of the partial volume effect on the quantitation of activity compared with filtered backprojection (FBP) techniques which include low-pass, and linear restoration filtering using the frequency distance relationship (FDR). The iterative reconstruction algorithms investigated were maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (MLEM), MLEM with ordered subset acceleration (ML-OS), and MLEM with acceleration by the rescaled-block-iterative technique (ML-RBI). The SIMIND Monte Carlo code was used to simulate small hot spherical objects in an elliptical cylinder with and without uniform background activity as imaged by a low-energy ultra-high-resolution (LEUHR) collimator. Centre count ratios (CCRs) and total count ratios (TCRs) were determined as the observed counts over true counts. CCRs were unstable while TCRs had a bias of approximately 10% for all iterative techniques. The variance in the TCRs for ML-OS and ML-RBI was clearly elevated over that of MLEM, with ML-RBI having the smaller elevation. TCRs obtained with FDR-Wiener filtering had a larger bias (approximately 30%) than any of the iterative reconstruction methods but near stationarity is also reached. Butterworth filtered results varied by 9.7% from the centre to the edge. The addition of background has an influence on the convergence rate and noise properties of iterative techniques.
