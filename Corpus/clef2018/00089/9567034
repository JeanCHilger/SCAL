Cerebral kinetics of brain perfusion agents. Radiotracers called chemical microsphere are widely accepted as brain perfusion agents. Following the intravenous administration, these drugs are transported via the artery to the brain, cross the intact blood-brain barrier, and enter the brain tissue. Once the tracer flows into the brain, the efflux of the tracer is prevented by some trapping mechanism, resulting in prolonged retention. Because the distribution of the accumulated tracer remains approximately consistent with regional cerebral blood flow for a relatively long period, high-quality SPECT images reflecting the distribution pattern of cerebral blood flow can be acquired. However, unlike true microsphere, cerebral kinetics of the brain perfusion agents is complicated, and various causes may produce discrepancy between the distributions of the tracer and blood flow. In this review, cerebral kinetics of the brain perfusion agents used commonly is discussed. The knowledge of the mechanism of brain accumulation appears to be essential to appropriately determine the tracer of choice and interpret the obtained images.
