FDG PET for detection and therapy control of metastatic germ cell tumor. We investigated the use of PET and 2[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) for detection and therapy control of metastatic germ cell cancer in comparison to CT.Fifty-four PET studies were performed in addition to CT in 33 patients with histopathologically proven germ cell tumors (14 seminomas, 18 nonseminomas, 1 not classified). The scans were done either after initial diagnosis (Group 1 n = 12), within 2 wk after completion of chemotherapy (Group 2PET was significantly more accurate than CT (0.86 versus 0.59 p < 0.025) for detection of residual viable tumor in Group 3. While sensitivities of PET and CT did not differ markedly, PET was significantly more specific than CT. No significant differences between PET and CT were found in Groups 1 and 2. PET scans after therapy resulted in false-negative findings in five of nine cases of Group 2 but only in two of nine cases of Group 3. False-positive PET findings occurred in three inflammatory processes. SUV of seminomas was significantly higher than in nonseminomas (p < 0.01).PET using FDG is superior to CT for assessment of residual tumor after chemotherapy of germ cell cancer and may thus have an increased effect on patient management in the future. PET must be performed at least 2 wk after completion of therapy. Further data are necessary to determine the role of FDG PET for initial staging of germ cell cancer.
