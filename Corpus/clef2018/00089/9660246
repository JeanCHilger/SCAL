Effects of IFN-beta on human cerebral blood flow distribution. The effect of interferon-beta1b (IFN-beta) on human cerebral blood flow distribution was examined in five multiple sclerosis patients using functional brain single-photon emission tomography (SPECT). Of nine regions of interest studied, only the basal ganglia exhibited a significant change (increase) in relative photon emission intensity (i.e., relative blood flow) when comparing SPECT scans obtained 6 h after s.c. IFN-beta injection with scans obtained at the same time of day (noon) 30 h after IFN-beta injection (IFN-beta-free day). The increase in relative blood flow to the basal ganglia following IFN-beta injection correlated positively with changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Additional studies will be required to determine the relevance of these observations for IFN-beta-induced central nervous system side effects.
