The significance of 123I-BMIPP myocardial SPECT on the evaluation of angina pectoris. Some patients of ischemic heart disease have low uptake in 123I-labeled beta methyl-iodophenyl penta-decanoic acid (BMIPP) SPECT in spite of normal uptake in thallium-201 (Tl) SPECT. To investigate their clinical significance, we performed both T1 and BMIPP myocardial SPECT in 26 cases with stable angina (n = 16) and unstable angina (n = 10), and compared with clinical backgrounds electrocardiogram (ECG) and left ventriculography (LVG). In 11 patients of them, the uptake of BMIPP was moderately reduced. We divided 26 cases into two groups according to uptake of BMIPP (normal/reduced). The two groups had no differences in length of angina attack and duration of disease, but they had a significant difference in the abnormality of either ECG or LVG. Three to six months after PTCA, we examined LVG in 18 cases, 12 of 16 cases with the abnormality of LVG showed the improvement of wall motion. We concluded the reduced uptake of BMIPP with normal uptake of Tl was related to more severe ischemia in cases with unstable angina.
