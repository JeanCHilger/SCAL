Validation of S-1'-[18F]fluorocarazolol for in vivo imaging and quantification of cerebral beta-adrenoceptors. S-1'-[18F]fluorocarazolol (S-(-)-4-(2-hydroxy-3-(1'-[18F]fluoroisopropyl)-aminopropoxy)carba zole, a non-subtype-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) has been investigated for in vivo studies of beta-adrenoceptors. Previous results indicated that uptake of this radioligand in heart and lung can be inhibited by beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists. In the present study, blocking, displacement and saturation experiments were performed in rats, in combination with metabolite analysis to investigate the suitability of this radioligand for in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and quantification of beta-adrenoceptors in the brain. The results demonstrate that, (i) the uptake of S-1'-[18F]fluorocarazolol reflects specific binding to beta-adrenoceptors, (ii) binding of S-1'-[18F]fluorocarazolol to atypical or non-beta-adrenergic sites is negligible, (iii) uptake of radioactive metabolites in the brain is less than 25% of total radioactivity, 60 min after injection, (iv) in vivo measurements of receptor densities (Bmax) in cortex, cerebellum, heart, lung and erythrocytes are within range of densities determined from in vitro assays, (v) binding of S-1'-[18F]fluorocarazolol can be displaced. In conclusion, S-1'-[18F]fluorocarazolol seems to possess the appropriate characteristics to visualize and quantify beta-adrenoceptors in vivo in the central nervous system using PET.
