Fluorine-18-fluoro-L-DOPA dosimetry with carbidopa pretreatment. This article presents dosimetry based on the measurement of fluoro-DOPA activity in major tissues and in the bladder contents in humans after oral pretreatment with 100 mg carbidopa.Bladder activity was measured continuously by external probe and calibrated using complete urine collections. Quantitative dynamic PET scans provided time-activity curves for the major organs. Bladder wall dosimetry was calculated using the methods of MIRD Pamphlet No. 14. Effective dose was calculated as described in ICRP Publication 60.Mean absorbed dose to the bladder wall surface per unit administered activity was 0.150 mGy/MBq (0.556 rad/mCi) with the realistic void schedule used in our studies. The dose was 0.027 mGy/MBq (0.101 rad/mCi) to the kidneys, 0.0197 mGy/MBq (0.0728 rad/mCi) to the pancreas, and 0.0186 mGy/MBq (0.0688 rad/mCi) to the uterus. Absorbed doses to other organs were an order of magnitude or more lower than the bladder, 0.009-0.015 mGy/MBq. The effective dose per unit administered activity was 0.0199 mSv/MBq (0.0735 rem/mCi.)Urinary excretion of fluoro-DOPA was altered significantly by pretreatment with carbidopa. In general, any manipulation of tracer metabolism in the body should be expected to produce changes in biodistribution and dosimetry. The largest radiation dose was to the bladder wall, for which our estimate was one-fifth of that from the original report. The methods used reflect realistic urinary physiology and typical use of this tracer. The principles of MIRD Pamphlet No. 14 should be used in planning studies using tracers excreted in the urine to minimize the absorbed dose.
