In vitro translation of type A Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin heavy chain and analysis of its binding to rat synaptosomes. Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are highly potent toxins that inhibit neurotransmitter release from peripheral cholinergic synapses. BoNTs consist of a toxifying light chain (LC 50 kDa) and a binding/translocating heavy chain (HC
