18F alpha-methyl tyrosine PET studies in patients with brain tumors. We have developed 18F-labeled alpha-methyl tyrosine (FMT) for PET imaging. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical application potential of FMT for patients with brain tumors.Eleven healthy volunteers and 20 patients with brain tumors were injected with 185 MBq (5 mCi) FMT. In 3 healthy volunteers, whole-body imaging and urinary and plasma analysis were conducted for the assessment of the biodistribution of FMT. The normal range of cortical standardized uptake value (SUV) as a reference for comparing tumor SUV of FMT was estimated by using PET data obtained at 30 min postinjection in 8 healthy volunteers. Dynamic PET scans were conducted for 100 min in 4 healthy volunteers and for 30 min in 15 patients with brain tumors. The 10-min static images in another 4 volunteers and all patients were obtained at 30 min postinjection. In 13 patients, FMT uptake in the brain tumor was compared with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Tumor-to-normal cortex count (T/N) ratio and tumor-to-white matter count (T/W) ratio and SUVs of brain tumors were determined on FMT and FDG PET images.Approximately 1480 MBq (40 mCi) FMT were produced in one radiosynthesis. Percentage injected dose (%ID) of FMT in the brain ranged from 2.8% to 4.9%, and approximately 50%ID of FMT was excreted in urine during 60 min postinjection, of which 86.6% was unmetabolized FMT. A faint physiological brain uptake with SUV of 1.61 +/- 0.32 (mean +/- SD, n = 8) was observed in healthy volunteers. Tumor SUV of FMT ranged from 1.2 to 8.2, with mean value of 2.83 +/- 1.57 (n = 23), which was significantly higher than that of the cortical area in healthy volunteers (P < 0.01). T/N and T/W ratios of FMT were significantly higher than those of FDG (2.53 +/- 1.31 versus 1.32 +/- 1.46, P < 0.001 3.99 +/- 2.10 versus 1.39 +/- 0.65, P < 0.0001, respectively).FMT, like other radiolabeled amino acids, can provide high-contrast PET images of brain tumors.
