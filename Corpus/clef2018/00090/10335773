Oxidative metabolism of the transplanted human heart assessed by positron emission tomography using C-11 acetate. For investigation of the metabolic profile of the transplanted human heart, positron emission tomography with C-11 acetate was performed to compare global and regional oxidative metabolism in 14 transplant patients with that in 10 healthy volunteers. Because no difference between transplants and normals could be observed, the results suggest that oxidative metabolism remains stable after transplantation, whereas cardiac work remains the major determinant.
