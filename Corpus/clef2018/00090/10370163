Measurement of bone marrow blood volume in the knee by positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography was used to measure bone marrow blood volume (BBV), an important hemodynamics parameter, in the knee. The subjects were 11 healthy male volunteers (mean age, 23.6 years range, 21-27 years). The 15O-labelled carbon monooxide (C15O) single-breath inhalation method was used. In the distal femur, regional (r) BBV in the posterior area of the epiphysis (medial, 2. 25 ml/100 cm3 bone marrow
