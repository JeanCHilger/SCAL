Pre-dialysis glycemic control is an independent predictor of mortality in type II diabetic patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. To evaluate the impact of pre-dialysis glycemic control on clinical outcomes for type II diabetic patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).One hundred and one type II diabetic patients receiving CAPD for at least 3 months were enrolled in a single institute. The patients were classified into two groups according to status of glycemic control. In the good glycemic control group, more than 50% of blood glucose determinations were within 3.3-11.0 mmol/L and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels were within 5%-10% at all times. In the poor glycemic control group, less than 50% of blood glucose determinations were within 3.3-11.0 mmol/L, or HbA1C levels were above 10% at least 6 months before peritoneal dialysis was started. In addition to glycemic control status, pre-dialysis serum albumin, cholesterol levels, residual renal function, peritoneal membrane function, and modes of glycemic control were also recorded.The patients with good glycemic control had significantly better survival than those with poor glycemic control (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in pre-dialysis morbidity between two groups. No significant differences were observed in patient survival between patients with serum albumin above 30 g/L and those with serum albumin under 30 g/L between those with cholesterol levels above or below 5.2 mmol/LGlycemic control before starting dialysis is a predictor of survival for type II diabetic patients on CAPD. Patients with poor glycemic control predialysis are associated with increased morbidity and shortened survival.
