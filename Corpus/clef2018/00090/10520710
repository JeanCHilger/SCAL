Left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction calculated from quantitative electrocardiographic-gated 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT. We compared the left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV) and ejection fraction (LVEF) as calculated by Cedars automated quantitative gated SPECT (QGS) to those determined by first-pass radionuclide angiography (FPRNA) and contrast left ventriculography (LVG) in a group of 21 patients (mean age 61.4 +/- 9.2 y).A total of 740 MBq 99mTc-tetrofosmin was administered rapidly into the right cubital vein at rest, and FPRNA was performed using a multicrystal gamma camera. One hour after injection, QGS was performed with a temporal resolution of 10 frames per R-R interval. LVG was performed within 2 wk.The EDV, ESV and LVEF calculated by QGS were highly reproducible (intraobserver, r = 0.99, r = 0.99 and r = 0.99, respectively interobserver, r = 0.99, r = 0.99 and r = 0.99, respectivelyQGS gave more reproducible results than FPRNA. LV volumes and LVEF calculated by QGS correlated well to those by LVG.
