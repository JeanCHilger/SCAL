LOFA: software for individualized localization of functional MRI activity. Although PET, SPECT, and fMRI studies have led to significant advances in functional mapping of the human brain, precise localization and quantification of activity in individual brains require additional procedures. Difficulties to be addressed by a localization strategy are: resolution of individual anatomic differences, differentiation of functional activity in closely juxtaposed brain regions, and management of multiple intricately shaped 3D anatomic structures. In this paper, we describe a localization tool, LOFA, which addresses these problems by forming ROIs with a user-driven interface. Using LOFA, complex 3D anatomy can be defined through open or closed loops and anatomic landmarks. Resulting partitions can be overlaid on top of each other to form multiple regions of interest (ROIs), and functional activity in these ROIs can be extracted individually, one after the other. LOFA introduces important paradigmatic advances over the other ROI analysis methods. The toolbox is interactive, fully compatible with AFNI (MCW), and requires Pv-Wave (VNI Inc.) license to run.
