Pet studies of serotonin synthesis in the human brain. The method for measuring serotonin synthesis in human brain uses [11C]alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan as a tracer and positron emission tomography. The alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan is converted to alpha-methylserotonin, which is not a substrate for monoamine oxidase and therefore accumulates in the brain. In a pilot study published recently, rates of serotonin synthesis were found to be higher in men than in women. This was due to the lower plasma free tryptophan in the women under the experimental conditions used, and does not necessarily reflect the situation in all circumstances. Acute tryptophan depletion lowered brain serotonin synthesis by 90% or more. Patients with borderline personality disorder, who exhibit emotional lability and impulsivity, may have lower brain serotonin synthesis rates than healthy controls.
