Image fusion using an integrated, dual-head coincidence camera with X-ray tube-based attenuation maps. The purpose of this study was to characterize a dual-head gamma camera capable of FDG imaging using coincidence detection and equipped with an integrated x-ray transmission system for attenuation correction, anatomic mapping, and image fusion.Radiation dose (425 mrads skin dose) and tissue contrast (0.7% deviation from expected values) were assessed for the x-ray system. Registration of transmission and emission scans was validated using a hot sphere phantom and was verified in selected patient studies.Fusion of anatomic maps and FDG images allowed precise anatomic localization of lesions identified using dual-head coincidence imaging.The combined approach of x-ray attenuation, anatomic mapping, and image fusion with scintigraphic studies provides a new diagnostic tool for nuclear medicine and fertile ground for future research.
