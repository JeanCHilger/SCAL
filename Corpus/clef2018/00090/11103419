Nuclear medicine study potentials in diseases of the skeletal system. Even though new diagnostic methods, as CT/MRI, are widely available, the bone scintigraphy still does remain an important tool for imaging bone pathology. An increase in diagnostic accuracy is possible by using different imaging modalities: wholebody scan, three phase bone scintigraphy and SPECT. For this reason, the bone scintigraphy can be used for diagnosis of tumors/infections and therapy monitoring. Applying these methods, important informations can be gained for differential diagnosis. The bone scintigraphy is easy to perform, allows good whole-body overview by low radiation burden to the patient.
