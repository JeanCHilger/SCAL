Cerebral amobarbital sodium distribution during Wada testing: utility of digital subtraction angiography and single-photon emission tomography. We aimed to determine if the cerebral distribution of anesthetic during Wada testing is reflected by findings on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and if the findings on these studies are relevant to the outcome of the Wada test. We carried out selective internal carotid artery (ICA) DSA on 29 patients underwent studies prior to a Wada test. In patients without angiographic cross-filling, amobarbital and a radiotracer were injected into each ICA, beginning with the epileptogenic side. In patients with cross-filling, the ICA ipsilateral to the epileptogenic focus was injected with amobarbital and radiotracer while other was injected with amobarbital alone. We analyzed the DSA studies for cross-filling and filling of the posterior cerebral arteries (PCA). We reviewed the SPECT for activity in the territories of the anterior, middle cerebral, and posterior cerebral arteries. We compared the results of both studies with the success or failure of the neuropsychological portion of the Wada test. In 20 patients without cross-filling, the results of DSA and SPECT were comparable: symmetrical hemisphere activity was seen. In nine patients with cross-filling, SPECT showed bilateral, almost symmetrical activity. Filling or nonfilling of the PCA correlated with activity (or lack of it) in the medial temporal and occipital regions in all patients. The Wada test was considered successful in all patients. The findings on SPECT did not alter interpretation of the Wada test and we suggest that it may not be needed in all patients undergoing Wada testing.
