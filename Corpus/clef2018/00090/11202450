Choice of collimator for cardiac SPET when resolution compensation is included in iterative reconstruction. In clinical cardiac single-photon emission tomography (SPET) studies, collimators of different spatial resolution and geometric efficiency are available for imaging. In selecting the appropriate collimator for clinical use, there is a trade-off between spatial resolution, which can limit the contrast of the reconstructed image, and detection efficiency, which determines the noise in the image. Our objective was to assess which collimator is best suited for cardiac SPET when reconstruction is performed with and without compensation for distance-dependent resolution (CDR). The dynamic MCAT thorax phantom was used to simulate 180 degree technetium-99m cardiac data, acquired using either a general-purpose (GP) or high-resolution (HR) collimator. For GP and HR, the resolution at 15 cm was 11.5 mm and 9.5 mm respectively, and the corresponding relative efficiency was 1.0 and 0.52 respectively. Distance-dependent resolution, attenuation and noise were included in the projection data scatter was not included. Ordered subsets expectation maximisation reconstruction (subset size 4) was performed with and without CDR. Results were evaluated by comparing the myocardial recovery coefficient and contrast between myocardium and ventricle relative to the original phantom, each plotted for different noise levels corresponding to increasing iteration number. The study demonstrated that, without CDR, HR gave the best results. However, for any given noise level with CDR, GP gave superior recovery and contrast. These findings were confirmed in a physical phantom study. Results suggest that improved reconstruction can be achieved using a GP collimator in combination with resolution compensation.
