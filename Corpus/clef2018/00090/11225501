Yersinia enterocolitica infections: 1. Impact on animal health. In Europe, yersiniosis is mainly caused by the bacterial species Yersinia enterocolitica. The clinical picture of yersiniosis in farm animals including pig, chinchilla, cattle, small ruminants and the pet animals dog and cat is described in detail. However, data on seroprevalence and prevalence in these animals are not available. Therefore, further research is needed in the fields of epidemiology and epizootiology.
