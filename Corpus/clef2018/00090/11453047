Reproducibility of repeated human regional splenic blood flow measurements using [15O] water and positron emission tomography. The reproducibility of measurement of regional splenic blood flow by dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) using [15O]water was evaluated. In 19 patients, the correlation between the first and second of two serial dynamic measurements was significant (P=1.78 x 10(-6) r=0.858). The regression equation was y = 1.06x, and the slope of the line described had a 95% confidence interval of 0.09. The error apparent between the two measurements was 0.129 (95% confidence interval 0.059). The results demonstrated sufficiently good reproducibility for measurements of regional splenic blood flow with PET and [15O]water to suggest use of this method for serial measurements intended to detect change, including drug effects.
