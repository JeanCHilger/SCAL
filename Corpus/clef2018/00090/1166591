Pesticides and domestic animals. Domestic animals are quite often poisoned by pesticides despite the considerable effort made through legislation and Ministry recommendations to provide adequate safeguards for the use of agricultural chemicals. All pesticides have to be registered and recommendations and restrictions for use are printed on the labels. But a number of cases involving the misuse of certain poisons as bait for vermin has caused concern recently to both Government and industry. Special problems face the veterinary surgeon who has to treat a pet animal with suspected esticide poisoning. This paper provides possible sources of information from which the veterinary surgeon may obtain help with diagnosis, advice on treatment and laboratory aid.
