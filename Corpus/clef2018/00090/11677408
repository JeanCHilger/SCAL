Diagnosis and prognosis in neuro-oncology: contribution of positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) assesses the uptake and distribution of a radiopharmaceutics labelling tissue metabolism, in tumour and in presumably healthy brain, respectively. This technique provides data which are complementary from those obtained with anatomical imaging (CT-scanner, MRI) and with histology performed on a biopsy sample. The most frequently used tracers, in neuro-oncology, are 18FDG and 11C-methionine. However, for most of the applications of this technique, the latter tracer appears to be more effective than the former, both from the point of view of sensitivity and specificity. The main applications of PET in clinical neuro-oncology are the following
