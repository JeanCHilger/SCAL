Usefulness of 201T1 gammagraphy in the diagnosis of carcinoma of the larynx. For the evaluation of a patient with a laryngeal tumor we need the clinical exam and other exams as the CT scan or MRI. Those studies have a sensitivity of less than 80%. For that reason in the last years there has been a development of new techniques trying to increase the accuracy. The 201Tl SPECT is one of them although it was developed for cardiological purposes. We present our experience in 46 patients with laryngeal tumor in whom we did a 201Tl SPECT as part of the extension study. The sensitivity of the study was 81.6% in the diagnosis of the primary tumor and 46.1% for the neck adenopathies. The 201Tl SPECT can be a good method for the evaluation and detection of recurrences in patients with pharyngo-laryngeal tumor.
