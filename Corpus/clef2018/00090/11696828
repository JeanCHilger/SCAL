Combined dipyridamole and dobutamine echocardiography in myocardial hibernation: comparison with thallium uptake in patients after percutaneous transluminal coronary revascularization under circulatory support. To investigate the specificity and sensitivity of the combination of dipyridamole and dobutamine echocardiography for predicting functional recovery in patients with reduced ventricular function after coronary angioplasty.Twenty-five patients, mean (SD) age 60.8 (10) years, with previous myocardial infarction (> 3 months), angiographically assessed coronary artery disease, and resting regional dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%) were studied. They underwent rest-redistribution thallium Tl-201 single photon emission computed tomography, and low-dose pharmacologic stress echocardiography with dobutamine (up to 10 microg/kg per minute), ultra low-dose dipyridamole (0.28 mg/kg over 4 minutes), and combined dipyridamole-dobutamine administration.The rate of agreement between Tl-201 and stress echo was 59% for dipyridamole, 62% for dobutamine, and 71% for combined dipyridamole-dobutamine (P <.05 vs dipyridamole and vs dobutamine). Combined dipyridamole-dobutamine showed a higher sensitivity (89%) than Tl-201, dobutamine, or dipyridamole (84%, 78%, and 80%). Specificity was lower for functional recovery prediction with Tl-201 (60%) compared with dobutamine (89%), dipyridamole (90%), and combined dipyridamole-dobutamine (91%).Thallium is more sensitive than dipyridamole or dobutamine the sensitivity gap is filled with combined dipyridamole-dobutamine. Pharmacologic stress echocardiography is more specific than Tl-201 scintigraphy.
