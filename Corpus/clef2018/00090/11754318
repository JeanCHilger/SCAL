Cortical dysplasia and epilepsy: functional imaging using single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography. Functional imaging using single photon emission CT and positron emission tomography have made important contributions to the evaluation of patients with medically intractable epilepsy and cortical dysplasia by identifying patients who previously were not considered surgical candidates. This article reviews the role of functional imaging in the presurgical evaluation of this patient population.
