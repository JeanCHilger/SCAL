Determination of regional cerebral function with FDG-PET imaging in neuropsychiatric disorders. Functional brain imaging using 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET) has greatly enhanced our understanding of brain function both in normal conditions as well as in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. We review the uses of FDG PET in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. This article will also explore what FDG-PET imaging has revealed in these neuropsychiatric disorders and how these findings relate to both research and clinical applications.
