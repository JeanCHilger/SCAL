Monitoring isotretinoin therapy in thyroid cancer using 18F-FDG PET. Treatment with isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid, 13-cis-RA) is a recent additional option in advanced, otherwise intractable differentiated thyroid cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) in the prediction and the monitoring of response to 13-cis-RA therapy. Twenty-one patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancers were investigated using 18F-FDG PET and iodine-131 whole-body scans before and 3, 6 and 9 months after initiation of 13-cis-RA therapy. After 9 months, 13-cis-RA treatment was discontinued and imaging procedures repeated 3 months later. Average 18F-FDG uptake (SUV) decreased significantly during 13-cis-RA therapy but subsequently increased in five of eight patients after withdrawal of 13-cis-RA. 18F-FDG uptake (SUV) 3 months after onset of 13-cis-RA therapy was significantly lower in patients who developed increased 131I uptake in their tumour sites than in patients with no subsequent increase in 131I uptake. There was no relationship between serum thyroglobulin level on the one hand and simultaneously measured 131I or 18F-FDG uptake on the other hand. There was a tendency towards lower 18F-FDG uptake in tumour manifestations with a better outcome. Therefore, 18F-FDG PET at 3 months after the start of treatment promises to differentiate between those patients who will eventually benefit from 13-cis-RA and those who will not. In conclusion, these data indicate that 18F-FDG PET is a useful tool for the evaluation and monitoring of adjuvant therapy with 13-cis-RA in thyroid cancer.
