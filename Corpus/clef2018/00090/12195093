Value and limitation of myocardial fluorodeoxyglucose single photon emission computed tomography using ultra-high energy collimators for assessing myocardial viability. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using ultra-high energy collimators permits wide clinical application of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) imaging without the use of expensive positron emission tomography (PET) cameras. This study was designed to evaluate the value of FDG SPECT using ultra-high energy collimators in assessing myocardial viability compared with FDG PET on a regional basis. We prospectively studied 33 patients with ischaemic heart disease. The patients were injected with 555 MBq of FDG under a hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp, and FDG PET was performed 40 min later. FDG SPECT using ultra-high energy collimators was performed immediately after FDG PET. The images of the left ventricular myocardium were divided into nine segments and the regional defect score was assessed visually using a four-point scale (0=normal to 3=defect). Regional FDG uptake (%uptake) was quantitatively analysed using polar maps. In 297 segments of all the 33 patients, agreement between the defect scores based on FDG SPECT images and those based on FDG PET images was 70%, and agreement within one rank was 96% (kappa value=0.52). The %uptake based on FDG SPECT images significantly correlated with that based on FDG PET images (r=0.77, P<0.01). However, the defect scores in the inferior wall based on FDG SPECT images were higher (1.41+/-1.14) than those based on FDG PET images (1.06+/-1.12, P<0.01). When the viable region is defined as %uptake > or =50% in FDG PET studies, the optimal cut-off level of %uptake based on FDG SPECT images was 60% in the anterior wall, apex, septum and lateral wall (accuracies, 97%, 93%, 96% and 99%, respectively), and 45% in the inferior wall (accuracy, 99%). It is concluded that FDG SPECT using ultra-high energy collimators can be used for the assessment of myocardial viability as accurately as FDG PET. However, a slight difference was observed in the defect scores mainly due to attenuation in the inferior wall. Therefore, a slightly different cut-off level for assessing myocardial viability should be applied to the inferior wall when using FDG SPECT.
