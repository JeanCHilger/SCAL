Single photon emission computed tomography perfusion imaging for assessment of myocardial viability and management of heart failure. In the setting of coronary artery disease, some areas of dysfunctional myocardium may realize significant improvement in function as a consequence of revascularization. These areas represent viable myocardium, encompassing a spectrum of pathophysiology ranging from chronic stunning, in which resting blood flow is preserved, to hibernating myocardium, in which resting blood flow is decreased. The accurate preoperative evaluation of viable myocardium helps identify those patients with left ventricular dysfunction who will most benefit from coronary revascularization. Of the various modalities available for viability assessment, the nuclear medicine techniques (201)Thallium and (18)Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography have emerged as the most sensitive. It has been consistently shown that in patients with a significant amount of viable myocardium, there is a substantial survival benefit in revascularization versus medical therapy. The likelihood of affecting a significant improvement decreases with time to revascularization, however, particularly in the setting of an enlarged left ventricle secondary to ventricular remodeling.
