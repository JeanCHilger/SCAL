Fetal DNA quantitation in peripheral blood is not useful as a marker of disease severity in women with preeclampsia. Trophoblast migration into the maternal circulation is increased in preeclampsia and can trigger the endothelial dysfunction that characterizes the clinical disease. We hypothesised that 'fetal trafficking' is increased in women with severe preeclampsia and that the quantity of trafficking is greater in women with more severe disease.To test the hypothesis, we used a technique that quantifies a genetic marker specific for the fetomaternal unit, that is, the SRY gene in a pregnant woman carrying a male fetus. Thirty two women with pre-eclampsia and 32 control women (women without preeclampsia) were recruited. Preeclampsia was defined according to the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP). All subjects with preeclampsia had evidence of the multisystemic nature of the disease. DNA was extracted from maternal peripheral blood and RTQ PCR analysis was performed to quantify the fetal DNA (SRY) and the total DNA (beta-actin) in each sample. The ratio of fetal to total DNA was calculated and compared between women with preeclampsia and controls.The women with preeclampsia and the control women did not differ in parity, blood pressure at booking, and gestational age at sampling. The groups differed significantly in age (29 +/- 5.7 vs 25 +/- 5.1 years P =.007), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at sampling (101 +/- 9.5 vs 70 +/- 5.5 mm HgFetal trafficking is more likely to be detected in women with preeclampsia compared to control women but the quantity does not appear to correlate with disease severity.
