Phase I clinical study of 99mTc-ECD. A phase I clinical study of 99mTc-L,L-ethyl cysteinate dimer (99mTc-ECD) was carried out in 3 normal volunteers. There was no significant change in vital signs and laboratory parameters attributing to the radiopharmaceutical. 99mTc-ECD was rapidly taken up by the brain, reaching the maximum peak activity within 1 min after the injection and remained relatively constant over several hours. The brain uptake of 99mTc-ECD at 5 min was 5.4 +/- 0.5% which decreased to 5.0 +/- 0.3% by 65 min. 99mTc-ECD cleared rapidly from other organs. The primary excretion route was through the kidneys. Cumulative 99mTc activity in the urine at 90 min and 24 hr were 60.2 +/- 7.3% and 88.5 +/- 10.3%, respectively. The critical organ was the bladder wall with an estimated radiation dose of 0.073 mGy/MBq, which was acceptable value. Clear SPECT images were obtained at 30, 90 and 150 min postinjection. In conclusion, 99mTc-ECD is a safe and promising radiopharmaceutical for the evaluation of regional cerebral blood flow.
