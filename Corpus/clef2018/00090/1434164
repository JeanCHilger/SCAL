Temporal lobe CO2 vasoreactivity in patients with complex partial seizures. The topography of CO2 vasoreactivity during hyperventilation in 8 patients with complex partial seizure (CPS) was visualized using the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as measured by H(2)15O-PET (positron emission tomography) and compared with that of 10 normal volunteers. In the normal volunteers, the vascular response to CO2 (VrCO2 = delta CBF%/delta PaCO2) in the temporal lobe was 2.46 +/- 0.56 (%/mmHg). In the patients with CPS, VrCO2 in the temporal lobe of the affected side was 2.08 +/- 0.40 (%/mmHg), while VrCO2 on the contralateral side was 2.30 +/- 0.46 (%/mmHg). There was a significant difference in VrCO2 between the affected side of the temporal lobes and the temporal lobes of the normal volunteers. Furthermore, there was a tendency for VrCO2 to be lower in the affected than in the contralateral side of the temporal lobe in patients with CPS. As CO2 is the main regulator of CBF, this impaired vasoreactivity may reflect the brain dysfunction in the seizure focus and adjacent areas.
