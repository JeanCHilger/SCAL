Effort-induced myocardial wall motion abnormalities in the magnetic resonance tomogram: a comparison with effort MIBI SPECT. In 20 patients with an angiographically documented coronary artery stenosis of > or = 70% and normal LV function at rest MRI was performed before and after dipyridamole infusion (0.75 mg/kg BW). In all patients MIBI-SPECT was obtained at rest and after dynamic symptom-limited exercise. In 18 patients MIBI-SPECT showed ischemia and in 18 patients dipyridamole MRI showed a wall motion impairment. In the segments representing the 29 stenosed vessels ischemia in MIBI-SPECT was diagnosed correctly in 24 instances (sensitivity 83%, specificity 90%) and a wall motion abnormality was present in MRI in 23 instances (sensitivity 79%, specificity 90%). Dipyridamole GE-MRI is not superior to MIBI-SPECT in the diagnosis of ischemia.
