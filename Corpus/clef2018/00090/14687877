Role of lactate in the brain energy metabolism: revealed by Bioradiography. To elucidate the role of lactate in the brain, we used a novel method, 'Bioradiography', in which the dynamic process could be followed in living slices by use of positron-emitter-labeled compounds and imaging plates. We studied the incorporation of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) into rat brain slices incubated in oxygenated Krebs-Ringer solution. Under the glucose-free condition, [18F]FDG uptake rate in the cerebral cortex decreased with time and plateaued within 350 min but the addition of 5 mM lactate made the [18F]FDG uptake linear. When an inhibitor of the lactate transporter, 0.5 mM alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (4-CIN) was applied to the glucose-free solution, the uptake rate decreased. Under the normal glucose condition, [18F]FDG uptake linearly increased for 6 h, but when 10 mM lactate was applied, the uptake rate decreased. In contrast, when 0.5 mM 4-CIN was applied to the normal glucose solution, [18F]FDG uptake rate increased. These results suggest that exogenous and endogenous lactate can substitute for glucose in the brain.
