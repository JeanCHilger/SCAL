Eicosanoid balance and perfusion redistribution of oleic acid-induced acute lung injury. We have proposed that endogenous prostacyclin opposes the vasoconstriction responsible for redistribution of regional pulmonary blood flow (rPBF) away from areas of increased regional lung water concentration (rLWC) in canine oleic acid- (OA) induced acute lung injury (D. P. Schuster and J. Haller. J. Appl. Physiol. 69: 353-361, 1990). To test this hypothesis, we related regional lung tissue concentrations of 6-ketoprostaglandin (PG) F1 alpha and thromboxane (Tx) B2 in tissue samples obtained 2.5 h after administration of OA (0.08 ml/kg iv) to rPBF and rLWC measured by positron emission tomography. After OA only (n = 16), rLWC increased in dependent lung regions. Some animals responded to increased rLWC by redistribution of rPBF away from the most edematous regions (OA-R, n = 6), whereas others did not (OA-NR, n = 10). In another six animals, meclofenamate was administered after OA (OA-meclo). After OA, tissue concentrations of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were greater than TxB2 in all groups, but concentrations of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were not different between OA-R and OA-NR animals. TxB2 was increased in the dependent regions of animals in both OA-R and OA-NR groups compared with controls (no OA, n = 4, P < 0.05). The tissue TxB2/6-keto-PGF1 alpha ratio was smaller in controls and OA-NR in which no perfusion redistribution occurred than in OA-R and OA-meclo in which it did occur. This TxB2/6-keto-PGF1 alpha ratio correlated significantly with the magnitude of perfusion redistribution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
