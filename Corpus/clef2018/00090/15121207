Development and evaluation of MRI based Bayesian image reconstruction methods for PET. A maximum a posteriori algorithm, which incorporates correlated magnetic resonance images into the processing of positron emission tomography reconstruction with the aim of improving image quality was developed. The line site map from MRI a priori is made up of a modified Markov random field or Canny edge detector with Gaussian smoothing filter. It is used in the MAP algorithm by a weighted line site method. We evaluate and compare the performance of these reconstruction methods. The results show that the Bayesian methods produce reconstructed images with less noise and better spatial resolution than those produced by the maximum likelihood-expectation maximization method.
