Eligibility for epilepsy surgery in children: review of the literature. We reviewed current literature about eligibility criteria for epilepsy surgery in children. Surgical treatment of epilepsy in childhood is increasing due to major advances in structural and functional imaging as well as EEG monitoring and surgical techniques. Recently, pediatric surgical outcome became similar to those reported for adults. The selection of children requires a multidisciplinary team evaluating intractability, operability and relative risks and benefits. The eligibility criteria are similar to those in adults, but there are age-related differences: number of epileptic syndromes, etiologies, vulnerability and plasticity of the developing brain. Until now, no randomized prospective studies comparing medical and surgical treatment or the different pre-surgical evaluation approaches has been performed in children. The benefit of surgery in child epilepsy has been determined by either referring to results obtained in adults or by comparing surgery outcome to the natural history of the disease. Many retrospective studies in childhood report post-surgical results comparing the seizure outcome, quality of life and the neuropsychological evaluation before and after surgery. The authors of these studies examined retrospectively the predictive factors of favorable outcome and defined the best selection criteria for surgery.
