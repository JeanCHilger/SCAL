Ventilation of the paranasal sinuses studied with dynamic emission computer tomography. This investigation's aim was to study a noninvasive method for determining the ventilation of the nasal sinuses. For this purpose, different insufflation techniques using xenon 133 were tried, along with different scintillation camera techniques. Xenon 133 gas was used for insufflation in the nose and sinuses, and the half-time of the washout curves was determined with the aid of digital scintillation cameras, one of which was capable of dynamic tomography. The tomographic procedure was superior because it made it possible to study the washout from the ethmoidal/sphenoidal sinuses as well. The washout was followed for up to 150 minutes. Great variations in washout were found between different sinuses and also in the same sinus over time. The single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) technique, which is easy to perform and gives a limited absorbed dose to the patient, seems promising for the future evaluation of sinus ventilation and ostial function.
