195Pt, 1H and 31P PGSE diffusion studies on platinum complexes. The first example of the use of (195)Pt PGSE diffusion data (D values) to recognize the solvent dependence of aggregation of the hexachloroplatinate dianion in Na(2)PtCl(6) (1) and in H(2)PtCl(6) (2) is reported. In water, the ions are separated however, in methanol the D values suggest ion pairing and/or aggregation. Additional (1)H and (31)P diffusion data for organometallic Pt complexes trans-PtX(Aryl)(L)(2) (where L = PEt(3) or PPh(3)) and Pt(C(7)H(4)O(2))(L(1))(L(2)) (where L(1) and L(2) = a variety of ligand types) reveal that phenyl phosphines afford relatively large hydrodynamic radii r(h). The presence of a substituent on the aryl ligand of PtX(Aryl)(L)(2) does not markedly affect the D values, whereas a substituent of similar size added to a PPh(3) group in Pt(C(7)H(4)O(2))(L(1))(L(2)) markedly changes both D and r(h) values. There is only a small concentration dependence of the D values in PtX(Aryl)(L)(2) on changing from 2 to 10 mM.
