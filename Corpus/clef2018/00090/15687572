Positron Emission Tomography (PET): an update on applications in breast cancer. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an imaging method which detects alterations in tumor physiology and displays them in an anatomically precise manner. Historically, the method has been a research tool, but it is being increasingly applied to clinical imaging problems. PET, using the glucose analog 18-F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), has been applied most widely and shows promise in detecting primary cancers, characterizing breast masses, staging for axillary metastases, evaluating for systemic metastases, and following response to therapy. This review summarizes the current status of this technique, which is in rapid evolution as new tracers and new imaging cameras become available.
