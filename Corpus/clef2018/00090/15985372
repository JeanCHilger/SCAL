Semi-automated preparation of the dopamine transporter ligand [(18)F]FECNT for human PET imaging studies. The fluorine-18 labeled dopamine transport (DAT) ligand 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-(2-fluoroethyl)nortropane (FECNT) has shown promising properties as an in vivo DAT imaging agent in human and monkey PET studies. A semi-automated synthesis has been developed to reliably produce [(18)F]FECNT in a 16% decay corrected yield. This method utilizes a new [(18)F]fluoralkylating agent and provides high purity [(18)F]FECNT in a formulation suitable for human use.
