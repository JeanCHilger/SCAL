Effects of the free radical scavenger, edaravone, on the development of postoperative cognitive impairment in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Some patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) experience postoperative cognitive impairment. The purpose of the present case cohort study with historical control was to determine whether pretreatment with a novel free radical scavenger, edaravone, could prevent development of cognitive impairment after CEA.Fifty-five patients with ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis (> or =70%) underwent CEA with administration of edaravone before ICA clamping. Neuropsychological testing was performed preoperatively and at the first postoperative month. Cerebral blood flow was also measured using single-photon emission computed tomography before and immediately after CEA and on the third postoperative day.Postoperative cognitive impairment was observed in only 1 (2%) patient, who exhibited postoperative cerebral hyperperfusion (cerebral blood flow increase > or =100% compared with preoperative values). Incidence of postoperative cognitive impairment in the control group (92 CEA patients without administration of edaravone) was significantly higher (12%) (P = .0298, control vs treatment group). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that postoperative cerebral hyperperfusion and absence of pretreatment with edaravone were significant independent predictors of postoperative cognitive impairment.Pretreatment with edaravone can prevent development of cognitive impairment after CEA.
