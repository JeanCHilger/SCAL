Comparison of different methods of DatSCAN quantification. The quantification of DaTSCAN images can be used as an adjunct to visual assessment to differentiate between Parkinson's syndrome and essential tremor. Many programs have been written to assess the relative uptake in the striatum.To compare two of the commercially available programs: QuantiSPECT, which analyses isolated data in two dimensions, and BRASS, which performs three-dimensional processing referencing a normal image template.Twenty-two patients (11 with Parkinson's syndrome and 11 with essential tremor) were visually assessed by two nuclear medicine consultants. The patient data were then processed using two commercial programs to determine the relative uptake in the striatum. A comparison of the results from the programs was performed, together with a comparison with the visual assessment. The inter-operator and intra-operator variabilities were also ascertained.All programs and processing methods could distinguish between Parkinson's syndrome and essential tremor. There was also a good correlation between the results from the three- and two-dimensional methods. The intra-operator and inter-operator variabilities were dependent on the amount of operator intervention.Both programs allowed statistical differentiation between Parkinson's syndrome and essential tremor. Strict operator protocols are needed with QuantiSPECT to reduce inter- and intra-operator variation. The three-dimensional method (BRASS) gave greater concordance than the two-dimensional method (QuantiSPECT) with the visual assessment, but at a cost of increased operator time.
