Predictive impact of the inducibility of ventricular fibrillation in patients with Brugada-type ECG. The natural history of asymptomatic individuals with a Brugada-type electrocardiogram (ECG) is still controversial. In this study, we evaluated ventricular fibrillation (VF) inducibility in Brugada-type ECG patients and compared it with other risk factors to clarify the significance of these data on their prognosis. The study population consisted of 38 patients who presented with a typical ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads and underwent an electrophysiological study (EPS). The patients were divided into 3 groups group A: patients with spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (VF) (n = 5), group B: patients without clinical VF but with inducible VF in EPS (n = 16), and group C: patients with neither clinical nor inducible VF (n = 17). The clinical features, diagnostic results, and prognosis were compared among these groups. During the follow-up period of 26 +/- 19 months, 2/5 (group A), 1/16 (group B), and 0/17 (group C) patients suffered fatal arrhythmic events. None of the clinical features showed any significant difference, although the incidence of positive results in a drug challenge test was higher in groups A and B than in group C (P < 0.05). On the other hand, VF inducibility was higher in patients with positive results in the drug challenge test than in patients with negative results (59% versus 13%
