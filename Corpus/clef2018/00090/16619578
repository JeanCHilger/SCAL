Iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy in localising phaeochromocytomas--experience and meta-analysis. Recommendations on the use of I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy in localising phaeochromocytomas vary. The accuracy of I-123 MIBG scintigraphy was determined by evaluating our own I-123 MIBG scans and performing a meta-analysis.Between January 1992 and May 2002, the I-123 MIBG scans of consecutive patients suspected of a phaeochromocytoma were re-evaluated. For the meta-analysis, studies with more than 5 I-123 MIBG scans were selected.Thirty patients were evaluated. The sensitivity in our own population was 92% and the specificity was 100%. Twelve articles were selected for our meta-analysis. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 96% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for tumours in the adrenal gland was 98% for both. For tumours located outside the adrenal gland, the sensitivity was 98% and the sensitivity for malignancies was 79%.1-123 MIBG scintigraphy has an excellent sensitivity and specificity in localising phaeochromocytomas, except for malignant tumours. 1-123 MIBG scintigraphy is superior in localising tumours outside the adrenal gland.
