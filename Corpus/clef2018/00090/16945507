Striatal D(2) receptor occupancy in bipolar patients treated with olanzapine. We explored the relationship between striatal dopamine-2 (D(2)) receptor occupancy and extra-pyramidal symptoms (EPS) in bipolar patients receiving olanzapine. Seventeen patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder were treated with 5-45 mg/day olanzapine for at least 14 days. After that period, D(2) receptor occupancy was determined using Iodobenzamide (IBZM) and SPECT. EPS were assessed by the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) and Barnes-Akathisia Scale (BAS). We found a dose-dependent increase in occupancy: 5 mg led to 28-50%, 10 mg to 40-68%, 15 mg to 69%, 20 mg to 57-66%, 30 mg to 66% and 45 mg to 80% D(2) receptor occupancy and a significant correlation between plasma levels and occupancy (R(2)=.55, P=.001). Similar to schizophrenic patients, bipolar patients did not exhibit EPS at D(2) occupancy levels of 28 to 80%. Although we did not find an increased vulnerability for acute EPS in bipolar patients receiving olanzapine at clinical relevant doses, this needs to be replicated with larger sample sizes.
