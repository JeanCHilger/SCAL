Left temporal perfusion associated with suspiciousness score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale in schizophrenia. We evaluated the relationship between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and clinical symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Single photon emission computed tomography with N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) was used to study 29 patients with schizophrenia. Clinical symptoms were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). We examined the correlation between rCBF and each BPRS item score using Statistical Parametric Mapping software. Corrected P-values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. The suspiciousness score on the BPRS was positively correlated with rCBF in the left inferior temporal gyrus. There was no significant correlation between rCBF and any other items of the BPRS. There was no significant correlation between rCBF and chlorpromazine-equivalent dosage. This analysis permits the quantitative assessment of the severity of persecutory delusions in relation to left temporal perfusion in patients with schizophrenia.
