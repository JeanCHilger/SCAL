Comparison of CT and 18F-FDG pet for detecting peritoneal metastasis on the preoperative evaluation for gastric carcinoma. The aim of our study was to compare the accuracy of CT and (18)FFDG PET for detecting peritoneal metastasis in patients with gastric carcinoma.One-hundred-twelve patients who underwent a histologic confirmative exam or treatment (laparotomy, n = 107 diagnostic laparoscopy, n = 4Based on the original preoperative reports, CT and (18)F-FDG PET showed sensitivities of 76.5% and 35.3% (p = 0.037), specificities of 91.6% and 98.9% (p = 0.035), respectively, and equal accuracies of 89.3% (p = 1.0). The receptor operating characteristics curve analysis showed a significantly higher diagnostic performance for CT (Az = 0.878) than for PET (Az = 0.686) (p = 0.004). The interobserver agreement for detecting peritoneal metastasis was good (kappa value = 0.684) for CT and moderate (kappa value = 0.460) for PET.For the detection of peritoneal metastasis, CT was more sensitive and showed a higher diagnostic performance than PET, although CT had a relatively lower specificity than did PET.
