Effects of perfluorochemicals on the depressed rCBF and brain metabolism shortly after the hypertensive ICH. The effect of perfluorodecalin and perfluorotripropylamine, Fluosol DA-20% (FDA-20%), on the ischemic brain after hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) was evaluated and the mechanism investigated. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and cerebral metabolic ratios of oxygen (CMRO2) and glucose (CMRGlu) were measured before and after infusion of FDA-20%. The rCBF was estimated by single photon emission computed tomography using the 133Xe inhalation method, and CMRO2 and CMRGlu were determined by calculating arteriovenous difference between the femoral artery and the jugular bulb. The results showed: 1) The mean cerebral blood flow (mCBF) in both affected and non-affected hemispheres significantly increased by 10-20% over the control during 3 hours and 6-12 hours after infusion of 500 ml and 1000 ml FDA-20%, respectively. 2) Administration of 500 ml FDA-20% caused a maximal increase of 15% in CMRO2 and 24% in CMRGlu, and 1000 ml FDA-20% administration caused a maximal increase of 30% in CMRO2 and 75% in CMRGlu. 3) There was no significant change in mean blood pressure, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxygen, or hematocrit before and after FDA-20% infusion. The results indicate that FDA-20% improved rCBF and brain metabolism in the ischemic brain of hypertensive ICH. FDA-20% may operate as an excellent oxygen carrier, and stimulate the brain metabolism directly.
