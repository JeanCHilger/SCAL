Clinical diagnosis of vascular dementia. Vascular dementia (VaD) is a heterogeneous clinical entity based on various vascular pathophysiological processes underlying the subtypes of cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Several diagnostic criteria are currently being used for the clinical diagnosis of VaD, but they are mostly more than 10 years old and need to be renovated including the use of functional brain imaging methods such as single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). There is a limitation in the diagnosis based on the strict dichotomy between AD and VaD, and the concept of "AD with CVD" or "mixed dementia" should be included in the clinical diagnosis of VaD.
