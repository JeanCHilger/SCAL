Evidence-based management of feline lower urinary tract disease. Many treatments have been recommended for managing cats with feline urinary tract disease (FLUTD). Veterinarians making therapeutic decisions should consider the quality of evidence supporting a recommendation to use (or not use) a particular treatment for cats with FLUTD. Whenever possible, recommendations should be based on results of randomized and well-controlled scientific studies performed in clinical patients with the spontaneously occurring disease of interest. In the absence of such studies, one is left to make the best recommendation possible with consideration of all information, including the quality of the evidence. At this time, additional studies are needed to evaluate evidence for many currently recommended treatments for cats with FLUTD.
