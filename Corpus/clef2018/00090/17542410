Standardized uptake values of normal organs on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography imaging. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) of normal organs were evaluated by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) scanning. Seventy patients (38 men and 32 women) with no non-physiological 18F-FDG uptake participated in the study. All patients fasted for at least 4 h before PET-CT imaging and their fasting blood glucose levels were within the normal range. Image acquisition was performed after intravenous administration of 18F-FDG and images were obtained from the vertex to the upper thigh region. The SUVs of various organs were determined from the transverse views. The uptake of 18F-FDG was highest in the cerebrum, cerebellum, myocardium, tonsils, liver and spleen in both sexes. Having knowledge of the physiological uptake of 18F-FDG and normal organ SUVs is required for the correct interpretation of whole-body 18F-FDG-PET-CT studies.
