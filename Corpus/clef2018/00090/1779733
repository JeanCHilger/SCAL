Bayesian image processing in magnetic resonance imaging. In the past several years, image processing techniques based on Bayesian models have received considerable attention. In our earlier work, we developed a novel Bayesian approach which was primarily aimed at the processing and reconstruction of images in positron emission tomography. In this paper, we describe how the technique has been adopted to process magnetic resonance images in order to reduce noise and artifacts, thereby improving image quality. In this framework, the image is assumed to be a statistical variable whose posterior probability density conditional on the observed image is modeled by the product of the likelihood function of the observed data with a prior density based our prior knowledge. A Gibbs random field incorporating local continuity information and with edge-detection capability is used as the prior model. Based on the formalism of the posterior density, we can compute an estimate of the image using an iterative technique. We have implemented this technique and applied it to phantom and clinical images. Our results indicate that the approach works reasonably well for reducing noise, enhancing edges, and removing ringing artifact.
