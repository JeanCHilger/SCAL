Reduced perfusion reserve in Leukoaraiosis demonstrated using acetazolamide challenge 123I-IMP SPECT. We examined the relationship between the perfusion reserve as measured by acetazolamide (ACZ)-challenge N-isopropyl-I-123-p-iodoamphetamine (IMP)-single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and the degree of leukoaraiosis (LA) as estimated using magnetic resonance imaging.In 51 patients receiving IMP-SPECT with the resting state and ACZ challenge, the unaffected cerebral hemispheres were included in the present study. Mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the resting state and ACZ reactivity were acquired. Absolute CBF value and ACZ reactivity were compared among patients with LA grades 0, 1, and 2. The relationship between mean age and LA grade was also assessed.No significant difference in the absolute CBF value in the resting state was observed among the 3 LA groups. Although vasoreactivity in LA grade 0 did not differ from that in grade 1, vasoreactivity in LA grade 2 was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that in grades 0 or 1.The perfusion reserve is impaired in advanced LA.
