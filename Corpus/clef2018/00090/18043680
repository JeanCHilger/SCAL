Coronary heart disease in women: update 2008. Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the leading cause of mortality for US women, responsible for almost 250,000 deaths annually. Preventive heart-health behavioral changes by women and aggressive coronary risk reduction can decrease the number of women disabled and killed by CHD. Angina is the predominant initial and subsequent presentation of CHD in women categorization of chest pain and risk stratification of women assume pivotal roles. A robust evidence-based algorithm can guide cardiovascular imaging techniques to evaluate women with suspected myocardial ischemia to detect those with worsened survival. Restricted functional capacity (<5 METs) is a consistent marker of worsened prognosis. Younger women have substantially higher mortality rates than men following myocardial infarction and coronary bypass surgery. Although these women have more comorbidity and risk factors, other issues including biological differences, treatment differences, and psychosocial factors require management strategies tailored to the unique needs of women.
