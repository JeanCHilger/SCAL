Thyroid cancer in childhood: management strategy, including dosimetry and long-term results. Thyroid cancer, although very rare in childhood, represents the most common pediatric endocrine neoplasia. The low incidence and the resulting limited availability of prospective, randomized trials lead to a lack of evidence- based recommendations for treatment strategies. Total thyroidectomy and lymphadenectomy, when indicated, followed by ablative radioiodine treatment, are considered the cornerstones of initial patient management which decrease the risk of relapse. On the other hand, less aggressive treatment modalities should also be aimed at due to the high life expectancy of this special patient group and the potential impairment of the quality of life. These considerations have led to individualized "tailored" therapeutic approaches based on prior risk stratification. This article mainly deals with novel nuclear medicine concepts for dosing regimens in radioiodine therapy.
