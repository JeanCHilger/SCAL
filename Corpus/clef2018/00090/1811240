Cerebral metabolic pattern in obsessive-compulsive disorder: altered intercorrelations between regional rates of glucose utilization. Correlations between normalized regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose, determined by positron emission tomography with 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose, were used to investigate functional associations between pairs of brain regions in 18 adult patients with primary obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) of childhood-onset, as compared with 18 age- and sex-matched control subjects. The number of correlations that differed significantly between the two groups exceeded chance, although as many of these correlations were larger in the OCD group relative to controls as were smaller. The two regions that had the largest number of correlations that differed significantly between groups were a left hemisphere superior parietal region and the left hemisphere anterior medial temporal area (which includes principally the amygdala). Correlations involving the caudate nuclei did not differ between the two groups for the most part. Anterior limbic/paralimbic regions had correlations in the OCD group that were significantly larger with frontal areas than in controls, and correlations that were significantly smaller with posterior brain regions. This pattern was especially pronounced for the left hemisphere anterior medial temporal region. These results suggest that the correlation pattern in OCD is not characterized by an overall loss of functional integration but, rather, by functional reorganization.
