The impact of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography on the staging and management of primary rectal cancer. 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG PET-CT) has a role in recurrent colorectal cancer. This study was designed to assess the impact of PET-CT on management of primary rectal cancer.Eighty-three patients with rectal cancer underwent PET-CT scan between 2002 and 2005. Referring physicians prospectively recorded stage and management plan after conventional imaging before PET-CT scan, which were compared to subsequent stage and management after PET-CT.Staging PET-CT caused a change in stage from conventional imaging in 26 patients (31 percent). Twelve (14 percent) were upstaged (7 change in N stage 4 change in M stagePET-CT scan impacts the management of patients with primary rectal cancer and influences staging/therapy in a third of patients and should be a component of rectal cancer workup.
