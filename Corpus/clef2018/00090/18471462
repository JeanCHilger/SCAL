Risk stratification assessed by combined lung and heart iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) has been used to assess myocardial sympathetic nervous activity and severity of heart failure. (123)I-MIBG is also used as a potential marker of pulmonary endothelial cell function and may be related to pulmonary hypertension. Thus, we hypothesized that combined assessment of lung and heart 123I-MIBG kinetics predicts future clinical outcome more accurately than myocardial evaluation alone in patients with chronic heart failure. To test this hypothesis, we examined 123I-MIBG scintigrams in 62 consecutive patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Anterior planar images were obtained 15 minutes and 3 hours after 123I-MIBG injection. Cardiac and pulmonary 123I-MIBG activities were quantified as heart-to-mediastinum activity ratio and lung-to-mediastinum activity ratio. We introduced lung-to-heart activity ratio as the new 123I-MIBG parameter including myocardial sympathetic nerve activity and pulmonary endothelial cell function. Delayed lung-to-heart ratio was correlated with pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0.48, p <0.0001), disease duration (r = 0.49, p <0.0001), and number of heart failure episodes (r = 0.55, p <0.0001). During a mean follow-up of 25 months, 15 patients had a cardiac event. Area under receiver operating characteristic curves for prediction of the event was greatest in delayed lung-to-heart ratio (lung to heart 0.92, heart to mediastinum 0.83, lung to mediastinum 0.80). In multivariate analysis, the lung-to-heart ratio (hazard ratio 2.76/0.1 increase, p = 0.002) was selected as an independent predictor for a future cardiac event. In conclusion, the combined assessment of lung and heart 123I-MIBG uptake may help to predict future clinical outcome for patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy more accurately than myocardial evaluation alone.
