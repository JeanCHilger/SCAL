Reticuloendothelium malignancy: current role of imaging. Imaging has an important role in the diagnosis and staging of patients with lymphoma, with a major influence on both patient management and outcome. CT is probably the most widely used modality in patients with lymphoma bur MRI is probably as useful as CT in the initial work-up of the patient. Finally, PET/CT can detect residual disease in patients post-treatment better than both CT and MRI and is playing an increasing role in the imaging of patients with lymphoma.
