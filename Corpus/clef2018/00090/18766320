Advanced imaging of spine disease. Imaging of the spine is an essential prerequisite in the clinical workup of spine disease. Conventional radiography (CR) is still used as a basic diagnostic tool and enables an initial diagnosis to clarify symptomatology. Advanced cross-sectional techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography enable a dedicated diagnostic workup only of complex spinal pathologies. Due to its enormous innovation and broad availability, multidetector computed tomography could replace spinal CR in the diagnostic workup of acute and multiply injured patients. Nuclear medicine bone scans and positron emission tomography serve as screening studies and are an adjunct to morphologic radiological imaging. This review article summarizes the radiological and nuclear medicine imaging modalities and their diagnostic and therapeutic significance for diagnostic workup of common spinal disorders.
