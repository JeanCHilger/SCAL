Infections with weakly haemolytic Brachyspira species in pigs with miscellaneous chronic diseases. The prevalence of infections with different Brachyspira species was assessed in 202 pigs with various chronic herd problems using different methods. Twenty-seven pigs (13.4%) were positive for Brachyspira spp. with at least one of the methods used. The highest number of positives was identified with mucosal scraping-PCR (23), followed by PET-PCR (22) and bacteriological-biochemical analysis (15). With the exception of three cases of B. pilosicoli infections, only weakly pathogenic Brachyspira species were identified. The majority was B. murdochii, followed by B. innocens and B. intermedia. Concurrent infections with two or more Brachyspira species were common and accounted for 37.1% of the total. Presence of weakly haemolytic Brachyspira was associated with wasting and diarrhoea in a number of cases. This investigation shows that infections with weakly haemolytic Brachyspira spp. may contribute to colonic pathology in pigs with chronic herd problems and that mixed infections seem to occur more frequently than previously noticed.
