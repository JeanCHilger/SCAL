Neuroimaging of toxic and metabolic disorders. Imaging of the brain, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in particular, is a key adjunctive tool in the diagnosis and management of toxic-metabolic disorders such as alcoholism, mitochondrial encephalopathies, disorders of iron or copper metabolism, exposure to carbon monoxide, radiotherapy, immunosuppressive agents, toluene, and recreational drugs. In this article, we review the neuroimaging findings of common toxic and metabolic disorders focusing on the role of conventional MRI. We also consider advanced imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion MRI, and positron emission tomography. We hope this article will prove useful to trainees and practitioners in the clinical and imaging fields of the neurosciences.
