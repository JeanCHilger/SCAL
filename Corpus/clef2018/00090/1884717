Cerebral activation during speech discrimination in temporal lobe epilepsy. Eight patients with uncontrolled complex partial seizures underwent positron emission tomography with 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose both at rest and during an auditory order discrimination task using speech syllables. Eight age-matched controls were scanned under identical conditions an additional 18 normal subjects were scanned only at rest. No consistent task-related changes were seen in control subjects. For the 3 patients with left temporal epileptogenic foci, left inferior temporal lobe hypometabolism was more evident during the activated than during the resting scan. Activation procedures may augment the diagnostic yield of metabolic scanning in epilepsy.
