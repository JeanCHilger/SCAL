Surgical salvage of cancer of the oropharynx after chemoradiation. Advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is treated primarily with chemoradiation, with the goal of excellent disease control and preservation of swallowing and articulation functions of the oropharynx. Disease control rates generally are excellent however, a significant number of patients do not achieve locoregional control of disease. The importance of human papillomavirus expression in predicting successful tumor response, locoregional control, and survival following chemoradiation is increasingly confirmed. Emerging is a clinical profile, viral expression, and genetic expression pattern that can predict success of chemoradiation and indicate which patients are at higher risk for locoregional failure necessitating surgical salvage. Successful surgical salvage depends on restaging at the time of recurrence and the time interval from chemoradiation to recurrence. Although surgical morbidity and mortality remain a challenge in patients undergoing salvage surgery of the oropharynx after radiation failure with or without chemotherapy, they may be mitigated by liberal application of regional and microvascular free flap reconstruction techniques.
