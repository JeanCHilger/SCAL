Influence of thyroid-stimulating hormone on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile uptake in human poorly differentiated thyroid cancer cells in vitro. In poorly differentiated thyroid cancer originating from thyroid follicular cells, the ability to concentrate iodine is lost. This makes recurrence undetectable by (131)I whole-body scan. In this situation, other radiopharmaceuticals, such as (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) and technetium-99m-methoxyisobutylisonitrile ((99m)Tc-MIBI), are used to evaluate recurrence or metastasis. Some reports suggest that (18)F-FDG uptake is increased by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation. This study aimed to determine the influence of TSH on (18)F-FDG and (99m)Tc-MIBI uptake in human poorly differentiated thyroid cancer cells in vitro.The cells were stimulated with 1000 muU/ml of recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) for 1 day, 3 days, and 5 days. Each cell was incubated with 0.5 MBq/ml-1 MBq/ml of (18)F-FDG or 0.5 MBq/ml-1 MBq/ml of (99m)Tc-MIBI for 1 h at 37 degrees C. The uptake of each radiopharmaceutical in the cells was quantified as a percent of whole radioactivity per total viable cell number. The quantification of glucose transporter 1, 2, 3 and 4 mRNA expression was measured using RT-PCR.TSH stimulation increased (18)F-FDG uptake in a time-dependent manner. Following 5 days of rhTSH stimulation, (18)F-FDG uptake was approximately 2.2 times that of the control. The increase in (18)F-FDG uptake following rhTSH stimulation was correlated to the increase in GLUT4 mRNA level. The GLUT1 mRNA level was unchanged. An increased uptake of (99m)Tc-MIBI was observed with a pattern similar to that of (18)F-FDG. The (99m)Tc-MIBI uptake was approximately 1.5 times that of the control 5 days later.These results suggest that TSH stimulates (18)F-FDG and (99m)Tc-MIBI uptake in poorly differentiated papillary thyroid cancer, and therefore (18)F-FDG-PET or (99m)Tc-MIBI scans under TSH stimulation may be more accurate than under suppression.
