Synthesis and evaluation of aryl-substituted diarylpropionitriles, selective ligands for estrogen receptor beta, as positron-emission tomographic imaging agents. We have investigated halogen-substituted non-steroidal estrogens with selective binding affinity for the estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta that might be used for imaging the levels of this ER-subtype in breast tumors by positron emission tomography (PET). Based on diarylpropionitrile (DPN, 1a), a compound previously reported that has a 72-fold binding selectivity for ERbeta, we developed a series of DPN analogs having methyl-, hydroxyl-, and halogen substituents, including fluoroethyl and fluoropropyl groups. In competitive radiometric binding assays with [(3)H]estradiol, all of these DPN analogs showed high ERbeta/ERalpha selectivity while the selectivity varied, in some cases it reached nearly 300-fold (RBA: ERalpha, 0.023%
