Stent-assisted parent artery occlusion of giant cerebrovascular aneurysms to avoid mass effect. Endovascular treatment of giant cerebrovascular aneurysms (GCA) may be challenging due to risk of worsening mass effect, thromboembolism, rupture, and recurrence. The purpose of this study was to provide a preliminary evaluation of GCA therapy using stent-assisted coil parent artery occlusion (PAO) to reduce the likelihood of mass effect, aneurysm recurrence, and vessel recanalization.Five patients with GCAs were treated by PAO by deploying detachable coils within a Neuroform-3 stent across the aneurysm neck. Patients were monitored clinically to note any changes after treatment. Magnetic resonance angiography was performed 3 to 12 months after stent placement, and incomplete PAO and aneurysm recurrence were noted.Stent-assisted PAO was technically successful in all GCAs with no residual aneurysm filling and without any coil herniation into the aneurysm sac. None of the patients had recanalization of the vessel or GCA or clinical worsening over a follow-up period of 3-17 months. Symptomatic mass effect improved in 2 and resolved in 2 patients.Based on our preliminary experience, stent-assisted PAO in GCAs is technically feasible and may be a valid option in patients who tolerate balloon test occlusion to minimize the likelihood of increased mass effect from coil embolization.
