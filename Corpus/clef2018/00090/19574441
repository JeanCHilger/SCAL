18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for lung antiinflammatory response evaluatio. Few noninvasive biomarkers for pulmonary inflammation are currently available that can assess the lung-specific response to antiinflammatory treatments. Positron emission tomography with [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) is a promising new method that can be used to quantify pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation.To evaluate the ability of FDG-PET to measure the pulmonary antiinflammatory effects of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) and recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) in a human model of experimentally-induced lung inflammation.Eighteen healthy volunteers were randomized to receive placebo, lovastatin, or rhAPC before intrabronchial segmental endotoxin challenge. FDG-PET imaging was performed before and after endotoxin instillation. The rate of [(18)F]FDG uptake was calculated as the influx constant K(i) by Patlak graphical analysis. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed to determine leukocyte concentrations for correlation with the PET imaging results.There was a statistically significant decrease in K(i) in the lovastatin-treated group that was not seen in the placebo-treated group, suggesting attenuation of inflammation by lovastatin treatment despite a small decrease in BAL total leukocyte and neutrophil counts that was not statistically significant. No significant decrease in K(i) was observed in the rhAPC-treated group, correlating with a lack of change in BAL parameters and indicating no significant antiinflammatory effect with rhAPC.FDG-PET imaging is a sensitive method for quantifying the lung-specific response to antiinflammatory therapies and may serve as an attractive platform for assessing the efficacy of novel antiinflammatory therapies at early phases in the drug development process.
