PET studies of cerebral metabolism in Parkinson disease. A defect in cerebral energy production due to dysfunction of the mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS) has been postulated to be important in the pathogenesis of Parkinson Disease (PD). However, direct in vivo measurements of cerebral mitochondrial function are scant and inconsistent. We directly investigated cerebral mitochondrial function in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) in 12 patients with early, never-medicated PD and 12 age-matched normal controls by combined measurements of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) and the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc). Instead of the decrease in CMRO(2) and CMRO(2)/CMRglc molar ratio characteristic of defects in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, there was a statistically significant 24% general increase in CMRO(2) and no change in CMRO(2)/CMRglc. Since PD symptoms were already manifest, reduced oxidative activity of the mitochondrial ETS cannot be a primary mechanism of neuronal death in early PD. This increase in metabolism could reflect the increased energy requirements of an injured brain or an uncoupling of ATP production from oxidation in the terminal stage of oxidative phosphorylation. Which is the case in early PD and whether these metabolic abnormalities are important in the pathogenesis of PD will require further study.
