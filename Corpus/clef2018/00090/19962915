Incremental value of 111-in pentetreotide SPECT/CT fusion imaging of neuroendocrine tumors. Hybrid single photon-emission computed tomographic (SPECT) and computed tomographic (CT) imaging for the investigation of neuroendocrine tumors allows the fusion of functional and anatomic information in a rapid and efficient method. The aim of this study was to assess the incremental diagnostic value of (111)In pentetreotide SPECT/CT imaging compared with traditional planar and SPECT imaging with respect to lesion localization and characterization and reader confidence.Forty-nine patients (23 male, 26 female mean age, 56.9 yearsIn 55 of 89 lesions (61.8%), (111)In pentetreotide SPECT/CT imaging improved lesion localization compared to planar and SPECT imaging in 25 of 89 lesions (28.1%), SPECT/CT imaging changed lesion classification. In 20 of 49 patients (40.8%) for reader 1 and 14 of 49 patients (28.6%) for reader 2, (111)In pentetreotide SPECT/CT imaging provided incremental diagnostic value, which was considered likely to affect patient management in twelve of 20 and seven of 14 patients, respectively. Increased reader confidence was found in 32 of 49 patients (65.3%) for both readers with uniformly high confidence after SPECT/CT interpretation.Hybrid (111)In pentetreotide SPECT/CT imaging provides incremental diagnostic value and greater reader confidence over planar and SPECT imaging. This is achieved though superior lesion localization, the identification of physiologic activity, and additional anatomic information derived from the nondiagnostic CT portion of the study.
