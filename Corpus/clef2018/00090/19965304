Pulmonary nodules: do we need a separate algorithm for non-solid lesions? This article describes the aetiology, epidemiology and clinical significance of incidental non-solid pulmonary nodules. Non-solid nodules are more likely malignant. If malignant, they are mostly due to atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. As these may be negative on positron emission tomography and slow growing, the diagnostic algorithms that are used for solid nodules have to be modified for non-solid nodules.
