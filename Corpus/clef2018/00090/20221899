Folate-PEG-CKK(2)-DTPA, A Potential Carrier for Lymph-Metastasized Tumor Targeting. A novel conjugate, Folate-PEG-CKK(2)-DTPA, was designed and prepared as a carrier for lymphatic metastasized tumor imaging diagnosis and targeting therapy.Folate-PEG-CKK(2)-DTPA was synthesized and characterized by analysis High Performance Liquid Chromatography, Size Exclusive Chromatography and (1)H-NMR. (99m)Tc-labeled conjugation was prepared, and in vivo quantitative biodistribution and SPECT imaging were studied after subcutaneously injected into the rats and rabbits, respectively. Cell uptake study was carried in a KB cell line using fluorescent methods. In vivo and ex vivo fluorescent imaging study was carried in tumor-bearing nude mouse to evaluate its targeting ability.Folate-PEG-CKK(2)-DTPA was synthesized with high purity. Both in vivo biodistribution study and SPECT imaging study show the rapid direction and high distribution of the conjugation to the lymph nodes. The uptake of fluorescence-labeled Folate-PEG-CKK(2)-DTPA in human oral epidermis carcinoma cells was observed. In vivo and ex vivo fluorescent imaging study indicated it could accumulate in tumor region after vein tail injection in nude mouse.All these findings suggested Folate-PEG-CKK(2)-DTPA as a novel and dependable carrier for tumor diagnosis and therapy, especially for lymph-metastasized tumors.
