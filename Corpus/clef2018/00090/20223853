Absolute quantification of activity content from PET images using the Philips Gemini TF PET/CT system. Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) is a quantitative technique suitable for diagnostics and uptake measurements. The quantitative results can be used for the purpose of the calculating absorbed dose to patients undergoing nuclear medicine investigations. Hence, the accuracy of the quantification of the activity content in organs or tissues is of great importance. When using a planar gamma camera and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images, the activity content in organs and tumours has to be determined by the user, using the number of counts in the organs and the efficiency of the camera. However, when using a Philips Gemini TF PET/CT system, the activity concentration in a region of interest (ROI) is given by the system. The reliability of activity concentration values given by the Philips Gemini TF PET/CT system was studied using a Jaszczak phantom containing hot spheres of different sizes the influence of the ROI size and the impact of organ size, that is the partial volume effect, was investigated with three different lesion-to-background ratios in the phantom. The use of a small ROI size (40 % of the large ROI size, which covered the entire sphere) showed a 15 % improvement in the recovery of the true activity. Small lesion sizes result in large underestimations of the activity concentration values.
