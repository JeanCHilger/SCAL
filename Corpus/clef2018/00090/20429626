Prognostic value of FDG-PET in Hodgkin lymphoma for posttreatment evaluation. Long term follow-up results. Determining the viability of residual tumor masses is a great challenge after primary treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma. FDG-PET may play a crucial role in this procedure. In this study, files of 128 Hodgkin lymphoma patients were reviewed, who were treated in three Hungarian hematology centers between January 1995 and February 2005. CT scan showed residual tumor mass by all of them. Their median follow-up was 75.5 months from PET examination. The number of true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, false-negative subjects were 29, 83, 10, 6, respectively. Sensitivity of post-treatment FDG-PET was 83 %, specificity 93 %, positive predictive value 74 %, negative predictive value 93 %, and accuracy 88 %. The difference between the event free survival of PET positive and negative cases is highly significant (p=0.0000), according to the Mantel-Cox test. Our results in the largest cohort of patients, in accordance with literature, clearly indicates that patients with negative FDG-PET results are unlikely to progress or relapse during the longest follow-up.
