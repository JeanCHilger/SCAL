Molecular imaging of interstitial alterations after myocardial infarction. To prevent progression of heart failure (HF), it is necessary to understand the cellular and molecular processes that precede more irreversible stages. Molecular imaging of HF has hitherto focused on myocytic and neuronal components. More recently, interstitial changes, particularly interstitial fibrosis, have been targeted both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Molecular imaging of interstitial changes may identify patients at risk to develop HF, before adverse remodeling has occurred. In addition, it may also serve as a surrogate endpoint for the assessment of treatment efficacy.
