. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has diverse physiological roles as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1). It also is a regulator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation. The brain 5-HT system has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia (2, 3). The serotonergic transmission is controlled in part by the serotonin transporter (SERT), which regulates the concentration of free, active 5-HT in the synaptic cleft. Citalopram, paroxetine, and fluoxetine were developed as selective SERT inhibitors to treat depression and anxiety disorders by blocking the reuptake of 5-HT [PubMed]. The blockade led to a higher 5-HT concentration in the synaptic cleft, and subsequently an improved well-being of the patients.
