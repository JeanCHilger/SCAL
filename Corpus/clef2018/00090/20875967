Motion correction and attenuation correction for respiratory gated PET images. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging technique which provides important functional information about the human body. However, thoracic PET images are often substantially degraded by respiratory motion, which adversely impacts on subsequent diagnosis. In this paper, a motion correction and attenuation correction method is proposed to correct for motion in respiratory gated PET images and to yield an accurate distribution of the radioactivity concentration. Experimental results show that this method can effectively correct for motion and improve PET image quality. The method is able to provide improved diagnostic information without increasing the acquisition time or the radiation burden.
