Semiconductor quantum dots photosensitizing release of anticancer drug. A new photo-controlled anticancer drug release system is reported based on the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) between semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) and N-methyl-4-picolinium (NAP) ester 1 under the excitation of visible light.
