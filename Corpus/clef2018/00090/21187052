From medical imaging to image-guided therapy. This survey on medical imaging provides a look into three major components. The first one deals with the full steps through which it must be apprehended: from the sensors to the reconstruction, from the image analysis up to its interpretation. The second aspect describes the physical principles used for imaging (magnetic resonance, acoustic, optics, etc.). The last section shows how imaging is involved in therapeutic procedures and in particular the new physical therapies. All along this paper, the research perspectives are sketched.
