Neuroimaging biomarkers of epileptogenesis. Much progress has been made in the field studying the process of epileptogenesis via neuroimaging techniques. Conventional imaging methods include magnetic resonance imaging with morphometric analysis, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and positron emission tomography. Newer network-based methods such as diffusion tensor imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging with resting functional connectivity are being developed and applied to clinical use. This review provides a brief summary of the major human and animal studies in both partial and generalized epilepsies that demonstrate the potential of these imaging modalities to serve as biomarkers of epileptogenesis.
