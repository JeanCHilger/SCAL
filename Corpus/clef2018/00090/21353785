Thermomechanical properties of polymer nanolithography using atomic force microscopy. The temperature-dependent mechanical properties of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymers are investigated using force-distance curves, adhesion force, and atomic force microscope (AFM) nanolithography combined the heating techniques. The results show that the width of grooves on the polymers at 20-60 °C were in the range of 14-363 nm. The wear depth of the polymers increased with increasing heating temperature. A volume of 251.85-2422.66 μm(3) at a load of 30-50 nN with heating to 30-60 °C was removed, as compared to that of 26.60-70.30 μm(3) obtained at room temperature. The contact forces of PET started increasing at 9 nN, whereas the size of the holes was average at a pressure. The results may be of importance in explaining the heating relationship among adhesion force, volume removal rate, and pressure.
