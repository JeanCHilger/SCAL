Longitudinal studies of ischemic penumbra by using 18F-FDG PET and MRI techniques in permanent and transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats. At present, the goal of stroke research is the identification of a potential recoverable tissue surrounding the ischemic core, suggested as ischemic penumbra, with the aim of applying a treatment that attenuates the growth of this area. Our purpose was to determine whether a combination of imaging techniques, including (18)F-FDG PET and MRI could identify the penumbra area. Longitudinal studies of (18)F-FDG PET and MRI were performed in rats 3 h, 24 h and 48 h after the onset of ischemia. A transient and a permanent model of focal cerebral ischemia were performed. Regions of interest were located, covering the ischemic core, the border that progresses to infarction (recruited tissue), and the border that recovers (recoverable tissue) with early reperfusion. Analyses show that permanent ischemia produces severe damage, whereas the transient ischemia model does not produce clear damage in ADC maps at the earliest time studied. The only significant differences between values for recoverable tissue, (18)F-FDG (84±2%), ADC (108±5%) and PWI (70±8%), and recruited tissue, (18)F-FDG (77±3%), ADC (109±4%) and PWI (77±4%), are shown in (18)F-FDG ratios. We also show that recoverable tissue values are different from those in non-infarcted tissue. The combination of (18)F-FDG PET, ADC and PWI MRI is useful for identification of ischemic penumbra, with (18)F-FDG PET being the most sensitive approach to its study at early times after stroke, when a clear DWI deficit is not observed.
