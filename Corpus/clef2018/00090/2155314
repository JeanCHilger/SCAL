SPECT studies of brain tumors with L-3-[123I] iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine: comparison with PET, 124IMT and first clinical results. L-3-[123I]iodo-alpha-methyltyrosine (123IMT) like tyrosine has been reported previously to have a high affinity for a transport system in the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). We examined the kinetic behavior of 124IMT in brain and plasma in two patients with glioblastoma using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET). 124IMT accumulated in brain and tumor tissue, reaching a maximum after 15 min, with a washout of 20% to 35% at 60 min postinjection. Animal experiments confirmed the accumulation of the intact tracer in murine brain, but there was no incorporation into proteins. SPECT studies with 123IMT in patients with different types of brain tumors showed increased uptake in 26 of 32 tumors. Although nonspecific uptake in tumors must be considered, the accumulation of IMT in normal brain and in some tumors with intact BBB suggests a specific uptake of IMT. As transport is the main determinant of initial amino acid uptake, 123IMT appears to be a suitable SPECT tracer of amino acid uptake although it is not incorporated into protein.
