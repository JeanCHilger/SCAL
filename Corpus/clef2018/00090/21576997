Incremental diagnostic value and impact on patient management of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy with indium-111-pentetreotide in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. To evaluate the efficacy of somatostatin analog scintigraphy with indium-111-pentetreotide and its overall impact on management in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET).Twenty-two consecutive patients with a proven or clinically suspected GEP-NET with or without proven metastases were imaged at 24 and 48 h after injection of (111)In-pentetreotide. The scintigraphic findings were compared with results from conventional imaging methods. The final diagnosis was based on histopathological and surgical findings and complementary radiology.Somatostatin receptor-positive lesions were found in 20 of the patients, whereas conventional methods were positive in 18 patients. Additionally, 13 new tumor sites were discovered by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in 5 patients (liver: 6 chest: 2Our data reinforced that scintigraphy with (111)In-pentetreotide represents the imaging modality of choice in the initial evaluation of GEP-NET. It is highly accurate and can identify clinically unsuspected lesions and optimize the overall staging. It also guides optimal therapy choice and most importantly identifies patients with inoperable or metastatic disease who might be candidates for high-dose targeted therapy.
