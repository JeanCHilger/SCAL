An effective technique for the storage of short lived radioactive gaseous waste. An effective technique is described to deal with volatile, short lived radioactive waste generated as a result of the routinely produced positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). All radioactive gases and aerosols created during the synthesis are collected and stored safely in commercially available TEDLAR gas sampling bags. Once these collected PET by-products decay, the TEDLAR gas bags can be easily emptied and reused. This improved technique is effective, safe, reliable and economical.
