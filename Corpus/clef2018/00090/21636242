Modern PET imaging for paragangliomas: relation to genetic mutations. Paragangliomas (PGL) are neural crest-derived tumours that are found along the autonomic neural network throughout the body and can be multiple and/or metastatic. Nuclear medicine imaging in combination with conventional imaging is required to fully delineate the extent of the disease. The performance of molecular imaging modalities is widely dependent on tumour biology.In the present paper we discuss the recent publications focused on the role of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and the relationship between tracer uptake patterns and genetic mutations associated with the disease.Recent advances in genetic and molecular pathogenesis of PGL have allowed for the identification of new molecular diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals tailored to genetic abnormalities. However, the optimal diagnostic imaging algorithm remains to be determined.
