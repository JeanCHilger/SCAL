Chemotherapy only for localized Hodgkin lymphoma. Radiation therapy (RT) alone and more recently in combination with chemotherapy (combined modality therapy CMT) has been the cornerstone of curative treatment for early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) for over 40 years. Because of increasing awareness of the late morbidity and mortality associated with RT, recent treatment regimens have attempted to limit its use. Chemotherapy only has been demonstrated to be a treatment option for most patients with localized HL. Current clinical trials have targeted subgroups of such patients who may be at an increased risk of recurrence for the addition of limited RT to chemotherapy.
