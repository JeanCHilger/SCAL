Radiation exposure and risk-benefit analysis in cancer screening using FDG-PET: results of a Japanese nationwide survey. The aim of this study was to estimate radiation exposure and evaluate the risks and benefits of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in cancer screening.A nationwide survey of FDG-PET cancer screening was conducted in 2006, and the results were analyzed with a common index, "extension/shortening of the average life expectancy."The average estimated effective dose was 4.4 mSv (male 4.7 mSv female 4.0 mSv) for dedicated PET and 13.5 mSv (male 14.2 mSvFDG-PET cancer screening is beneficial for examinees above the break-even ages. The risks and benefits should be explained to examinees because of the larger radiation used in cancer FDG-PET screening compared with other X-ray tests.
