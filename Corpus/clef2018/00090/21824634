Occurrence of Bartonella henselae types I and II in Central Italian domestic cats. Serological and molecular surveys were conducted to determine the occurrence of Bartonella henselae in domestic cats in Central Italy. Samples from 234 pet cats were tested for B. henselae antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence with 78 (33.3%) positive. A PCR assay specific for the Bartonella 16S rRNA gene was carried out on DNA samples extracted from blood of the 234 cats 26 (11.1%) of the seropositive cats were positive. Two PCR protocols, which discriminate genotypes I and II of B. henselae, were performed on all DNA samples. Sixteen (6.8%) cats were infected by genotype I, 6 (2.5%) by genotype II, and two males (0.8%) by both genotypes. Two female (0.8%) cats which were Bartonella sp. PCR positive, gave negative results with the types I and II PCR. This protocol facilitates the direct and rapid detection of Bartonella DNA in feline blood samples, and differentiates B. henselae genotypes.
