Application of radiotherapy and chemotherapy protocols to pre-clinical tumor models. This unit (1) provides background into understanding how agents that target specific molecules or receptors (molecular-targeted agents), in particular, agents affecting the tumor vasculature (perivasculature network in tumors), interact with and modify radiation therapy (2) details factors affecting interpretation of results in murine tumor model experiments utilizing radiation therapy and drug combinations
