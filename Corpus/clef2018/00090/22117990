Clinical factors associated with sodium removal in peritoneal dialysis patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 156 clinically-stable peritoneal dialysis patients to identify the factors associated with sodium removal. Serum biochemistry, peritoneal function (modified peritoneal equilibration test [PET]) and the adequacy of dialysis were analysed in relation  to sodium removal using multivariate linear regression. Factors significantly affecting peritoneal sodium removal included infusion volume and ultrafiltration volume per 24 h, sodium dip in the first hour of PET and sodium difference between serum and fresh dialysate. Factors significantly  affecting total sodium removal included ultrafiltration and urine volume per 24 h, sodium dip in the first hour of PET and sodium difference between serum and fresh dialysate. With traditional dialysate, adequate fluid removal is required to ensure sufficient sodium removal, but a low-sodium  dialysate may prevent sodium retention. Sodium removal should be included in evaluation of the adequacy of dialysis.
