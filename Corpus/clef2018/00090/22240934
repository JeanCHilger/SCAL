Focal physiologic fluorodeoxyglucose activity in the gastrointestinal tract is located within the colonic lumen. Physiologic activity of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the intestinal tract occurs frequently in patients undergoing PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging, appearing most often in the colon. The purpose of this study is to determine the localization of the FDG within the colon. We hypothesize that intestinal FDG activity is intraluminal.In a prospective Institutional Review Board-approved and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study, patients with physiologic colonic FDG activity on PET/CT scans were enrolled to undergo repeat imaging 2 h after stimulation of colonic motility with a high-fat meal.We identified 13 patients who had focal FDG activity in their colon during a routine clinical PET/CT scan. After administration of a high-fat meal, 10 patients (77%) demonstrated antegrade movement of FDG along the colon, consistent with luminal clearance.Our results suggest that normal physiologic FDG activity within the large intestine, seen on PET/CT scans, is intraluminal.
