Test-retest stability of cerebral mGluR₅ quantification using [¹¹C]ABP688 and positron emission tomography in rats. This study evaluates the reproducibility of the quantification of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR₅) densities in rats using the PET radiotracer [¹¹C]ABP688 and pharmacokinetic models that are based on an input function, which is derived from a reference tissue. Seven rats underwent dynamic PET scans (60 min) after bolus injection of [¹¹C]ABP688. Kinetic analyses included: binding potential (BP(ND) ) determined by calculating (a) the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and (b) its two-steps simplified version (SRTM2) (c) multilinear reference tissue model (MRTM) and (d) its 2-parameter version (MRTM2)
