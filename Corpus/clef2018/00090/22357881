Critical review and state of the art in interventional oncology: benign and metastatic disease involving bone. Image-guided percutaneous ablation methods have proved effective for treatment of benign bone tumors and for palliation of metastases involving bone and soft-tissue sites beyond the liver and lung. Image-guided radiofrequency ablation is now the standard treatment for osteoid osteoma, as the procedure can be performed with higher rates of technical success, decreased morbidity, and lower cost than those obtained with open surgery. Several ablation methods have been used to effectively palliate focal painful metastatic disease involving bone and soft-tissue sites beyond the liver and lung. Substantial pain reduction is possible in patients who have failed to achieve benefit from conventional therapies, including chemotherapy and external-beam radiation. Importantly, the pain reduction that is achieved is durable over many months of observation.
