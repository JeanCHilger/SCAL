Enhanced myocardial fluorodeoxyglucose uptake following Adriamycin-based therapy: Evidence of early chemotherapeutic cardiotoxicity? To analyze changes in myocardial glucose metabolism using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) in patients treated with adriamycin and to investigate the clinical significance of these changes.Considering that FDG-PET scanning has the ability to show changes in glucose metabolism in the myocardium, we retrospectively analyzed the FDG-PET studies of 18 lymphoma patients treated with adriamycin-based chemotherapy in both the pre- and post-therapy setting. Cardiac contractile parameters such as left ventricular ejection fraction were not available for correlation in all patients due to the short duration and the level of cumulative dose administered in these patients during the time of the follow-up FDG-PET study. The change in myocardial glucose utilization was estimated by change in standard uptake values (SUV) in the myocardium.We observed a significant change in SUVmean values in the myocardium (defined as more than Â± 20% change in cardiac SUVmean between pre- and post-chemotherapy PET) in 12 patients, whereas 6 patients did not show any significant cardiac FDG uptake in both pre- and post-therapy PET scans. Patients were divided into three groups based on the changes observed in myocardial tracer uptake on the follow-up (18)F-FDG-PET study. Group A (n = 8): showed an increase in cardiac (18)F-FDG uptake in the post-therapy scan compared to the baseline scan carried out prior to starting adriamycin-based chemotherapy. Group B (n = 6): showed no significant cardiac (18)F-FDG uptake in post-therapy and baseline PET scans, and group C (n = 4): showed a fall in cardiac (18)F-FDG uptake in the post-therapy scan compared to the baseline scan. Mean cumulative adriamycin dose (in mg/m(2)) received during the time of the follow-up FDG-PET study was 256.25, 250 and 137.5, respectively.Our study shows three different trends in the change in myocardial glucose metabolism in patients undergoing adriamycin-based chemotherapy. A further prospective study with prolonged follow-up of ventricular function is warranted to explore the significance of enhanced FDG uptake as a marker of early identification of adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity.
