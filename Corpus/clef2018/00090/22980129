Normal blood glucose level and (18)F-FDG PET/CT. Patient preparation for FDG PET studies is perhaps more critical and more complex than for any other commonly performed imaging procedure. We report a patient with normal blood glucose level prior to the execution of a PET study in which FDG uptake was virtually zero in internal organs and was very extense in large muscle groups. The patient recognizes ingestion several minutes before the test. Ten days later, a repeated PET scan with normal blood glucose level, showed a normal organs distribution of FDG.
