Estimation of the reticuloendothelial function by positron emission computed tomography (PET) study in chronic liver disease. We have developed a new liver scanning agent (Ga-68 human serum albumin microspheres) in a convenient kit for use in positron emission computed tomography (PET). In this study, this scanning agent was evaluated for clinical usefulness as a function test for the reticuloendothelial system. A dose of 5 micrograms/kg (1-2 mCi) of Ga-68 microspheres was injected intravenously to 25 patients, 11 with chronic hepatitis and 14 with liver cirrhosis, and 5 normal volunteers for PET imaging of the liver and spleen using HEADTONE-III (SET 120W). The volumes of the liver and the spleen and the uptakes of Ga-68 microspheres were calculated as an index of the reticuloendothelial system function. In liver cirrhosis the liver volume estimated by PET was decreased and the spleen volume was increased. Both the liver uptake rate and differential absorption ratio (DAR) of the radioactivity were decreased corresponding with the degree of chronic liver disease. The spleen uptake rate was increased with progression of chronic liver diseases, but there was no difference in DAR between normal volunteers and patients with chronic liver disease. it was concluded that PET using Ga-68 microspheres is useful in the evaluation of the function of the reticuloendothelial system.
