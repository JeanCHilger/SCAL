Transplantation of human sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells into parkinsonian monkeys: no reversal of clinical symptoms. Cultured human fetal sympathetic ganglion explants or adrenal chromaffin cell aggregates were implanted into the left striatum of monkeys whose left nigrostriatal pathway had been lesioned with the neurotoxin MPTP. There was no clinical reversal of parkinsonian symptoms and PET scans did not show increased striatal fluorodopa uptake from pre-implant levels. At sacrifice, left striatal contents of dopamine were not statistically different from MPTP-treated but non-implanted controls. Histological examinations revealed pockets of extrinsic cells which were found at the end of needle tracks. There was no evidence of immune rejection. The extrinsic cells did not stain for tyrosine hydroxylase or neurofilament, suggesting that they were not dopaminergic neurons. The failure to reverse clinical parkinsonian symptoms highlights the stage of infancy of neural implantation in Parkinson's disease.
