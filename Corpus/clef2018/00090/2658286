Nutritional support of hospitalized patients. Effective nutritional support requires sound knowledge of both basic and clinical nutrition of dogs and cats as well as familiarity with products and delivery systems. Case management includes assessment of nutritional status and estimation of fuel sources. Most starved or stressed patients use fatty acids for over 70 per cent kcalME and protein for over 20 per cent kcalME. Approximate kcal needs are calculated from maintenance energy equations. Most patients respond best to enteral nutrition. Meat-based pet foods, liquid enteral products, and nutrient modules are offered in slurries or are tube-fed. Management includes careful monitoring of patients and gradual transitions to diets with more complex nutrient sources.
