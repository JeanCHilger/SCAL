Clinical and environmental isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans in Bangkok (Thailand). Cryptococcus neoformans was isolated from 13 patients (7 females and 6 males) suffering from systemic cryptococcosis. Eight patients were suffering from central nervous system cryptococcosis and 5 were suffering from disseminated cryptococcosis. Systemic lupus erythematosus was found to be the common underlying disease in 3 patients. The results of treatment depended on the underlying diseases (7 improved, 6 died). Also, 13 isolates of C. neoformans were obtained from feces of 30 pet birds. All 26 isolates of C. neoformans were cultured in glycine cycloheximide medium and were found to be of serotypes A and D.
