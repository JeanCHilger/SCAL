Technical introduction to nuclear imaging. It is very important to pay attention to technical detail when acquiring nuclear scans of the heart. It must be remembered that not only is the heart a three dimensional structure, which imposes its own limitations on the interpretation of information represented as two dimensional images, but the organ also moves which will in turn degrade static images. Dynamic studies of left ventricular function must be able to resolve the rapidly changing events of the cardiac cycle which makes specific technical demands upon the imaging equipment and computer system used. In spite of these potential drawbacks, both static and dynamic imaging of the heart using radiopharmaceuticals are widely used in a clinical and research environment. In this article some of the technical considerations will be covered as they apply to both the commonly used clinical applications of nuclear cardiology and some of the newer but potentially exciting techniques will also be covered briefly.
