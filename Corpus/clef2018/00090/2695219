Whole heart distribution of myocardial perfusion, metabolism and myocardial viability by positron emission tomography. The three dimensional evaluation of regional myocardial perfusion and metabolism of the whole left ventricular wall is now possible using the new generation of Positron Emission Tomography scanners (PET). We have used whole heart PET to study the metabolic consequences of transient myocardial ischaemia distal to critical coronary obstructions and to assess the viability of non contractile myocardium. At present whole heart PET should be considered a sophisticated technique for clinical research but its remarkable potential and further possible technical advances suggest its diagnostic application could be considered in the future, if justified on a cost benefit basis.
