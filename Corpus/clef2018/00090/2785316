Quantification of the myocardial scar with technetium-99m-isonitrile (MIBI) in emission computerized tomography (SPECT)--comparison with serial creatine kinase determinations and radionuclide ventriculography. Estimation of the size of myocardial infarction is of major interest for clinical patient management and a simple and reliable method is still searched for. In this study the potential of the new myocardial perfusion tracer, Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) methoxy-isobutyl-isonitril (MIBI) combined with emission computertomography (SPECT), is tested vs. the standard procedures of serial plasma creatine kinase (CK) measurements and radionuclide ventriculography (RNV). In 10 patients with first myocardial infarction, integral values for CK were obtained during the acute phase. Following three weeks of uncomplicated recovery the patient was referred for both types of myocardial imaging within four days. 370 MBq Tc-99m-MIBI were injected with the patient supine and at rest. One hour later SPECT acquisition commenced. The reconstructed slices were rearranged to long and short axes slices, which served to calculate a functional "scar image" in polar coordinates. The color-coded areas of significantly reduced tracer uptake were expressed in percent of the total myocardial area. RNV was performed with the patient supine and at rest, the left anterior oblique angle being optimized for septum visualization. Infarct localizations were antero-apical (three), anterolateral (two), postero-lateral (one), and posterior (four).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
