Iodine-131 meta-iodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) for the localization of suspected phaeochromocytoma. Forty-five 131I-MIBG scintigrams were performed in 42 patients with suspected phaeochromocytoma. Two patients were infants and the remainder were adults. A sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 88.2% were achieved, leading to an accuracy of 86.7%. The positive predictive value was 69.2% and the negative predictive value was 93.7%.
