Effect of excess endogenous androgens on bone density in young women. To determine whether endogenous androgens influence bone density in young women, we studied 27 normal women and 19 women with androgen excess, as defined by increased serum bioavailable testosterone (bio T) concentrations. The women ranged from 21-48 yr of age. The 2 groups were comparable with respect to age, anthropomorphic measures, nutrition, gynecological history, and serum cortisol and estradiol levels. Trabecular (lumbar) and cortical (radial) bone density were quantitated by computerized tomography and single photon absorptiometry, respectively. Serum obtained during the follicular phase of the cycle was assayed for bio T, total T, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione (Adione), and 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide (3-Adiol-G). Trabecular bone density was significantly higher in the androgen excess group [172 +/- 7 (+/- SE) vs. 153 +/- 5 mg/mL P = 0.03]
