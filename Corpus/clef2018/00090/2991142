Radiosynthesis of an opiate receptor binding radiotracer: [11C]carfentanil. Carfentanil, a potent opiate receptor agonist, was labeled with 11C for in vivo studies using positron emission tomography. This synthesis was completed in approximately 30 min using iodomethane as the 11C precursor. The synthesis, purification, characterization, and determination of specific activity are presented and discussed.
