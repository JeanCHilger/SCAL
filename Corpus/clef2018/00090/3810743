The effect of ergotamine and dihydroergotamine on cerebral blood flow in man. The effects of ergotamine and dihydroergotamine on cerebral blood flow was investigated 4 hours after i.v. injection as these drugs might be of importance for migraine treatment. Eight normal male volunteers (not suffering from migraine) received 0.5 mg ergotamine and 1 mg dihydroergotamine i.v. Cerebral blood flow was measured by the xenon-133 inhalation method and single-photon-emission computerized tomography before and after intravenous acetazolamide administration (1 g). Cerebral blood flow was measured before and 4 hours after ergotamine and dihydroergotamine administration. Strain-gauge measurements of toe-arm systolic gradients were used to monitor the effect of the drug on leg arteries. Mean hemispheric and regional cerebral blood flow was unchanged after either drug (mean +/- SEM, ml/100 g/min): for ergotamine, 57 +/- 3 before and 57 +/- 3 at 4 hours for dihydroergotamine, 54 +/- 2 before and 55 +/- 2 at 4 hours. The acetazolamide response was unchanged as well. Only ergotamine decreased the toe-arm systolic gradient significantly (22 mm Hg at maximum after 240 minutes
