Quantitative measurement of myocardial blood flow with oxygen-15 water and positron computed tomography: an assessment of potential and problems. An in vivo measurement technique using 15O water and positron CT for quantitation of myocardial blood flow (MBF) was investigated. A closed-chest dog model and NeuroECAT scanner were used in the study. The in vivo technique involves i.v. infusion of 15O water for a duration of 2-3 min. Oxygen-15 water radioactivity in myocardium was imaged with a NeuroECAT scanner for 10 min, starting at the time of tracer infusion. A separate scan following inhalation of 15O CO was obtained to label the blood pool and to help remove the contribution of radioactivity in the blood pool during the 15O water scans. The integrated projection technique was used for calculating MBF. The quantitative microsphere technique for measurement of MBF was performed along with the 15O water study to provide reference values, with which the MBF values by the in vivo technique was compared. Results of 12 experimental runs (in seven animals) show the in vivo technique with 15O water and positron CT can give quantitative flow images of myocardium. The in vivo positron CT measurement was found to correlate well (r = 0.93) with the in vitro values (by microspheres) over the flow range of 40 to 150 ml/min/100 g.
