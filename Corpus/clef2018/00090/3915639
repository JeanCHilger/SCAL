New CT-guided stereotactic apparatus and clinical experience with intracerebral hematomas. The conventional Sugita stereotactic frame has been improved to perform CT-guided stereotactic surgery both in the CT and operating rooms. The development of our instrument and the software of the scanners' computer are presented. Newly designed equipment produced almost no artifacts on the CT image. Using the improved stereotactic frame, we have operated upon 44 intracerebral hematomas in the CT room. More than 80% of the cases had satisfactory results. Two complications were encountered, and 1 patient died from pneumonia. Our initial experience of the pre- and postoperative cerebral blood flow measurement with 133Xe inhalation method and single photon emission CT is described.
