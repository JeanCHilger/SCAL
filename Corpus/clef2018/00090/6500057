Phosphorylethanolamine--the major constituent of the phosphomonoester peak observed by 31P-NMR on developing dog brain. 31P-NMR spectra of newborn dog brains exhibit a prominent phosphomonoester (PME) peak (6.78 +/- SD 0.05 ppm from phosphocreatine peak), similar to those of human neonates. Studies were undertaken to identify the chemical constituents of this peak. Brains of puppies were funnel frozen for methanol-HCl-perchloric acid extraction after in vivo 31P-NMR spectra were taken. The pK of the major component of the PME region in the NMR spectrum of extract was 5.4, corresponding to that of phosphorylethanolamine (PEt). Addition of PEt increased the major peak on the PME region over a wide range of pH, while addition of phosphorylcholine or ribose 5-phosphate yielded distinct peaks. We suggest that the major constituent of phosphomonoester peak of 31P-NMR spectra of newborn dog brain is phosphorylethanolamine. Biochemical mechanisms relevant to changes of phosphorylethanolamine during brain development are discussed.
