The ramp injection of radiotracers for blood flow measurement by emission tomography. A prototype instrument based on the coincidence detection of annihilation radiation was built to control the arterial concentration of a radionuclide as a uniformly increasing ramp function over a preset injection interval (ranging from 1.6 min to 13.6 h). The device was designed to accommodate radionuclides of different physical and biological half-life, and the physiological characteristics of the system being studied. A kinetic model based on the Kety-Schmidt integral was developed to permit the determination of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Both the kinetic model and the ramp injector were tested in cats studied with the PETT III positron emission tomograph and 4-(18F)-fluoroantipyrine as the CBF tracer. The ratio lambda/f of the brain-to-blood partition coefficient (lambda) and blood flow (f) were determined simultaneously by serial measurements with positron emission tomography.
