Synthesis of no-carrier-added fluorine- 18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. A new synthetic procedure for the preparation of fluorine- 18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose has been developed. This procedure offers the advantages of flexibility in the source of the fluorine- 18, high yields, and short synthesis times. The procedure works at the no-carrier-added level and gives a product of very high specific activity.
