Quantification of myocardial infarction by computer-assisted positron emission tomography. The accuracy of three-dimensional transverse section positron emission imaging for quantification of myocardial infarction size was validated and compared with the accuracy of two dimensional planar positron imaging. After induction of acute anterior myocardial infarction in anaesthetised dogs, gallium-68 albumin microspheres were injected into the left atrium. Planar and transverse section images of the thorax were obtained with a multicrystal positron camera. After staining with tetrazolium tetrachloride injected intravenously, the hearts were excised, sectioned manually, and planar imaging repeated. Each myocardial infarction was clearly delineated by transverse section imaging with high contrast ratios (mean 0.68 +/- 0.02 SEM) planar imaging identified seven of nine infarcts but with lower contrast ratios (0.24 +/- 0.04
