Pregnancy associated alpha-glycoprotein (SP-III) in Nigerian pregnant women. Pregnancy associated protein (SP-III) was measured by rocket electroimmunoassay in the sera of Nigerian women with normal and abnormal singleton pregnancy. A tendency to increases of SP-III levels with advancing gestational age was observed. SP-III may contribute to immunosuppression in preventing anti-allograft responsiveness and levels may also reflect the effect of infections since SP-III is also leucocyte derived. Values in PET and anaemia in pregnancy were similar to values in normal pregnant women.
