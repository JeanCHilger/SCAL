Functional magnetic resonance tomography of the visual cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows to directly visualize regional activity of the visual cortex during stimulation. The value of the method to evaluate physiologic and pathologic conditions is elaborated on in comparison with positron emission tomography (PET). Aspects as sequence selection and stimulus paradigms are discussed. Subtle activity in the primary cortex (V1), processing areas as MT/V5 and subcortical areas are visualized by MRI. Cooperation of the subjects is a essential factor. Despite promising initial results in clinical trials the focus of research in clinical trials the focus of research in the visual cortex yet remains in the preclinical field.
