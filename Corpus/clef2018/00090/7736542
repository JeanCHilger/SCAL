Immunotargeting of urothelial cell carcinoma with intravesically administered Tc-99m labeled HMFG1 monoclonal antibody. Ten patients with transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder received 3-6 mCi of HMFG1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) intravesically. The antibody was labeled with Tc-99m using the 2-Iminothiolane method. All patients underwent transurethral resection of the bladder tumor within 12-20 h following intravesical administration of 99m-Tc-HMFG1. The presence of the radiolabeled MAb in the circulation was studied by measuring the radioactivity in the serum for a period up to 20 h. Three of 10 patients underwent immunoscintigraphy (SPECT) 2-3 h postadministration and cancerous areas could be easily localized. Biopsies were taken from the tumor sites as well as from normal bladder mucosa. Absolute uptake of the administered MAb expressed as percent administered dose/kg of tissue could be evaluated only in eight patients. Multiple specimen taken from various tumor sites in every patient gave a wide range of uptake values ranging from 0 to 9.29% adm. dose/kg, whereas normal tissue uptake values ranged from 0 to 1.63, respectively.
