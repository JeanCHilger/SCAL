Application of technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime single-photon emission tomography to neurologic prognosis in patients undergoing urgent carotid surgery. In this study we aimed to work out a quantitative prognostic index for preoperative assessment of brain technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) single-photon emission tomography (SPET) in patients referred for urgent carotid endarterectomy due to acute obstructive disease of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and neurological deficit. To this end we compared data from preoperative SPET studies with the postinterventional changes in neurological status in 20 patients (17 males, three females mean age 53 years, SD 4 years) with acute ischaemic cerebral disorders induced by obstruction of the ICA. Carotid obstruction was diagnosed by ultrasound B-mode study. All patients underwent urgent carotid endarterectomy from the ICA. Patients were divided into two groups in accordance with the results of postoperative follow-up: group A comprised patients with significant (more than 3 points) postoperative improvement in neurological condition as quantified by the Canadian Neurological Scale (11 patients)
