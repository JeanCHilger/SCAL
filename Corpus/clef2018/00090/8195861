Treatment of metastatic prostate carcinoma with radiolabeled antibody CC49. A Phase II trial of 75 mCi/m2 131I-anti-TAG-72 high-affinity antibody CC49 was studied in 15 patients with hormone-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.Patients had adequate renal, liver and hematopoietic function. No previous cytotoxic chemotherapy was allowed and previous radiation was limited to 20% of the active bone marrow.No acute adverse reactions occurred, but all patients had evidence of an immune response to CC49 by 4 wk. Six of 10 symptomatic patients had bone pain relief, but no patients met the radiographic or PSA criteria for objective response. Positive imaging of bone and/or soft-tissue lesions was noted for 13 of the 15 patients.CC49 had a high frequency of tumor localization with evidence of anti-tumor effects (pain relief).
