The role of single photon emission computed tomography brain imaging with 99mTc-bicisate in the localization and definition of mechanism of ischemic stroke. 99mTc-bicisate (99mTc-ECD) is a new brain perfusion imaging agent formulated from a radiochemically stable kit (Neurolite). A multicenter trial was conducted to determine the sensitivity and specificity of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging with 99mTc-bicisate in the localization of ischemic stroke 170 subjects were enrolled, 128 patients with stroke and 42 controls. Imaging results from 148 subjects (107 stroke patients and 41 controls) were considered evaluable. In the evaluable subjects, SPECT brain imaging with 99mTc-bicisate (21.0 +/- 2.5 mCi) was interpreted without clinical information and was compared with a final assessment using all clinical, diagnostic, and laboratory procedures except the 99mTc-bicisate SPECT results. 99mTc-bicisate was safe and well-tolerated. SPECT imaging with 99mTc-bicisate demonstrated a specificity of 98% and a sensitivity of 86% for localization of strokes (kappa, 0.75
