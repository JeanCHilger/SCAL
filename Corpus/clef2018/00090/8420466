Evaluation of brain collateral circulation by the transcranial color Doppler-guided Matas' test. For the determination of the indication for reconstruction of the carotid artery in patients with head and neck cancer, a color Doppler-guided Matas' test was performed to examine brain collateral circulation and blood flow of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA). Both SSA-270A convex (3.75 MHz) and linear (3.75 MHz and 2.5 MHz) array probes (Toshiba Co, Ltd) were used for this investigation. A temporary occlusion test (60 seconds) by digital pressure on the common carotid artery was performed on 30 patients with head and neck cancer. The results were classified into four groups according to the relative flow volume (percent blood flow volume before the test) of the MCA: group A, with a flow volume of 87% or more group B, with a flow volume between 72% and 86%
