Selective increase in the right hemisphere transcranial Doppler velocity during a spatial task. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography of the middle cerebral arteries was performed during two tasks: sorting of mah-jongg tiles and vibratory stimulation. These tasks selectively increase cerebral blood flow by positron emission tomography. The purpose of this study was to determine if analogous increases in cerebral blood flow velocity could be detected. We measured flow velocity during right hand manipulation followed by left hand manipulation, or vice versa, with resting studies in between. The average increase in the mean velocity, by paired t-test, was significant for the right middle cerebral artery with both left hand (p < .0005) and right hand (p < .005) tile sorting. For the left middle cerebral artery, there was an increase in the mean velocity with right hand (p < .005) but not for left hand sorting (p = .13). These findings support the importance of the right hemisphere in the performance of this type of spatial task. No significant flow velocity increase occurred during vibratory stimulation.
