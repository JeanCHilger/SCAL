Novel techniques of coronary artery imaging. Intravascular ultrasound imaging and intracoronary Doppler flow mapping are two new techniques used to diagnose coronary artery disease. One provides detailed information about coronary morphology the other assesses coronary function. By combining these two techniques, mechanisms of coronary syndromes that were previously unclear can be elucidated. The preliminary use of electron beam computed tomography in scanning of the coronary arteries has demonstrated the potential to identify severe coronary artery disease noninvasively. Coronary arteries can be imaged by intravenous injection of contrast material. Magnetic resonance imaging and positron-emission tomography are also used for the noninvasive visualization coronary arteries. Both techniques have been tested after interventions, which offers the potential to study myocardial function and perfusion.
