The functional anatomy of remembered saccades: a PET study. Studies of patients with damage to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the basal ganglia have shown that these areas are involved in the control of remembered saccades. However, although positron emission tomography (PET) studies of remembered saccades have demonstrated extensive cortical and subcortical activation, they have failed to detect any significant increase in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in these areas. This study was designed to see if these areas could be activated. Eight right-handed male volunteers were studied using H2(15)O PET. Comparison of the rCBF in the remembered saccade task to a rest control state revealed significant activation in both the DLPFC and the basal ganglia, and also the frontal eye fields, the supplementary motor area, the posterior parietal lobe, the cingulate cortex, the striate cortex, the extrastriate cortex and the superior temporal lobe. These findings confirm that remembered saccades are controlled by an extensive cortical and subcortical network, which includes the DLPFC and the basal ganglia.
