Avian companionship in alleviation of depression, loneliness, and low morale of older adults in skilled rehabilitation units. To assess effects of a companion bird on the depression, morale, and loneliness of 40 older adults in a skilled rehabilitation unit, self-reported measures of depression, loneliness, and morale were completed on admission and 10 days later. With the presence of a companion bird the experimental group (n = 20) showed a significant decrease in depression but none in morale or loneliness from the control group (n = 20) who were without a bird. Use of a companion bird may lessen negative effects of change of residence for older adults.
