Encoding words and pictures: a positron emission tomography study. Subjects viewed words, pictures, crosshairs, or a large X flanked by two smaller xs on either side while their brain activity was monitored using positron emission tomography (PET). When activation from the pictures, crosshairs, or Xs condition was subtracted from activation in the words condition, the left angular gyrus and Broca's area were found to be activated. In the comparison of words and pictures, additional language areas were activated. These results provide support for the classical neurological model of reading. The results also suggest that a "word form area" is near the margin of the left angular gyrus.
