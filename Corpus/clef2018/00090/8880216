Generation and application of monoclonal antibody to human pancreatic carcinoma. An IgG1 mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) YPC3 against human pancreatic carcinoma was generated by a hybridoma technique. When human tissue sections were examined with immunohistochemical staining, YPC3 MAb reacted with 28 of 32 (87.5%) cases of pancreatic carcinoma tissue it failed to react with all 11 cases of normal pancreas examined. When 99mTC-radiolabeled YPC3 MAb was administrated intravenously to the nude mice bearing xenograft of pancreatic carcinoma, clear scintigraphic visualization of tumor xenograft was found with SPECT 24 h after injection. Administration of either YPC3 MAb or LAK cells combined with YPC3 MAb could inhibit the growth of the xenografts in nude mice. These results suggest that YPC3 MAb might be an ideal carrier for radioimmunolocalization and immunotherapy of human pancreatic carcinoma.
