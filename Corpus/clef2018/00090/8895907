A voxel-by-voxel multivariate analysis of cerebral perfusion defects in divers with 'bends'. Past analysis of dysbaric-induced cerebral perfusion defects, demonstrated by 99Tcm-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99Tcm-HMPAO) single photon emission tomography in divers using quantitative and/or univariate techniques, has resulted i considerable controversy regarding the significance of these lesions compared to those seen in control subjects, correlations with clinical findings and the role of 99Tcm-HMPAO as a prognostic indicator in decompression sickness. We tried to address these problems by using a multivariate approach to a voxel-by-voxel analysis, involving the use of principal components, to determine ranges of normality in 50 reference controls. In subsequent images, abnormality was defined as 10 spatially connected voxels at an appropriate significance level of three standard deviations. The images of 50 divers with clinically diagnosed 'bends' were compared with those of a further 40 normal population controls with no previous history of loss of consciousness, head injury or dysbarism. The results showed that 19 of 50 divers with 'bends' and 3 of 40 population controls had significant perfusion defects, representing a significant difference between divers with dysbarism and population controls at the level P < 0.002. It is concluded that dysbarism causes significant cerebral cortical perfusion defects in affected divers both in 'silent' and symptomatic (clinically correlated) areas.
