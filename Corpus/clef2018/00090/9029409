Lack of permanent nigrostriatal dopamine deficit following 6-hydroxydopamine injection into the rat striatum. Short communication. The lesion caused by a single 6-hydroxydopamine injection into rat striatum was evaluated. In vivo positron emission tomography using a dopamine reuptake tracer revealed no consistent reduction in striatal dopamine transporter. Amphetamine rotation test was negative up to 18 weeks. A 21% reduction in striatal dopamine seen at 11 weeks was not detectable at 18 weeks. Tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurone counts showed no decline in substantia nigra. Our results suggest that this lesion may be subject to compensation and therefore should be used with caution in studies on neuroprotective treatments of Parkinson' disease.
