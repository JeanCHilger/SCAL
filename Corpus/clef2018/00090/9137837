High-level expression of cecropin CMIV in E. coli from a fusion construct containing the human tumor necrosis factor. Cecropin CMIV gene was fused to the 3'-terminus of the mutated tumor necrosis factor (TNFb) gene and the fusion gene was directly under the control of an inducible T7 promoter in pET-11d. This fusion gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli with an expression level of approximate 40%-50% of total cellular proteins, and was produced mainly in the form of inclusion body. Peptide with antibacterial activity was obtained by cleaving the fusion protein with CNBr.
