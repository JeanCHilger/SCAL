Basic principles and neurosurgical applications of positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a technique for studying functional processes in the human body in vivo. The important clinical applications of PET in neurosurgery include localization of epileptic foci, diagnosis of brain tumors, preoperative brain mapping, and the study of plasticity of the brain following brain damage. The basic physics and neurosurgical applications of PET are presented.
