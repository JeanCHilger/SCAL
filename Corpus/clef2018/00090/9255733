Immunolocalization of the pseudorabies virus immediate-early protein IE180 by immunoperoxidase staining. The immediate-early (1E) gene of pseudorabies virus (PRV) expresses immediately upon infection, a phosphorylated protein (immediate-early protein, IE180) that can transactivate viral other genes and plays an essential role in regulating viral gene expression. In order to detect and localize IE180 in infected cells early on, this gene was cloned for overexpression, and the expressed products were applied to generate specific antibodies against IE180 protein. Two recombinant expression plasmids pN and pNB were constructed by cloning the IE gene onto pET 30a(+) expression vector via NcoI and BamHI sites. Plasmid pN contains the 1.8-kb NcoI-NcoI fragment of IE gene coding for the N-terminus of 616 amino acid residues, while pNB contains the 2.8-kb NcoI-Bam HI fragment coding for the rest of the IE180 protein. Both pN and pNB were transformed, respectively, into E. coli cells and produced large amounts of IE protein products during induction with 1 mM IPTG. The expressed IE proteins for pN and pNB were 60 kDa and 100 kDa in size, respectively. These expression products were purified and then used as antigens to immunize mice for preparing specific antibodies against PRV IE180 protein. The specificities of the mice immune sera were confirmed by their abilities to react with IE180 protein present in the PRV infected cells in the Western immunoblotting assay. Furthermore, immunoperoxidase staining of PRV infected cells undertaken with these antisera revealed the subcellular distribution of the IE proteins in the infected cells and also demonstrated their transportation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during infection.
