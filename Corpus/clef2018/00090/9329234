Migrainous syndrome with CSF pleocytosis. SPECT findings. Brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) findings are described in four adult patients with the transient syndrome of headache with neurological deficits and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis. Focal deficits consisted of right-sided hemisensory changes with or without motor dysphasia or dysarthric speech (n = 4) and confusional episodes (n = 1). All patients had a CSF pleocytosis (with a mean of 309 cells/mm3 on the first spinal tap range 75 to 590) and an elevated total protein (mean 130.5 mg/dL
