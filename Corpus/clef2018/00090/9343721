A prospective comparison of high-resolution planar, pinhole, and triple-detector SPECT for the detection of renal cortical defects. To compare the detection rate of renal cortical defects with Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) using triple-detector SPECT, pinhole, and planar cortical scintigraphy, the authors prospectively studied 80 kidneys in 40 patients (26 males, 14 females) who ranged in age from 3 months to 26 years (mean: 7.5 years). They found single or multiple definite defects in 30 kidneys using SPECT, 23 using pinhole imaging, and 17 using planar imaging (McNemar's test, two-tailed, P < 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively). SPECT was significantly better than pinhole imaging at demonstrating definite defects (P = 0.008). This study indicates that SPECT, and to a lesser extent pinhole, are superior to planar imaging for conclusively demonstrating renal cortical defects.
