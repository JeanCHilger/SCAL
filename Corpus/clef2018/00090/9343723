Radionuclide imaging in emphysema after lung volume reduction surgery. Three dimensional (3D) surface displays of dynamic Xe-133 and Tc-99m MAA SPECT were performed to evaluate regional lung function in two patients with pulmonary emphysema before and after thoracoscopic lung volume reduction surgery. The 3D displays were reconstructed using a color-illuminated, surface-rendering technique. For the Xe-133 studies, a fusion display of 3D equilibrium (EQ) and 3-minute washout (WO) images was used to show the distribution of Xe-133 retention, which were transparently seen within the entire lung contours delineated by the EQ image. In both patients, these 3D displays allowed an overview of the localized poorly functioning lungs with Xe-133 retention or reduced perfusion with geometric realism. The location and extent were more easily comprehended on the displays compared to the slice-by-slice presentations of tomograms. Postoperatively, the displays efficiently revealed restored function in the remaining lungs. The 3D surface displays of the two SPECT procedures providing topographic information of regional lung function appears to contribute to the treatment strategy of this surgery.
