A survey of aquarium fishes, their foods, and environmental water for salmonellae. The presence of salmonellae in the pet shop environment, fishes, aquarium water, and in a variety of commercially prepared and natural fish foods was determined. Salmonellosis attributed to turtles purchased from pet shops has been responsible for an estimated 280,000 human cases annually in the United States. The possibility that aquarium fishes, or their food and aquatic habitat might also serve as sources of human salmonellosis was deemed worthy of clarification. Results of the present survey indicate that this is probably not correct, and a public health hazarddoes not exist.
