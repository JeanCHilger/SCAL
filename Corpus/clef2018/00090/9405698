Vascular imprints of neuronal activity: relationships between the dynamics of cortical blood flow, oxygenation, and volume changes following sensory stimulation. Modern functional neuroimaging methods, such as positron-emission tomography (PET), optical imaging of intrinsic signals, and functional MRI (fMRI) utilize activity-dependent hemodynamic changes to obtain indirect maps of the evoked electrical activity in the brain. Whereas PET and flow-sensitive MRI map cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes, optical imaging and blood oxygenation level-dependent MRI map areas with changes in the concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR). However, the relationship between CBF and HbR during functional activation has never been tested experimentally. Therefore, we investigated this relationship by using imaging spectroscopy and laser-Doppler flowmetry techniques, simultaneously, in the visual cortex of anesthetized cats during sensory stimulation. We found that the earliest microcirculatory change was indeed an increase in HbR, whereas the CBF increase lagged by more than a second after the increase in HbR. The increased HbR was accompanied by a simultaneous increase in total hemoglobin concentration (Hbt), presumably reflecting an early blood volume increase. We found that the CBF changes lagged after Hbt changes by 1 to 2 sec throughout the response. These results support the notion of active neurovascular regulation of blood volume in the capillary bed and the existence of a delayed, passive process of capillary filling.
