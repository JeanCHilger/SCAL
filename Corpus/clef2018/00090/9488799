Transient global amnesia is an alarming but benign disorder of middle age, which prevents both the formation of new memories, and the retrieval of recently formed ones, for some hours. Research over the last 10 years has shed light on the epidemiology, neuropsychology, functional anatomy and differential diagnosis of this distinctive condition, and clarified its management.
