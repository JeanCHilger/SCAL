Kinetic analysis of glucose metabolism by FDG-PET versus proliferation index of Ki-67 in meningiomas--comparison with gliomas. I compared glucose metabolism by 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose (FDG)-PET with proliferative potentials determined by using Ki-67 in meningiomas and gliomas. Ki-67 labeling index (LI) as proliferation index was used to assess tumor aggressiveness. In FDG-PET, I measured tumor versus contralateral gray matter ratio (T/N), standardized uptake value (SUV), kinetic rate constants (k1, k2, k3) which were analyzed according to the three compartment FDG model, and kinetic cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (kCMRGl). Significantly elevated FDG uptake in T/N, kCMRGl was found in a high Ki-67 LI (above 2%) group compared to a low Ki-67 LI group in gliomas, but there was not found significant difference between these two groups in meningiomas. Tumor k3 value, an indicator of hexokinase activity, of a high Ki-67 LI group was significantly higher than that of a low Ki-67 LI group. It was found that k3 correlated with Ki-67 LI. The k3 value is useful for estimating the biological aggressiveness of meningiomas.
