Chemoreflex thresholds to CO2 in decerebrate cats. We used a modified rebreathing technique to measure chemoreflex thresholds to CO2 in decerebrate, paralyzed and ventilated cats. Cats were hyperventilated to neural apnea (PaCO2 < 15 mmHg) with one ventilator and then switched to a rebreathing circuit consisting of a balloon inside a bottle connected to a second ventilator. The volume of the circuit was approximately 110 ml. The balloon contained 5% CO2:95% O2 for hyperoxic rebreathing or approximately 5% CO2 with 11 or 6.5% O2 for moderately and severely hypoxic rebreathing. A plateau in CO2 concentration at the onset of rebreathing indicated equilibration of CO2 between the circuit, alveolar gas and venous and arterial blood. After rapid equilibration of CO2 between the cat and the circuit, CO2 increased linearly with time during rebreathing. Under hyperoxic conditions, phrenic activity began to increase at an end-tidal P(CO2) (PET(CO2)) of 35.1 +/- 6.1 (SD) mmHg (n = 8) during hypoxia, phrenic activity began to increase at a significantly lower PET(CO2) of 27.8 +/- 4.8 mmHg (P < 0.01, n = 6). We interpret these values as the central and peripheral chemoreflex thresholds to CO2, respectively. Persistent phrenic activity prevented determination of a threshold during severe hypoxic rebreathing. Our modified method of hyperoxic and hypoxic rebreathing allows detection of the effects of hypoxia on the central and peripheral chemoreflex thresholds and, within a cat, measurements of chemoreflex sensitivities.
