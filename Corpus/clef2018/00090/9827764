Brain activation during micturition in women. Experiments in the cat have led to a concept of how the CNS controls micturition. In a previous study this concept was tested in a PET study in male volunteers. It was demonstrated that specific brainstem and forebrain areas are activated during micturition. It was unfortunate that this study did not involve women, because such results are important for understanding urge incontinence, which occurs more frequently in women than in men. Therefore, a similar study was done in 18 right-handed women, who were scanned during the following four conditions: (i) 15 min prior to micturition (urine withholding) (ii) during micturition
