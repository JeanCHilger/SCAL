Influence of speech-coding strategy on cortical activity in cochlear implant users: a positron emission tomographic study. The effects of a speech-coding strategy of cochlear implant (CI) on cortical activity were evaluated using positron emission tomography. The CIs used in the present study were those of a 22-channel system using the Multipeak speech-coding strategy (MPEAK) and the spectral peak strategy (SPEAK). On comparing the 2 groups, it was found that the speech-tracking performance was significantly higher in the SPEAK group than in the MPEAK group. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured during the silent resting, noise stimulus and speech stimulus periods. The increase in rCBF was localized mainly in the primary auditory area during the noise stimulus period. The increase in rCBF in the auditory association area during the speech stimulus period was stronger in the SPEAK group than in the MPEAK group. This finding suggests that the SPEAK strategy activates more speech processing neuronal networks in the auditory association area than the MPEAK strategy.
