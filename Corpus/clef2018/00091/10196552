Functional anatomy of saccadic adaptation in humans. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to investigate the neurophysiological substrate of human saccadic adaptation. Subjects made saccadic eye movements toward a visual target that was displaced during the course of the initial saccade, a time when visual perception is suppressed. In one condition, displacement was random from trial to trial, precluding any systematic modification of the initial saccade amplitude. In the second condition, the direction and magnitude of displacement were consistent, causing adaptative modification of the initial saccade amplitude. PET difference images reflecting metabolic changes attributable to the process of saccadic adaptation showed selective activation of the medioposterior cerebellar cortex. This localization is consistent with neurophysiological findings in monkeys and brain-lesioned humans.
