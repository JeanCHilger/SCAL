I-131-Lipiodol therapy in liver neoplasms. Twelve patients with liver neoplasms [10 HCC, 1 CCC, 1 multiple breast cancer metastases (BCM)] were treated by transarterial I-131-Lipiodol. Computed tomography (CT) and single photon emission CT (SPECT) showed pronounced I-131-Lipiodol accumulation in the tumor tissue in all cases. In three patients with HCC a reduction of tumor size was achieved after the first treatment. The remaining patients had big tumor masses 5 of these (4 HCC, 1 CCC) had stable disease after the first treatment, and 2 HCC were progressive. One patient died immediately after therapy due to other reasons. The BCM proved significant reduction in number and size. Eighteen-FDG-PET (positron emission tomography with fluor-18-deoxy-glucose) and CT controls showed in part different results with pretherapeutic PET proving high interindividual variability in tumor activity. Side effects were tolerable. In summary, the therapy procedure with transarterial I-131-Lipiodol is safe and effective in tumors with moderate tumor mass.
