Clinical effects of air cleaners in homes of asthmatic children sensitized to pet allergens. Exposure to cat and dog allergens is very common in the Western World and is a serious cause of asthma in sensitized subjects.We sought to study the clinical effects of air cleaners in living rooms and bedrooms of asthmatic children sensitized to cat or dog allergens.Twenty asthmatic children sensitized to pet allergens (cat/dog) and with an animal at home participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in which the effects of air cleaners placed in the living room and bedroom for 3 months were compared with the effects of sham air cleaners. Before and after each study period, lung function, airway hyperresponsiveness (adenosine monophosphate), and peak flow variation were recorded. Cat and dog allergen levels were assessed in the filters of the air cleaners.After a 3-month intervention with active air cleaners, airway hyperresponsiveness decreased significantly, showing a 1.2 doubling dose increase of PC(20 )adenosine (P =.003). Peak flow amplitude also decreased (P =. 045). Substantial amounts of airborne cat and dog allergen were captured by the air cleaners in living rooms and bedrooms as well. Allergen levels in floor dust were not changed.In young asthmatic patients sensitized and exposed to pets in the home, application of air cleaners in living rooms and bedrooms was accompanied by a significant improvement in airway hyperresponsiveness and a decrease in peak flow amplitude.
