Estimation of the proportions of dogs and cats that are surgically sterilized. To determine an estimate of the proportions of dogs and cats in Texas that are surgically sterilized and whether those proportions differed according to species and sex of the animal, level of responsibility of the owner, or geographic location.Cross-sectional study.43,831 dogs and cats > or = 6 months old.Information on sterilization rates was provided by 14 licensing agencies and 16 animal shelters in diverse regions of Texas. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare sterilization rates among subpopulations of animals (dogs vs cats, males vs females, sheltered vs licensed, rural vs urban location).Overall, 12,893 (29.4%) of the animals (26.9% of dogs and 32.6% of cats) were sterilized. Proportions of animals sterilized were significantly different among subpopulations.Although the cause of pet overpopulation is multifaceted, failure of owners to spay and castrate their animals is a major contributing factor. Significant differences in sterilization rates among subpopulations of dogs and cats suggest that organizations encouraging spaying and castration should use motivational techniques specific for the pet owners they are targeting.
