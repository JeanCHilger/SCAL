Early diagnosis of stress fracture of the lumbar spine in athletes. Thirty-three athletes complaining of back pain of more than 1 months' duration and with normal radiography of the lower spine were all studied by scintigraphy and in 24 of them with single photon emission computerized tomography. A stress fracture was considered present if localized increased uptake was seen at a vertebral level. Scintigraphy showed increased uptake in 17 of 33 patients and single photon emission computerized tomography in 16 of 24 patients.
