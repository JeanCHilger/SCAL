Pet allergens in a house-dust and elimination procedures against them. The paper presents a group of allergens carried by the most popular home-kept animals (furred animals). Ubiquitous presence of these allergens (at schools and in public places) is caused by their specific characteristics different from those of house-dust-mites. It is stressed that the serum albumines coming from such animals can be the cause of allergic symptoms in the respiratory tract of patients suffering from bronchial asthma. The trials carried out so far have confirmed the reduction of the animal allergens' amount in different indoor environments when several ways of their elimination were applied. However only few clinical trials have been made to estimate the improvement of ventilation parameters, bronchodilatators requirement and the symptom intensification in bronchial asthma cases, after employing some of the recommended methods often in the continuing presence of the animal at home. Education and encouraging bronchial asthma patients and their families to get rid of animals from their homes and acquiting them with various reservoirs of animal allergens as well as the allergens' distribution and translocation should become the basis of therapeutic management in that group of patients.
