Assessment of coronary artery bypass surgery by exercise thallium imaging. The purpose of this study was to assess the coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy. The study was performed on 18 consecutive patients undergoing elective surgery. We compared the results of the scintigraphic examinations, 1 week before and 1 month postoperatively. Of the 47 bypass grafts, 20 (42. 6%) grafts contributed to the improvement of the ischemic areas and 38% of the bypass grafts did not change the scintigraphic patterns after surgery. Some bypass grafts had been performed on the stenotic arteries that dominated the areas which preoperatively showed normal exercise scintigraphic patterns yet were considered to worsen in the near future. Such grafts main contribution may be to protect and to increase the overall myocardial washout ratio for prevention of an enlargement of ischemic areas.
