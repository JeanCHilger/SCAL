Early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease with positron emission tomography. The emergence of drugs that may slow progression of Alzheimer disease, if administered early during its course, has necessitated early diagnosis of the disease itself. Among the functional imaging methods that could assist in early diagnosis, positron emission tomography has an important role in providing quantitative measures of various aspects of brain function affected by the disease. Positron emission tomography studies in patients with Alzheimer disease have revealed a typical pattern of metabolic deficits in the temporal and parietal lobes. Additionally, converging evidence from numerous studies indicates that a similar pattern of deficits can be observed in nondemented subjects who are at risk of developing the disease, such as those with recognized genetic traits such as familial Alzheimer disease with mutations in chromosomes 21 and 14, Down syndrome, subjects with the epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene, and individuals with mild cognitive impairment. These findings might have implications for the selection of patients for clinical trials, defining the outcome measures and evaluation of treatment efficacy and responder characteristics, but should be confirmed by prospective studies comprising larger samples and include clinicopathologic correlations.
