Correlations between reaction time and cerebral blood flow during motor preparation. We show using positron emission tomography in normal volunteers that for four tasks involving motor preparation, regional cerebral blood flow in the ipsilateral cerebellum is negatively correlated with reaction time. Each of the tasks presented subjects with different amounts of advanced information (from none to partial to full information) prior to a signal to move one of two possible fingers in one of two possible directions. The cerebellum was the only brain area that was correlated with reaction time in all the conditions. These results are compatible with the idea that the cerebellum plays an important role in the preparation and initiation of motion.
