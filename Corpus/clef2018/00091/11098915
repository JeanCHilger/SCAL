Dual-window scatter correction and energy window setting in cerebral blood flow SPECT: a Monte Carlo study. The image quality in SPECT studies of the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) performed with 99mTc-HMPAO is degraded by scattered photons. The finite energy resolution of the gamma camera makes the detection of scattered photons unavoidable, and this is observed in the image as an impaired contrast between grey and white matter structures. In this work, a Monte Carlo simulated SPECT study of a realistic voxel-based brain phantom was used to evaluate the resulting contrast-to-noise ratio for a number of energy window settings, with and without the dual-window scatter correction. Values of the scaling factor k, used to obtain the fraction of scattered photons in the photopeak window, were estimated for each energy window. The use of a narrower, asymmetric, energy discrimination window improved the contrast, with a subsequent increase in statistical noise due to the lower number of counts. The photopeak-window setting giving the best contrast-to-noise ratio was found to be the same whether or not scatter correction was applied. Its value was 17% centred at 142 keV. At the optimum photopeak-window setting, the contrast was improved by using scatter correction, but the contrast-to-noise ratio was made worse.
