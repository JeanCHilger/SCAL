Registration, segmentation, and visualization of multimodal brain images. This paper gives an overview of the studies performed at our institute over the last decade on the processing and visualization of brain images, in the context of international developments in the field. The focus is on multimodal image registration and multimodal visualization, while segmentation is touched upon as a preprocessing step for visualization. The state-of-the-art in these areas is discussed and suggestions for future research are given.
