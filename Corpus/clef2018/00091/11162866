Predictive factors in radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer: present status. To evaluate the predictive factors for radiation response in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the role of such factors in guiding high dose radiation therapy.The first International Workshop on Prognostic and Predictive Factors in Lung Cancer was organized by the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group and held in Athens, Greece under the auspices of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer. Presentations at this meeting provided the outline of this report, which has also been supplemented with available data from the current literature.The predictive factors for both the natural history and the therapy outcome of NSCLC are grouped as follows: (1) tumor related factors (anatomic factors) the extent of tumor (tumor stage) is one of most important prognostic factors affecting the therapy outcome. Tumor size (T stage), anatomical structures involved (T4 vs. T3 lesion), and the presence of regional lymph node metastasis have a significant impact on both prognosis and response to appropriate therapyCurrent data indicate that there is a dose-response relationship between radiation dose and local tumor control, and also between local tumor control and survival in stage III NSCLC. Therapeutic factors, i.e. total radiation dose, fractionation schedule and dose intensity, and use of 3-D conformal radiation to secure the optimum therapeutic ratio are important for improved local tumor control and survival. Future research should be directed towards radiation dose escalation using 3-D conformal therapy to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiation in chemo-radiotherapy, and the use of this MTD for improved local tumor control and survival. Radiobiological, molecular, and metabolic markers may have potential for monitoring tumor response and optimizing radiation therapy.
