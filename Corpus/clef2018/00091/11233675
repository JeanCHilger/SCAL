Comparison of fluorine-18 deoxyglucose and O-15 water PET in temporal lobe epilepsy. This study reports a comparison of Fluorine-18 deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and O-15 water (H2(15)O) PET with regard to lateralization of the seizure focus in patients with complex partial epilepsy. The analysis of 35 patients who had an anterior temporal lobectomy for medically intractable seizures indicated that FDG- and H2(15)O-PET were highly correlated in demonstrating the epileptic focus. FDG- and H2(15)O-PET showed significant asymmetries in 83% and 77% of cases respectively. The lateralization with visual analysis of MRI was found to be lower than both FDG and blood flow imaging. Ictal electroencephalography (EEG) lateralizations were concordant with sites of blood flow and FDG-PET abnormalities. Thirty-three patients (94%) were seizure-free or improved significantly after surgery. In conclusion, blood flow PET yielded similar results compared to FDG-PET and can be a valuable modality in preoperative evaluation of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.
