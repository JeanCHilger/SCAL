Radionuclide tests of cerebral circulation in the assessment of treatment of sensorineural hearing loss. Examination and treatment results are available for 59 patients with acute and chronic neurosensory hypoacusis. Cerebral circulation was investigated at radionuclide carotid arteriography and radionuclide single-photon emission computed tomography. Arterial flow to the brain, microcirculation of the gray matter and venous outflow from the cranial cavity were studied before and after the course of quantum hemotherapy.
