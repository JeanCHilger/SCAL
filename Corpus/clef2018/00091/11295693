Increased myocardial blood flow during acute exposure to simulated altitudes. Although only poor data exist on changes in myocardial blood flow (MBF) under acute hypoxia, patients with known coronary artery disease are advised not to exceed a moderate altitude exposure of about 2000 m above sea level.We measured MBF with positron emission tomography using O-15--labeled water in 8 healthy human volunteers (aged 26 +/- 3 years [mean +/- SD]) at baseline (450 m above sea level, Zurich, Switzerland) and during acute hypoxic hypoxemia induced by inhalation of 2 hypoxic gas mixtures corresponding to altitudes of 2000 and 4500 m. MBF remained unchanged at 2000 m (increase of 10%, not significant) but increased significantly at 4500 m (62%, P <.001), exceeding the relative increase in rate pressure product.Our results may explain why exposure to an altitude of 2000 m (corresponding to the cabin pressure in most airplanes during flight) is clinically well tolerated, even by patients with reduced coronary flow reserve, such as those with coronary artery disease. However, at an altitude of 4500 m, MBF increases significantly, supporting the recommendation that patients with impaired flow reserve avoid exposure to higher altitudes.
