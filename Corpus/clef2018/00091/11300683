Helminth fauna of the golden hamster Mesocricetus auratus in Brazil. Helminth fauna of conventionally maintained hamsters from institutional animal houses that supply the research community with laboratory animals and from an openly kept control group, randomly purchased in a pet shop in the State of Rio de Janeiro, were evaluated and compared. Necropsied animals from institutional suppliers were infected with the oxyurid nematodes Syphacia criceti and S. mesocriceti and with the cestode Rodentolepis nana those from the pet shop were infected with S. mesocriceti and R. nana. These are the first morphometric data that are based on Brazilian samples of these species parasitizing hamsters. Mesocricetus auratus is a newly recorded host for S. criceti, previously recovered from Oryzomys subflavus and Calomys callosus in Brazil. The potential of pet and laboratory hamsters in the spreading of helminth infections to humans is also considered.
