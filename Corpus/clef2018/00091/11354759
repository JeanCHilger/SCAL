Brain perfusion measured by flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) and dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging: comparison with nuclear medicine technique. The aim of this study was to compare cerebral perfusion images and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of SPECT study with the images and regional intensity of relative cerebral blood flow (CBF) images acquired by contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging (pMRI) and flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR). Twelve patients with various cerebral diseases were underwent I-123-IMP SPECT, pMRI, and FAIR studies to measure rCBF. A total of 12 regions of interest (ROI) were created over cerebrum and cerebellum to acquire the corresponding rCBF from I-123-IMP study and regional average signal intensity from CBF images of pMRI and FAIR studies. Left-to-right (L/R) and cerebral-to-cerebellar (CCR) ratios were created from the rCBF of I-123-IMP and signal intensity of CBF images of pMRI and FAIR. Image quality of FAIR was the poorest among all however, CBF images of pMRI and FAIR images show comparatively decreased intensity at the corresponding site of decreased perfusion on I-123-IMP images. Both FAIR and pMRI images showed high intensity along the sinuses, choroid plexus, and large vessels in sulci. No significant correlation was found among all imaging modalities. But L/R ratio of I-123-IMP showed significant correlation with those of pMRI and FAIR, but for CCR, significant correlation was observed only between I-123-IMP and FAIR. Perfusion images of both pMRI and FAIR may produce images comparable to SPECT study. But to calculate absolute CBF more easy-to-apply and accurate algorithms are needed to overcome the artifacts from large vessels.
