Myocardial free fatty acid and glucose use after carvedilol treatment in patients with congestive heart failure. Use of beta-adrenoreceptor blockade in the treatment of heart failure has been associated with a reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption and an improvement in myocardial energy efficiency. One potential mechanism for this beneficial effect is a shift in myocardial substrate use from increased free fatty acid (FFA) oxidation to increased glucose oxidation.We studied the effect of carvedilol therapy on myocardial FFA and glucose use in 9 patients with stable New York Heart Association functional class III ischemic cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction </=35%) using myocardial positron emission tomography studies and resting echocardiograms before and 3 months after carvedilol treatment. Myocardial uptake of the novel long chain fatty acid metabolic tracer 14(R, S)-[(18)F]fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid ([(18)F]-FTHA) was used to determine myocardial FFA use, and [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose ([(18)F]-FDG) was used to determine myocardial glucose use. After carvedilol treatment, the mean myocardial uptake rate for [(18)F]-FTHA decreased (from 20.4+/-8.6 to 9.7+/-2.3 mL. 100 g(-1). min(-1) P<0.005), mean fatty acid use decreased (from 19.3+/-7.0 to 8.2+/-1.8 micromoL. 100 g(-1). min(-1)Carvedilol treatment in patients with heart failure results in a 57% decrease in myocardial FFA use without a significant change in glucose use. These metabolic changes could contribute to the observed improvements in energy efficiency seen in patients with heart failure.
