Helicobacter pylori prevalences and risk factors among school beginners in a German urban center and its rural county. In 1998, the Helicobacter pylori [(13)C]urea breath test was offered to all school beginners (birth cohort 1991/1992) in the city of Leipzig and in Leipzig County, Germany, to determine the colonization prevalence and potential transmission pathways of the bacterium. A total of 3,347 school beginners participated in the test, and 2,888 parents completed the detailed, self-administered questionnaire. The H. pylori prevalence was 6.5% [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.3-7.6] in the city and 5.7% (CI, 4.2-7.0) in the county. Using cluster analysis (WARD's method, Euclidean distances), we identified different sets of variables (confirmed by multivariate logistic regression analyses [odds ratios (ORs)] that are signficantly associated with H. pylori positivity. Among city children, the risk is significantly increased with contact to a pet hamster (OR = 2.4 95% CI, 1.2-4.7
