Positron emission tomography imaging in oncology. The applications for FDG-PET imaging are rapidly growing and accepted in the field of oncology. FDG-PET imaging does not replace other imaging modalities, such as CT, but seems to be very helpful in specific situations where CT has known limitations, such as differentiation of benign from malignant indeterminate lesions on CT, differentiation of post-treatment changes versus recurrent tumor, differentiation of benign from malignant lymph nodes, and monitoring therapy. The biggest use of FDG-PET presently is in N and M staging of various body tumors. The addition of FDG-PET in the evaluation of oncologic patients in well-defined algorithms including a combination of imaging studies seems to be cost effective by accurately identifying patients who benefit from invasive procedures and saving unnecessary costly invasive procedures on patients who do not benefit from them. Although PET imaging may decrease the cost of health care by reducing the number of invasive procedures, implementation of clinical PET has been hindered by the high cost of the purchase, operation expenses, and maintenance of PET systems the need for immediate access to a source of 18F (owing to the 110-minute half-life)
