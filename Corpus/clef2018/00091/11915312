Performance evaluation of dual-head coincidence gamma camera for positron imaging. We assessed the performance evaluation of a dual-head coincidence gamma camera (Millennium VG, General Electric, Milwaukee, USA) as a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner based on the measurement indicator for performance evaluation of PET device.The axial spatial resolution was 4.98 mm FWHM at the center of the field of view. The true high count-rate characteristic curve was relatively straight within the range 0-0.2 microCi/ml. The relative recovery coefficient was 0.1 with a diameter of 10 mm and 0.39 with a diameter of 20 mm.In this study, we had to make a some change in the protocols described in the measurement indicator for performance evaluation of PET devices.
