Occurrence of yeasts in psittacines droppings from captive birds in Italy. Three-hundred twenty five droppings from parrots raised in the premises of 4 breeders and in several private households were cultured for yeasts. One-hundred sixty droppings (49.2%) resulted positive. From these specimens 212 isolates belonging to 27 different species were obtained. Mainly Candida species such as C. albicans, C. catenulata, C. curvata, C. famata, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondi, C. holmii, C. intermedia, C. krusei, C. lambica, C. lusitaniae, C. membranaefaciens, C. parapsilosis, C. pelliculosa, C. sake and C. valida were isolated. Debarvomyces marama, D. polymorphus, Geotrichum sp., Pichia etchelsii, P. ohmeri, Rhodotorula glutinis, R. rubra, Rhodotorula sp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. kluyiveri and Zygosaccharomyces sp. were also obtained. Dark colonies on Staib medium were never observed. The psittacine birds apparently serve as carriers for several Candida species or their perfect states and to a lesser extent for other opportunistic yeasts such as Rhodotorula, Trichosporon and Saccharomyces spp., which are considered part of the transient microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract. The most striking finding was the absence of Cryptococcus spp. among the isolates. The present survey confirms the role of pet birds in carrying potential zoonotic yeasts.
