Noninvasive cardiac diagnosis for quantifying scarring, ischemia and pump function within the scope of a study. 20 useful facets in routine cardiology nuclear medicine practice. Myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) commonly is interpreted qualitatively and not quantitatively. Most of the prognostic literature is based on a semi-quantitative visual analysis (SQA) of MPS. However, data about the comparison between the SQA and coronary angiography (cath) is lacking. We therefore evaluated 167 patients who underwent MPS and subsequent cath. SQA using a 20 segment model was used for MPS interpretation. Patients with a small to moderate amount of ischemia (SDS < or = 4 mean 1.2 +/- 1.5) and with extensive ischemia (SDS > 4
