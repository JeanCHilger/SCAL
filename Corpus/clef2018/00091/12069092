A non-parametric bootstrap approach for analysing the statistical properties of SPECT and PET images. Knowledge of the statistical properties of reconstructed single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) images would be helpful for optimizing acquisition and image processing protocols. We describe a non-parametric bootstrap approach to accurately estimate the statistical properties of SPECT or PET images whatever the noise properties in the projections and the reconstruction algorithm. Using analytical simulations and real PET data, this method is shown to accurately predict the statistical properties, including the variance and covariance, of reconstructed pixel values for both linear (filtered backprojection) and non-linear (ordered subset expectation maximization) reconstruction algorithms.
