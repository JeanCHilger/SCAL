Current status of nuclear medicine. Clinical application of FDG-PET for cancer diagnosis. Colorectal cancer. In Japan, colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of death from cancer. The recurrence rate after curative surgical treatment for colorectal cancer has been estimated at 30-40%, most frequently occurring within 3 years. Therefore, more accurate staging of recurrent colorectal cancer is required for more appropriate management decisions. This article focuses on the clinical value of PET with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the diagnosis of recurrent and primary colorectal cancers. The technical issues in clinical practice and the cost-effectiveness of FDG-PET in staging recurrent colorectal cancer will be covered.
