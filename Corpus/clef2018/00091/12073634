Current status of nuclear medicine. Clinical application of FDG-PET for cancer diagnosis. Malignant lymphoma. Malignant lymphoma is one of the tumors that show high FDG uptake, enabling the accurate detection of small involved lesions by FDG-PET. It is useful in both initial staging and follow-up study. In initial staging, FDG-PET is superior to CT from the aspects of sensitivity and specificity, and it is reported that the therapeutic protocol has been changed in 21% of patients. In the follow-up of therapy and detection of recurrence, the accuracy of residual disease is reported to be more than 90%. Among the different pathological types of lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and intermediate-grade NHL are typical indications because of the requirement of accurate staging in determining the therapeutic protocol. One of the shortcomings of FDG-PET is its low specificity. Combination study with PET tracers with higher specificity in tumor diagnosis such as C-11 methionine or F-18 methyltyrosine could be a way to solve this problem.
