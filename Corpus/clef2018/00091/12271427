Myocardial metabolic and receptor imaging in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) is a distinct disease of the myocardium, of unknown etiology. The disease can occur acutely, or evolve in a subacute fashion. IDC is often associated with a substantial impairment of ventricular function, which may recover over time. Although spontaneous recovery of LV function occurs in 20%-45% of newly diagnosed patients, the majority of patients do not do well. IDC has an average 5-year mortality of 20%. Abnormalities of energetics, perfusion, and adrenergic control of the myocardium are markers of the status of LV dysfunction. As the heart fails, changes occur in the production and catabolism of high-energy substrates, the efficiency of mitochondrial oxidative processes, the distribution of resting perfusion and coronary vasodilating capacity and the adrenergic receptor density and function. This article reviews the information provided by metabolic and receptor imaging in patients with IDC, and the role the data may play in patient management.
