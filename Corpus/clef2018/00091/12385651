Usefulness of brain SPECT with HMPAO-99mTc and psychological tests for diagnosis of neurological involvement in Behçet's disease. The purpose of this study was to establish the usefulness of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and psychological tests for diagnostic of neuro-Behçet (NB) and to evaluate the clinical significance of neurological symptoms that are difficult to interpret and asymptomatic abnormalities in diagnostic tests.Forty patients with Behçet's disease (BD) were enrrolled for being studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), SPECT and psychological tests.MRI findings were abnormal in 52,9% of patients with neurological involvement and 23.1% without it (p < 0.1), whereas SPECT findings were abnormal in 82.3% and 61.5%, respectively (no significant difference). The difference between MRI and SPECT findings was significant (p < 0.02 for the complete group p < 0.05 for patients without neurological symptomsSPECT seems more sensible and less specific than MRI for diagnostic of NB. Although SPECT findings were frequently abnormal in patients with BD without neurological involvement or with neurological symptoms hard to interpret, no patient from this group developed a NB flare after a long follow-up period. A characteristic personality was found for patients with BD.
