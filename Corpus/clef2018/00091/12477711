Ictal SPECT in children with epilepsy: comparison with intracranial EEG and relation to postsurgical outcome. In order to validate the ability of ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to localize the epileptogenic zone (EZ) in children, we compared in 20 patients aged from 10 months to 17 years (mean 6.5 years) the topography of the area of increased ictal perfusion (IPA), determined on the basis of ictal minus interictal scan values, with that of the EZ determined by intracranial EEG recordings and assessed its relationship with the postsurgical outcome. Eighteen patients had symptomatic epilepsy and 10 had extratemporal epilepsy. All patients except one had an ictal injection (mean time lag from clinical seizure onset was 18 s). Ictal and interictal SPECT images were successively co-registered, normalized, subtracted, smoothed and superimposed on MRI. All patients with ictal injection exhibited one or several IPAs. The topography of the 'highest' IPA, i.e. the maximal cerebral blood flow (CBF) change between ictal and interictal SPECT, significantly colocalized with the site of onset of the discharge, and that of the lower IPAs with that of the area of propagation (P < 0.0001). At a threshold of 30% of the maximal CBF change, the IPAs detected the onset of the discharge with a sensitivity of 0.80 and a specificity of 0.70. The highest IPA localized the EZ in 12 out of 15 patients. In the three others it missed the EZ and showed the area of propagation because of rapid seizure propagation or of infraclinical seizure onset. Among the patients with favourable surgery outcome, the highest IPA colocalized with the resected area in 70% of cases. Ictal SPECT could therefore plays an important role as a non-invasive presurgical method of investigation by optimizing the placement of intracranial electrodes, thus improving the postsurgery outcome of paediatric partial epilepsy.
