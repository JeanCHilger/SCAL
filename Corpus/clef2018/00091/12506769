18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in colorectal cancer: value in primary staging and follow-up. Positron emission tomography using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) is a encouraging imaging technique allowing a highly sensitive whole-body search for malignant foci detected by their increased glucose metabolism compared with benign tissues. Several studies are now available that indicate its added value for diagnosis and staging of colorectal cancer. In all, patient management seems to be changed in 20-30% of patients who undergo Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in addition to standard staging procedures. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is also useful in monitoring radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Regarding preoperative staging of primary colorectal cancer the literature is very limited.
