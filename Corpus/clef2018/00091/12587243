Imaging in laryngeal cancer: computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography. Imaging modalities have become increasingly significant in the treatment of laryngeal cancer. The ability of CT and MR imaging to reveal pathologic conditions that are undetectable by palpation or endoscopy has led to the development of several imaging-based systems of anatomic classification and tumor staging. This article provides an up-to-date review of the radiographic evaluation of the normal neck and information for both the radiologist and clinician treating the patient with laryngeal cancer. Technical considerations, imaging-based staging systems, and the radiographic characteristics of laryngeal cancer in various regions of the neck are discussed.
