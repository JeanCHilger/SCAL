Sentinel lymph node excision (SLNE) and positron emission tomography in the staging of stage I-II melanoma patients. Sentinel lymph node excision (SLNE) and positron emission tomography (PET) were evaluated in the staging of 51 Stage I and II melanoma patients (staged according to the guidelines of the German Dermatological Society).Tumor thickness ranged from 1.0 mm to 6.0 mm (median: 1.5 mm mean: 2.07 mm). At least one sentinel lymph node (SLN) was excised in all patientsAccording to the current literature SLNE is recommended in primary tumors greater than 1 mm thickness. PET cannot be expected to give additional information in the staging of stage I-II patients.
