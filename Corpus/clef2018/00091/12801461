The relative effects of supplemental dietary calcium and oxalate on urine composition and calcium oxalate relative supersaturation in healthy adult dogs. The aim of this study was to establish the relative effects of dietary calcium and oxalate (in the form of oxalic acid) on the composition of urine produced by healthy adult Cairn Terriers and Miniature Schnauzers. A nutritionally complete dry dog food was fed to 7 dogs (4 Cairn terriers and 3 Miniature schnauzers) for 24 weeks. The dogs were fed the diet alone, or supplemented with six different combinations of dietary calcium (as carbonate and sulphate) and oxalate (as oxalic acid) commonly found in dry commercially prepared dog foods. Urine pH, volume, specific gravity, and concentrations of 12 analytes were measured for each dog urinary relative supersaturation (RSS) with calcium oxalate (CaOx) was calculated from these values. The effects of supplemental calcium and oxalate were established using two-way analysis of variance and multiple range tests (least significant difference)
