Evidence of pharmacologic preconditioning during PTCA by intravenous pretreatment with ATP-sensitive K+ channel opener nicorandil. It is not known whether pretreatment with nicorandil, an ATP-sensitive K+ channel (K(ATP)channel) opener, induces a preconditioning effect independent of increased collateral recruitment.Forty-four patients with angina who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis were randomly allocated for pretreatment with an intravenous injection of 80 g/kg nicorandil 5 min before initial ballooning (n=22) or saline (n=22). 99mTc tetrofosmin was injected during balloon inflation, quantitative analysis of occlusion images by SPECT was conducted, and the defect severity score (SS) was calculated. An ECG was recorded during the 2-min inflation to calculate the sum of ST elevation (sigmaST).SigmaST levels were significantly reduced in patients with nicorandil pretreatment compared with control patients (control:1.89+/-0.85 mV nicorandil:1.24+/-0.57 mV, p=0.0052). However, no difference was observed in defect severity (control: 79.0+/-32.5, nicorandil: 98.7+/-48.9 ns). A close correlation was observed between SS and sigmaST in both groups (nicorandil group R(2)=0.505, control group R(2)=0.599). A multivariate regression model demonstrated that both defect severity (p<0.0001) and pretreatment with nicorandil (p<0.001) were significantly related to the level of sigmaST, suggesting a cellular protective effect against ischaemia by nicorandil, independent of myocardial blood flow.Nicorandil pretreatment resulted in the induction of myocardial preconditioning independent of the severity of ischaemia.
