Quantitative liver-spleen scan using single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) for assessment of hepatic function in cirrhotic patients. Accurate quantitative determination of liver function is critical in cirrhotic patients in order to predict outcome, particularly in patients who undergo hepatic resection or non-hepatic surgery. As colloid uptake by perfused Kupffer cells is proportional to perfused hepatocyte mass, quantitative liver spleen scan may be used as an index of perfused hepatocyte mass. Thus, this study was conducted to evaluate quantitative single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) of Tc-99mm-phytate colloid uptake by the liver as a test for hepatic function in cirrhotic patients.Quantitative SPECT was used to measure liver volume, quantitative colloid uptake by the liver and percentage of injected dose/ml of liver tissue in cirrhotic patients (n=75), non-cirrhotic patients with chronic liver disease (n=52) and patients without liver disease (n=36).Although liver volume was similar among the three groups, the cirrhotic patients had significantly lower total quantitative uptake and quantitative uptake/ml compared to groups 2 and 3 (P<0.001). Quantitative liver uptake in the cirrhotic patients was highly correlated with Child-Pugh score (r=-0.64, P<0.0001) and with indocyanine green retention at 15 min (r=-0.84, P<0.0001).Quantitative SPECT of the liver may be an additional, useful, non-invasive quantitative test for assessment of hepatic function and severity of liver disease in cirrhotic patients.
