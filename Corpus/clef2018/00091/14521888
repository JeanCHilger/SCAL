Technetium-99m tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography to detect metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma in patients with elevated human serum thyroglobulin levels but negative I-131 whole body scan. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of technetium-99m tetrofosmin (Tc-99m TF) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the neck and chest to detect metastatic lesions in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) after near total thyroidectomy and radioiodine (I-131) treatment in patients who present with elevated serum human thyroglobulin (hTg) levels but negative I-131 whole body scan (WBS).Twenty patients with PTC treated by near total thyroidectomy and I-131 treatments were included in this study. All 20 patients had negative I-131 WBS results and elevated hTg levels (hTg 2.0 microIU/ml) under thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation (TSH 30 microIU/ml). Nineteen of the 20 cases were confirmed to have metastases by operation/biopsy histopathological findings or clinical follow-up longer than 1 year by additional morphological imaging techniques. The remaining patient has been followed up closely and has been disease free for 10 months. Tc-99m TF SPECT was performed to detect metastatic lesions.Tc-99m TF SPECT demonstrated lesions in 11/19 patients a sensitivity of 57.9%. Tc-99m TF SPECT failed to demonstrate lesions in eight patients including smaller lymph nodes and miliary lung metastases.We conclude that Tc-99m TF SPECT is a useful additional tool to detect metastatic lesions in PTC with elevated hTg but negative I-131 WBS. However, smaller lymph nodes and miliary lung metastases may be missed.
