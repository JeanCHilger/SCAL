Chemical recycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) by hydrolysis and glycolysis. In this paper we review an interesting method of PET recycling, i.e. chemical recycling it is based on the concept of depolymerizing the condensation polymer through solvolytic chain cleavage into low molecular products which can be purified and reused as raw materials for the production of high-quality chemical products. In this work our attention is confined to the hydrolysis (neutral, acid and alkaline) and glycolysis processes of PET chemical recycling
