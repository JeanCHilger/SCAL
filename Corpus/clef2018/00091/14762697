Diagnosis and staging of children's lymphoma using the technetium-labelled somatostatin analogue, 99mTc-depreotide. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) is useful in diagnosing tumours with increased expression of somatostatin receptors. Lymphoma cells are known to express somatostatin receptors however, the application of indium-labelled analogues in children is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the technetium-labelled somatostatin analogue, depreotide, may be useful in diagnosing and staging malignant lymphoma in children. Fifteen children (mean age 13.8 years) with malignant lymphoma were studied (eight with Hodgkin's lymphoma and seven with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). All children were investigated for verification of staging established by other modalities. Imaging was performed 3-5 h after administration of 300-550 MBq (99m)Tc-depreotide. All patients underwent whole-body scan and single-photon emission tomography of the chest and/or abdomen. Images were assessed visually. In all patients, foci of increased tracer uptake were found. The neck and thorax were the most frequent lesion localisations. Abdominal lesions were found in four patients, and bone lesions in three. In two patients, diffusely increased uptake was observed throughout the skeleton (verified as representing bone marrow involvement). In 11 patients, the number of abnormal sites detected by SRS was greater than that detected by CT. Based on radionuclide examination, three children were upstaged and none were downstaged. It is concluded that (99m)Tc-depreotide shows increased accumulation in pathological sites in malignant lymphoma in children. SRS with (99m)Tc-depreotide provides a single-day imaging method with high sensitivity in lymphoma and with all the advantages of a technetium-labelled compound. Further studies are required on the specificity and the possible value of (99m)Tc-depreotide in the follow-up of these patients.
