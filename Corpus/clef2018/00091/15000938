Dual-head gamma camera coincidence imaging in pancreatic cancer. To assess the usefulness of dual-head camera imaging with 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in the identification of malignant pancreatic lesions.Fifteen (15) patients with pancreatic masses (7 females and 8 males, mean age 52 10 years) have been studied prospectively. After a 12-hour fasting patients received 120 MBq of FDG and were imaged in a dual-head camera equipped with coincidence detection. The final diagnosis was obtained by histology (biopsy or surgery in 13 patients) or follow-up (in 2 patients).Nine patients showed FDG uptake, all had pancreatic cancer proven on histological examination. Six patients had no tracer uptake: two had chronic pancreatitis, 1 had insulinoma, 1 had gastrinoma and two had pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Overall sensitivity was 69%, specificity was 100% and accuracy was 73%.Dual-head camera FDG images seem potentially useful in the characterization of the nature of pancreatic lesions. However, a negative study does not rule out malignancy in this patient population.
