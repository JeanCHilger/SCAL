Pharmacokinetic simulations of SPECT quantitation of the M2 muscarinic neuroreceptor subtype in disease states using radioiodinated (R,R)-4IQNB. Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves selective loss of muscarinic M2, but not M1, subtype neuroreceptors in the posterior parietal cortex of the human brain. Emission tomographic study of the loss of M2 receptors in AD is limited by the fact that there is currently no available M2-selective radioligand which can penetrate the blood-brain barrier. However, by taking advantage of the different pharmacokinetic properties of (R,R)-[123I]IQNB for the M1 and M2 subtypes, it may be possible to estimate losses in M2. It has previously been hypothesized that the difference between an early study and a late study should provide information on the M2 receptor population. In order to test this hypothesis, we present here the results of pharmacokinetic simulations of the in vivo localization of (R,R)-[123I]IQNB in brain regions containing various proportions of M1 and M2 subtypes. These results permit us to conclude that SPECT imaging of (R,R)-[123I]IQNB localization can potentially be used to quantitate changes in the M2 subtype in a disease state within a brain region for which the ratio M2/M1 is sufficiently high in normal individuals.
