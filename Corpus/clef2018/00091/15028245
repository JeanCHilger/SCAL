New alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists derived from the antipsychotic sertindole - carbon-11 labelling and pet examination of brain uptake in the cynomolgus monkey. Central alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors are potential targets for recently developed antipsychotic drugs. Two new 11C labeled potent and selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists, 1- [2- [4-[1-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(2-[(11)C]methyl-tetrazol-5-yl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-1-piperidinyl]ethyl]-imidazolidin-2-one ([(11)C]2) and 1- [2- [4-[1-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(1-[(11)C]methyl-(1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-1-piperidinyl]ethyl]-imidazolidin-2-one ([(11)C]3) were prepared and evaluated for imaging of central alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors in the cynomolgus monkey brain. For both compounds, the total brain radioactivity was only about 0.6% of the radioactivity injected i.v. There was no evident binding in regions known to contain alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. This observation suggests that the affinity of the radioligands in primates in vivo is not sufficient to provide a signal for specific binding that can be differentiated from the background. In addition, active efflux by P-glycoprotein may be responsible for the low total brain-uptake of the two radioligands. Both compounds showed a highly polarised and verapamile sensitive transport across monolayers of Caco-2 cells. The total brain-uptake of [(3)H]2 was 6 times higher in mdr1a(-/-) knock-out mice lacking the gene encoding P-glycoprotein compared to wild type mice. Pretreatment of one monkey with Cyclosporin A (15 mg/kg) resulted in 40% higher brain uptake for [(11)C]3 when compared with baseline. These observations support the view that efflux by P-glycoprotein can be of quantitative importance for the total brain-uptake of some PET radioligands.
