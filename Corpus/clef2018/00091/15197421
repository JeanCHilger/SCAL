Association between insulin resistance and reduced coronary vasoreactivity in healthy subjects. Insulin resistance appears to be an important risk factor for coronary artery disease.To examine the role of insulin resistance on coronary vasoreactivity in healthy subjects.Myocardial blood flow was quantitated using positron emission tomography and oxygen-15-labelled water in 10 healthy, nonobese men. The perfusion measurements were performed basally and during adenosine infusion, which has been used as a measure of coronary vasoreactivity. After perfusion measurements were taken, whole-body glucose uptake was determined using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique.Basal myocardial blood flow was 0.89+/-0.21 mL.g(-1).min(-1) adenosine significantly increased the flow to 4.00+/-1.13 mL.g(-1).min(-1). Adenosine-stimulated myocardial blood flow was inversely associated with fasting serum insulin concentration (r=-0.69, P<0.05). Concordantly, hyperemic blood flow was associated with whole-body glucose uptake during euglycemic hyperinsulinemic conditions (r=0.64, P<0.05). Basal myocardial blood flow was not affected by insulin resistance.The results of the present study demonstrate the novel finding that insulin resistance is associated with reduced coronary vasoreactivity, even in healthy subjects.
