CdZnTe strip detector SPECT imaging with a slit collimator. In this paper, we propose a CdZnTe rotating and spinning gamma camera attached with a slit collimator. This imaging system acquires convergent planar integrals of a radioactive distribution. Two analytical image reconstruction algorithms are proposed. Preliminary phantom studies show that our small CdZnTe camera with a slit collimator outperforms a larger NaI(Tl) camera with a pinhole collimator in terms of spatial resolution in the reconstructed images. The main application of this system is small animal SPECT imaging.
