Presence of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 gene mutation in a patient with apparently sporadic Parkinson's disease: clinical implications. Among 242 patients with apparently sporadic Parkinson's disease, a 70-year-old man with a CAG repeat number of 37 in the SCA2 gene was identified. He has remained responsive to levodopa 14 years after onset and has had no overt signs suggesting cerebellar dysfunction. Although it is not possible to confirm if this patient has a de novo mutation of the SCA2 gene, this genetic defect seems to be contributing to his parkinsonian features and further supports the concept that apparently sporadic, late-onset, levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease may have multiple causes.
