Designed molecular probes in brain research: molecular imaging of IP2 receptor in the human brain. The study of the role of prostaglandins in living human brain requires a highly designed non-invasive molecular probe with a specific function in the central nervous system and high stability in an in vivo system in addition to the ability of blood-brain-barrier penetration. We succeeded in designing 15R-TIC, which binds with a novel prostacyclin receptor subtype (IP2) expressed specifically in the central nervous system. 15R-TIC exhibited a distinct nerve-protecting effect in both high oxygen and in vivo ischemic conditions. In addition, a rapid C-methylation reaction, developed in order to incorporate a short-lived 11C-positron nuclide into the molecule, realized the synthesis of 15R-[11C]TIC methyl ester with the radioactivity of 2.5 GBq. The molecular imaging was established for both monkey and human brains by intravenous injection of this positron emission tomography (PET) probe.
