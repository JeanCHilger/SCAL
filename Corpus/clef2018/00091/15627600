Dysfunctional supplementary motor area implication during attention and time estimation tasks in schizophrenia: a PET-O15 water study. Results of this PET-O15 water activation study confirm the implication of supplementary motor areas during time estimation tasks. They also show that the cortical-subcortical network associated with temporal processing is impaired in schizophrenia. Following recent proposals of time dynamic networks, this impairment may consist in a dysfunctional imbalance of early failure of supplementary motor activation during temporal processing.
