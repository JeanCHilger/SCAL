Clinical pathway for the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding with an emphasis on endometrial cancer detection. Postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) accounts for about 5% of all office gynaecology visits. The causes of PMB are varied. Many women with endometrial cancer present with this symptom. Although many investigations are described, the most appropriate approach is often unclear. In a patient with no obvious local cause, the emphasis should be on uterine and adnexal evaluation. Based on a literature review, the evidence favours a conservative approach if the endometrial thickness (ET) is < 4mm, unless there are risk factors. All patients with ET 4 mm should have outpatient endometrial sampling. If this is unsuccessful, then outpatient hysteroscopy with directed biopsy or inpatient hysteroscopy is favoured. The role of ancillary investigations are described.
