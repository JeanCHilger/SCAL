Pet ownership by elderly people: two new issues. Two new issues of pet ownership were considered in a mail questionnaire and an interview survey of a large number of elderly people age sixty and over. First, evidence was obtained that pets are an important determinant of housing choice. Second, many elderly pet owners have made no arrangements for the pet if they predecease it or become unable to care for it. Problems related to these issues are discussed.
