Use of positron-emission tomography with F18-fluorodeoxyglucose for the assessment of lung lesions suspicious of malignancy. Positron-emission tomography (PET) with F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is very helpful in the evaluation and management of lung lesions. It is specially useful for the characterization of solitary nodules, for the staging, evaluation of recurrence and therapeutic response in non-small cell lung cancer, for the evaluation of small cell lung cancer and for the assessment of pulmonary metastases. This article is a literature review on PET with FDG in lung cancer. A preliminary analysis of PET results at the Military Hospital in Santiago, Chile, is also presented.
