Does percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PCNL) affect renal function: assessment with quantitative spect of Tc 99M-DMSA (QDMSA) renal scintigraphy. The study aimed to quantitatively investigate the effect of PCNL on global and regional function using quantitative single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) measurement of Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake by the kidneys (QDMSA).Seventy nine patients with nephrolithiasis undergoing PCNL were studied by sequential QDMSA examination. There were 42 (53%) males and 37 (47%) females with mean age of 47 +/- 16 years. The initial study was conducted before PCNL procedure and the follow-up studies were performed 1.5-24 months after PCNL. Among 60 of the 79 (76%) patients, in whom PCNL was performed using upper or lower pole access, regional renal function of affected and non-affected pole of operated kidney was calculated separately.There was no statistically significant difference between the uptake of treated kidney before and after PCNL procedure (11.9% +/- 5% vs 11.6% +/- 5% t = 0.9, p = 0.368). The total renal functional volume of treated kidney was to be slightly decreased from 235cc +/- 62cc to 224cc +/- 59cc (t = 2.7
