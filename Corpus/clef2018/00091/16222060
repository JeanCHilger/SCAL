Effect of somatostatin analog on postprandial satiation in obesity. Altered satiation may impact postprandial symptoms and potentially change food intake in obesity. Our aim was to compare effects of octreotide and placebo on postprandial symptoms, satiation, and gastric volumes in obesity.In a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 26 obese but otherwise healthy participants received 100 mug of octreotide or placebo subcutaneously 30 minutes before each study. Studies were performed on 2 separate days and included validated non-invasive techniques: (99m)Tc-single photon emission computed tomography imaging to measure fasting stomach volume and gastric volume changes after 90 mL of water and 240 mL of Ensure and a standardized nutrient drink test to measure the maximum tolerated volume and postprandial symptoms.Relative to placebo, octreotide increased gastric volume after 90 mL of water however, fasting and gastric volume change post-Ensure and maximum tolerated volume of Ensure were not different. Octreotide decreased sensations of fullness (p = 0.035) and bloating (p = 0.05) and tended to reduce aggregate symptoms (p = 0.07) after the fully satiating meal.In obese individuals, somatostatin analog significantly reduced postprandial sensations after a satiating meal without altering maximum tolerated meal volume or postnutrient gastric volume, suggesting an effect on upper gut sensation. The role of somatostatin as a permissive factor in the development of obesity by reducing postprandial sensations deserves further study.
