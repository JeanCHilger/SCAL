Analysis of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and oligomers in recycled polyethylene terephthalate. Formaldehyde (FA), acetaldehyde (AA) and oligomers in recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were analyzed by HPLC. All of the physically recycled PET contained detectable levels of FA, AA and oligomers, and the levels were almost the same as in used bottles. Most superclean-like and chemically recycled PET contained lower levels than new pellets. These compounds showed no decrease upon physical recycling, but showed a marked decrease upon superclean-like recycling. In PET sheets made using physically recycled PET, FA was decreased, though AA was increased by the sheeting process as same as new one. FA, AA and oligomers originated from PET resin and their levels in recycled products were almost equivalent to those in new products. It was concluded that there is no particular safety concern about their presence in recycled PET.
