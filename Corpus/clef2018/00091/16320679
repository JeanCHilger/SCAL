Primary prophylaxis of cerebrovascular complications in patients with metabolic syndrome. To study effects of antihypertensive therapy with bisoprolol and actovegin on cerebral perfusion in patients with metabolic syndrome.Thirty patients (18 women and 12 men) with metabolic syndrome and mild arterial hypertension took bisoprolol alone in a dose 5-10 mg/day, and fifteen patients received combined therapy (bisoprolol and actovegin) for 12 weeks. Before the study and 12 weeks later measurements were made of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, single photon emission computed tomography investigated brain perfusion.Improvement of brain perfusion was observed after both monotherapy with bisoprolol and its combination with actovegin.Monotherapy with bisoprolol and bisoprolol combination with actovegin improved brain perfusion but the combination was more effective.
