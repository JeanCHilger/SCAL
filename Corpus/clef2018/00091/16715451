The role of whole-body fluorine-18-FDG positron emission tomography in the detection of recurrence in symptomatic patients with stages II and III breast cancer. The role of whole-body fluorine-18-FDG positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) as an adjunct localize recurrence in stages II and III breast cancer patients who present with clinical suspicion for recurrence is not well established. We report our experience in such a patient population.A retrospective review of all patients with stages II and III breast cancer who had a whole-body FDG-PET scan was performed.Of the 23 patients who fit the criteria, 9 had stage II and 14 had stage III breast cancer. Overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 81%, 100%, and 87%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values for stages II and III were 100% and 83%, respectively, and 100% and 50%, respectively. FDG-PET detected two recurrences that were missed by conventional imagings, but such recurrences were local and amenable for biopsy.In patients with stages II and III breast cancer who present with a suspicion for recurrent disease, a whole-body FDG-PET scan may be a useful adjunct in the evaluation of recurrence. However, its added benefit over conventional imaging should be questioned.
