In vivo benzodiazepine receptor occupancy by CL 218,872 visualized by positron emission tomography in the brain of the living baboon: modulation by GABAergic transmission and relation with anticonvulsant activity. In vivo benzodiazepine receptor occupancy by increasing doses of CL 218,872 has been evaluated in the baboon Papio papio, using (11C) RO 15-1788 as specific radioligand and positron emission tomography as external detection system. Although BZR heterogeneity has been previously demonstrated in the brain of the living baboon using PET, we did not observe in our studies that CL 218,872 interacts preferentially with one of the BZR subtypes. The monophasic pattern of the dose dependent CL 218,872 displacement curve and the corresponding "in vivo Hill coefficient" near unity suggest that CL 218,872 binds in cerebral baboon cortex with a similar affinity with BZ1 as well as BZ2 subtypes. The anticonvulsant properties of CL 218,872 against bicuculline and allylglycine-induced seizures were correlated with benzodiazepine receptor occupancy by assessment of electroencephalographic activity during positron emission tomography studies. Our data confirmed in vivo the hypothesis of a partial agonist anticonvulsant activity of CL 218,872. At the same time, the use of a GABA-antagonist (bicuculline) or an inhibitor of the GABA synthesis (allylglycine) suggested the existence of an allosteric interaction between benzodiazepine receptors and GABA receptors.
