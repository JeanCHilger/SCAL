Comparison of (11)C-acetate positron emission tomography and (67)Gallium citrate scintigraphy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Nuclear imaging may have an increasing role in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to compare prospectively the Gallium-67 citrate ((67)Ga) scintigraphy results with those obtained by positron emission tomography (PET) using (11)C-acetate in patients with HCC.We prospectively analysed 21 patients (mean age, 64+/-11 years) with histopathologically verified HCC undergoing (11)C-acetate PET and (67)Ga scintigraphy. (67)Ga scans were not performed in three of these 21 patients due to the exacerbation of the disease. Whole-body (11)C-acetate PET were performed following intravenous injection of 850 MBq of (11)C-acetate. For (67)Ga scintigraphy, whole-body, planar and single photon emission computed tomography imaging acquisitions were performed after intravenous application of a mean dose of 189 MBq (67)Ga.(67)Ga scintigraphy found abnormalities only in 10 of 18 patients (56%) and detected 22 of 46 clinically involved sites (48%) it was false-positive in two patients. (11)C-acetate PET found abnormalities in 14 of 18 patients (78%) and detected 36 of 46 clinical lesions (78%)Our results indicate significantly higher sensitivity and specificity of (11)C-acetate PET than (67)Ga scan in detection of HCC lesions. This study suggests that imaging with (11)C-acetate PET might play a potential role in the diagnostic workup of patients with HCC.
