Positive correlation between standardized uptake values of FDG uptake in the stomach and the value of the C-13 urea breath test. The distribution of FDG uptake in the stomach is variable. Gastritis is one of the causes of elevated FDG uptake. Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection was found in approximately 80% of patients with peptic ulcer and 30% to 60% of symptomatic gastritis. The C-13 urea breath test (UBT) is one of the gold standard tools in diagnosis of HP infection. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between standardized uptake values (SUVs) of FDG uptake in the stomach and the value of the C-13 urea breath test (UBT).Sixteen patients, referred from the department of community medicine, for FDG PET for health examination were chronologically enrolled for detection of HP infection by using the C-13 UBT within 1 week. The maximal SUVs of FDG uptake in the gastric wall as well as the value of the C-13 UBT were measured. The correlation between maximal SUVs of FDG uptake in the stomach and the value of the C-13 UBT was observed.We took the results of C-13 UBT as the final diagnosis of HP infection. Of 16 patients, 5 were HP-infected and 11 were uninfected. Standardized uptake values of FDG uptake in the gastric wall were strong positively correlated with the value of the C-13 UBT in this retrospective study (P < 0.001).Except for gastric cancer, HP infection has to be concerned when high SUVs of FDG uptake in the stomach are noted.
