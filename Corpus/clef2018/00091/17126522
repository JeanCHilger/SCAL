The role of 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in the management of patients with colorectal cancer. In patients with colorectal cancer an accurate diagnostic work-up is mandatory in order to perform the most specific treatment. At this moment 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is considered an accurate imaging technique in staging/restaging several malignancies. The aim of this paper is to review the scientific literature available about the role of FDG-PET in the management of patients with colorectal cancer.An overview on Medline of scientific literature concerning FDG-PET and colorectal cancer was performed. The most relevant studies are reported. Advantages, limitations and new chances in using FDG-PET in these subsets of patients are summarized.FDG-PET is a useful tool in the evaluation of colorectal cancer. In comparison to conventional imaging technique, FDG-PET has an additional diagnostic value because it allows to metabolically characterize undetermined lesions suspected for recurrence of disease, to perform a complete pre-surgical staging and to identify occult metastatic disease. In clinical practice its use leads to a change in therapeutic choices in a high percentage of cases.FDG-PET should be considered an essential diagnostic tool in the management of patients with colorectal cancer, especially in recurrent disease evaluation.
