Parametric and regional maps of free serotonin 5HT1A receptor sites in human brain as function of age in healthy humans. Serotonin 5HT(1A)-binding sites can be detected in living human brain with the positron-emitting antagonist [(11)C]WAY-100635. Previous measurements of the availability of [(11)C]WAY-binding sites in normal aging are equivocal, in part because of the greatly variable binding of this ligand. To test the null hypothesis that the binding potential (pB) of 5HT(1A) sites remains constant with age 19 healthy volunteers aged 23-73 years (8 women, 11 men) underwent positron emission tomography. To determine pBs, we applied a novel tissue reference method of analysis, Estimation of Reversible Ligand Binding and Receptor Density (ERLiBIiRD) (Gjedde, 2003
