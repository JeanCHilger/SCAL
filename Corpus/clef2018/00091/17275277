Imaging apoptosis for detecting plaque instability: rendering death a brighter facade. The relatively poor correlation between the risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture and the degree of luminal obstruction before this event implies a strong imperative for in vivo detection of the processes underlying progressive plaque destabilization. In addition to the morphologic characteristics, apoptosis and inflammation comprise two important indicators of plaque instability. Apoptotic macrophage death results in enlargement of the plaque necrotic core and positive vascular remodelling, whereas apoptosis of the smooth muscle cells leads to attenuation of the fibrous cap. Imaging of apoptotic cells with annexin A5 provides an opportunity for the non-invasive assessment of cell death, and hence plaque vulnerability. The clinical detection of apoptosis could therefore promote the development of novel intervention strategies.
