FDG-PET scanning in the management of cancer of the oesophagus and oesophagogastric junction: early experience with 100 consecutive cases. The aim was to evaluate the impact of FDG-PET scan on tumour staging and management decisions in oesophageal cancer.One-hundred consecutive patients referred for consideration of surgery underwent a whole body FDG-PET scan in addition to CT imaging.Based on CT scan, a curative approach could be considered in 62 patients. The PET scan altered regional nodal (N) staging in 16 patients overall, but did not alter management decisions. Metastatic status (M) was increased in 14 patients, with altered management in 10/62 (16%). Nine were downstaged, with management changed in 3/38 (8%). Seventeen patients underwent 19 additional tests to clarify findings on PET, in 15 patients (88%) the tests revealed no pathology.FDG-PET alters M stage in 23% of patients and may impact on surgical decision-making. The spurious investigations and cost of the high false-positive rate of further tests is of concern.
