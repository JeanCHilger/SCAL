Animal models of neurodegenerative disease: insights from in vivo imaging studies. Animal models have been used extensively to understand the etiology and pathophysiology of human neurodegenerative diseases, and are an essential component in the development of therapeutic interventions for these disorders. In recent years, technical advances in imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have allowed the use of these techniques for the evaluation of functional, neurochemical, and anatomical changes in the brains of animals. Combining animal models of neurodegenerative disorders with neuroimaging provides a powerful tool to follow the disease process, to examine compensatory mechanisms, and to investigate the effects of potential treatments preclinically to derive knowledge that will ultimately inform our clinical decisions. This article reviews the literature on the use of PET and MRI in animal models of Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, and evaluates the strengths and limitations of brain imaging in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases.
