The expanding role of left ventricular functional assessment using gated myocardial perfusion SPECT: the supporting actor is stealing the scene. Gating of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has significantly improved the reliability and diagnostic accuracy of myocardial perfusion imaging. The functional parameters derived from this technique, mainly left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction, have been demonstrated to be accurate and reproducible. They are able to increase the detection of severe and extensive coronary artery disease and show a significant incremental prognostic power over perfusion abnormalities. Therefore, the importance given to gated SPECT functional data has progressively grown.This circumstance has further expanded the indications for myocardial perfusion imaging and strengthened its position among the different imaging modalities. Moreover, several studies show that the evaluation of ventricular function may have a leading part in justifying the execution of perfusion scintigraphy in various clinical conditions.Aim of this review is to describe this evolution of gated SPECT functional assessment from a supporting rank with respect to perfusion, to a main actor position in the field of cardiac imaging.
