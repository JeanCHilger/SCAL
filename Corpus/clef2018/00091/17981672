Subarachnoid hemorrhage: effect on cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolism. Alterations in cerebral blood flow and metabolism after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are well known and have been extensively described. Many techniques exist in the intensive care setting to monitor for these alterations. Ranging from classic neurological exam to novel imaging studies a variety of modalities are available for intensive monitoring. Early identification of cerebral vasospasm is the key to prevention of its long term complications and as such the role of genetics and biochemical markers are currently being investigated. The dynamics of cerebral blood flow and metabolism following SAH are unique and require additional studies before any monitoring technique can be used as stand alone modality and supplant the DSA as the gold standard for detection of cerebral vasospasm.
