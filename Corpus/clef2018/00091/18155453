Mid-term outcome of positron emission tomography/computed tomography-assisted radiofrequency ablation in primary and secondary liver tumours--a single-centre experience. To determine the mid-term results of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of malignant liver tumours when using FDG-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/computed tomography for tumour evaluation and follow-up.Between January 2002 and June 2006, 55 patients (mean age 63 years) with 78 liver lesions (39 colorectal metastases, 39 hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] nodules) were treated with RFA. All patients received PET/computed tomography before intervention. RFA was performed under computed tomography guidance with conscious sedation. Post-interventional PET/computed tomography was carried out in PET-positive patients 24h after the ablation and was repeated at 1, 3 and 6 months and every 6 months after the intervention. PET-negative patients received contrast-enhanced computed tomography at the same time points. The rate of local tumour progression (LTP) and survival rates were assessed for the whole patient population.The 78 lesions (mean size 2.3 cm, range 0.8-5 cm) were treated with 101 consecutive ablation procedures resulting in a technical success rate of 96%. The mean time of follow-up was 25+/-12 months. Thirty-five of 78 tumours (45%) developed LTP. At the end of follow-up, LTP was found in 22 patients (40%), with intra- and extrahepatic recurrence in 11 patients. Twenty-two patients remained free of hepatic tumours. The 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates were 85, 74 and 58%, respectively. Tumour entity, lesion size and localisation were significant risk factors for LTP.Computed tomography-guided RFA of malignant liver tumours is effective, but shows a high rate of LTP. PET/computed tomography supports RFA by early identification of residual tumour or LTP.
