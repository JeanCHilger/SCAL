Role of PET-CT with 18-FDG in the management of UADT squamous-cell carcinomas: a retrospective study of 43 cases. The aim of our retrospective study was to evaluate the role of PET-CT in the management of upper-aerodigestive tract (UADT) squamous-cell carcinomas.Our study included 43 patients with UADT squamous-cell carcinomas having undergone PET-CT for: initial staging (n=20), diagnosis of recurrent disease (n=16), and response to treatment (n=7).PET-CT diagnosed distant metastases missed by conventional imaging in four patients (20%) in initial staging, four patients (25%) in diagnosis of recurrent disease, and two patients (29%) in response to treatment. Overall, PET-CT induced a shift in the management of 10 patients (28%).Our study and other publications suggest that PET-CT should be used in: initial staging in Stage III and IV detection of recurrent disease
