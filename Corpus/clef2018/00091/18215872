Quantitative PET with positron emitters that emit prompt gamma rays. The purpose of this work was to determine the feasibility of using positron emitting isotopes that emit prompt gammas to acquire quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) data using standard PET instrumentation. Prompt gammas can contaminate PET data by increasing dead time, converting singles into invalid coincidences, and producing multiple coincidences which can lead to the replacement of valid coincidences by invalid coincidences. The measurements in this work were made by scanning point sources containing F-18, Na-22, and Co-60 and studying the effects of the prompt gammas on the PET data, We found that for the Na-22 point source, the annihilation photon coincidence rate was about 25 times the prompt gamma-annihilation photon coincidence rate in the entire active volume of the scanner. With scatter, the Na-22 prompt gamma-annihilation photon coincidence rate was 1.3 times higher than the F-18 scatter coincidence rate. The most significant effect of the prompt gamma was to increase dead time the dead time correction factor for Cu-60 was 2.4 times higher than the correction factor for N-13 for the same source activity. We conclude that, in many cases, quantitative PET data can be readily obtained with isotopes that emit prompt gammas, using standard PET 2-D instrumentation. However there are some cases, such as 3-D PET, where prompt gammas could significantly contaminate the PET data.
