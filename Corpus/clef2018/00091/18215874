An evaluation of the algorithms for determining local cerebral metabolic rates of glucose using positron emission tomography dynamic data. Measurement of the local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (LCMRGlc) and the individual rate constant parameters of the [(18 )F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) model can provide a clearer understanding and insight to the physiological processes in the human brain, and a quicker and more accurate means of diagnosis in clinical applications. A systematic study using simulated and clinical tissue time activity data is presented to evaluate several existing and newly developed major algorithms used for determining LCMRGlc and the individual rate constants from positron emission tomography dynamic data. The computational and statistical properties of the autoradiographic approach, weighted and unweighted nonlinear least squares methods, Patlak graphic approach, weighted integration method, linear least squares and generalized linear least squares methods are investigated and discussed in this paper.
