Performance evaluation of an iterative image reconstruction algorithm for positron emission tomography. An image reconstruction method motivated by positron emission tomography (PET) is discussed. The measurements tend to be noisy and so the reconstruction method should incorporate the statistical nature of the noise. The authors set up a discrete model to represent the physical situation and arrive at a nonlinear maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) formulation of the problem. An iterative approach which requires the solution of simple quadratic equations is proposed. The authors also present a methodology which allows them to experimentally optimize an image reconstruction method for a specific medical task and to evaluate the relative efficacy of two reconstruction methods for a particular task in a manner which meets the high standards set by the methodology of statistical hypothesis testing. The new MAP algorithm is compared to a method which maximizes likelihood and with two variants of the filtered backprojection method.
