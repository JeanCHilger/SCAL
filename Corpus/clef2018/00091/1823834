Radiopharmaceutical therapy of malignant pheochromocytoma with [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine: results from ten years of experience. Twenty-eight patients with histologically proven metastatic or invasive, unresectable pheochromocytomas, which were shown to concentrate and retain tracer doses of [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG), were treated with therapeutic quantities of this radiopharmaceutical. Between one and six doses ranging from 97 to 301 mCi (cumulative dose 111-916 mCi) were administered. Partial response in tumor size was achieved in 8/28 patients and partial biochemical responses in 12/28 patients. No pharmacological toxicity was observed. Mild radiation sickness (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) occurred in 21/28. Minor degrees of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 3/28. There were three cases of hypothyroidism but no significant hepatic, renal, adrenocortical or autonomic nervous dysfunction. We conclude that therapeutic 131I-MIBG can achieve significant therapeutic responses in some cases of malignant pheochromocytoma without pharmacological toxicity and only mild radiotoxicity.
