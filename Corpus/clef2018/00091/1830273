Initial experience with SPECT examinations using [123I]IBZM as a D2-dopamine receptor antagonist in Parkinson's disease. [123I]IBZM is a new radioactive labelled ligand which has a high affinity and specificity to D2-dopamine receptors. The in vivo kinetics of [123I]IBZM were studied in patients with unilateral and bilateral accentuated idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The uptake in the basal ganglias and the imaging properties of this D2 receptor antagonist as a radiopharmaceutical for SPECT examinations had to be investigated. 5 patients, aged 42-66 years, (2 m/3 f) were examined. Each patient received 185 MBq [123I]IBZM intravenously. Blood samples were taken 0-120 min post injection (p.i.) and time activity curves were plotted. Three SPECT examinations were performed (I: 30-50 min II: 50-70 min
