Salmonella in free-living exotic and native turtles and in pet exotic turtles from SW Spain. We screened 78 native and 94 exotic turtles from natural ponds and 39 exotic pet turtles for presence of Salmonella, resulting with infection rates of 6.61%, 6.4%, and 5.1%, respectively. Concurrent shedding of multiple serotypes of the bacteria was only detected in one pet turtle. Eleven isolates were obtained in free-living turtles, including serotypes commonly found in reptiles and also the serotype Typhimurium, which is commonly related to human infections. In pet turtles, the five serotypes isolated were different to those isolated in free-living turtles and had been reported to cause reptile-associated salmonellosis in humans. These results confirm the risk of transmission of Salmonella from free-living and pet turtles to humans, demanding the necessity of regulation of pet turtle trade in Europe.
