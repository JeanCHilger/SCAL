Synthesis and radiation dosimetry of 4-borono-2-[18F]fluoro-D,L-phenylalanine: a target compound for PET and boron neutron capture therapy. The 18F-labeling of 4-borono-D-L-phenylalanine (BPA), a potential target compound for cancer treatment with boron neutron capture therapy, is described. By direct fluorination of BPA with [18F]AcOF or [18F]F2 followed by HPLC separation, 4-borono-2-[18F]fluoro-D,L-phenylalanine was prepared with radiochemical yields of 25-35% and with a radiochemical purity of over 99%. The tissue distribution study showed that the compound has potential as a tracer for pancreas imaging with positron emission tomography. Radiation dosimetry is also described.
