Evaluation of prefrontal-hippocampal effective connectivity following 24 hours of estrogen infusion: an FDG-PET study. Although several functional neuroimaging studies have addressed the relevance of hormones to cerebral function, none have evaluated the effects of hormones on network effective connectivity. Since estrogen enhances synaptic connectivity and has been shown to drive activity across neural systems, and because the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are putative targets for the effects of estrogen, we hypothesized that effective connectivity between these regions would be enhanced by an estrogen challenge. In order to test this hypothesis, FDG-PET scans were collected in eleven postmenopausal women at baseline and 24h after a graded estrogen infusion. Subtraction analysis (SA) was conducted to identify sites of increased cerebral glucose uptake (CMRglc) during estrogen infusion. The lateral PFC and hippocampus were a priori sites for activation SA identified the right superior frontal gyrus (RSFG
