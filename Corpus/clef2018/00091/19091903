18F-FDG PET/CT for monitoring the response of lymphoma to radioimmunotherapy. We retrospectively evaluated 18F-FDG PET/CT for monitoring the response of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to radioimmunotherapy.A total of 33 clinical patients received 131I-tositumomab (n=23) or 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (n=10) and underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT scans before radioimmunotherapy and at 12 wk after radioimmunotherapy. A third scan was performed on 13 patients at 24 wk after radioimmunotherapy, 12 of whom did not receive interval therapy. Tumor metabolic activity was assessed before and after radioimmunotherapy visually and quantitatively by lean maximum standardized uptake value (SUVlean max). Response was assessed by the International Workshop Criteria (IWC) and Revised IWC, which includes 18F-FDG PET (IWC-PET).Mean SUVlean max decreased from baseline in 244 target lesions 12 wk after radioimmunotherapy (from 6.51+/-4.05 to 3.94+/-4.41 P<0.01), regardless of response at 12 wk after radioimmunotherapy (P<or=0.02). After radioimmunotherapy, SUVlean max was lower for responders than for nonresponders (P<or=0.01). Median percentage change in SUVlean max of target lesions per patient was -51% (-95% to 97%). No significant difference in decline in SUVlean max between patients who received 131I-tositumomab and those who received 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan was demonstrated (-31%+/-51% vs. -47%+/-46%In non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 18F-FDG uptake in tumors typically drops significantly after radioimmunotherapy. A continued decline in tumor SUVlean max between 12 and 24 wk without additional therapy can occur, suggesting a need for delayed-response assessment. In patients who progress after radioimmunotherapy, new sites of disease commonly develop, rather than recurrence or progression at previous disease sites. Large declines in 18F-FDG uptake tend to be seen in those with the longest progression-free survival.
