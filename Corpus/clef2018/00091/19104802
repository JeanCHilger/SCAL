Combined PET/MRI: a new dimension in whole-body oncology imaging? Hybrid imaging systems providing morphological and functional data in a single session have been available for oncological imaging for some time. So far, computed tomography (CT) has been the morphological method-of-choice for inclusion into these hybrid imaging systems. However, recently, research has focused on hardware-based fusion of function with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rather than CT.Now that the first head-only positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI systems have been installed and whole-body systems are to be expected in the near future, potential indications in clinical oncology have to be addressed.This article discusses potential indications of PET/MRI in whole-body oncology imaging. Potential advantages and disadvantages compared with currently available hybrid imaging systems will be reviewed.
