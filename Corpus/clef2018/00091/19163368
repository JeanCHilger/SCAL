A new method based on both fuzzy set and possibility theories for tumor volume segmentation on PET images. A new automatic method for tumor volume segmentation on PET images has been developed. The method introduced in this paper is based on previous works in MRA segmentation and involves both fuzzy set and possibility theories. Visual results prove the method efficiency which is confirmed by obtained Jaccard index.
