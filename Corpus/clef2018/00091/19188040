The outcomes after surgical resection in pancreatic endocrine tumors: an institutional experience. Sporadic pancreatic endocrine tumors (PET) can be managed surgically with excellent outcomes. The aim of this study was to analyze surgical outcomes and factors influencing survival.Between 1995 and 2007, 96 patients with sporadic PET who underwent surgery at our institution were retrospectively reviewed for clinicopathologic variables and outcomes according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classifications.Thirty-nine patients had well-differentiated tumors (WDT) with benign behavior, 23 had uncertain behavior, 27 had low-grade carcinoma, and 7 were diagnosed with high-grade carcinoma. R0 resection was performed in 84 patients. No recurrence was observed in WDT regardless of its behavior or curability but 16 of 34 patients with carcinoma had recurrence. Five-year overall survival (OS) for R0-resected patients with carcinoma was 57%, and OS at 3 years for R1/R2-resected patients was 23% (P = 0.012). The WHO classification and R0 resection were independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis.This single institutional experience demonstrated that surgical resection is curative for WDT and recurrences are frequent in spite of curative resection for malignant PET. The WHO classification and R0 resection remained independent prognostic factor.
