Whole-body MRI for primary evaluation of malignant disease in children. The aim of this study was to compare diagnostic accuracy of whole-body (WB) MRI to a combined reference standard of conventional cross-sectional imaging methods and FDG-PET in the detection of malignant disease spread in children.24 children (age between 5 and 18 years) with malignant diseases (mainly Hodgkin's lymphoma and different types of sarcoma) initially examined with conventional cross-sectional imaging methods (ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging) were examined prospectively with whole-body MRI (1.5T) and FDG-PET. Studies were read by two nuclear medicine physicians (FDG-PET) and two radiologists (WB-MRI) independently in a blinded manner and each study type was evaluated in consensus. The reference standard was defined as pathological lesions detected in the same location both in FDG-PET and another conventional cross-sectional imaging method.Overall 190 lesions were detected by WB-MRI and 155 lesion were found by FDG-PET. 106 lesions fulfilled the criteria of the reference standard (42 osseous and 64 extraosseous lesions) from which 102 were detected by WB-MRI (sensitivity of 96%). All bone lesions were detected and extra-skeletal lesions were identified with a sensitivity of 93.8%. Overall 88 lesions detected by WB-MRI were not part of the reference standard from which 33 were lesions of the peripheral skeleton not imaged by conventional cross-sectional imaging studies. 4 lesions of the reference standard were not identified by WB-MRI which were all lymph nodes.WB-MRI is a radiation free imaging technique with high sensitivity for the detection of malignant disease spread in particular beneficial for children. In patients with suspected bone lesions it should be considered for initial disease evaluation prior to specific and regional imaging methods to reduce the overall number of imaging examinations and radiation exposure.
