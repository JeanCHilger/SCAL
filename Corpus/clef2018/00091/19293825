Early metabolic characteristics of lesion and nonlesion tissue after head injury. We defined lesion and structurally normal regions using magnetic resonance imaging at follow-up in patients recovering from head injury. Early metabolic characteristics in these regions of interest (ROIs) were compared with physiology in healthy volunteers. Fourteen patients with severe head injury had positron emission tomography within 72 h, and magnetic resonance imaging at 3 to 18 months after injury. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen utilization (CMRO(2)), and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) were all lower in lesion ROIs, compared with nonlesion and control ROIs (P<0.001) however, there was substantial overlap in physiology. Control ROIs showed close coupling among CBF, blood volume (CBV), and CMRO(2), whereas relationships within lesion and nonlesion ROIs were abnormal. The relationship between CBF and CMRO(2) generally remained coupled but the slope was reduced
