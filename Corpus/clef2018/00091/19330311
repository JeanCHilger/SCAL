Large-vessel vasculitis. Imaging and interventional therapy. Giant cell arteritis and Takayasu's arteritis are classified as primary large-vessel vasculitides. Inflammatory cell infiltrates and cytokines induce destruction and hyperplasia of the vessel wall, leading to stenoses or aneurysms. When extracranial large arteries are involved, there is often a similar clinical and radiologic disease pattern of an inflammatory aortic arch syndrome. Rare causes of large-vessel vasculitis include Beh√ßet's disease, association with other autoimmune diseases, and infection. Depending on the localization, imaging is usually performed by means of duplex ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or positron emission tomography. These imaging modalities are used not only to establish the diagnosis but also to determine the disease extent and activity and to perform follow-up in the course of medical therapy. Angiography offers the option to perform interventional therapy for vascular stenoses and occlusions.
