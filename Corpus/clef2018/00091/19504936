Effect of clay content and speed screw rotation on the crystallization and thermal behaviors of recycled PET/clay nanocomposites. Nanocomposites of recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (rPET) containing 2.5 wt% and 5.0 wt% of montmorillonite modified with organophilic quaternary ammonium salt (DELLITE 67G) were prepared by melt compounding using a co-rotating twin-screw type extruder with two organoclay contents were used: 2.5 wt% and 5.0 wt% and were prepared using two different rotation speeds: 150 and 250 rpm. Thermal characterization (analysis) of the nanocomposites was performed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The results from DSC measurements showed that the addition of organoclay affects recycled PET's crystallization for two screw rotation speeds studies. The nucleating effect of organoclay was investigated. Morphological analysis using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) revealed the presence of fully exfoliated clay platelets in samples prepared at 150 rpm.
