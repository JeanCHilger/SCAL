Neuroimaging of schizophrenia: what it reveals about the disease and what it tells us about a patient. Neuroimaging in psychiatry, and in schizophrenia in particular, moves ahead at a rapid pace delivering new insights into the nature of the illness and its intriguing symptoms via technologies such as MRI, fMRI, PET, and SPET scanning. How do these impact on understanding the patient in front of us? What do they mean for the busy clinician in clinic? We outline some of the recent findings in neuroimaging research of schizophrenia and consider their potential application in clinical practice.
