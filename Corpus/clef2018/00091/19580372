Parental attitudes toward new dosage forms of desloratadine in an online survey: results from four European countries. Allergic disease affects an estimated 50% of children worldwide and causes considerable impairment in academic performance and daily activities. Pediatric formulations for allergy treatment are often highly sugared or contain ingredients to improve palatability, appearance, and patient acceptance/adherence. These excipients, however, are associated with dental caries, gastrointestinal intolerance, and dermatologic reactions.To assess the appeal of new sugar-free/dye-free syrup and orodispersible formulations of the second-generation antihistamine desloratadine to parents of children with allergy in four European countries.In an online survey of households with children aged < or =12 years with allergies in France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain, respondents were asked to consider one of two desloratadine product concepts: a sugar-free, dye-free oral solution or an orodispersible tablet.Eligible households had to have at least one child aged < or =12 years with symptomatic seasonal, pet, or indoor allergies or hives for > or =1 week/year. Respondents had to be the decision makers regarding their child's allergy medication and to be likely to treat symptoms with prescription medication some of the time.There were 627 eligible households. Most (88%) parents in Spain were likely to ask their physician about and to consider trying sugar-free, dye-free desloratadine syrup, followed by 76% of those in France, 68% in Italy, and 56% in the Netherlands. About three-quarters of parents in France, Spain, and Italy and more than half of those in the Netherlands were likely to ask their physician about and to consider trying the orodispersible formulation.There is no control group for comparisons between the study's online responses and those that would have resulted from another survey methodology. Further, response biases do exist across countries based on cultural norms.Survey respondents were generally receptive to the new sugar-free, dye-free syrup and orodispersible tablet formulations of the second-generation antihistamine desloratadine. At least half of parents surveyed indicated their willingness to try the new products.
