Changes in the relationships between dogs, owners and veterinarians in Norway and Iceland. Norwegian and Icelandic dog owners were interviewed about aspects of their dog keeping and their attitudes to the veterinary profession. Dogs were found to play an important role in the lives of their owners, who had high expectations of their veterinarians, not only with respect to the treatment of their dogs but also with respect to themselves as clients. About one-third of owners reported problems related to a lack of trust and poor communications in encounters with their veterinarians.
