Cerebral metabolism and sleep homeostasis: a comment on Vyazovskiy et al. In this journal, Vyazovskiy et al. reported deoxyglucose data that they interpreted as supporting the Tononi and Cirelli hypothesis that cerebral metabolic rate (CMR) increases across waking. We summarize contradictory PET-deoxyglucose data that show CMR is the same in the morning and evening and that it decreases rather than increases after a night of sleep deprivation. We propose an alternative model of CMR-sleep homeostasis relations that points to novel experiments.
