Pet-associated infections. Pet-related infections in humans are diverse, rather infrequent considering the high number of pets in households and often unrecognized. This article briefly covers a couple of them, caused by bacteria (salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis, cat-scratch disease, fish tank granuloma, psittacosis), fungi (dermatophytosis), viruses (lymphocytic choriomeningitis) and parasites (toxoplasmosis, toxocariasis, cutaneous larva migrans, echinococcosis) and describes their epidemiology and clinical presentation. Widening of public tastes in this area opens doors for emerging diseases (e.g. Cowpox virus with rats).
