Antigen-induced phospholipase D activation in rat mast cells is independent of protein kinase C. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) in antigen (Ag, DNP-Ascaris suum)-induced phospholipase D (PLD) activation of rat peritoneal mast cells. Phorbor myristate acetate (PMA) as well as Ag activated PLD as inferred by phosphatidylethanol (PEt) production. PKC inhibitors, staurosporine and H-7, however, failed to suppress PMA-stimulated PLD activation, suggesting that PLD activation by PMA is independent of PKC. By contrast, Ag-stimulated PLD activity was significantly reduced by staurosporine and slightly by H-7. Surprisingly, the inhibitors inhibited Ag-stimulated phospholipase C (PLC), correlated to the inhibition of PLD. These observations lead us to conclude that in Ag-stimulated mast cells 1,2-diacylglycerol (DG) formed by PLC directly or indirectly stimulates PLD, independently of PKC.
