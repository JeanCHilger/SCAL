Chemoradiotherapy in the management of primary squamous-cell carcinoma of the rectum. To assess the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy in the management of primary squamous-cell carcinoma of the rectum.Nine patients with primary squamous-cell carcinoma of the rectum were treated with chemoradiotherapy from 1985 to 2007. All patients were female, with a mean age of 54 years (range 41-72 years). The mean distance of the tumour from the anal verge was 6 cm (range 4-10 cm). Seven patients were treated with curative intent (two postoperative, three preoperative, two chemoradiotherapy alone). Clinical stages for the curative group were T1N0M0 (1), T3N0M0 (3), T3N1M0 (1) and T4N0M0 (2). Chemoradiotherapy consisted of pelvic radiation 45-54 Gy in 1.8 Gy/fraction and concurrent 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C. The mean follow-up duration for the curative group was 39 months (range 15-120 months).All seven patients treated with curative intent achieved local control. A complete pathological response was seen in all patients after preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Two patients did not have surgery and remained free of disease. One patient with gross residual disease after surgery achieved local control. 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity was detected in all patients who had FDG-PET scans. Both primary and metastatic tumours demonstrated FDG-avidity.Primary squamous-cell carcinoma of the rectum appears to be very sensitive to chemoradiotherapy. The high complete response rate suggests that chemoradiotherapy alone with salvage surgery for local failure should be further explored. FDG-PET scan may have a role to play in the management of this disease.
