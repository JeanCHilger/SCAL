Myocardial perfusion imaging does not adequately assess the risk of coronary artery disease in patients with atrial fibrillation. The role of coronary artery disease (CAD) in atrial fibrillation (AF) is poorly investigated. This study investigated the value of myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in the assessment of risk of CAD in patients with a history of AF.Out of consecutive patients without previous coronary angiogram or history of CAD referred for SPECT, patients with a history of AF (n = 129) were compared with age- and gender-matched controls (n = 124). Primary endpoint was positive SPECT, i.e. unambiguous signs of ischaemia. There was no significant difference with regard to positive SPECT outcome between AF patients and controls (14 patients, 11% vs. 21 patients, 17% P = 0.16). Coronary angiography (CAG) performed after SPECT demonstrated a higher yield of positive SPECT regarding significant CAD in control patients (10 out of 15 patients, 67%) than in AF patients (2 out of 13 patients, 15%Positive SPECT outcome was similar in patients with AF and in controls. Nevertheless, in AF patients a positive SPECT outcome was less often related to significant CAD in those patients who subsequently underwent CAG. These results emphasize the need for new non-invasive techniques to adequately assess the risk of significant CAD in AF patients.
