(18)F Labeled benzimidazole derivatives as potential radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) tumor imaging. This article reported the synthesis and bioevaluation of two [(18)F] labeled benzimidazole derivatives, 4-(5-(2-[(18)F] fluoro-4-nitrobenzamido)-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl) butanoic acid ([(18)F] FNBMBBA, [(18)F]a1) and 3-(2-fluoroethyl)-7-methyl-2-propyl-3H-benzimidazole-5-carboxylic acid ([(18)F] FEMPBBA, [(18)F]b1) for PET tumor imaging. The preparation [(18)F] FEMPBBA was completed in 1h with overall radiochemical yield of 50-60% (without decay corrected). Biodistribution assay in S180 tumor bearing mice of both compounds were carried out, and the results are both meaningful. [(18)F] FEMPBBA which can be taken as a revision of [(18)F] FNBMBBA got an excellent result, and has significant advantages in some aspects compared with L-[(18)F] FET and [(18)F]-FDG in the same animal model, especially in tumor/brain uptake ratio. The tumor/brain uptake ratio of [(18)F] FEMPBBA gets to 4.81, 7.15, and 9.8 at 30min, 60min and 120min, and is much higher than that of L-[(18)F] FET (2.54, 2.92 and 2.95) and [(18)F]-FDG (0.61, 1.02, 1.33) at the same time point. The tumor/muscle and tumor/blood uptake ratio of [(18)F] FEMPBBA is also higher than that of L-[(18)F] FET at 30min and 60min. This result indicates compound [(18)F] FEMPBBA is a promising radiotracer for PET tumor imaging.
