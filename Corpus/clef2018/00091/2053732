Fungal flora of the coat of pet cats. The fungal flora of the coat of 172 healthy pet cats was examined qualitatively. Fungi were isolated from 136 (79%) of the 172 cats. Fifteen genera were isolated 13 are commonly regarded as saprophytes, and 2 (Microsporum and Trichophyton) are commonly regarded as pathogens. Aspergillus, Alternaria, Penicillium, and Cladosporium spp were the most frequently isolated saprophytes. Dermatophytic fungi, including Microsporum gypseum (n = 1), M vanbreuseghemii (n = 1), and Trichophyton rubrum (n = 14), were recovered from 16 cats. Microsporum canis was not isolated from any cat during this study.
