Pets-related peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis: companion animals or trojan horses? Infectious peritonitis is still a major concern in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Standard antibiotic regimens target common causative microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. When the infection does not respond, unusual infective agents are to be considered including zoonoses-infections with an animal source. Companion animals or occupations involving animal contact favor the development of zoonoses, especially for immunocompromised patients such as those with end-stage renal disease. We reviewed the literature for all animals-related peritonitis in PD and analyzed data from our own PD unit and from the French-speaking registry for peritoneal dialyis (RDPLF) to assess both the frequency and the potential risk for PD patients in owning a pet or to working with animals. In a literature search, we identified 124 cases of PD peritonitis caused by 12 different zoonotic agents. Animals were involved in 24% of the cases. Overall mortality rate was 13.5% and Tenckhoff catheters had to be removed in 27% of the cases. The results from RDPLF analysis show that zoonotic microorganisms were responsible for 0.54% of the peritonitis episodes (51 out of a total of 9433 during a 9-year period). In our unit, zoonotic microorganisms were responsible for 0.03% of the peritonitis episodes (four out of a total of 128 during a 9-year period). Considering those results, some specific treatment recommendations can be made, but the major factor still remains prevention, by insisting on strict hygenic measures when a PD patient owns a pet.
