Cancerous tumors are formed by characteristically high levels of proliferating cells that have a constant high requirement for basic building blocks such as carbohydrates, nucleotides, and amino acids (AA) to maintain a suitable metabolic rate and to continue the synthesis of macromolecules such as DNA and proteins to sustain their phenotype (1). Because of the high carbohydrate demand of tumor cells, (
