 The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates biological activity through an intracellular tyrosine kinase signaling pathway. This receptor is known to be overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies, and the degree of expression often indicates the clinical outcome for the patient (1). Blocking EGFR activity appears to be an effective approach for the treatment of cancers, and a variety of agents, including monoclonal antibodies (MAb), have been developed for this purpose (2). The human-mouse chimeric MAb C225 was developed to target the EGFR and was demonstrated to inhibit the tyrosine kinase signaling pathway of this receptor. C225 was also shown to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cell lines expressing EGFR (3). This MAb is currently being evaluated in several clinical trials for the treatment of human breast, colon, head and neck, lung, prostate, and cervical cancers (4, 5). However, to determine the possible response of a patient, it is necessary to evaluate the degree of EGFR expression in the tumors by immunohistology before and after the MAb treatment. This is an invasive procedure and, because of tumor heterogeneity and metastasis, some tumors may be inaccessible and may be overlooked during patient evaluation (5). Therefore, a radiochemical targeted to the EGFR would be a useful tool to determine the level of EGFR expression in the tumor cells and could help select patients who are most likely to benefit from MAb therapy (5). Using diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), the radioactive metal chelator indium (
