Meta-[radioiodinated]iodobenzylguanidine Meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a norepinephrine (NE) analog that contains a benzyl and a guanidine group. Because it structurally resembles NE, neuroendocrine cells take up MIBG through an active mechanism and store it in the neurosecretory granules. This leads to specific concentration of the molecule in the neuroendocrine cells. MIBG radiolabeled with iodine (as
