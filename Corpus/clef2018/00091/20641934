 Chemotactic cytokines, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (chemotactic protein-1 MCP-1), play a pivotal role in the inflammatory process associated with the development and progression of atherosclerosis (1, 2). MCP-1, a low molecular weight monomeric peptide (9â€“15 kDa), is initially upregulated at the site of vessel wall injury by vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) and endothelial cells (3). MCP-1, in interaction with several cytokines and cell adhesion molecules, mediates the transendothelial migration of monocytes to the subendothelial layer
