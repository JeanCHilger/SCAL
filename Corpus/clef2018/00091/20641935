 The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a membrane-bound glycoprotein that possesses different peptidase activities (see Table above), is expressed mainly in the prostate epithelium. Because of its overexpression in primary, metastatic or hormone-refractory prostate and other cancers, including the neovasculature of solid tumors, this antigen is considered to be a cancer marker and a good target for imaging agents and therapy (1). Hence, PSMA has been targeted in several clinical trials that have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of prostate cancer. In addition, capromab pendetide, a commercially available monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds to the intracellular domain of the PSMA and was approved by the FDA for the diagnostic imaging of prostate cancer, has limited use because the MAb binds primarily to necrotic parts of the tumor and may not detect any viable malignant tumor cells (2). Investigators have also developed and evaluated MAbs directed against the extracellular domains of PSMA, and after preclinical studies they reported that these MAbs could be of potential use in the detection and treatment of PSMA-positive cancers (3-5). However, results obtained from a phase I clinical trial to evaluate the use of
