Preoperative combined 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography imaging in head and neck cancer: does it really improve initial N staging? In our experience PET-CT cannot yet reliably predict the need for surgical neck dissection in patients with N0 neck. According to the results of PET-CT the neck dissection should be extended towards unusual lymph node areas.To analyze the value of PET-CT for the initial N staging, comparing PET-CT data with histopathological results of the modified radical neck dissection.Fifty patients with previously untreated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were eligible for inclusion in this study. Modified radical unilateral or bilateral neck dissection was performed in all patients. PET-CT findings and histological findings were compared to determine their diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.In all, 105 levels had pathologically diagnosed metastases: PET-CT was positive in 87 levels and negative in 18 levels. Also, 399 levels had negative postoperative histology findings: PET-CT was positive in 24 levels and negative in 375 levels. The false-positive over-staged and the false-negative under-staged rates were 27% and 12%, respectively.
