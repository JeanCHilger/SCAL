The role of selective venous sampling in the management of persistent hyperparathyroidism revisited. Localization studies are mandatory prior to revision surgery in patients with persistent hyperparathyroidism in order to improve surgical outcome and reduce the risk of lengthy explorations. However, in this case, noninvasive localization studies are reported to have a poor sensitivity. The aim of our study is to determine the accuracy of selective venous sampling (SVS) for parathyroid hormone (PTH) in localizing residual hyperactive parathyroid glands in patients with persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism.We retrospectively evaluated the localizing accuracy of 20 PTH SVS performed prior to revision surgery in 18 patients with persistent or recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism (n=11) or autonomous (tertiary) hyperparathyroidism (n=7). Tc99m-methoxy-isobutyle-isonitrile (MIBI)-single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was also performed in all patients prior to revision surgery. Operative and pathological data were obtained from hospital records.The SVS was able to accurately localize 15 of the 20 pathological glands removed at revision surgery, representing a sensitivity of 75%. This sensitivity is significantly higher than that of Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT, which was only 30% (P=0.012).Our findings demonstrate that SVS is a valuable localization study in patients with persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism, with a sensitivity significantly higher than that of Tc99m-MIBI-SPECT. Our data suggest that SVS represents a useful addition to the preoperative workup of these patients prior to revision surgery.
