Imaging dopamine transporters in Parkinson's disease. The dopamine transporter (DAT) is responsible for clearance of dopamine from the synaptic cleft after its release. Imaging DAT availability provides a measure of dopamine terminal function and a method for detecting striatal dopamine deficiency states present in idiopathic Parkinson's disease and atypical neurodegenerative Parkinsonian disorders such as multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy. DAT imaging with PET or single photon emission computed tomography can be used to support a diagnosis of dopamine-deficient parkinsonism in cases where this is suspected and rationalize the use of dopaminergic agents as therapy. It can also detect subclinical dopaminergic dysfunction when present in subjects at risk of Parkinson's disease, such as relatives of patients, susceptibility gene mutation carriers, and subjects with late-onset hyposmia or sleep disorders. Finally, the presence of normal DAT availability on imaging can help exclude nondopamine-deficient syndromes, such as dystonic and severe essential tremors, drug-induced and psychogenic parkinsonism that, on occasion, mimic Parkinson's disease.
