Biocompatible inorganic nanoparticles for [18F]-fluoride binding with applications in PET imaging. A wide selection of insoluble nanoparticulate metal salts was screened for avid binding of [(18)F]-fluoride. Hydroxyapatite and aluminium hydroxide nanoparticles showed particularly avid and stable binding of [(18)F]-fluoride in various biological media. The in vivo behaviour of the [(18)F]-labelled hydroxyapatite and aluminium hydroxide particles was determined by PET-CT imaging in mice. [(18)F]-labelled hydroxyapatite was stable in circulation and when trapped in various tissues (lung embolisation, Subcutaneous and intramuscular), but accumulation in liver via reticuloendothelial clearance was followed by gradual degradation and release of [(18)F]-fluoride (over a period of 4 h) which accumulated in bone. [(18)F]-labelled aluminium hydroxide was also cleared to liver and spleen but degraded slightly even without liver uptake (Subcutaneous and intramuscular). Both materials have properties that are an attractive basis for the design of molecular targeted PET imaging agents labelled with (18)F.
