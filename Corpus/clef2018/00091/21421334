Myocardial MIBG scintigraphy may predict the course of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. The metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy is a well established nuclear medicine method to support the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. In this study we examined the predictive value of the MIBG scintigraphy concerning the severity and progression of the parkinsonian motor symptoms.This study included 40 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (age 56 ± 9 years, Hoehn and Yahr stage 1.4 ± 0.7, mean ± standard deviation). All patients underwent a baseline visit and a follow-up visit 3-8 years (5.3 ± 1.6 years) after the baseline visit. (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy was performed only once at the baseline visit. At both visits the motor symptoms bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, postural tremor and axial symptoms were quantified by means of the motor part of the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale.The myocardial MIBG uptake correlated significantly with the annual progress of rigidity (r=-0.41, p<0.05 Pearson's correlation) and axial symptoms (r=-0.49, p<0.01). There was no significant correlation (p>0.05) between the initial myocardial MIBG uptake and the annual progress of the other motor symptoms.The MIBG scintigraphy may predict the velocity of progress of rigidity and axial symptoms in the following 3-8 years. Such a prediction is not possible for the other motor symptoms resting tremor, postural tremor and bradykinesia.
