Bortezomib combined with rituximab and dexamethasone is an active regimen for patients with relapsed and chemotherapy-refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Bortezomib belongs to a new class of anti-cancer agents, the proteasome inhibitors, and has documented activity in multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Preclinical studies suggest that bortezomib has synergistic activity with rituximab, which provides a rationale for the exploration of treatment combinations.The activity and safety of bortezomib in combination with rituximab and dexamethasone were investigated in patients with relapsed or chemotherapy-refractory mantle cell lymphoma. A treatment cycle consisted of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m² on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 six 21-day cycles), rituximab (375 mg/m², day 1) and dexamethasone (40 mg orally, days 1 to 4). Responding patients received four consolidating doses of rituximab. Sixteen patients with progressive mantle cell lymphoma after a median of three prior lines of therapy were enrolled.The overall response rate was 81.3% (13 patients), with seven patients achieving a complete response (43.8%). Six of these patients were also negative for disease activity by positron emission tomography scanning. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 12.1 and 38.6 months, respectively. In patients achieving a complete response, the median progression-free survival and overall survival have not yet been reached. Adverse events (greater than grade II) included thrombocytopenia (37.5%), fatigue (18.8%) and peripheral neuropathy (12.5%). Two patients discontinued bortezomib because of grade III neuropathy.Bortezomib combined with rituximab and dexamethasone has promising activity and manageable toxicity in patients with heavily pretreated mantle cell lymphoma. Achievement of complete response emerged as an important factor for sustained disease control. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00261612.
