Characterization of 64Cu-DOTA-conatumumab: a PET tracer for in vivo imaging of death receptor 5. Conatumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates human death receptor 5 (DR5 also known as TRAIL receptor 2). The purpose of this study was to characterize (64)Cu-labeled conatumumab as a PET tracer for imaging DR5 in tumors.DOTA-conatumumab was synthesized by incubating conatumumab with 2,2',2″-(10-(2-(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yloxy)-2-oxoethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triyl)triacetic acid (DOTA-NHS). The absolute numbers of DOTA molecules per conatumumab molecules were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. (64)Cu-DOTA-conatumumab was prepared by incubating (64)CuCl(2) (33-222 MBq) with DOTA-conatumumab at 37°C for 1 h. Binding of conatumumab and DOTA-conatumumab to Fc-coupled human DR5 (huTR2-Fc) was tested in a kinetic analysis assay, and the biologic activity of copper-DOTA-conatumumab was measured using a caspase-3/7 luminescent assay. In vivo evaluation of DOTA-conatumumab and copper-DOTA-conatumumab was done in severe combined immunodeficiency mice bearing Colo205 xenografts: tissue uptake was determined with biodistribution studies, and small-animal PET and autoradiography were used to determine the uptake of (64)Cu-DOTA conatumumab into tumors and other tissues.DOTA-conatumumab was prepared with an average of 5 DOTA molecules per conatumumab molecule. The in vitro median effective concentration required to induce a 50% effect of DOTA-conatumumab and conatumumab from the assay were 389 and 320 pM, respectively. The median effective dose (±SD) of DOTA-conatumumab and conatumumab via the caspase assay was 135 ± 31 and 128 ± 30 pM, respectively. In female CB17 severe combined immunodeficiency mice bearing Colo205 xenografts, DOTA-conatumumab and conatumumab inhibited tumor growth to the same extent. Small-animal PET studies showed tumor uptake at 24 h after injection of the tracer, with a mean standardized uptake value of 3.16 (n = 2). Tumor uptake was decreased by the coadministration of 400 μg of unlabeled conatumumab (mean standardized uptake value, 1.55 n = 2), suggesting saturable uptake. Tissue uptake determined by biodistribution studies was in agreement with the small-animal PET findings.These results suggest that (64)Cu-DOTA-conatumumab is a potential PET tracer for imaging DR5 in tumors and may be useful for measuring on-target occupancy by conatumumab.
