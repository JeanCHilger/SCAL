Immunoscintigraphy of inflammatory processes with a technetium-99m-labeled monoclonal antigranulocyte antibody (MAb BW 250/183). Antigranulocyte immunoscintigraphy with a technetium-99m- (99mTc) labeled monoclonal antigranulocyte antibody (MAb BW 250/183) was performed in 34 in-patients of the departments of accident surgery and internal medicine in order to prove or exclude inflammatory processes. After labeling with 99mTc, 555 MBq, 99mTc-MAb (0.5 mg antibody) were slowly injected intravenously over a period of 5 min. A whole-body scan was done 4-6 hr postinjection, and planar or SPECT images were performed 6, 18, and 24 hr postinjection. Leukocyte immunoscintigraphy proved inflammatory suppurating processes in 20 cases (true-positive) and excluded them in 11 cases (true-negative). The findings were false-positive in two patients (hematoma without signs of infection, pseudoarthrosis) and false-negative in one patient (encapsulated lung abscess with pleural fibrosis). Anti-idiotypic human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) were found only in one out of 20 patients. According to our experiences, immunoscintigraphy with 99mTc-MAb BW 250/183 has a sensitivity of 95%, and is, therefore, well suited for the identification of leukocytic inflammations.
