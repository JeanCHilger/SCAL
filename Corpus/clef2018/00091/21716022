Dose-response relationship between cumulative mercury exposure index and specific uptake ratio in the striatum on Tc-99m TRODAT SPECT. Tc-99m TRODAT is an agent for dopamine transporters and measuring dopamine innervation of the striatum. An association between Parkinson disease and body burden mercury level has been reported in the scientific published data. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of mercury exposure on dopamine transporters in the striatum measured by Tc-99m TRODAT single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Study subjects included 17 workers who worked in a lamp factory at risk for mercury vapor exposure and 15 age-matched healthy controls. All subjects received Tc-99m TRODAT SPECT, brain computed tomography scan, and neurologic examinations. Biologic urine mercury levels at the end of a work week were assessed for workers.There were significant differences in specific uptake ratio (SUR) in the striatum, caudate, and putamen between mercury exposure workers and healthy controls on Tc-99m TRODAT SPECT (all P < 0.001). The results showed a significantly negative correlation between urine and cumulative mercury levels and SUR in the striatum on Tc-99m TRODAT SPECT by Pearson analysis (r = -0.501, P = 0.040 r = -0.563, P = 0.019). After adjusting for age, gender, and body mass index, cumulative mercury exposure index (Cum Hg) was demonstrated to be the statistically significant predictor for SUR in the striatum, caudate, and putamen on Tc-99m TRODAT SPECT by multiple linear regression analysis (Î² = -0.543, P = 0.018Mercury exposure has significantly negative effect on dopamine transporters in the striatum. There is dose-response relationship between cumulative mercury exposure index (Cum Hg) and SUR in the striatum on Tc-99m TRODAT brain SPECT.
