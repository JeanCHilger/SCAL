Direct radiolabelling of proteins at cysteine using [18F]-fluorosugars. A strategy for the site-specific attachment of 2-deoxy-2-fluorosugars to cysteine and dehydroalanine tagged proteins is reported. When combined with thionation of fluorosugars, such as the widely available (18)F probe 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoroglucose ([(18)F]FDG), this methodology allows fast and direct access to site-specific [(18)F]FDG-labelled proteins.
