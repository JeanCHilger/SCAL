The influence of mass of [11C]-laniquidar and [11C]-N-desmethyl-loperamide on P-glycoprotein blockage at the blood-brain barrier. An earlier report suggested that mass amount of PET tracers could be an important factor in brain uptake mediated by P-glycoprotein. Thereby, this study investigated the influence of mass dose of laniquidar, desmethyl-loperamide and loperamide on the P-glycoprotein-mediated brain uptake of, respectively, [(11)C]-laniquidar and [(11)C]-N-desmethyl-loperamide ([(11)C]-dLop).Wild-type (WT) mice were injected intravenously with solutions of 5.6 MBq [(11)C]-laniquidar (either no carrier added or 60 mg/kg laniquidar added) or with 5.0-7.4 MBq [(11)C]-dLop (either no carrier added or 3 mg/kg desmethyl loperamide). Mice were killed, and brain and blood were collected, weighted and counted for radioactivity. Mdr1a(-/-) knockout mice were incorporated as the control group.Injection of (11)C-laniquidar (no carrier added) in WT mice resulted in a statistical significant lower brain uptake (0.7±0.2 %ID/g) compared to the carrier-added formulation (60 mg/kg laniquidar) (3.1±0.3 %ID/g) (P=.004), while no statistical difference could be observed between formulations of [(11)C]-dLop. The [(11)C]-laniquidar and [(11)C]-dLop blood concentrations were not significantly different between the tested formulations in WT mice. In control animals, no effect of mass amount on brain uptake of both tracers could be demonstrated.These results demonstrate the bivalent character of laniquidar, acting as a substrate at low doses and as a blocking agent for P-glycoprotein transport in the brain at higher doses. In comparison, no difference was observed in [(11)C]-dLop uptake between carrier- and no-carrier-added formulations, which confirms that desmethyl-loperamide is a substrate of P-glycoprotein at the blood-brain barrier.
