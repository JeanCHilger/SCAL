Evaluation of crossing calibration of (123)I-MIBG H/M ration, with the IDW scatter correction method, on different gamma camera systems. (123)I-MIBG Heart-to-Mediastinum activity ratio (H/M) is commonly used as an indicator of relative myocardial (123)I-MIBG uptake. H/M ratios reflect myocardial sympathetic nerve function, therefore it is a useful parameter to assess regional myocardial sympathetic denervation in various cardiac diseases. However, H/M ratio values differ by site, gamma camera system, position and size of region of interest (ROI), and collimator. In addition to these factors, 529 keV scatter component may also affect (123)I-MIBG H/M ratio. In this study, we examined whether the H/M ratio shows correlation between two different gamma camera systems and that sought for H/M ratio calculation formula. Moreover, we assessed the feasibility of (123)I Dual Window (IDW) method, which is a scatter correction method, and compared H/M ratios with and without IDW method. H/M ratio displayed a good correlation between two gamma camera systems. Additionally, we were able to create a new H/M calculation formula. These results indicated that the IDW method is a useful scatter correction method for calculating (123)I-MIBG H/M ratios.
