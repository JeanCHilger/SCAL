Does FDG PET-assisted management of patients with left ventricular dysfunction improve quality of life? A substudy of the PARR-2 trial. Patients with left ventricular dysfunction whose management is directed by F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging may have a quality of life (QOL) benefit over standard care.Among 430 patients randomized in the PET and Recovery Following Revascularization (PARR)-2 trial to FDG PET-assisted management vs standard, QOL scores were obtained using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) in 427 patients at baseline (FDG PET n = 216 standard n = 211) and 355 patients at 12-month follow-up (FDG PET n = 184A trend toward higher EQ-5D scores in FDG PET was observed (P = 0.056). Subgroup analysis showed a significant difference favouring adherence (P = 0.04). Higher QOL at 6 months for FDG PET (P = 0.02) and Adherence (P = 0.02) were observed. For revascularization, an interaction with management (FDG PET vs standard) for QOL was observed (6 months: P = 0.01 12 months: P = 0.1)FDG PET-directed management improves QOL, at least in the short-term and with adherence to recommendations. This may relate to revascularization, and may indicate better treatment selection using FDG PET.
