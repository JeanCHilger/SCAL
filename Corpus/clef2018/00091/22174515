Unilateral thalamic hypometabolism on FDG brain PET in patient with temporal lobe epilepsy. Interictal Brain F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging has been widely used for localizing the focus of a seizure. Hypometabolism in the extratemporal cortex on FDG-PET study is an important finding to localize seizure focus, which might be seen as ipsilateral, contralateral or bilateral thalamus hypometabolism in epileptic patients. In this case report, it is aimed to show ipsilateral thalamus hypomethabolism on FDG PET brain study of a 24-year-old male patient with temporal lobe epilepsy.
