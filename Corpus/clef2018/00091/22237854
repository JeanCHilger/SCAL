Striatal and extrastriatal dopamine D₂ receptor occupancy by the partial agonist antipsychotic drug aripiprazole in the human brain: a positron emission tomography study with [¹¹C]raclopride and [¹¹C]FLB457. Second-generation antipsychotics demonstrate clinical efficacy with fewer extrapyramidal side effects compared with first-generation antipsychotics. One of the proposed explanations is the hypothesis of preferential extrastriatal dopamine D₂ receptor occupancy (limbic selectivity) by antipsychotics. In the present study, we focused on aripiprazole, which has a unique pharmacological profile with partial agonism at dopamine D₂ receptors and the minimal risk of extrapyramidal side effects. Previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies using high-affinity radioligands for dopamine D₂ receptors have reported inconsistent results regarding regional differences of dopamine D₂ receptor occupancy by aripiprazole.To test the hypothesis of preferential binding to extrastriatal dopamine D₂ receptors by aripiprazole, we investigated its regional dopamine D₂ receptor occupancies in healthy young subjects.Using PET and two radioligands with different affinities for dopamine D₂ receptors, [¹¹C]raclopride and [¹¹C]FLB457, striatal and extrastriatal dopamine D₂ receptor bindings at baseline and after oral administration of 6 mg aripiprazole were measured in 11 male healthy subjects.Our data showed that dopamine D₂ receptor occupancies in the striatum measured with [¹¹C]raclopride were 70.1% and 74.1%, with the corresponding values for the extrastriatal regions measured with [¹¹C]FLB457 ranging from 46.6% to 58.4%.In the present study, preferential extrastriatal dopamine D₂ receptor occupancy by aripiprazole was not observed. Our data suggest partial agonism at dopamine D₂ receptors is the most likely explanation for the minimal risk of extrapyramidal side effects in the treatment by aripiprazole.
