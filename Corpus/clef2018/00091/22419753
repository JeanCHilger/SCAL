Coronary arterial 18F-FDG uptake by fusion of PET and coronary CT angiography at sites of percutaneous stenting for acute myocardial infarction and stable coronary artery disease. Whether (18)F-FDG PET can detect inflammation in the coronary arteries remains controversial. We examined (18)F-FDG uptake at the culprit sites of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) after percutaneous coronary stenting (PCS) by coregistering PET and coronary CT angiography (CTA).Twenty nondiabetic patients with AMI (median age, 62 y 16 men and 4 women) and 7 nondiabetic patients with stable coronary artery disease (CADCompared with stable CAD patients, more AMI patients exhibited a PCS site maxTBR greater than 2.0 (12/20 vs. 1/7, P = 0.04). More AMI patients were active smokers (9/20 vs. 0/7 in stable CAD, P = 0.03). After adjusting for baseline demographic differences, stent-myocardium distance, and myocardial (18)F-FDG uptake, presentation of AMI was positively associated with a PCS site maxTBR greater than 2.0 (odds ratio, 31.6 P = 0.044). Prevalence of excess myocardial (18)F-FDG uptake was similar in both populations (8/20 AMI vs. 3/7 stable CAD, P = 0.89).Systematic fusion of (18)F-FDG PET and coronary CTA demonstrated increased culprit site (18)F-FDG uptake more commonly in patients with AMI than in patients with stable CAD. However, this approach failed to detect increased signal at the culprit site in nearly half of AMI patients, highlighting the challenging nature of in vivo coronary artery plaque metabolic imaging. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that imaging of coronary artery inflammation is feasible, and further work evaluating (18)F-FDG uptake in high-risk coronary plaques prior to rupture would be of great interest.
