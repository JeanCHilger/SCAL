Positron emission tomography imaging of meningioma in clinical practice:  review of literature and future directions. Meningiomas represent about 20% of intracranial tumors and are the most frequent nonglial primary brain tumors. Diagnosis is based on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mainstays of therapy are surgery and radiotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy is tested in clinical trials of phase II. Patients are followed clinically by imaging. However, classical imaging modalities such as CT and MRI have limitations. Hence, we need supplementary imaging tools. Molecular imaging modalities, especially positron emission tomography (PET), represent promising new instruments that are able to characterize specific metabolic features. So far, these modalities have only been part of limited study protocols, and their impact on clinical routine management is still under investigation. It may be expected that their extended use will provide new aspects about meningioma imaging and biology. In the present article, we summarize PET imaging for meningiomas based on a thorough review of the literature. We discuss and illustrate the potential role of PET imaging in the clinical management of meningiomas. Finally, we indicate current limitations and outline directions for future research.
