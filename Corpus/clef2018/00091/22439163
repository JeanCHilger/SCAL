 Microbubbles (MBs) are spherical shells that are made of various types of biocompatible materials, such as albumin, carbohydrates, lipids or polymers, and are filled with heavy gases (nitrogen, perfluorocarbon, or sulfur hexafluoride) in the core. In the clinic, MBs are commonly used for the noninvasive real-time imaging of inflammation, thrombus formation, and angiogenesis with ultrasonography (1, 2). The features and utility of MBs have been discussed recently by Postema and Gilja (3). Targeted MBs can be generated by coating the MB shells with small molecules, peptides, proteins, or antibodies (Abs) that have a high binding affinity for disease-specific molecular markers, such as Î±
