Changing paradigms with molecular imaging of neuroendocrine tumors. Molecular imaging is changing diagnostic and treatment paradigms in patients with neuroendocrine tumors through its ability to non-invasively characterize disease, supplementing the traditional role of using imaging for localizing and measuring disease. For patients with metastatic disease, there is an increasing range of therapies but these must be individualized to the specific subtype of tumor expressed, which varies in aggressiveness from well to poorly differentiated phenotypes. Positron emission tomography (PET) is now able to characterize these subtypes through its ability to quantify somatostatin receptor cell surface (SSTR) expression and glycolytic metabolism with SSTR and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, respectively. The ability to perform this as a whole body study is highlighting the limitations of relying on histopathology obtained from a single site. Through earlier diagnosis, improved selection of the most appropriate therapy and better assessment of therapeutic response for an individual patient, molecular imaging is improving the outcome for patients with NET.
