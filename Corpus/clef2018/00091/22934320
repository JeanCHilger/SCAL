 A bifunctional chelating agent (BFC) such as 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) is often used to link a radionuclide with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) for the targeted imaging or radioimmunotherapy of cancers (1). However, a major limitation of using BFCs is that harsh reaction conditions such as high temperatures are required to facilitate the formation of the radionuclide-BFC complex (2). In addition, these complexes are not very stable
