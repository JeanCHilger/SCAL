Contribution of positron emission tomography to the diagnosis of a case of acromegaly. Diagnosis of acromegaly is based on biochemical tests demonstrating increased growth hormone (GH) secretion. More than 95% of patients with acromegaly harbor a GH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The technique of choice in the diagnosis of an adenoma is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The use of new techniques such as (111)In-octreotide scintigraphy (OctreoScan) and positron emission tomography (PET) can provide additional information in some cases. We report the case of a woman with acromegaly. The results of several MRI scans and OctreoScan were normal and other diagnostic possibilities were ruled out. The pituitary origin of the increased GH secretion was identified by PET. In acromegaly, the absence of MRI findings and identification of location by means of PET are exceptional.
