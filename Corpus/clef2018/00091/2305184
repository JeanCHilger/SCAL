Epidemiology and prevention of echinococcosis in France. Echinococcosis is a cosmopolitan parasitic disease caused by the larvae of two tapeworms: Echinococcus granulosus responsible for unilocular hydatidosis, and Echinococcus multilocularis responsible for alveolar hydatid disease. In both cases man is infected by ingesting eggs of these tapeworms belonging to the genus Cestoda. In France, the only animal that acts as definitive host and transmits the unilocular type of hydatid disease is the dog, while the alveolar type is transmitted by dogs, foxes and cats. Carnivorous pet animals must be taken into account in the prevention of echinococcosis, whether their role is direct or indirect (fouling plants).
