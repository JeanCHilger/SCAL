Plasma polymerized tetrafluoroethylene/polyethylene terephthalate vascular prostheses. Tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) was discharged onto woven polyethylene terephthalate (PET) prostheses, and the PET prostheses (50 mm long) with or without TFE were implanted into canine carotid arteries and aortas. Additional controls included polytetrafluoroethylene and Dacron. Specimens were explanted after one to 12 months, photographed, and sectioned for light and scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and thrombus-free surface areas calculated by computerized planimetry. Results showed no significant patency differences among carotid or aortic groups. However, both PET carotid groups had significantly greater thrombus-free surface areas. Histologically, both PET groups appeared identical. An endothelialized neointima covered PET carotid specimens by six months, compared with three months in the aortic position, with greater pannus ingrowth in both PET groups. Plasma polymerized TFE offered no additional advantage in these long-term experiments.
