RCBF-quantification with 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT: theory and first results. The activity concentrations of 99mTc-HMPAO in brain after intravenous injection were evaluated in 25 patients using SPECT. With additional first pass studies of heart and brain with the short lived isotope 195mAu, the cardiac output and the mean cerebral transit times of the patients were measured a short time before the HMPAO injection. The time dependence of 99mTc-HMPAO activity in the brain was registered during the first 5 min after injection over both hemispheres. Using a simplified three compartment model it was possible to calculate the mean retention fraction of HMPAO in brain from the time activity curves. It could be shown that the regional cerebral blood flow in ml/min per 100 g can be calculated from the activity concentration of HMPAO in the brain, the cardiac output and the retention fraction. In 15 of the 25 cases the rCBF was measured using the planar 133Xe inhalation method as a reference. We found a significant correlation between the mean hemisphere CBF from our method and the mean hemisphere grey matter CBF from the Xenon method with a correlation coefficient of 0.73.
