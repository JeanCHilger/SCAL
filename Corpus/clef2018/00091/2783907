SPECT volume measurement using an automatic threshold selection method combined with a V filter. The volume measurement of various organs by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has generally been performed by summing up the voxels lying within the outer edge of the organ determined by thresholding as a function of the maximum reconstructed counts within a volume of interest. The optimum threshold level, however, is influenced by various factors. To eliminate this problem, Mortelmans et al. (1986) proposed to use an automatic threshold selection method (ATSM) based on discriminant criteria and to correct the errors induced by the imperfect system response using the method based on linear regression analysis, which has some problems in practical application. We tried to use ATSM combined with a V filter. The correlation coefficient (r) and the regression equation between the true (x) and the calculated volume (y) obtained by experimentation using 22 phantoms with a volume ranging between 26 ml and 380 ml were as follows: r = 0.994 and y(ml) = 1.015 x +1.09 using ATSM combined with a V filter, while r = 0.993 and y(ml) = 1.110 x +30.55 using only ATSM. The relative error between the true and the calculated volumes decreased significantly (P less than 0.01) from 37.7% +/- 26.9% to 5.5% +/- 4.2%. The results suggest that ATSM combined with a V filter is useful for correcting the errors caused by an imperfect system response, and is available and reliable for SPECT volume determination even when the organ volume is small.
