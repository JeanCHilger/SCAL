Design concepts and preliminary performances of stationary-sampling whole-body high-resolution positron emission tomography: HEADTOME IV. Design concepts and preliminary performances of a stationary sampling high-resolution whole-body positron emission tomograph, HEADTOME IV, were reported. The system comprises four layers of detector ring which consists of 768 BGO crystals with 3 mm width, 96 photomultiplier tubes arrayed on 825 mm circle. A sufficiently fine sampling-interval allows data sampling without scan motion along the transaxial plane. But an axial motion (Z-motion) is installed to interlace between adjacent planes. Preliminary performance characteristics were an in-plane resolution of 4.5 mm in full width at half maximum (FWHM), an axial resolution of 9.5 mm in FWHM, sensitivities of 14 and 24 kcps/(microCi/ml) for direct and cross planes, respectively, with 20 cm diam. cylindrical flood phantom. A large scale cache memory prepared for each plane allows a realtime correction for the deadtime and the radionuclide decay, and a realtime calculation of the rate constants using the weighted integral method.
