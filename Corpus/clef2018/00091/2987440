Prediction of survival in glioma patients by means of positron emission tomography. The aim of this study was to determine whether positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 (18F)-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) can be used as a prognostic test in patients with high-grade cerebral gliomas, regardless of the treatment given. Forty-five patients with astrocytoma Grade III or IV were included in this analysis. The mean survival time of patients with tumors exhibiting high glucose utilization as determined by PET-FDG was 5 months, whereas patients with gliomas showing lower glucose utilization had a mean survival period of 19 months. It is postulated that PET-FDG scans reflect the biological behavior of high-grade astrocytomas and may be used to predict the survival time of patients harboring such neoplasms.
