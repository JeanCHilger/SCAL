Technetium-99m HM-PAO images (planar and SPECT) of the human brain. Tc-99m HM-PAO has a great potential in the assessment of regional brain perfusion in various neurologic disorders. An atlas of planar and SPECT images of the normal and abnormal human brain has been generated using Tc-99m HM-PAO as the tracer.
