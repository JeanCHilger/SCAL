Tracing of dopamine receptors in hemiparkinsonism with positron emission tomography (PET). In 13 hemiparkinson patients possible changes in dopamine receptors were investigated in vivo with PET, using [11C]methylspiperone as the receptor labeling ligand. Though in individual patients the specific binding of the tracer differed between both striata, no consistent difference was found. However, the specific binding in the striatum of patients with longterm dopaminergic medication was significantly higher than in non-medicated patients, and close to normal. No correlation with the predominantly unilateral clinical pathology was found. Since the postsynaptic receptor changes in hemiparkinson patients appear not to be uniform, these results suggest that the clinical asymmetry is not only caused by a dysfunction of nigral dopaminergic cells, but by pathology in other cells and probably in other neurotransmitter systems as well. The observed bilateral increase in receptor binding during dopaminergic therapy most likely results from a symmetrical change in local pharmacokinetics or from alteration of the receptor binding. Further studies with PET are needed to determine the exact nature of this change.
