Results obtained from the group study on the clinical efficacy of SPECT of the liver. The influence of SPECT over the detectability of SOL in the liver was evaluated by the Subcommittee on Efficacy Study, which belongs to Medical and Pharmaceutical Committee of Japan Radioisotope Association, under the participation of 9 hospitals including some university hospitals. In this study segmental reading of the SOL was requested. The film reading was performed twice on the different patient-groups and the results from well-experienced doctors (11 doctors) were summarized, indicating a slight increase in sensitivity as a whole although there were some doctors showing a reverse effect in each performance. Sensitivity was determined in the patient-group without SOL, which showed a slight decrease as a whole, indicating that SPECT had some possibility of increasing false positive cases. In the study of SOL detectability based on its segmental location, a marked positive effect of SPECT was noted in the right anterior and right posterior segments whereas a marked negative effect in the left lateral segment. The left medial segment also showed a slight decrease in the detectability of SOL.
