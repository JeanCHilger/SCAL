Course of the dermatophytic spectrum in tinea capitis. Apropos of 124 cases seen in Bordeaux. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of tinea capitis in the Bordeaux area (Dermatology Unit of the HÃ´pital des Enfants, Bordeaux) during a 6-year period (January, 1979 to December, 1984). Dermatophytic infection of the hair was proven by culture in 124 patients, 21 of whom had a negative potassium hydroxide direct examination. Age and sex distribution are shown in figure 1. One case was observed in a 15 days old infant, and 4 cases in adult females (3 young black mothers of affected children, 1 elderly white woman). Table I indicates the geographical origin of the patients and the isolates identified. The incidence of anthropophilic dermatophytes has increased from 13 p. 100 to 50 p. 100 since our previous survey (1975-1978). M. langeronii (29 cases), T. soudanense (19 cases) and T. violaceum (10 cases) were isolated mostly among African immigrants from Western tropical Africa and the Maghreb. However, 4 children of French origin without any history of previous sojourn in endemic areas developed tinea capitis due to M. langeronii the source of contamination could not be determined. Zoophilic dermatophyte infection was mainly caused by M. canis (50 cases), with cats being the most frequent source of contamination. Family cases were frequent: 64 corresponding to 28 families. This may be due to either interhuman contamination or the presence of a contact pet animal in the family. The discussion is focused on: the shift in dermatophytic isolates from tinea capitis toward anthropophilic species, notably M. langeronii, mainly caused by an increased immigration from West Africa
