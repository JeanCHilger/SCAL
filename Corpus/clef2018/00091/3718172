The third biannual winter workshop on schizophrenia. Schladming, Austria, Jan 26-31, 1986. The following general principles seem to summarize the emphasis that was evident from the several days of multiple presentations and discussions. The need exists to continue to develop improvements in the tools applicable to research in psychiatry, both clinical and biological "instruments" that are both sensitive and specific to the questions asked. New molecular genetic technology has already been used to explore genetic susceptibility hypotheses, as well as novel viral associations. Imaging of brain receptor kinetics in vivo is in progress. Improvements in structured clinical rating scales for quantifying changes in biologically important clusters of symptoms (eg, negative vs positive symptoms) or the defining of prodromal symptoms that lead to relapse are critical to progress in etiological and treatment research. A genetic factor or factors for schizophrenia exist, although whether a "familial" type defines only a subgroup of schizophrenia is controversial. The relative importance of genetic vs environmental variables, and whether there is genetic and environmental heterogeneity, continue to be debated. The most important epidemiological data, the seasonality of birth, and the controversial question of geographical variation in prevalence can be clues to the etiology of schizophrenia and are presently being clarified. The pursuit of new treatments and modifications of present conventional treatments to increase the percentage of patients recovering from psychotic illnesses or lead to more complete recovery states is always of prime importance. An emphasis on clarifying the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia with PET continues to be at the forefront of psychiatric research. A focus on patients in a first episode of schizophrenia can clarify major issues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
