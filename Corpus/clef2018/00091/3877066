Analysis of some errors in the measurement of oxygen extraction and oxygen consumption by the equilibrium inhalation method. Some sources of error in the equilibrium inhalation method for the measurement of oxygen extraction fraction and CMRO2 by positron emission computed tomography scanning have been evaluated by computer simulation. Emphasis has been placed on errors that have not been thoroughly studied in past work. These include effects of random statistical errors, systematic errors in arterial blood radioactivity concentrations, and errors due to perturbations of the equilibrium state, to tissue inhomogeneity, and to subject motion.
