Development of a 99Tcm-labelled radiopharmaceutical for cerebral blood flow imaging. A new radiopharmaceutical, 99Tcm-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99Tcm-HM-PAO) has shown considerable promise for single photon emission tomographic (SPECT) imaging of the brain. In animal biodistribution studies this complex demonstrates good brain uptake with prolonged retention of activity in brain. Further improvement of these properties, resulting in higher brain uptake with very slow washout and fixed regional distribution has been achieved following the isolation of the d,1-diastereoisomer of HM-PAO.
