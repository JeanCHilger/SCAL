Complementary roles of CT and 131I-MIBG scintigraphy in diagnosing pheochromocytoma. Recently 131I-MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine), an adrenergic tissue-localizing radiopharmaceutical, has been used for diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. In a retrospective study of 32 patients with pathologically proved primary, metastatic, or recurrent pheochromocytoma, the roles of 131I-MIBG scintigraphy and computed tomography (CT) in pheochromocytoma detection were compared. The two methods were equally accurate in the identification of primary and recurrent pheochromocytoma. 131I-MIBG scanning was more accurate as the initial examination in patients with extraadrenal tumors. In patients with metastatic disease, scintigraphy was preferable to CT because of its nontomographic nature, which permitted imaging of the entire body. Although a positive MIBG scan is diagnostic of pheochromocytoma, CT of extraadrenal tumors (particularly in the chest) has been very useful in planning appropriate surgical intervention. Furthermore, the roles of 131I-MIBG scintigraphy and CT in the detection of pheochromocytoma are complementary because each method has certain limitations.
