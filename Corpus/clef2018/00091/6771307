Preliminary imaging results with 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. Transverse section imaging with 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2FDG) is of considerable interest because quantitative values of regional glucose metabolism may be obtained. We present preliminary results using 2FDG produced by the Brookhaven National Laboratory and imaged with the PCII at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Three studies are reported showing the distribution in dog, monkey, and in brain of an essentially normal patient.
