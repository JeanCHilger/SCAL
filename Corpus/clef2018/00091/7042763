A microcomputer system for the collection and analysis of antibiotic sensitivity test data. A microcomputer system for the routine collection and analysis of microbiological data is described. A digitising tablet is used as a method of data input. A series of analysis programmes was developed to allow investigation of the distribution of organisms in relation to the type of specimen in which they occur, the origin of the specimen and also to examine their associated sensitivity patterns. In this instance a Commodore PET was used, though other microcomputers could be similarly employed with equal facility.
