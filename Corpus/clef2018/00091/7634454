Evidence for preserved cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of renal cortical blood flow in humans with advanced heart failure. A positron emission tomography study. The effect of cardiopulmonary baroreflexes on the renal circulation in healthy humans and patients with heart failure is unknown because of the technical limitations of studying the renal circulation. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a new method to measure renal cortical blood flow in humans that is precise, rapid, reproducible, and noninvasive. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of acute cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading by phlebotomy on regional blood flow in healthy humans and humans with advanced heart failure.We compared renal cortical blood flow and forearm blood flow in 10 healthy volunteers and 8 patients with heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction, 0.24 +/- 0.02) during cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading with phlebotomy (450 mL). The major findings of this study are: (1) At rest, renal cortical blood flow is markedly diminished in humans with heart failure compared with healthy humans (heart failure, 2.4 +/- 0.1 versus healthy, 4.3 +/- 0.2 mL.min-1.g-1, P < .001). (2) In healthy humans, during phlebotomy, forearm blood flow decreased substantially (basal, 3.3 +/- 0.4 versus phlebotomy, 2.6 +/- 0.3 mL.min-1.100 mL-1, P = .02) and renal cortical blood flow decreased slightly but significantly (basal, 4.3 +/- 0.2 versus phlebotomy, 4.0 +/- 0.3 mL.min-1.g-1, P = .01). (3) The small magnitude of reflex renal vasoconstriction is not explained by the inability of the renal circulation to vasoconstrict, since the cold pressor stimulus induced substantial decreases in renal cortical blood flow in healthy subjects (basal, 4.4 +/- 0.1 versus cold pressor, 3.7 +/- 0.1 mL.min-1.g-1, P = .003). (4) In humans with heart failure, during phlebotomy, forearm blood flow did not change (basal, 2.6 +/- 0.3 versus phlebotomy, 2.7 +/- 0.2 mL.min-1.100 mL-1, P = NS), but renal cortical blood flow decreased slightly but significantly (basal, 2.4 +/- 0.1 versus phlebotomy, 2.1 +/- 0.1 mL.min-1.g-1, P = .01). (5) The cold pressor stimulus induced substantial decreases in renal cortical blood flow in patients with heart failure (basal, 2.9 +/- 0.1 versus cold pressor, 2.3 +/- 0.1 mL.min-1.g-1, P = .008). Thus, in patients with heart failure, there is an abnormality in cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of the forearm circulation but not the renal circulation.This study demonstrates the power of PET imaging to study normal physiological and pathophysiological reflex control of the renal circulation in humans and describes the novel finding of selective dysfunction of cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of one vascular region but its preservation in another in patients with heart failure.
