Microvascular dysfunction in collateral-dependent myocardium. The aim of this study was to evaluate myocardial blood flow regulation in collateral-dependent myocardium of patients with coronary artery disease.Despite great clinical relevance, perfusion correlates of collateral circulation in humans have rarely been estimated by quantitative methods at rest and during stress.Nineteen patients with angina and isolated occlusion of the left anterior descending (n = 14) or left circumflex (n = 5) coronary artery were evaluated. Using positron emission tomography and nitrogen-13 ammonia, we obtained flow measurements at baseline, during atrial pacing-induced tachycardia and after intravenous administration of dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg body weight over 4 min). Flow values in collateral-dependent and remote areas were compared with values in 13 normal subjects.Flow at rest was similar in collateralized and remote myocardium (0.61 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.63 +/- 0.17 ml/min per g, mean +/- 1 SD), and both values were lower than normal (1.00 +/- 0.20 ml/min per g, p < 0.01). During pacing, blood flow increased to 0.83 +/- 0.25 and 1.11 +/- 0.39 ml/min per g in collateral-dependent and remote areas, respectively (p < 0.05 vs. baseline) both values were lower than normal (1.86 +/- 0.61 ml/min per g, p < 0.01). Dipyridamole induced a further increase in perfusion in remote areas (1.36 +/- 0.57 ml/min per g, p < 0.01 vs. pacing) but not in collateral-dependent regions (0.93 +/- 0.37 ml/min per g, p = NS vs. pacing)Despite rest hypoperfusion, collateral-dependent myocardium maintains a vasodilator reserve that is almost fully utilized during increases in oxygen consumption. A global microvascular disorder might hamper adaptation to chronic coronary occlusion.
