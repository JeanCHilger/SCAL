Comparative correlations of HMPAO SPECT indices, neurological score, and stroke subtypes with clinical outcome in acute carotid infarcts. The prognostic value of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic value of stroke severity, stroke subtypes, and SPECT indices and to determine which predictive factors have an independent effect on clinical outcome.We studied 55 consecutive patients with acute (< 12 hours) carotid infarct within 36 hours of symptom onset with SPECT. Clinical presentation was assessed by the Canadian Neurological Scale and stroke subtypes. SPECT indices were the degree and size of hypoperfusion and crossed cerebellar diaschisis as assessed by a semiquantitative analysis. Outcome was evaluated by the functional status and mortality (Rankin Scale score at 1 month).The Rankin Scale score correlated with the degree (r = .580 P < .00001) and size (r = .616SPECT performed within 36 hours of onset predicts clinical outcome, but different clinical and SPECT indices with threshold values should be chosen according to the relevant outcome end point.
