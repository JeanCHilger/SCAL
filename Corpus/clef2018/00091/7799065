Radiolabeled octreotide for the demonstration of somatostatin receptors in malignant lymphoma and lymphadenopathy. This prospective study evaluated somatostatin receptor-specific scintigraphy as a clinical tool for routine detection of malignant lymphoma.Forty-one consecutive patients were examined using 111In-DTPA-D-Phe-1-octreotide. Thirty-four patients had diagnoses of Hodgkin's disease (n = 11) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 23) previously verified and staged by hematology, histology and imaging methods (CT, chest x-ray and abdominal ultrasonography). The remaining seven patients initially suspected of presenting lymphoma (n = 5) or lymphoma recurrence after chemotherapy and radiotherapy (n = 2) were subsequently shown to have other diseases. Planar images were recorded 4, 24 and 48 hr after intravenous injection and evaluated without knowledge of other results. In case of negative planar scintigraphy, additional SPECT images were obtained. Since these failed to increase sensitivity, they were omitted after 15 negative recordings.Octreotide scintigraphy did not yield false-positive results. The sensitivity for detecting Hodgkin's disease was 70% and varied from 88% in the neck and chest to 13% in the abdomen and pelvis. The sensitivity for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was not influenced by localization and amounted uniformly to 35% but varied with the degree of malignancy between 44% (high-grade) and 29% (low-grade malignancy).Our results suggest that radiolabeled octreotide is better suited to characterize somatostatin receptor expressing lymphomas than to localize lesion sites. It is useful for imaging Hodgkin's disease, especially above the diaphragm.
