Prefrontal dysfunction in young acute neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients: a resting and activation SPECT study. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in six neuroleptic-naive, young, acute schizophrenic patients and six normal control subjects. We evaluated rCBF changes in prefrontal areas at rest and during a prefrontal activation task, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Schizophrenic patients had significantly higher prefrontal blood flow than did control subjects during the resting conditions. During activation, the control group showed significant increases in prefrontal blood flow, whereas the schizophrenic group did not. These results suggest that at rest there is no evidence of hypofrontality, whereas hyperfrontality seems to be the most frequent pattern in our selected sample of young acute neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients. Furthermore, schizophrenic patients seem to be unable to increase prefrontal blood flow under conditions that challenge the prefrontal cortex.
