Imaging of head and neck tumors with positron emission tomography and [11C]methionine. To evaluate the value of positron emission tomography and [11C]methionine in imaging of malignant tumors of the head and neck region.Forty-seven tumors of the head and neck were investigated with 11C-labeled methionine and positron emission tomography before treatment. Because of the resolution limits of the positron emission tomography scanner, all tumors selected for the study were larger than 1 cm in diameter.Forty-two (91%) of the 46 malignant tumors were clearly visible in the positron emission tomography image (squamous cell carcinoma, n = 26 lymphoma, n = 9Malignant head and neck tumors can be effectively imaged with positron emission tomography using [11C]methionine as the tracer.
