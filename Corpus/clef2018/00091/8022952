Gender-related differences in regional cerebral glucose metabolism in normal volunteers. Positron emission tomography studies have correlated changes in the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose utilization (CMRglu) with symptoms of depression, aggression, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Psychiatric disorders in which these symptoms are manifested are disproportionately represented among the sexes. We evaluated gender differences in regional CMRglu in control subjects (21 men and 18 women) with particular interest in the global, orbital frontal, and left anterolateral prefrontal cortical (LAPFC) CMRglu. A trend was present for global CMRglu to be greater in women than in men. Regional CMRglu was lower in men than in women in the orbital frontal area. No differences were observed in the LAPFC region.
