Thallium and indium antimyosin dual-isotope single-photon emission tomography in acute myocardial infarction to identify patients at further ischaemic risk. Dual-isotope single-photon emission tomography (SPET) with indium-111 antimyosin and thallium-201 chloride was performed in 54 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to detect the location and extent of myocardial necrosis (antimyosin) and viable myocardium (201Tl). All patients underwent intravenous thrombolytic therapy with either streptokinase (1.5 million units/90 min) or tissue plasminogen activator (80 mg/90 min). Sensitivity in detecting MI was 91% (49/54 patients). With regard to dual-isotope SPET patterns, patients were divided into three groups: match, i.e. antimyosin uptake in segments with thallium defect (n = 8) mismatch, i.e. no uptake of either of the nuclides in corresponding segments (presence of perfusion abnormalities in the absence of antimyosin uptake) (n = 5)
