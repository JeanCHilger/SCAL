Potential applications of positron emission tomography in surgical oncology. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a new nuclear medicine technique. The number of PET facilities is limited due to the high costs and complexity of this diagnostic modality. The principles of PET are explained. The technique can be used to visualize and analyse tumor metabolism. Present applications include tumor detection, staging, determination of growth rate, malignancy grade and hormone receptor status.
