Changes in medial cortical blood flow with a stimulus-response compatibility task. Previous work has suggested that human subjects engaged in tasks, like the Stroop task, that require response selection utilize the medial frontal cortex. We used positron emission tomography to measure blood flow changes in a stimulus-response compatibility task designed to maximize the demand on response selection processes. We report significant activation in the cingulate sulcus (Brodman's area 32) and a correlation of activity in this region with faster response time for an incongruent stimulus-response task.
