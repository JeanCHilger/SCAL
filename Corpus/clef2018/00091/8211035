Subcortical cerebrovascular accidents: correlation between clinical aspects, topography and flow measurements using single photon emission tomography. 35 patients with subcortical ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke included in the Lausanne Stroke Registry underwent cerebral blood flow measurement using I-123-IMP and 99mTc-HMPAO single photon emission tomography (SPECT). Our findings suggest that neuropsychological disturbances are not systematically correlated to cortical hypoperfusion secondary to the deep lesion (diaschisis). The role of cortical diaschisis was especially prominent in patients with aphasia and left subcortical lesion.
