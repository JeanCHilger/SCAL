Calcium binding by chick calretinin and rat calbindin D28k synthesised in bacteria. Calretinin is a member of the EF-hand calcium-binding protein family, with a high similarity with calbindin D28k. The chick calretinin cDNA sequence was reconstructed in a M13 vector and transferred into an expression plasmid derived from the pET series. The calretinin gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and produced immunoreactive calretinin of the expected size. Bacterially expressed calretinin was purified with successive ammonium-sulfate precipitation, DEAE chromatography, hydroxyapatite chromatography, Sephadex G-75 chromatography and Mono-Q chromatography. Normally, 1.0-1.5 mg calretinin was obtained from 1 l bacterial culture with a protein recovery of 0.5-1.5%. Calbindin D28k was purified similarly from bacteria using an expression plasmid provided by W. Hunziker. Calcium-binding activity of purified proteins was measured by equilibrium dialysis in calcium/EGTA mixtures with 45Ca as tracer. Both calretinin and calbindin D28k bound 3-4 Ca2+/molecule (calretinin, 4.0 +/- 0.5 calbindin D28k, 3.5 +/- 0.4), implying that at least one of the canonical EF-hand domains does not bind calcium. The Kd was 0.3-0.5 microM with little difference between the values for the two proteins.
