Regional cerebral glucose metabolism in late-life depression and Alzheimer disease: a preliminary positron emission tomography study. Eight subjects with late-life depression, eight subjects with probable Alzheimer disease, and eight healthy age-matched controls were studied using 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography in the resting state with their eyes open and ears unoccluded. The depressed subjects showed widespread reductions in the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose in most major neocortical, subcortical, and paralimbic regions that were significantly different from control values (P < 0.01). The metabolic decrements in the depressed group were comparable in magnitude to those seen in the Alzheimer disease group. These data demonstrate widespread nonfocal decline in glucose metabolism in late-life depression that is comparable to the hypometabolism seen in Alzheimer disease. These findings have pathophysiological implications in major depressive disorder in the elderly.
