Effects of surgical orthodontic treatment for malalignment due to the prolonged retention of deciduous canines in young dogs. This study was conducted to clarify the effects of surgical orthodontic treatment for malalignment caused by the prolonged retention of deciduous canines in young dogs. Fifty-five dogs with malocclusion or pre-malocclusion were divided into two groups. Group 1 received surgical orthodontic treatment (32 dogs) using modification of Ross and Yamane's method of treating for malalignment due to prolonged retention of deciduous canine teeth Group 2 received no treatment (23 dogs). Occurrence of malocclusion 1-3 weeks after treatment of the group receiving surgery was only 3.8%. However, malocclusion was seen in 73.4% of the non-treatment group approximately 2 years after the first examination. Surgical orthodontic treatment was very useful in treating malalignment due to prolonged retention of deciduous canines in young dogs.
