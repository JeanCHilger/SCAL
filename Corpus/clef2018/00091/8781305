Thermal injury in rats alters glucose utilization by skin, wound, and small intestine, but not by skeletal muscle. The effects of thermal injury in rats on glucose utilization (Rg) by skin, wound, small intestine, and muscle in vivo has been determined using 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG) 6 hours, 24 hours, and 3 weeks after injury. These results were compared with serum glucose and insulin levels at the same time points and with hexokinase activity in the tissues. Thermal injury had no significant effects on serum glucose levels however, serum insulin levels were lower than sham values 6 hours after injury, the same as sham values 24 hours after injury, and significantly higher than sham values 3 weeks after injury. Rg of unburned skin was not changed at 6 or 24 hours after injury, but was increased at 3 weeks after injury. The Rg of the wound was almost zero at 6 and 24 hours after injury
