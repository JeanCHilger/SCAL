Bayesian reconstruction of PET images: methodology and performance analysis. We describe a practical statistical methodology for the reconstruction of PET images. Our approach is based on a Bayesian formulation of the imaging problem. The data are modelled as independent Poisson random variables and the image is modelled using a Markov random field smoothing prior. We describe a sequence of calibration procedures which are performed before reconstruction: (i) calculation of accurate attenuation correction factors from re-projected Bayesian reconstructions of the transmission image (ii) estimation of the mean of the randoms component in the data
