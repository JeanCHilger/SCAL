Radiation dosimetry for 131I-mIBG therapy of neuroblastoma. This paper describes the methodology which can be used to determine whole-body, red marrow, blood, bladder, liver, and tumour doses delivered during 131I-mIBG therapy of neuroblastoma. The methodology is based on the Physics Protocol used in a multi-centre study undertaken by the United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG). In this study, the estimates of the doses delivered, using 2.4-12.1 GBq 131I-mIBG, were in the following ranges: whole body, 0.14-0.65 mGy MBq-1 red marrow, 0.17-0.63 mGy MBq-1
