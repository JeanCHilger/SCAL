Evaluation of meta-[211At]astatobenzylguanidine in an athymic mouse human neuroblastoma xenograft model. A paired-label biodistribution was performed in athymic mice bearing SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma xenografts to compare the tissue uptake of meta-[211At]astatobenzylguanidine ([211At]MABG) and [131I]MIBG. Significantly higher (p < 0.05) uptake of [211At]MABG was seen in tumor (3.8 +/- 0.8% ID/g vs. 3.1 +/- 0.7% ID/g at 8 h) compared to [131I]MIBG. Desipramine reduced tumor uptake of [211At] MABG by 43%, suggesting that its accumulation was related to the specific uptake-1 mechanism. Higher uptake of [211At]MABG was also seen in normal tissue targets such as heart (6.0 +/- 0.9% ID/g vs. 4.5 +/- 0.8% ID/g at 8 h p < 0.05). Pretreatment of mice with unlabeled MIBG increased tumor uptake of [211At]MABG by 1.5-fold while reducing uptake in heart and several other normal tissues. The vesicular uptake inhibitor tetrabenazine reduced heart uptake by 30% without reducing the tumor uptake. These results suggest such strategies might be useful for improving [211At]MABG tumor-to-normal tissue ratios.
