Combined Tc-99m MIBI and Tc-99m RBC for anatomic localization of ectopic mediastinal parathyroid adenomas. Preoperative localization of abnormal parathyroid tissue in patients with persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism is recommended as a standard of care. A high percentage of these patients have ectopic tissue in the mediastinum. Tc-99m MIBI imaging alone for detection of ectopic parathyroid tissue in the mediastinum does not provide a sufficient number of anatomic landmarks, which makes communication regarding the exact location of any area of abnormal uptake difficult. We report the use of concomitant Tc-99m RBC and Tc-99m MIBI imaging for precise anatomic localization of ectopic mediastinal parathyroid tissue in 4 patients. It is thought that this combination of studies allows improved communication with referring physicians, surgeons, and radiologists for planning both surgical approach and correlative imaging studies. It is hoped that in the future this combination of studies may obviate the need for other imaging studies.
