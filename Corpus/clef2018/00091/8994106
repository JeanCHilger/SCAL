Brain 6-[18F]fluorodopa metabolism in early and late onset of Parkinson's disease studied by positron emission tomography. We measured 6-[18F]fluorodopa (FDOPA) uptake in the caudate nucleus and the putamen of 20 patients with early and late onset of Parkinson's disease (EOPD and LOPD) and 20 normal control subjects using positron emission tomography. The mean influx rate constant values (Ki) were significantly reduced in the caudate nucleus and the putamen of the patients with EOPD and LOPD compared with age-matched control groups (p < 0.01), respectively. There were significant negative correlations between Ki values in the caudate nucleus (r = -0.67, p = 0.0024) and the putamen (r = -0.67, p = 0.0014), and duration of disease in the LOPD group compared with the EOPD group. Similar negative relationships between Ki values and clinical stages by Hoehn and Yahr and degrees of main clinical symptoms (bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity) were more markedly seen in the LOPD group than in the EOPD group. The present results suggest that the function of presynaptic dopaminergic terminals correlates well with clinical disease severity and degrees of main symptoms in the LOPD group, but not in the EOPD group. We speculate that compensatory up-regulatory function in the postsynaptic dopaminergic receptors may modify disease severity and the degrees of main clinical symptoms of EOPD.
