Striatal dopamine-2 receptor occupancy in psychotic patients treated with risperidone. Seventeen psychiatric patients (11 with schizophrenia, 5 with other psychotic disorders, and 1 with obsessive-compulsive disorder) were examined by single photon emission computed tomography with 123I-iodobenzamide (IBZM) as tracer. Patients were treated with risperidone in two different dosage groups (3 mg and 8 mg) and haloperidol (10-20 mg) and compared with eight healthy control subjects. There was a statistically significant difference in basal ganglia/frontal cortex ratios of IBZM binding between controls and all treatment groups. A statistically significant difference was also found concerning these ratios and percentage of dopamine D2 receptor occupancy rates between the treatment groups with lowest ratios and highest percentage of D2 receptor occupancy in the group of patients treated with haloperidol, followed by the group treated with 8 mg of risperidone and the group treated with 3 mg of risperidone.
