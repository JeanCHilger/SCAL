Laryngeal radionecrosis versus recurrent cancer. This article reviews the nature, pathogenesis, and clinical grading system of laryngeal radionecrosis. The differentiation of radiation-induced soft-tissue complications from recurrent cancer can be a difficult clinical dilemma. Conventional imagery and even biopsy results are frequently equivocal. A treatment-interventional algorithmic approach to the problem patient is presented, and the role of positron emission tomographic scanning in making this differentiation is discussed.
