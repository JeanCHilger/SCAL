Left ventricular cavity-to-myocardium count ratio in technetium-99m-sestamibi SPECT in the detection of resting left ventricular dysfunction. The aim of this study was to assess the value of the cavity-to-myocardium count ratio (C/M ratio) calculated in resting 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT images to identify patients with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).In the 95 patients studied, the C/M ratio was calculated from the midventricular short-axis slice using regions of interest drawn in the center of the cavity and in the most active area of the ventricular wall its value was compared with LVEF measured using two-dimensional echocardiography.The C/M ratio correlated with LVEF (r = 0.6, p < 0.000001) and was significantly lower in patients with abnormal LVEF than those with normal LVEF: 0.026 +/- 0.028 versus 0.125 +/- 0.093, p < 0.000001. In the entire patient population, a C/M ratio < 0.07 identified the patients with depressed LVEF with a 94% sensitivity, 71% specificity and 82% accuracy.The resting 99mTc-sestamibi C/M ratio is a useful parameter in identifying patients with depressed LVEF directly from the SPECT perfusion images.
