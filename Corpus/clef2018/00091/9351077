A comparison of solute clearance and ultrafiltration volume in peritoneal dialysis with total or fractional (50%) intraperitoneal volume exchange with the same dialysate flow rate. The most efficient way to perform automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) has not yet been defined. Tidal peritoneal dialysis (TPD) has been claimed to be more efficient than traditional intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD), but few comparative studies have been done keeping dialysate flow the same in the two treatment techniques.Six patients were treated with 10, 14 and 24 litres total dialysis fluid volume during 9 h (flow rate 18.5, 25.9 and 44.4 ml/min), receiving the treatments both as IPD and TPD. Glucose concentration in the fluid was held constant during all treatments. Transperitoneal clearances (ml/min) for urea, creatinine and uric acid and ultrafiltration volume was calculated, and comparisons made between TPD and IPD. The total intraperitoneal dwell time was calculated for each treatment session. A peritoneal equilibration test was also done for each patient.The ratio of the creatinine concentration in dialysate to the concentration in plasma at 4 h obtained with the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) averaged 0.77 (range 0.69-0.82). Urea clearance was higher for IPD than for TPD with 10 litres: 14.3 +/- 2.4 and 13.3 +/- 2.7 (P = 0.0092). For 14 and 24 litres urea clearance for IPD and TPD was 16.9 +/- 2.3 and 15.9 +/- 3.5 (n.s.) and 20.9 +/- 3.6 and 19.9 +/- 5.6 (n.s.) respectively. Creatinine clearance was higher for IPD than for TPD with 10 litres: 9.6 +/- 1.3 and 8.9 +/- 1.3 (P = 0.0002). For 14 and 24 litres creatinine clearance for IPD and TPD was 11.0 +/- 0.7 and 9.9 +/- 2.0 (n.s.) and 12.3 +/- 1.2 and 12.4 +/- 2.2 (n.s.) respectively. Uric acid clearance was higher for IPD than for TPD with 10 litres: 8.4 +/- 1.3 and 7.7 +/- 1.0 (P = 0.0054). For 14 and 24 litres uric acid clearance for IPD and TPD was 9.3 +/- 1.7 and 8.9 +/- 2.2 (n.s.) and 11.3 +/- 2.9 and 10.6 +/- 2.6 (n.s.) respectively. IPD gave significantly higher ultrafiltration volume (ml) than IPD for both 10 and 14 litres: 944 +/- 278 and 783 +/- 200 (P = 0.0313) and 1147 +/- 202 and 937 +/- 211 (P = 0.0478). For 24 litres there was no significant difference between IPD and TPD: 1220 +/- 224 and 1253 +/- 256.With the lowest dialysate flow rate (18.5 ml/min), solute clearance and ultrafiltration volume was higher on IPD than on TPD. With the intermediate flow rate (25.9 ml/min) the ultrafiltration volume was higher on IPD, but no difference was found for solute clearance. With the highest flow rate (44.4 ml/min) there was no difference neither for ultrafiltration nor for solute clearances.
