Interpersonal trauma and animal-related experiences in female and male military veterans: implications for program development. Exposure to trauma is more frequent than was previously recognized. The prevalence and impact of trauma events, including trauma involving animals, was assessed in age-matched male and female veterans. High rates of exposure to at least one trauma event were reported by males (95%) and females (97%). Females were more likely to report sexual and physical abuse by a significant other. Both genders experienced higher trauma rates in the military than in civilian settings. A survey of animal-related experiences showed similar rates of losing a special pet, being frightened or hurt by an animal, witnessing or perpetrating violence toward animals, and having sexual interactions with animals. Almost one-third of the veterans showed evidence of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, highlighting the potential benefit of trauma screening to identify veterans in need of further evaluation and treatment.
