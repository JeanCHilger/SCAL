Propentofylline enhances cerebral metabolic response to auditory memory stimulation in Alzheimer's disease. To evaluate efficacy, safety, metabolic and clinical effects of propentofylline in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in 30 patients with mild to moderate AD who underwent pretreatment and posttreatment 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography under resting conditions and during stimulation with an auditory memory paradigm. Twenty-eight subjects completed the 3-month study. The drug was well tolerated. In the active treatment group, a significant increase of cerebral metabolic response to the memory task was observed (multiple measurement ANOVA P = 0.02). The placebo group showed a significantly decline in the MMSE score (P = 0.02) while there was no change in the treatment group. This suggests a protective role for propentofylline in slowing the progression of AD.
