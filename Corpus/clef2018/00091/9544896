Regional cerebral blood flow during seizures in neonates. With the use of 99mTc-D, L,-hexamethylpropylenamine oxime and single photon emission computed tomography, regional cerebral blood flow was measured ictally in 12 mature infants with recurrent seizures and compared with a reference group of nine interictal studies. The study indicates that both clinical and electrical seizures in neonates are associated with a focal cerebral hyperperfusion of the same amount as seen in adults.
