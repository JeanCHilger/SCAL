Altropane, a SPECT or PET imaging probe for dopamine neurons: III. Human dopamine transporter in postmortem normal and Parkinson's diseased brain. Increasing evidence suggests that the dopamine transporter is situated almost exclusively on dopamine neurons. Accordingly, it is an valuable marker for Parkinson's disease and other pathological states of dopamine neurons. We previously demonstrated that the potent dopamine transport inhibitor [125I]altropane (IACFT:E-N-iodoallyl-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluor ophenyl)tropane) is a high affinity selective probe for the dopamine transporter in monkey brain and an effective SPECT imaging agent in nonhuman primate brain. We now report the binding properties of [125I]altropane in postmortem tissue of normal human brain and compare the findings to Parkinson's diseased brain. In homogenates of human brain putamen, [125I]altropane bound with high affinity (KD: 4.96 +/- 0.38 nM, n = 4) and site density (BMAX: 212 +/- 41.1 pmol/g original wet tissue weight) well within the density range reported previously for the dopamine transporter in this brain region. Drugs inhibited [125I]altropane binding with a rank order of potency that corresponded closely to their rank order for blocking dopamine transport (r 0.98, P < 0.001). In postmortem Parkinson's diseased brain, bound [125I]altropane (1 nM) was markedly reduced (89%, 99% in putamen, depending on measures of nonspecific binding) compared with normal aged-matched controls (normal putamen: 49.2 +/- 8.1 pmol/g Parkinson's diseased putamen: 0.48 +/- 0.33 pmol/g
