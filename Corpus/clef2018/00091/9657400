Assessment of coronary flow reserve by transesophageal echocardiography in cardiac transplant recipients. This study investigated the feasibility of dipyridamole Doppler transesophageal echocardiography to assess coronary flow reserve in 26 patients with orthotopic heart transplantation and compared it with positron emission tomography. We found an 85% success rate in obtaining Doppler flow signals in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Our data also showed that the correlation between transesophageal echocardiography and dipyridamole N-13 ammonia positron emission tomography increases when respective resting rate-pressure products are taken into account. However, comparison between the two methods should be made with caution because coronary flow reserve derived from transesophageal echocardiography tends to be higher than that obtained with positron emission tomography.
