Tooth enamel thickness in the mature dentition of domestic dogs and cats--preliminary study. The thickness of the enamel of dogs and cats was measured in 194 teeth. The enamel was found to be thinner than that of human teeth, varying in thickness from 0.1mm-1mm. The "enamel bulge" coronal to the cemento-enamel junction does not consist of a thickened area of enamel.
