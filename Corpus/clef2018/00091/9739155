Opiate receptor avidity is reduced in non-motor impaired MPTP-lesioned rhesus monkeys. Opiate receptor avidity, roughly equivalent to the ratio of unoccupied receptor density to the receptor dissociation constant (B'max/KD), was measured in four MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3, 6-tetrahydropyridine)-lesioned rhesus monkeys and nine normal controls with positron emission tomography (PET) and 6-deoxy-6-beta-[18F]fluoronaltrexone (cyclofoxy, CF), a mu- and kappa-opiate receptor antagonist. Although the MPTP-lesioned monkeys were dopamine deficient as measured with [18F]-L-fluorodopa ([18F]-DOPA) and PET [Doudet et al., 6-[18F]-L-DOPA imaging of the dopamine neostriatal system in normal and clinically normal-MPTP-treated rhesus monkeys, Exp. Brain Res. 78 (1989) 69-80], they had clinically recovered from the acute motor effects of MPTP exposure. Opiate receptor avidity was found to be reduced by 30-35% in the opiate-receptor rich areas of caudate, anterior putamen, thalamus, and amygdala of the MPTP-lesioned animals. The results suggest that opiate pathways make a significant contribution to the adjustment of cortico-striatal-thalamic pathway activity and thereby to behavior in rhesus monkeys following dopamine loss.
