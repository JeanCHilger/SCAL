Usefulness of measurement of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels in exercise testing of patients with coronary heart disease. Atrial natriuretic peptide secretion on exercise testing may be exaggerated by left ventricular dysfunction due to multivessel coronary disease rather than by scintigraphically detectable myocardial ischemia. The measurement of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels during exercise test may provide additional information regarding the severity of coronary heart disease.
