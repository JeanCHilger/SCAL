Simultaneous assessment of myocardial viability and function for the detection of hibernating myocardium using ECG-gated 99Tcm-tetrofosmin emission tomography: a comparison with 201Tl emission tomography combined with cine magnetic resonance imaging. The aims of this study were to evaluate the simultaneous assessment of myocardial viability and function for the detection of hibernating myocardium using ECG-gated 99Tcm-tetrofosmin single photon emission tomography (SPET), and to compare the technique with 201Tl SPET in combination with cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fifteen patients aged 41-70 years with impaired left ventricular function (mean LVEF 23.4 +/- 8.1%) and three-vessel coronary artery disease were studied before and after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The following investigations were performed within the 3 months before surgery: stress/redistribution and separate-day rest 201Tl SPET with early and late imaging, stress and ECG-gated rest 99Tcm-tetrofosmin SPET, and resting cine MRI. Between 3 and 6 months post-surgery, stress/redistribution 201Tl SPET and cine MRI were repeated. Tracer uptake in nine segments of the left ventricle was graded visually and by quantitative analysis. Myocardial motion and thickening were graded visually from cine MRI and from gated 99Tcm-tetrofosmin SPET images. Segments were defined as hibernating pre-operatively if tracer uptake was moderately reduced or better but myocardial motion was severely hypokinetic or worse. The accuracy of pre-operative assessment was assessed by comparison with post-operative function assessed by MRI. The sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of functional improvement were 69% and 60% for late rest 201Tl uptake combined with MRI 58% and 62% for rest 99Tcm-tetrofosmin uptake combined with MRI
