Regional cerebral blood flow difference between dementia with Lewy bodies and AD. The authors studied 14 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 14 patients with AD, and 14 healthy control subjects with N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine SPECT. Comparison with the statistical parametric mappings revealed that relative cerebral blood flow was lower in the occipital lobes and higher in the right medial temporal lobe in the DLB group than in the AD group. Decreased occipital perfusion and relatively well preserved medial temporal perfusion are features that distinguish DLB from AD.
