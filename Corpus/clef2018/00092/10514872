Positron emission tomography receptor studies. Several PET receptor ligands have been used to investigate the neurochemical basis of the epilepsies. 11C-Flumazenil binds to the central benzodiazepine receptor (cBZR)-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor complex 11C-diprenorphine, 18F-cyclofoxy, and 11C-carfentanil to opiate receptors
