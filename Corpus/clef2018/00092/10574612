Production of growth factors by in vitro cultured human endothelial cells after contact with carbon coated polyethylene terephthalate. The release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and platelet derived growth factor AB (PDGF-AB) by in vitro cultured human umbilical endothelial cells in contact with carbon and collagen coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET + PC) was assessed by enzyme immunoassay. The same cells cultured on polystyrene without biomaterials were tested as negative control. PET + PC induced a significant increase in the release of bFGF after 72 h and a significative reduction in the release of PDGF-AB after 48 and 72 h, compared to the negative control.
