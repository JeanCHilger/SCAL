Usefulness of 99Tcm-MDP knee SPET for pre-arthroscopic evaluation of patients with internal derangements of the knee. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether knee SPET can localize lesion sites in patients with internal derangements of the knee. We performed knee SPET as a pre-arthroscopic examination in 63 consecutive patients. SPET imaging was performed with a triple-headed SPET camera 4 h after the injection of 99Tcm-methylene diphosphonate. Arthroscopic diagnoses were as follows: 28 medial meniscus injuries, 24 lateral meniscus injuries, 31 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, three posterior cruciate ligament injuries and one medial collateral ligament injury. Of 30 patients with crescent-shaped increased activity at the medial tibial plateau, 22 had medial meniscus injuries (positive predictive value: PPV 73%) of 17 patients with crescent-shaped activity at the lateral tibial plateau, 13 had lateral meniscus injuries (PPV 76%). Of 18 patients with increased activity at ACL attachment sites (primary sign), 17 had ACL injuries (PPV 94%). Of 27 patients with increased activity at bone impaction sites of ACL injury (secondary sign), 22 had ACL injuries (PPV 81%). Of 32 patients who had either a primary or secondary sign, 26 had ACL injuries (PPV 81%). We conclude that knee SPET is very useful in the management of internal derangements of the knee, particularly in determining the need for arthroscopy by localizing lesion sites.
