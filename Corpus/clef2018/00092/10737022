Effects of healthy aging on the regional cerebral blood flow measurements using 99mTc-ECD SPECT assessed with statistical parametric mapping. To clarify the effects of normal aging on the cerebral blood flow, regional cerebral blood flow measurements++ using a Patlak Plot method of 99mTc-ECD were performed in 53 normal volunteers aged 18 to 87 years old (mean = 47.9 years). The subjects, 29 men and 24 women, were normal on clinical examination, and had neither a history of neurological nor psychiatric disease and no abnormal CT or MRI images. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used for automatching and an objective approach to analysis of SPECT image data. Global cerebral blood flow showed a significant decline with age (r = 0.406). The SPM analysis (voxel height p < 0.001, Bonferroni correction
