Neural correlates of semantic associative encoding in episodic memory. Associations between individual items are the basic building blocks of learning and memory. Functional neuroimaging has now made it possible to study neural correlates of such associations. The present PET study examined three associative encoding conditions differing in the number of words (0, 1, or 2) semantically related to a third word representing the name of a semantic category. A recall task consisting in the presentation of the category names as cues for retrieving the other two members of the triads followed each encoding condition. As expected, retrieval performance increased as the number of semantic exemplars at encoding increased (10%, 43%, 70% items recalled, respectively). A first analysis (partial least squares, PLS) of the PET data identified task-related patterns of activity for associative encoding and cued-recall tasks. A second analysis identified brain regions whose activity was modulated by the number of semantic exemplars at encoding. Some of the task-related brain regions also showed modulated activity by semantic relatedness and consisted in the left inferior prefrontal cortex, right medial temporal lobe, fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus bilaterally. Some of these regions showed greater activity when words in a triad were unrelated, whereas others did so when the three words were semantically related. These regions have been consistently reported in previous functional neuroimaging studies of associative encoding and may constitute key structures in association formation.
