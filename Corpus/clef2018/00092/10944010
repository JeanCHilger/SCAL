False-positive results obtained with stress myocardial SPECT in patients with right bundle branch block. Right bundle branch block (RBBB) is a conduction defect that often is accompanied by nonspecific patient symptoms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the false-positive results obtained with TI-201 myocardial SPECT in patients with RBBB.Thirty-one patients (24 men, 7 women age range, 35 to 78 yearsTI-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphs must be evaluated carefully in RBBB because false-positive results are likely to occur as a result of functional changes produced by dissynchronous activation between the ventricles.
