The functional neuroanatomy of simple calculation and number repetition: A parametric PET activation study. We examined cerebral activation patterns with positron emission tomography (PET) in 12 right-handed normal volunteers while they were completing simple calculation tasks or merely repeating numbers. Using a parametric experimental design, during calculation we found activation in the medial frontal/cingulate gyri, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left anterior insular cortex and right anterior insular cortex/putamen, left lateral parietal cortex, and the medial thalamus. Number repetition engaged bilateral inferior sensorimotor cortex, bilateral temporal areas, and left inferior frontal cortex. These results suggest a functional anatomical network for simple calculation, which includes aspects of attention, auditory, and motor processing and the phonological store and articulatory loop components of working memory they add some support for a special role of the parietal cortex in calculation tasks.
