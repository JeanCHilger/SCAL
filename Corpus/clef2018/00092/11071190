Myocardial blood-flow response during mental stress in patients with coronary artery disease. Positron emission tomography was used to quantify changes in myocardial blood flow during mental stress in patients with and without coronary artery disease. Blunted augmentation of myocardial blood flow during mental stress was observed in regions without significant epicardial stenosis.
