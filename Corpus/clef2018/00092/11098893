High-resolution image reconstruction method for time-of-flight positron emission tomography. We present a new image reconstruction method for time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET). The TOF-PET measurement system is modelled using the continuous-discrete mapping model, and images are reconstructed using an algebraic technique. The proposed method can produce images with better spatial resolution than conventional methods based on the filtered backprojection method. Numerical simulation results show that accurate modelling of the measurement system improves the spatial resolution and the contrast recovery, while the utilization of TOF information improves the signal-to-noise ratios of images.
