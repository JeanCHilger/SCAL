Structural and functional neuroimaging of electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Neuroimaging has long been utilized to provide a measure of the effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on brain structure and function as well as to better understand its mechanisms of action. In a similar fashion, functional neuroimaging may provide the means to elucidate both the underlying neurobiological effects and therapeutic potential of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This article will review findings of neuroimaging studies of both TMS and ECT, concentrating on how such studies may help guide treatment.
