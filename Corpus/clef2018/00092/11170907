Clinical value of [(18)F]fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography for patients with fever of unknown origin. We describe the diagnostic contribution of [(18)F]fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan in 58 consecutive cases of fever of unknown origin (FUO) and compare this new approach with gallium scintigraphy. This investigation was performed from March 1996 through October 1998 at Gasthuisberg University Hospital in Leuven, Belgium. A final diagnosis was established for 38 patients (64%). Forty-six FDG-PET scans (79%) were abnormal 24 of these abnormal scans (41% of the total number of scans) were considered helpful in diagnosis, and 22 (38% of the total number) were considered noncontributory to the diagnosis. In a subgroup of 40 patients (69%), both FDG-PET and gallium scintigraphy were performed. FDG-PET scan and gallium scintigraphy were normal in 23% and 33% of these cases, respectively
