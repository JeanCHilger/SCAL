The development of a potential single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging agent for the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor type. A high-affinity radioligand for CRHR1 has been prepared that can serve as a template for the development of SPECT imaging agents. The 5-chloro-N-cyclopropylmethyl-N-(2,6-dichloro-4-iodophenyl)-2-methyl-N-propylpyrimidine-4,6-diamine (6b, Ki = 14 nM), and the corresponding 4-bromophenyl analogue (6a, Ki = 21 nM), were synthesized in four steps from compound 3.
