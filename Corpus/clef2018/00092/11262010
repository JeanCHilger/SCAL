Flavor, color, and vitamin C retention of pulsed electric field processed orange juice in different packaging materials. Effects of packaging materials, storage temperature, and time on the stability of pulsed electric field (PEF) processed orange juice were investigated. Single-strength orange juice was treated with PEF at an electric field strength of 35 kV/cm for 59 micros using an integrated pilot plant scale PEF processing and glovebox packaging system. The retention of eight orange juice aroma compounds, color, and vitamin C in glass, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high-density polyethylene, and low-density polyethylene were evaluated at 4 and 22 degrees C for 112 days. Packaging material had a significant effect (p < or = 0.05) on the retention of orange juice aroma compounds, color, and vitamin C. PEF-treated orange juice had a shelf life of >16 weeks in glass and PET at 4 degrees C.
