Methylphenidate increased regional cerebral blood flow in subjects with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) responses to methylphenidate (MPH) treatment were examined in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Thirty-two male children, diagnosed with ADHD by the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, other behavioral assessment scales and neuropsychological battery, were studied using 99mTc-HMPAO-single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Subjects were studied before and after MPH treatment. First, using an image subtraction method, we obtained a NDR parametric image of each patient and found increased cerebral blood flow in the frontal lobes, caudate nuclei and thalamic areas after treatment. When the changes in SPECT and clinical response were compared, the matching rate, sensitivity and specificity between them were found to be 77.1, 80.0 and 79.2%, respectively. Second, three transaxial brain slices delineating anatomically defined regions of interest (ROI) at 20, 40, and 60mm above the orbitomeatal line (OML) were used, with the average number of counts for each region of interest normalized to the area of the cerebellar maximal uptake. The left and right prefrontal areas, and caudate and thalamic areas showed significant increases in rCBF after MPH treatment. These findings suggested MPH could affect the function of the fronto-striato-thalamic circuit, which is known as the pathophysiologic site of ADHD and could be used to correct the underlying brain dysfunction of ADHD.
