Assessment of effect of Shexiang Baoxin pill for labour angina pectoris patients with computerized tomography myocardial imaging. To assess the effect of Shexiang Baoxin Pill (SXBXP) for labour angina pectoris.Effect of 66 patients treated with conventional treatment or conventional treatment plus SXBXP were observed and compared with 99mTC-MIBI single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) target cardiograph to estimate ischemia myocardial area.The total effective rate was much higher in patients treated with SXBXP than that in patients treated with conventional treatment only (87.8% vs 56%, P < 0.05). The effective rate on ECG in the two groups was 70.7% and 52.0% respectively, without significant statistical difference between them(P > 0.05). While significant difference was observed in ischemia area of myocardial image between the two groups after treatment, 18.2 +/- 8.2% vs 23.8 +/- 9.8%, P < 0.05. Moreover, the recurrence of angina pectoris and cardiac event were also less in the SXBXP group.The SXBXP was effective for labour angina pectoris.
