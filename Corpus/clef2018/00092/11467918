Mental imagery of high- and low-resolution gratings activates area 17. Some, but not all, previous neuroimaging studies of visual mental imagery have found that Area 17 (primary visual cortex) is activated when people visualize objects. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that the necessary degree of resolution of the mental image is a determining factor in whether Area 17 is activated during imagery. Eight male subjects visualized and compared sets of stripes that required high or low resolution to resolve, while their brains were scanned using 15O(CO2) positron emission tomography (PET). When imagery in general (visualization of high- and low-resolution gratings stimuli combined) was compared to an auditory baseline condition where subjects did not visualize, Area 17 was activated. However, region of interest (ROI) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analyses revealed no difference between imagery conditions using high- and low-resolution stimuli. These results indicate that the resolution of the stimuli alone does not necessarily determine whether Area 17 will be activated during visual mental imagery.
