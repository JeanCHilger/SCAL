Positron-emission tomography (PET) in solitary pulmonary nodule. Solitary Pulmonary Nodules have from 10% to 70% probability of malignancy. After the Computed Tomography Study, 30% to 40% of them are still classified as indeterminated in regards to malignancy. The Positron Emission Tomography has been used to define if the nodules are benign or malignant. The bibliography is review and our results are shown in 45 confirmed cases. The best results were obtained for a 2.5 Standardized Uptake Value. With this Value, the clinical efficacy parameters were: Sensitivity 0.92, Specificity 0.90, Positive Predictive Value 0.92, Negative Predictive Value 0.90 and Accuracy 0.91.
