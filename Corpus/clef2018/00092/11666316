Bonding Properties of the 1,2-Semiquinone Radical-Anionic Ligand in the [M(CO)(4-n)(L)(n)(DBSQ)] Complexes (M = Re, Mn DBSQ = 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzosemiquinone Rhenium and manganese complexes of the 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzosemiquinone (DBSQ) ligand, [M(CO)(4)(DBSQ)], fac-[M(CO)(3)(L)(DBSQ)], and cis,trans-[M(CO)(2)(L)(2)(DBSQ)], with a widely varied nature of co-ligand(s) (L = THF, Me(2)CO, MeC(O)Ph, py, NEt(3), Ph(3)PO, SbPh(3), AsPh(3), PCy(3), P(OPh)(3), PPh(3), dppe-p, PPh(2)Et, P(OEt)(3), PEt(3)) were generated in solution and characterized as valence-localized molecules containing the radical-anionic DBSQ ligand bound to Re(I) or Mn(I) metal atoms. This is evidenced by the following. (i) Carbonyl stretching frequencies nu(C&tbd1O) and average force constants k(av) are typical for Mn(I) or Re(I) carbonyls. (ii) Frequencies of the intra-dioxolene C=O bond stretching vibration, nu(C=O), lie within the 1400-1450 cm(-1) range which is diagnostic for coordinated semiquinones. (iii) EPR spectra indicate a very small spin density on the metal atom (0.2% < a(M)/A(iso) > 2.6%). (iv) Absorption spectra show Re(I) --> DBSQ MLCT electronic transitions characterized by a resonant enhancement of the Raman peaks due to the nu(C&tbd1
