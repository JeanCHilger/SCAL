(201)Tl and (99m)Tc-MIBI retention in an isolated heart model of low-flow ischemia and stunning: evidence of negligible impact of myocyte metabolism on tracer kinetics. It is not known whether cellular metabolic disorders play a role in the decreased tracer uptake that is documented by conventional SPECT during low-flow ischemia or stunning. This study sought to determine the impact of low-flow ischemia and stunning on the kinetics of (201)Tl and MIBI across the plasma membrane of myocytes.The global myocardial retention (Rf) of (201)Tl and MIBI was determined in isolated working hearts from rabbits, perfused with red blood cell-enhanced solution. Experiments were performed in normoxia, with physiological values of coronary flow (N n = 16)There was a slight increase in average values of Ci/Cc in ischemia, but not in stunning, for (201)Tl (L, 0.011 +/- 0.006 vs. N, 0.006 +/- 0.004 [P < 0.05] S, 0.007 +/- 0.004 vs. N [not significant]) and for MIBI (L, 0.011 +/- 0.008 vs. N, 0.005 +/- 0.004 [P < 0.05]The kinetics of (201)Tl and MIBI across the plasma membrane of myocytes were affected only poorly by low-flow ischemia and not at all by stunning, without any deleterious effects on myocardial retention of both tracers. During low-flow ischemia or stunning, therefore, the information provided by (201)Tl or MIBI SPECT is expected to depend on myocardial perfusion but not on cellular metabolic disorders.
