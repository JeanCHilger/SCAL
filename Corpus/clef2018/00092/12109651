Tc-99m-labeled human polyclonal immunoglobulin G (HIG) scintigraphy in Sjögren's syndrome. To evaluate the usefulness of Tc-99m-HIG scintigraphy in patients with Sjögren's syndrome.Twelve consecutive patients with verified secondary Sjögren's syndrome were included in this prospective study. The control group consisted of seven patients with Lupus erythematosus none of them showed clinical signs of Sjögren's syndrome. Planar and SPECT images of the head were performed six hours after i.v. administration of Tc-99m HIG.Eleven out of twelve patients with secondary Sjögren's syndrome showed a positive result, while one was false negative. Tracer accumulation in patients with positive scintigraphy varied. All patients of the control group were negative.Our data in a limited number of patients suggest that Tc-99m HIG scintigraphy could be a modality with high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome and can provide objective information on the severity of the disease.
