Circulating tumor markers and nuclear medicine imaging modalities: breast, prostate and ovarian cancer. Clinical oncologists have always shown great interest in circulating tumor markers. There are several markers that in the clinical routine are a signal of particular tumor types some of them are strictly tissue-specific such as prostatic specific antigen (PSA) for prostatic cancer, AFP and HCG for germ cell tumors of the testis and ovary, others such as CA 15.3, CA125, CEA or cytokeratins are less specific since their elevations can be found in different varieties of cancers even if they are preferentially associated to a certain tumor type, thus are considered markers for breast, ovarian cancer and colon adenocarcinoma. The most useful clinical applications of these parameters is their determination during the follow-up of the treated patients, in order to detect the tumor recurrence early, and also to evaluate the evolution of the disease by monitoring the treatment responses. During follow-up, increasing levels of tumor markers can be observed even several months before the clinical demonstration of cancer recurrence. The association of tumor marker tests with imaging modalities can lead to several advantages: the first is to confirm the diagnosis of relapses, possibly before the appearence of the related clinical symptoms due to tumor growth
