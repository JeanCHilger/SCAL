Correlation of cerebral blood flow and treatment effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in depressed patients. The aims of this study were to: (1) assess the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on brain activity in depressed patients as measured by single photon emission tomography (SPECT) (2) evaluate the predictive value of brain SPECT on the antidepressant efficacy of rTMS. Patients (n=17) received 1600 rTMS stimuli at a rate of 10 Hz, 5 days per week for 2 weeks to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Whole brain SPECT data were acquired using Tc99m-Bicisate. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was correlated with the % change in the 28-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Score (Delta-HDRS) and a semiquantitative region of interest (ROI) analysis was conducted. Prior to rTMS there was a significant left-right asymmetry favoring the right, whereas 2 weeks after the rTMS treatment this asymmetry was reversed. The rCBF in limbic structures was negatively correlated with the outcome and rCBF in several neocortical areas was positively correlated. Brain SPECT can provide information about mechanisms of action of rTMS and may have predictive value for the antidepressant efficacy of rTMS.
