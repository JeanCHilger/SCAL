Cerebrovascular reserve capacity. Cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVR) describes how far cerebral perfusion can increase from a baseline value after stimulation. Measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) can be done by PET or SPECT. Noninvasive and easily performed transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) is mostly used as indirect perfusion measurement. Stimulation of cerebral perfusion is often done by CO2 inhalation or acetazolamide injection. Alternative stimuli are breath holding or cerebral activation by hand-gripping. Normal values for these tests are presented. The hemodynamic effect of stenoses of the internal carotid artery (ICA) can be estimated using CVR. The relevance of CVR is discussed controversially, since cerebral infarction due to stenosis of arteries supplying the brain is probably mostly of embolic, not hemodynamic origin. The indication for carotid artery surgery according the NASCET and ECST investigations takes into account only the degree of the stenoses and not the CVR. According to recent studies, the risk of cerebral infarction in these patients is considerably higher with reduced CVR. Therefore, CVR can be used as an additional parameter if the indication for surgery is not defined, especially in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. It seems also possible to identify patients who might profit from an extra-intracranial bypass operation and high-risk patients for cerebral ischemia with cerebral microangiopathy. Furthermore, the risk of cerebral infarction during carotid artery surgery and also during heart surgery can be estimated using CVR. More studies with a higher number of patients are needed to confirm the potential predictive diagnostic value of CVR in order to establish CVR measurement as part of a routine diagnostic neuroangiologic program.
