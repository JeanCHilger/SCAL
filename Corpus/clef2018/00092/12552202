Respiratory depression by tramadol in the cat: involvement of opioid receptors. Tramadol hydrochloride (tramadol) is a synthetic opioid analgesic with a relatively weak affinity at opioid receptors. At analgesic doses, tramadol seems to cause little or no respiratory depression in humans, although there are some conflicting data. The aim of this study was to examine whether tramadol causes dose-dependent inhibitory effects on the ventilatory carbon dioxide response curve and whether these are reversible or can be prevented by naloxone.Experiments were performed in cats under alpha-chloralose-urethane anesthesia. The effects of tramadol and naloxone were studied by applying square-wave changes in end-tidal pressure of carbon dioxide (Petco2 7.5-11 mmHg) and by analyzing the dynamic ventilatory responses using a two-compartment model with a fast peripheral and a slow central component, characterized by a time constant, carbon dioxide sensitivity, time delay, and a single offset (apneic threshold).In five animals 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg tramadol (intravenous) increased the apneic threshold (control: 28.3 +/- 4.8 mmHg [mean +/- SD] after 4 mg/kg: 36.7 +/- 7.1 mmHgBecause naloxone completely reversed the inhibiting effects of tramadol on ventilatory control and it prevented more than 50% of the respiratory depression after a single dose of tramadol, the authors conclude that this analgesic causes respiratory depression that is mainly mediated by opioid receptors.
