Prediction of left ventricular functional recovery by dobutamine echocardiography, F-18 deoxyglucose or 99mTc sestamibi nuclear imaging in patients with chronic myocardial infarction. Currently, several modalities are available to predict viability, however, studies comparing various modalities validated by functional recovery after revascularization are scarce. This study analyzed the relative merits of low-dose dobutamine echocardiography, F-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and (99m)Tc sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography to predict functional recovery after revascularization in patients with chronic myocardial infarction.Patients with chronic coronary occlusion (duration: 3.1 +/- 4.8 years) and impaired left ventricular function (ejection fraction: 42 +/- 13%) underwent low-dose dobutamine echocardiography (20 microg/kg/min), FDG-PET and (99m)Tc sestamibi imaging before revascularization. Revascularization was performed irrespective of any viability data. Follow-up angiography was obtained 4.8 +/- 2.5 months after revascularization.Viability analysis was performed in 34 patients with patent target vessel at follow-up, of whom 9 (27%) exhibited functional recovery on left ventricular angiography. For dobutamine echocardiography, improvement of >/=2 adjacent akinetic segments resulted in improved sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 80% to predict functional recovery. For glucose metabolism, FDG uptake >55% was an optimal threshold yielding a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 68%. With respect to perfusion, (99m)Tc sestamibi uptake >60% was the best cutoff resulting in a sensitivity and a specificity of 56 and 88%, respectively. A concordant match of FDG >55% and of (99m)Tc sestamibi >50% resulted in optimized sensitivity (78%) and specificity (80%) with dual imaging.Recovery of chronically dysfunctional myocardium can be predicted with high accuracy by stimulation of contractile reserve or by concordant match of preserved glucose metabolism and residual perfusion.
