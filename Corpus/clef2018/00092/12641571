Contact sensitization to N-(cyclohexylthio)phthalimide. Previous reports revealed relative high sensitization rates to the rubber chemical N-(cyclohexylthio)phthalimide (CTP CAS-No. 17796-82-6), but the relevance of positive reactions remained unknown. It was discussed whether the test concentration of 1% pet. needed to be changed. The German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) added CTP in 3 concentrations, i.e. 0.25% pet., 0.5% pet, 1% pet., to the rubber series. From June 1999 to December 2000, 1936 patients in 30 departments of dermatology were tested with CTP. Of the 56 patients with a positive test reaction (2.9%), 52 reacted to CTP 1% pet., 21 to CTP 0.5% pet., and 9 to CTP 0.25% pet. The reaction indices were about the same with all concentrations. 34 patients with a positive reaction to CTP 1% pet. did not react to the lower concentrations. The majority of these reactions are probably false-positive. With CTP 0.25% pet., however, the majority of true allergic reactions to CTP were missed. Analysis of population characteristics and concomitant sensitizations to other rubber chemicals led to the conclusion that a positive reaction to CTP 0.5% pet. was a good indicator of contact allergy to CTP. Thus, the DKG decided to continue patch testing with CTP 0.5% pet. in the rubber series. Manufacturers' information about the use of CTP seem to partly contradict the patients' characteristics seen in this study. So the relevance of positive CTP patch test reactions, and the causative exposures in patients with CTP allergy, still remain to be clarified.
