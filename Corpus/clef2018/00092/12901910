Synthesis and binding affinities of fluoroalkylated raloxifenes. Three fluoroalkylated derivatives (1-3) of the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), raloxifene, have been synthesized. The key step in the synthesis is the C-C bond formation of benzo[b]thiophene and a substituted phenyl group (ring C) using a Stille reaction. The in vitro binding affinities of the substituted raloxifenes 1-3 are 45, 60, 89%, respectively, relative to the affinity of estradiol, which is higher than the affinity of raloxifene itself (25%). When labeled with the positron-emitting radionuclide, these compounds might be useful as PET imaging agents for estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors.
