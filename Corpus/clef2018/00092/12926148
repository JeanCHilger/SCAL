Detection of bladder cancer using single-photon emission computed tomography of thallium-201: a preliminary report. Thallium-201 (Tl-201) is a recognized tumor-imaging agent however, the usefulness of Tl-201 in bladder cancer has not been studied. The aim of this preliminary study was to evaluate the potential usefulness of Tl-201 in detecting bladder cancer. A total of 14 patients (11 men and 3 women ranging in age from 49 to 80 years) with bladder cancer were arranged for Tl-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the pelvis. All of the patients had transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). Meanwhile, 7 normal controls (5 men and 2 women
