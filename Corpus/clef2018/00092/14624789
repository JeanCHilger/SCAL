FDG PET imaging in hereditary thyroid cancer. To report the role of different imaging methods in staging individuals with multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A (MEN2A) or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC).Fourteen newly diagnosed gene carriers underwent cervical ultrasound scanning (US), cervical and mediastinal CT, MRI and whole-body meta-[131I]iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scanning.US identified seven true primary cancer. CT and MRI located only tumors > or =5 mm in diameter. MIBG scintigraphy and FDG PET could not identify MTC foci within the thyroid. Whole-body FDG PET identified two true-positive and one false-positive lymph node metastases. MIBG scintigraphy did not identify lymph node metastases. Total thyroidectomy was performed in 12 cases, and subtotal thyroidectomy in two subjects.Whole-body FDG PET and cervical US help stage individuals carrying mutant genes verifying MEN2A or FMTC.
