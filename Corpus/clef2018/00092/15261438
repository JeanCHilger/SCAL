Positron emission tomography in the diagnosis of mesothelioma. The increasing incidence of malignant pleural mesothelioma has led to the development of new treatment strategies and a need for new diagnostic techniques to identify the extent of the disease at an early stage and to evaluate treatment. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are helpful in identifying the location and extent of the involved areas but cannot always differentiate between benign and malignant processes. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, which in oncology, is based on changes in metabolic pathways of glucose, has been shown in a number of studies to differentiate malign and benign lesions in patients with asbestos exposure. FDG-PET images were also found to provide excellent delineation of the active tumour sites. Further evaluations of this technique included a combined experimental/clinical study to investigate the difference in rates of FDG uptake between malignant and inflammatory cells and processes.
