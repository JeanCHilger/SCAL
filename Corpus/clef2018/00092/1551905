The nuclear gene MRS2 is essential for the excision of group II introns from yeast mitochondrial transcripts in vivo. RNA splicing defects in mitochondrial intron mutants can be suppressed by a high dosage of several proteins encoded by nuclear genes. In this study we report on the isolation, nucleotide sequence, and possible functions of the nuclear MRS2 gene. When present on high copy number plasmids, the MRS2 gene acts as a suppressor of various mitochondrial intron mutations, suggesting that the MRS2 protein functions as a splicing factor. This notion is supported by the observations that disruption of the single chromosomal copy of the MRS2 gene causes (i) a pet- phenotype and (ii) a block in mitochondrial RNA splicing of all four mitochondrial group II introns, some of which are efficiently self-splicing in vitro. In contrast, the five group I introns monitored here are excised from pre-mRNA in a MRS2-disrupted background although at reduced rates. So far the MRS2 gene product is unique in that it is essential for splicing of all four group II introns, but relatively unimportant for splicing of group I introns. In strains devoid of any mitochondrial introns the MRS2 gene disruption still causes a pet- phenotype and cytochrome deficiency, although the standard pattern of mitochondrial translation products is produced. Therefore, apart from RNA splicing, the absence of the MRS2 protein may disturb the assembly of mitochondrial membrane complexes.
