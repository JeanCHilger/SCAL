Brain imaging findings in neuropathic pain. The contribution of brain imaging technologies to the understanding of mechanisms underlying clinical neuropathic conditions is discussed in this article. Available technologies, their advantages, and contributions also are presented. The brain regions involved in acute pain are contrasted to chronic pain and the implications of these differences are discussed. Overall, the reasons for the limited contribution of these techniques to the science of chronic pain are presented in this article.
