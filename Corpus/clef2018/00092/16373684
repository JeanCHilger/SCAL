Overall activity of all masticatory muscles during lateral excursion. Quantification of the overall activity of every masticatory muscle is requisite for the analysis of stomatognathic function, which has not been accomplished by conventional electromyography. We used positron emission tomography and 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose to quantify the overall activity of every masticatory muscle during lateral excursion, and to evaluate the relative contribution of each masticatory muscle to lateral excursion. The present study suggested that lateral and medial pterygoid muscles are more responsible for lateral excursion than are masseter and temporal muscles. In particular, the contralateral lateral pterygoid muscle plays a major role, followed by the contralateral medial pterygoid muscle.
