Effects of age-dependent or liposome-induced alterations in the phospholipid composition on sphingomyelin biosynthesis in rat liver microsomal and plasma membranes. 1. The effects of age-dependent or liposome-induced alterations in the phospholipid composition of rat liver plasma and microsomal membranes on the phosphatidylethanolamine:ceramide-phosphoethanolamine (PE:Cer-PEt) and phosphatidylcholine:ceramide-phosphocholine (PC:Cer-PCh) transferase activities were studied. 2. In all cases under study the PE:Cer-PEt transferase activity was found to be several times higher than that of PC:Cer-PCh transferase in both plasma and microsomal rat liver membranes. 3. The presence of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in plasma membranes was observed to enhance the PE:Cer-PEt transferase activity, while phosphatidylserine (PS) inhibited it.
