Nitric oxide and prostaglandins influence local skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise in humans: coupling between local substrate uptake and blood flow. Synergic action of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins (PG) in the regulation of muscle blood flow during exercise has been demonstrated. In the present study, we investigated whether these vasodilators also regulate local blood flow, flow heterogeneity, and glucose uptake within the exercising skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle blood flow was measured in seven healthy young men using near-infrared spectroscopy and indocyanine green and muscle glucose uptake using positron emission tomography and 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-[(18)F]glucose without and with local blockade of NO and PG at rest and during one-legged dynamic knee-extension exercise. Local blockade was produced by infusing nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and indomethacin directly in the muscle via a microdialysis catheter. Blood flow and glucose uptake were measured in the region of blockade and in two additional regions of vastus lateralis muscle 1 and 4 cm away from the infusion of blockers. Local blockade during exercise at 25 and 40 watts significantly decreased blood flow in the infusion region and in the region 1 cm away from the site of infusion but not in the region 4 cm away. During exercise, muscle glucose uptake did not show any regional differences in response to blockade. These results show that NO and PG synergistically contribute to the local regulation of blood flow in skeletal muscle independently of muscle glucose uptake in healthy young men. Thus these vasodilators can play a role in regulating microvascular blood flow in localized regions of vastus lateralis muscle but do not influence regional glucose uptake. The findings suggest that local substrate uptake in skeletal muscle can be regulated independently of regional changes in blood flow.
