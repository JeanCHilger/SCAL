Image reconstruction and quantification in emission tomography. Radionuclide tomographic imaging has substantially benefited from the introduction of statistical image reconstruction. Although the main concepts of these iterative algorithms were published decades ago, their widespread use in clinical routine only became available with faster computers for image processing in the last few years. This article gives an overview of data acquisition and iterative reconstruction in emission tomography, deals with the popular maximum likelihood algorithm, and describes the basics of the maximum a posteriori reconstruction. Prerequisites and corrections necessary for quantification are discussed in the second part of the article on the basis of positron emission tomography. Improvements in technical equipment are expected to stimulate future research into image reconstruction.
