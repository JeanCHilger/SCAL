Validation of a novel CHX-A'' derivative suitable for peptide conjugation: small animal PET/CT imaging using yttrium-86-CHX-A''-octreotide. A versatile bifunctional chelating reagent based on a preorganized cyclohexyl derivative of DTPA (CHX-A'') has been developed for the convenient N-terminal labeling of peptides with metal ion radionuclides of Bi(III), In(III), Lu(III), or Y(III). This was achieved via the synthesis of a mono-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl penta-tert-butyl ester derivative of CHX-A'' (trans-cyclohexyldiethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid) featuring a glutaric acid spacer. Commercially obtained octreotide was modified at its N-terminus by this reagent in the solution phase, and its subsequent radiolabeling with (111)In (T(1/2) = 2.8 d) and (86)Y (T(1/2) = 14.7 h) demonstrated. Small animal PET/CT imaging results of (86)Y-CHX-A''-octreotide in a somatostatin receptor-positive tumor-bearing rat model are presented for the validation of the novel agent.
