Comparison of left ventricular functional parameters measured by gated single photon emission tomography and by two-dimensional echocardiography. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation amongst left ventricular (LV) functional parameters estimated by gated single photon emission tomography (GSPET) and two-dimensional (2D) M-mode, echocardiography (ECHOC). GSPET was performed in a single day stress/rest protocol by using either technetium-99m methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile ((99m)Tc-MIBI) or technetium-99m tetrofosmin ((99m)Tc-myoview) in 36 consecutive patients, 21 males and 15 females mean age 57.6+/-11.8 y, range 32-82 y. The various LV parameters studied were: ejection fraction (EF), end systolic volume (ESV), end diastolic volume (EDV), stroke volume (SV) and LV mass (LVM). The GSPET data were reconstructed using an automatic algorithm employing filtered back projection (FBP) and further analyzed by Emory cardiac (EC) toolbox versions EO-00369 and EO-00733 for the quantitative determinations of these parameters. All patients underwent ECHOC within 1-2 h of the post-stress data acquisition of GSPET. Our results showed that the LV volumes and the LVM showed good correlation (r=0.749 to 0.952, P=0.01). These values could thus be used interchangeably. The assessment of these parameters by GSPET therefore does not seem to be affected by the dose of the radioactivity administered as the dose of the (99m)Tc-labeled myocardial agents for acquiring rest study was approximately four times higher than that for the stress study. Our results also showed that the mean +/- SD values of the volumes and the EF of the LV evaluated by the two techniques, differed significantly except significant correlations for ESV, EDV and LVEF were observed between the two methods: r=0.574 to 0.954
