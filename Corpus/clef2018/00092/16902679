Osseous stress reaction in a rower diagnosed with positron emission tomography (PET): a case report. Back injury is one of the most frequently encountered injuries in the collegiate rower. The differential diagnosis of back pain in the competitive rower includes muscle strain, ligament/tendon injury, stress reaction, stress fracture, and a tear in the annulus fibrosis. Endurance sports, such as rowing, have an increased frequency of stress injury The diagnosis of stress reaction cannot be made with plain radiographs. Many studies have firmly established the efficacy of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) bone scans and magnetic resonance imaging in establishing the diagnosis of a stress reaction We present a case of a collegiate rower with mid back pain secondary to a stress reaction of the endplates of the costotransverse articulation at the T8 level diagnosed by a positive positron emission tomogram study in the setting of a negative SPECT scan.
