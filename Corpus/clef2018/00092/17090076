Organic light-emitting diodes having carbon nanotube anodes. Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) films on flexible PET (polyethyleneterephthalate) substrates are used as transparent, flexible anodes for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). For polymer-based OLEDs having the structure: SWNT/PEDOT-PSS:MeOH/TFB (poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-N-(4-butylphenyl)diphenylamine)) + TPD-Si(2) (4,4'-bis[(p-trichlorosilylpropylphenyl)phenylamino]biphenyl) /BT (poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole))/CsF/Al, a maximum light output of 3500 cd/m(2) and a current efficiency of 1.6 cd/A have been achieved. The device operational lifetime is comparable to that of devices with Sn-doped In(2)O(3) (ITO)/PET anodes. The advantages of this novel type of anode over conventional ITO are discussed.
