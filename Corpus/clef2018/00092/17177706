Is it possible to improve the patch-test diagnostics for isocyanates? A stability study of petrolatum preparations of diphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate and polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate. We have previously shown that the concentration of diphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate (4,4'-MDI) in commercial test preparations was so low that patch testing with the same was not reliable. The stability of 4,4'-MDI in petrolatum (pet.) was compared with pet. preparations of polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (PMDI), which consists of a complex mixture of monomeric isomers and oligomers of MDI. Preparations of 4,4'-MDI and PMDI were stored under 3 different conditions, i.e. at room temperature, refrigerated and frozen. They were analysed continuously during 1 year with regard to the content of 4,4'-MDI, 3-ring oligomers and 4-ring oligomers using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. PMDI preparations kept frozen were stable for a year. All other preparations failed to fulfil the requirements of stability, i.e. +/-20% of the initial concentration. Storage in a freezer prolonged the lifetime for 4,4'-MDI. The decrease in concentration for preparations kept at room temperature and refrigerated was less rapid in PMDI preparations than in 4,4'-MDI preparations. PMDI preparations are better suited for patch testing patients exposed to MDI because they are more stable and homogeneous than 4,4'-MDI preparations. They better reflect possible allergens that workers are exposed to because products used in industry contain both monomers and oligomers.
