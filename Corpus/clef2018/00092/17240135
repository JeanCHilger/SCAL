Imaging angiogenesis. Angiogenesis represents the formation of new capillaries by cellular outgrowth from existing microvessels and plays a critical role in the response to ischemia associated with peripheral arterial disease and myocardial infarction. Imaging of angiogenesis would be valuable in risk stratification of patients with arterial occlusive disease. The progress in noninvasive imaging strategies to assess angiogenesis has been made possible with the availability of many technological advances, which include dedicated hybrid SPECT-CT and PET-CT systems and agents targeted at molecular markers of the angiogenic process, involving both receptor-probe interactions and reporter gene technology. These novel targeted approaches for imaging angiogenesis will complement standard imaging of physiological parameters and will play a crucial role for evaluation of therapeutic interventions to promote angiogenesis.
