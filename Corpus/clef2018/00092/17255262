Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography predicts tumor differentiation, P-glycoprotein expression, and outcome after resection in hepatocellular carcinoma. To investigate the diagnostic value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for prediction of tumor differentiation, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression, and outcome in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Seventy HCC patients who underwent curative resection were prospectively enrolled in the study. FDG-PET was done 2 weeks preoperatively, and the standardized uptake value (SUV) and the tumor to nontumor SUV ratio (TNR) were calculated from FDG uptake. Tumor differentiation and P-gp expression were examined with H&E and immunohistochemical staining, respectively.SUV and TNR were significantly higher in poorly differentiated HCCs than in well-differentiated (P = 0.001 and 0.002) and moderately differentiated HCCs (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001). The percentage P-gp-positive area was significantly higher in well-differentiated HCCs than in poorly differentiated (P < 0.0001) and moderately differentiated HCCs (P = 0.0001). Inverse correlations were found between SUV and P-gp expression (r = -0.44 P < 0.0001) and between TNR and P-gp expression (r = -0.47The results suggest that preoperative FDG-PET reflects tumor differentiation and P-gp expression and may be a good predictor of outcome in HCC.
