FDG-PET lymphoma demonstration project invitational workshop. The proceedings of a workshop focusing on a project to evaluate the use of fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) as a tool to measure treatment response in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) are described. Sponsored by the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the Foundation of the National Institutes of Health, and the National Cancer Institute, and attended by representatives of the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and scientists and clinical researchers from academia and the pharmaceutical and medical imaging industries, the workshop reviewed the etiology and current standards of care for NHL and proposed the development of a clinical trial to validate FDG-PET imaging techniques as a predictive biomarker for cancer therapy response. As organized under the auspices of the Oncology Biomarker Qualification Initiative, the three federal health agencies and their private sector and nonprofit/advocacy group partners believe that FDG-PET not only demonstrates the potential to be used for the diagnosis and staging of many cancers but in particular can provide an early indication of therapeutic response that is well correlated with clinical outcomes for chemotherapy for this common form of lymphoma. The development of standardized criteria for FDG-PET imaging and establishment of procedures for transmission, storage, quality assurance, and analysis of PET images afforded by this demonstration project could streamline clinical trials of new treatments for more intractable forms of lymphoma and other cancers and, hence, accelerate new drug approvals.
