Comparison between thallium-201 and technetium-99m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile defect size in single-photon emission computed tomography at rest, exercise and redistribution in coronary artery disease. Defect size on myocardial tomograms was measured in 30 patients who underwent 2 separate studies, 1 with thallium-201 (TI-201), the other with technetium-99m-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI). A group of 15 patients with myocardial infarction was studied at rest and received both tracers on the same day. The other 15 patients had documented coronary artery disease. They were were given injections of TI-201 at peak exercise and underwent imaging immediately after exercise and again 4 hours later. They then received a dose of MIBI for imaging at rest. A week later they underwent a second exercise test with the same work load and received a second dose of MIBI. Defect size on single-photon emission computed tomographic images was measured and repeated twice. Results were expressed in percentage of the volume of the whole myocardium. Reproducibility of the defect size measurement was high for TI-201 (r = 0.978 SEE = 1.59) as well as for MIBI (r = 0.981
