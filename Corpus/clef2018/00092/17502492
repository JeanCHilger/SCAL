Validation of renal oxidative metabolism measurement by positron-emission tomography. Either in research or in clinical practice, the exploration of renal oxidative metabolism is limited by the lack of noninvasive measurement. Positron-emission tomography using carbon-11 acetate may estimate tissue oxidative metabolism by measuring acetate turnover in the Krebs cycle. Although extensively studied in cardiology, this method has never been validated for renal oxidative metabolism measurement. The aim of this study is the validation of acetate turnover compared with the invasive renal oxygen consumption measurement. Renal oxygen consumption and tubular sodium reabsorption were measured invasively in 10 anesthetized pigs. Simultaneously, acetate turnover was estimated by the clearance of carbon-11 acetate in the renal cortex, after a 166-MBq injection of carbon-11 acetate. Renal oxidative metabolism was measured under various conditions induced by mechanical and pharmacological interventions. Renal oxygen consumption and acetate turnover varied on a wide range from 0.05 to 0.29 mmol min(-1) (>5-fold) and from 0.025 to 0.188 minutes(-1) (>7-fold), respectively. Acetate turnover was very significantly correlated with renal oxygen consumption (P<0.0001 R=0.82) and tubular sodium reabsorption (P=0.001
