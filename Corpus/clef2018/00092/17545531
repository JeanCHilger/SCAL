Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake of primary non-small cell lung cancer at positron emission tomography: new contrary data on prognostic role. This prospective study evaluated the prognostic significance of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) uptake in primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at positron emission tomography, in a carefully staged population, while correcting for partial volume effects.Two hundred eight potentially resectable NSCLC patients were referred for FDG positron emission tomography staging after thoracic computed tomography. Each tumor stage was confirmed surgically, or for some stage IV tumors by additional imaging. The tumor maximum pixel-standardized uptake value (maxSUV) and the maxSUV partial volume corrected for lesion size (PVCmaxSUV) were compared with overall survival and disease-free survival using Cox proportional hazards regression.Stage distribution: stage I, 36% stage II, 15%As expected, tumor stage is prognostic in NSCLC. However, tumor FDG uptake does not provide additional prognostic information. This prospective study contradicts prior reports.
