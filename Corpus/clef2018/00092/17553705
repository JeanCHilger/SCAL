Functional anatomy of motor urgency. This PET H(2)(15)O study uses a reaching task to determine the neural basis of the unconscious motor speed up observed in the context of urgency in healthy subjects. Three conditions were considered: self-initiated (produce the fastest possible movement toward a large plate, when ready), externally-cued (same as self-initiated but in response to an acoustic cue) and temporally-pressing (same as externally-cued with the plate controlling an electromagnet that prevented a rolling ball from falling at the bottom of a tilted ramp). Results show that: (1) Urgent responses (Temporally-pressing versus Externally-cued) engage the left parasagittal and lateral cerebellar hemisphere and the sensorimotor cortex (SMC) bilaterally (2) Externally-driven responses (Externally-cued versus Self-initiated) recruit executive areas within the contralateral SMC
