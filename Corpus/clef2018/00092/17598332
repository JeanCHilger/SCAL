Fat and muscle component of body mass index (BMI): relation with hyperinsulinemia. Currently there is tremendous interest in obesity and its harmful donsequences. Height, weight and body mass index (BMI) along with waist girth are routinely used parameters. One snag in the interpretation of BMI >25 as a measure of obesity is the assumption that the increase is mainly due to fat. This review emphasizes the importance of assessing the muscle component of BMI (by simple somatoscopy or somatotyping). 75 percent of Indian T2DM patients have a normal or low BMI, only 25 percent have BMI >25, wherein muscle mass also contributes as well as fat. Hyperinsulinemia is anabolic to both fat and muscle. Since skeletal muscle is a primary site of insulin resistance, greater the muscle mass, greater the importance of physical exercise to overcome the insulin resistance and greater the importance of dietary supplement of n3-PUFA to optimize the phospholipid composition of the muscle membrane (increasing membrane fluidity and thereby permitting longer residence of GLUT-4 in the plasma membrane). I propose three testable hypotheses: (1) Brown fat (FDG-PET imaging) and UCP2 and UCP3 expression in muscle are positively correlated with ectomorphy and mesomorphy, and negatively correlated with endomorphy and obesity. BAT is absent in obese people. (2) Indian T2DM patients with normal or low BMI have increased UCP2 and UCP3 expession in their muscle, as well as increased high molecular weight adiponectin which promote fatty acid oxidation and prevent obesity. (3) Indian T2DM with BMI >25 and obesity have dysfunction of UCP2 and UCP3. They have high leptin with leptin resistance (induced by hyperinsulinemia) and low adiponectin. There is inverse relationship between adipose mass and adiponectin production.
