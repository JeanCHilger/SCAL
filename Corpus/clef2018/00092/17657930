Metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy in the diagnosis and followup of neuroblastoma. Apropos of 16 cases. The aim of this study is to evaluate meta-iodo-benzyl-guanidine scintigraphy in the diagnosis and the management of neuroblastoma.betwen september 1999 and jun 2004, 16 children aging from 4 months to 6 years, with neuroblastoma, underwent mIBG scintigraphy in military hospital nuclear medicine department.23 mIBG scans were done. The exam was indicated for the initial staging in 7 cases, to evaluate chemotherapy or surgery in 12 cases and to seek for reccurences in 3 cases. The sensitivity of mIBG was 57% in the detection of the primary tumor, 100% for liver metastases and 67% for medullar involvement.mIBG scintigraphy should be a standard in the initial staging of neuroblastoma and in evaluating therapy response.
