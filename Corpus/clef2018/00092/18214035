Pet therapy effects on oncological day hospital patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Pet therapy is utilised to improve the quality of life of patients with chronic diseases. The impact of AAA (animal-assisted activities), a kind of pet therapy, on oncological patients submitted to chemotherapy was evaluated.Two groups of patients receiving chemotherapy with (experimental group) or without AAA (control group) were compared. The 2 participating dogs have been trained by a cynophilist behaviourist and examined by a veterinarian. Before and after chemotherapy both groups of patients were asked to fill out a A.De.Ss.O. test questionnaire, a simplified Italian version of Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were recorded.Depression improved only in the AAA group (p=0.01). Arterial oxygen saturation increased in the experimental group (p=0.004), while it decreased in the controls.AAA during chemotherapy reduces depression of patients and increases their arterial oxygen saturation.
