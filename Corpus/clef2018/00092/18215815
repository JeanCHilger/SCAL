Effect of real-time weighted integration system for rapid calculation of functional images in clinical positron emission tomography. A system has been developed to rapidly calculate images of parametric rate constants, without acquiring dynamic frame data for clinical positron emission tomography (PET). This method is based on the weighted-integration algorithms for the two- and three-compartment models, and hardware developments (real-time operation and a large cache memory system) in a PET scanner, Headtome-IV, which enables the acquisition of multiple sinograms with independent weight integration functions. Following the administration of the radiotracer, the scan is initiated to collect multiple time-weighted, integrated sinograms with three different weight functions. These sinograms are reconstructed and the images, with the arterial blood data, are inserted into the operational equations to provide parametric rate constant images. The implementation of this method has been checked in H(2)(15 )O and (18)F-fluorophenylalanine ((18)FPhe) studies based on a two-compartment model, and in a (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)FDG) study based on the three-compartment model. A volunteer study, completed for each compound, yielded results consistent with those produced by existing nonlinear fitting methods. Thus, this system has been developed capable of generating rapidly quantitative, physiological images, without dynamic data acquisition, which will be of great advantage to PET in the clinical environment. This system would also be of great advantage in the new generation high-resolution PET tomography, which acquire data in a 3-D, septaless mode.
