A fully automated optimization algorithm for determining the 3-D patient contour from photo-peak projection data in SPECT. The class of noninverse problems versus inverse problems is discussed. A general optimization approach to solving certain constrained noninverse problems is presented. This approach is applied in the area of single photon emission computed tomography to estimate the patient outer contour directly from the photo-peak projection data. The resulting algorithm is fully automated, fast, and the determined 3-D patient contour satisfies smoothness constraints. The accuracy and reliability of the algorithm is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations, patient studies, and an experimental validation study.
