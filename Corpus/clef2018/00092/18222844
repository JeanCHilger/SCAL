3-D computer simulations of resolution effects of multidetector point focusing SPECT imaging. The authors present an efficient algorithm and the results of its application in simulating the three-dimensional (3-D) projection data resulting from a 3-D distribution of radioactivity. The algorithm was applied to a series of geometrical mathematical phantoms and to a realistic mathematical brain phantom. The authors simulated the projection data from a multidetector single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) system with point focusing collimators. The simulated projection data were then reconstructed using the manufacturer's software. The objects simulated included simple geometrical solids such as spheres and sheets, as well as the distribution of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in a realistic brain slice. Spheres were chosen as a model for brain structures such as caudate nucleus, thalamus, and cerebellum sheets were selected as representing lateral cortical gray matter regions. The results of these simulations indicate the existence of significant qualitative and quantitative artifacts in reconstructed human brain images.
