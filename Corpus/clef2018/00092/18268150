Long-term benefit of postconditioning. We previously demonstrated that ischemic postconditioning decreases creatine kinase release, a surrogate marker for infarct size, in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Our objective was to determine whether ischemic postconditioning could afford (1) a persistent infarct size limitation and (2) an improved recovery of myocardial contractile function several months after infarction.Patients presenting within 6 hours of the onset of chest pain, with suspicion for a first ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, and for whom the clinical decision was made to treat with percutaneous coronary intervention, were eligible for enrollment. After reperfusion by direct stenting, 38 patients were randomly assigned to a control (no intervention n=21) or postconditioned group (repeated inflation and deflation of the angioplasty balloonPostconditioning affords persistent infarct size reduction and improves long-term functional recovery in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
