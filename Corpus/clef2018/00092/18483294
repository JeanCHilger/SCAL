Integrin-targeted imaging and therapy with RGD4C-TNF fusion protein. This study used integrin alpha v beta3 as a target for tumor-specific delivery of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF). The fusion protein RGD4C-TNF bound specifically to alpha v beta3 as evidenced by cell receptor binding assay and noninvasive micro-positron emission tomography imaging. 64Cu-DOTA-RGD4C-TNF had significantly higher activity accumulation in integrin-positive tumors (U87MG and MDA-MB-435) but not in integrin-negative tumors (C6) compared with 64Cu-DOTA-TNF. The magnitude of tumor uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-RGD4C-TNF correlated well with the alpha v beta3 level (U87MG > MDA-MB-435 > C6). Tumor accumulation of 64Cu-DOTA-RGD4C-TNF could be effectively blocked by c(RGDyK) peptide in alpha v beta3-positive tumor models, suggesting alpha v beta3 specificity of RGD4C-TNF fusion protein in vivo. Furthermore, although the fusion of RGD4C moiety to TNF had little effect on the bioactivity and cytotoxicity of RGD4C-TNF compared with TNF in cell culture, RGD4C-TNF was significantly more potent than TNF in inhibiting orthotopic MDA-MB-435 tumor growth. Ex vivo tissue staining confirmed specific cytotoxicity of RGD4C-TNF against integrin-positive tumor cells and tumor vasculature.
