Does preoperative positron emission tomography with computed tomography predict nodal status in endometrial cancer? A pilot study. Fewer than 20% of women with endometrial cancer have positive nodes, and an accurate noninvasive imaging modality to assess lymph node status would be helpful in selecting those who need lymphadenectomy. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate positron emission tomography with computed tomography (pet-ct) in predicting nodal status before surgery for endometrial cancer. Twelve patients were enrolled at a single tertiary care centre. The sensitivity and specificity of preoperative pet-ct in predicting nodal status were 53.3% and 99.6% respectively. Using pet-ct, all metastatic nodes may not necessarily be detected, especially nodes with microscopic disease. The sensitivity of this imaging modality has to be improved before it can routinely be used in the preoperative evaluation of endometrial cancer.
