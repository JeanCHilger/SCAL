Frequency-specific coupling in the cortico-cerebellar auditory system. Induced oscillatory activity in the auditory cortex peaks at around 40 Hz in humans. Using regional cerebral blood flow and positron emission tomography we previously confirmed frequency-selective cortical responses to 40-Hz tones in auditory primary cortices and concomitant bilateral activation of the cerebellar hemispheres. In this study, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we estimated the influence of 40-Hz auditory stimulation on the coupling between auditory cortex and superior temporal sulcus (STS) and Crus II, using a dynamic causal model of the interactions between medial geniculate nuclei, auditory superior temporal gyrus (STG)/STS, and the cerebellar Crus II auditory region. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that 40-Hz-selective responses in the cerebellar Crus II auditory region could be explained by frequency-specific enabling of interactions in the auditory cortico-cerebellar-thalamic loop. Our model comparison results suggest that input from auditory STG/STS to cerebellum is enhanced selectively at gamma-band frequencies around 40 Hz.
