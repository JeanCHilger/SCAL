Sequential salvage chemotherapy for recurrent intracranial hemangiopericytoma. Hemangiopericytoma (HPC) is an uncommon primary brain tumor with an almost invariable tendency to recur and metastasize. We undertook a retrospectively collected case series of recurrent intracranial HPCs treated with salvage chemotherapy with the primary objective of evaluating progression-free survival.Fifteen patients, ages 26 to 62 years, with recurrent HPC and who were previously treated with surgery and involved-field radiotherapy were studied. Eight (53%) of these patients had undergone re-resection before study entry. Ten patients (67%) were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. Chemotherapy was administered to 5 patients at first relapse, 8 at second relapse, and 2 at third relapse (none of these patients were candidates for reoperation or stereotactic radiotherapy). Eight patients developed disseminated disease, all with multifocal intracranial disease (5 with cerebrospinal fluid dissemination, 4 with extraneural metastases). All patients were initially treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (CAV). After disease progression despite the administration of CAV in clinically appropriate patients, alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) (9 patients) was administered. Five patients were treated with ifosfamide, cisplatin, and etoposide after they failed to respond to alpha-IFN. Neurological and neuroradiographic evaluations were performed every 8 weeks.All patients were evaluable. A median of 4 cycles of CAV 8 cycles of alpha-IFNSalvage chemotherapy demonstrated modest efficacy with acceptable toxicity in this cohort of adult patients with recurrent surgery- and radiotherapy-refractory intracranial HPC.
