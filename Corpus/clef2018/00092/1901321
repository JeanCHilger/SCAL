An assessment of cerebral blood flow and metabolism after fleroxacin therapy. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), glucose (FDG), and oxygen metabolism (OM) were evaluated by positron emission tomography (PET) in 18 healthy volunteers who were randomized to a 72-hour course of either 600 mg/d of fleroxacin or placebo. Such studies attempted to assess potentially serious, yet unexplained, central nervous system adverse effects of the fluorinated quinolone class. Baseline and postplacebo values for CBF (mL/min/100 g) and FDG (mg/min/100 g) were: 53 +/- 6 and 5.7 +/- 1.8 and 49.6 +/- 4.4, and 5.2 +/- 1.2, respectively. Identical values for fleroxacin were: 53.9 +/- 4.8 and 6.3 +/- 1.1
