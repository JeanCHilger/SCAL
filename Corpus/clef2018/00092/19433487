Hybrid SPECT-CT and PET-CT imaging of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Hybrid imaging modalities such as radioiodine single photon emission CT with integrated CT ((131)I SPECT-CT) and 2-(fluorine-18)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography with integrated CT (FDG PET-CT) allow the rapid and efficient fusion of functional and anatomic images, and provide diagnostic information that may influence management decisions in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Diagnostic localisation and therapy of these tumours are dependent upon their capacity to concentrate radioiodine ((131)I) via uptake through the sodium-iodide symporter and retention within the tumour. The prognosis for most patients with DTC is favourable, although controversy exists regarding the role of post-operative (131)I therapy in patients at low-risk for disease. Accurate identification of functional thyroid tissue (benign or malignant) using diagnostic (131)I planar scintigraphy complemented by SPECT-CT imaging enables the completion of post-operative staging and patient risk stratification prior to (131)I therapy administration. In patients with non-iodine-avid tumours (negative (131)I scan but elevated thyroglobulin indicative of persistent or recurrent disease), FDG PET-CT is used to identify tumours with enhanced glucose metabolism and to localise the source of thyroglobulin production. The CT component of this hybrid technology provides anatomic localisation of activity and allows CT-based attenuation correction of PET images. Images from 15 patients illustrate the applications of (131)I SPECT-CT and FDG PET-CT.
