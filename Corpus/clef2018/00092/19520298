Optimization of automated large-scale production of [(18)F]fluoroethylcholine for PET prostate cancer imaging. PET tumor imaging is gaining importance in current clinical practice. FDG-PET is the most utilized approach but suffers from inflammation influences and is not utilizable in prostate cancer detection. Recently, (11)C-choline analogues have been employed successfully in this field of imaging, leading to a growing interest in the utilization of (18)F-labeled analogues: [(18)F]fluoroethylcholine (FEC) has been demonstrated to be promising, especially in prostate cancer imaging. In this work we report an automatic radiosynthesis of this tracer with high yields, short synthesis time and ease of performance, potentially utilizable in routine production sites.We used a Modular Lab system to automatically perform the two-step/one-pot synthesis. In the first step, we labeled ethyleneglycolditosylate obtaining [(18)F]fluoroethyltosylate in the second step, we performed the coupling of the latter intermediate with neat dimethylethanolamine. The final mixture was purified by means of solid phase extractionThe optimized procedure resulted in a non decay corrected yield of 36% and produced a range of 30-45 GBq of product already in injectable form. The product was analyzed for quality control and resulted as pure and sterile in addition, residual solvents were under the required threshold.In this work, we present an automatic FEC radiosynthesis that has been optimized for routine production. This findings should foster the interest for a wider utilization of this radiomolecule for imaging of prostate cancer with PET, a field for which no gold-standard tracer has yet been validated.
