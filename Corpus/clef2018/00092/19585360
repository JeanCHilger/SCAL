Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in patients with unexplained chronic uveitis. To assess the value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) in patients with unexplained chronic uveitis.Retrospective review of 19 (18)F-FDG PET scans. All patients had normal chest CT. In the final analysis, the authors used criteria similar to the criteria of Abad et al. (Abad S, Meyssonier V, Allali J, et al. Association of peripheral multifocal choroiditis with sarcoidosis: a study of thirty-seven patients. Arthritis Rheum. 200451:974-982) for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis-associated uveitis.Ten (53%) whole-body scans were consistent with sarcoidosis. At the end, subsequent mediastinal biopsies proved sarcoidosis in 3 patients 2 patients were considered as presumed sarcoidosis, and 6 indeterminate sarcoidosis.(18)F-FDG PET may show focal uptake suggestive of sarcoidosis in patients with unexplained uveitis.
