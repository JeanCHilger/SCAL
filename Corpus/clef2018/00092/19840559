Comparison between myocardial contrast echocardiography and (99m)technetium sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography determined myocardial viability in predicting hard cardiac events following acute myocardial infarction. The extent of residual myocardial viability (MV) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an important determinant of the outcome. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is widely used to assess MV after an AMI. However, myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE), a relatively new technique for the assessment of MV, has better spatial and temporal resolution than SPECT. The present study evaluated whether MV determined by MCE is comparable to that determined using SPECT for the prediction of hard cardiac events after an AMI. Accordingly, 99 patients who had undergone simultaneous rest low-power MCE and nitrate-enhanced SPECT 7 days after an AMI were followed up for cardiac death and AMIs. Both MCE perfusion (1 = normal 2 = reduced
