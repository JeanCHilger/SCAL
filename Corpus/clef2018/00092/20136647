EFNS guidelines on the use of neuroimaging in the management of motor neuron diseases. These European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines on neuroimaging of motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are designed to provide practical help for the neurologists to make appropriate use of neuroimaging techniques in patients with MNDs, which ranges from diagnostic and monitoring aspects to the in vivo study of the pathobiology of such conditions.Literature searches were performed before expert members of the Task Force wrote proposal. Then, consensus was reached by circulating drafts of the manuscript to the Task Force members and by discussion of the classification of evidence and recommendations.The use of conventional MRI in patients suspected of having a MND is yet restricted to exclude other causes of signs and symptoms of MN pathology [class IV, level good clinical practice point (GCPP)]. Although the detection of corticospinal tract hyperintensities on conventional MRI and a T2-hypointense rim in the pre-central gyrus can support a pre-existing suspicion of MND, the specific search of these abnormalities for the purpose of making a firm diagnosis of MND is not recommended (class IV, level GCPP). At present, advanced neuroimaging techniques, including diffusion tensor imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, do not have a role in the diagnosis or routine monitoring of MNDs yet (class IV, level GCPP). However, it is strongly advisable to incorporate measures derived from these techniques into new clinical trials as exploratory outcomes to gain additional insights into disease pathophysiology and into the value of these techniques in the (longitudinal) assessment of MNDs (class IV, level GCPP).
