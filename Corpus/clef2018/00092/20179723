Brain glucose overexposure and lack of acute metabolic flexibility in obesity and type 2 diabetes: a PET-[18F]FDG study in Zucker and ZDF rats. Brain glucose exposure may complicate diabetes and obesity. We used positron emission tomography with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose in Zucker obese, diabetic, and control rats to determine the contributions of blood glucose mass action versus local mechanisms in regulating central glucose disposal in fasted and acutely glucose-stimulated states, and their adaptations in obesity and diabetes. Our study data indicate that brain glucose uptake is dependent on both local and mass action components, and is stimulated by acute glucose intake in healthy rats. In diseased animals, the organ was chronically overexposed to glucose, due to high fasting glucose uptake, almost abolishing the physiologic response to glucose loading.
