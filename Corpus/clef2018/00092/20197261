Is the risk of allergic hypersensitivity to fungi increased by indoor exposure to moulds? Moulds are frequently found in the indoor environment of residential houses. An association between domestic mould contamination and respiratory symptoms has been reported, but mould exposure as a risk factor for allergy to moulds is not well documented. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence and associated factors of allergic hypersensitivity to moulds.A group of 243 participants was examined. Of these 118 lived in dwellings with evident signs of fungal contamination (study group) and 125 in non-contaminated sites (controls). An interview, skin prick tests to common and fungal allergens, evaluation of total serum IgE and specific IgE to moulds, resting spirometry as well as mycological analysis in building were performed for each participant.19.8% subjects were sensitized to at least one mould allergen. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the history of respiratory and skin symptoms, smoking cigarettes in the past and positive skin prick tests (SPT) to common allergens (dust mite and grass pollens) or the presence of a cat as a pet animal were the significant associated factors of hypersensitivity to moulds.The association between indoor fungal exposure and the development of fungal allergy was not confirmed in our study.
