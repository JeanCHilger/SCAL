Neuroimaging studies of schizophrenia. Neuroimaging studies of schizophrenia have identified abnormalities in neuroanatomy, regional brain metabolism and receptor physiology. Computerized tomographic (CT) studies have demonstrated gross ventricular and sulcal enlargement. These findings are probably nonprogressive, and it is not yet clear whether they are present only in a subgroup of patients whether they represent a reduction in tissue from a previously normal condition or an abnormality in brain development
