Anthracene coupled adenine for the selective sensing of copper ions. Anthracene-based adenines 1 and 2 have been designed and synthesized, and their metal ion recognition properties have been established fluorometrically. Both molecules exhibit Cu²⁺ induced ON-OFF type signaling patterns over the other representative metal ions studied. Compound 1 exhibits 97% quenching of emission in the presence of Cu²⁺ whilst derivative 2 shows 81% quenching under similar experimental conditions.
