PET-CT in oncology. Diagnostic imaging plays a pivotal role in cancer management. Imaging has made rapid strides in the past few years with new modalities and new indications getting added all the time. Molecular and metabolic imaging with 18F Flurodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG PET) and other non-FDG isotopes have revolutionized oncologic imaging and changed our approach towards cancer diagnosis, staging and imaging surveillance. The evidence for the use of FDG PET is mounting every day with newer indications getting added to the literature. The main focus of our discussion will be to understand the basic principles of FDG PET imaging and to study a few of its clinical applications in oncology.
