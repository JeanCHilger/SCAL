Use of relocatable stereotactic frame to integrate positron emission tomography and computed tomography images: application in human malignant brain tumours. A stereotactic head frame has been developed which is accurately relocatable over an extended period of time, is non-invasive, and yet is rigidly fixed relative to the patient's skull. Eight patients with malignant brain tumours were studied by positron emission tomography scanning using 18FUDR and computed tomography scan. Serial biopsies were performed and were studied by routine histological methods and using the monoclonal antibody Ki67.
