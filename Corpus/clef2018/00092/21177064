Scintigraphic evaluation of rhBMP-2-biocoated implants reveals no ectopic bone formation. The main objectives of the study described below were of two-fold nature: (1) to examine if rhBMP-2-biocoated implants in a pig model could lead to ectopic bone formation and (2) if quantitative and/or qualitative differences could be found between adhesively and covalently bonded BMP II using the scintigraphic method. In order to examine these central questions, 26 GÃ¶ttingen minipigs were allocated to three groups with a control group (n=7) and two study groups (n=9 each) receiving one of three implant types: (a) chromosulfuric acid treated titanium surface as control, (b) non-covalently bonded BMP-2, and (c) covalently bonded and immobilized rhBMP-2. Each animal received four barbell-shaped implants, one in the proximal and distal metaphysis of each femur. The scintigraphic analyses were conducted after four, eight, and 12 weeks postoperatively. The visual (qualitative) analysis failed to show ectopic bone formation in any of the three groups. The statistical analysis of the relative values for bone formation yielded no significant differences between the groups, although the limitation in the applied methods do not enable one to draw conclusions regarding the histomophometric results.
