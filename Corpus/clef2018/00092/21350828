Evaluation of right ventricular function. Right ventricular (RV) function is a powerful prognostic factor in congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension, but assessing RV function is a challenge because of the right ventricle's complex geometry, its extreme sensitivity to loading conditions, and a limited understanding of underlying mechanisms of right heart failure. At present, a single widely accepted and generally applicable index of RV function is not available. Current approaches to assessment of RV function include physical examination, catheterization, conventional contrast and radionuclide angiography, nuclear perfusion scintigraphy, cardiac CT, MRI, echocardiography, and positron emission tomography. This review will discuss assessment of RV function in the context of RV physiology.
