Risk evaluation for coronary artery disease in patients with impaired glucose tolerance after a successful coronary intervention. Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) often have risk factors that may influence endothelial function. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the endothelial function and its association with coronary risk factors after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).A total of 14 patients with impaired glucose tolerance and CAD underwent positron emission tomography with N-13 ammonia to measure myocardial blood flow (MBF) at rest and during a cold pressor test (CPT), to estimate endothelial function as a percent increase (%increase) of MBF. The results were compared among normal segments (normal), reperfused segments with PCI (PCI), and nonculprit CAD segments without PCI (non-PCI). Correlations between the %increase and major risk factors were also investigated.CPT induced significant increase in MBF in all groups. The %increase of normal, non-PCI, and PCI groups were 33% ± 22%, 21% ± 23%, and 26% ± 23%, respectively. Comparison with risk factors demonstrated significant correlations only in the non-PCI group. Specifically, there were negative correlations between %increase and fasting blood sugar (r = -0.64, P < 0.05), hemoglobin A1c (r = -0.74, P < 0.05), total cholesterol (r = -0.87, P < 0.05), triglyceride (r = -0.71, P < 0.05), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = -0.92, P < 0.005), respectively.Although impaired glucose tolerance patients with a PCI-treated coronary stenosis showed preserved response to CPT, the %increase negatively correlated with risk factors in the non-PCI segments. Therefore, coronary risk factors may affect CAD lesions in PCI-treated patients.
