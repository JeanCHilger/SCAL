A trial of 89Sr bremsstrahlung SPECT. 89Sr bremsstrahlung SPECT imaging has been evaluated for detecting the more detailed whole body 89Sr distribution.89Sr bremsstrahlung whole body planar and merged SPECT images were acquired by using two detectors type SPECT system. Energy window A (100 keV +/- 50%) for planar imaging, and energy window A plus adjacent energy window B (300 keV +/- 50%) for SPECT imaging were set on the continuous spectrum. Those images were compared with 99mTc-H-MDP whole body planar and merged SPECT images. To verify the accumulation obtained by bremsstrahlung whole body planar and merged SPECT image, we made original phantom based on the counts of clinical study imaging.On 89Sr bremsstrahlung merged SPECT image, focal accumulations were recognized in the parts of 99mTc-H-MDP merged SPECT accumulation. Focal accumulations were much clearer on 89Sr bremsstrahlung merged SPECT imaging than those of whole body planar image of 89Sr bremsstrahlung. In phantom study, counts of each concentration linearly increase as acquisition time and number of rotation increase on planar and SPECT images.89Sr bremsstrahlung merged SPECT imaging would be useful for detecting the more detailed whole body 89Sr distribution.
