Imaging targets of the sympathetic nervous system of the heart: translational considerations. The usefulness of imaging the cardiac sympathetic nervous system is increasingly supported by prospective clinical studies. The future success of this molecular imaging technique, however, will depend on careful design of additional trials. But preclinical and clinical use requires a thorough understanding of the underlying biology, which defines the relationship between neuronal tracer kinetics, disease mechanisms, and appropriate study interpretation. This review focuses on basic methodologic aspects considered relevant for successful continuation of the translation of cardiac neuronal imaging from a research tool toward a clinical test.
