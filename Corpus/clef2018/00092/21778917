Long-term angiographic and clinical outcome following stenting by flow reversal technique for chronic occlusions older than 3 months of the cervical carotid or vertebral artery. Long-term angiographic and clinical outcome following stenting by flow reversal technique (FRT) for chronic occlusions (COs) of the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) or vertebral artery (VA) is unknown.The aim of our retrospective study was to investigate the feasibility, safety, and long-term outcome of stenting by FRT for COs of the cervical ICA or VA.Included for analysis were patients (1) who underwent stenting for COs of the ICA or VA older than 3 months by FRT, and (2) who finished at least 1-year follow-up angiographic and clinical investigation. Criteria of stenting for CO in the ICA or VA were patients (1) who experienced minor strokes, a transient ischemic attack, or transient symptoms probably due to hemodynamic compromise or insufficiency, (2) angiographic complete occlusion of the ICA or VA, and (3) occlusion limited in the cervical area of the affected artery.During the study period, 6 patients underwent stenting by FRT for cervical COs successfully, ICAs in 4 cases and VAs in 2 cases. The prestenting angiographically estimated occlusion length ranged from 50 to 130 mm. Total length of the deployed stents ranged from 30 to 108 mm. No complications occurred during the periprocedural period. Neither transient ischemic events nor restenosis has occurred during the follow-up period.COs of the cervical carotid or vertebral arteries older than 3 months can be opened safely with FRT, and 1-year angiographic and long-term clinical outcome is favorable.
