Better late than early: FDG-PET imaging in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Sunitinib treatment benefits patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), but response duration can vary widely and resistance is not predicted by standard measures. [¹⁸F]fluoro-2-deoxy-2-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) uptake is variable in mRCC, but changes in FDG-PET uptake may be useful in monitoring disease progression. Further work is needed to personalize treatment for patients with mRCC.
