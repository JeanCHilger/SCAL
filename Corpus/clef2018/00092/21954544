Follow-up after primary therapy of malignant epithelial ovarian tumors. Follow-up after finishing the primary therapy has become a routine aimed to an early detection of relapse, decreasing the mortality and improving the quality of patient's life. Main aim of the follow-up is to prolong the life of the patient. No prospective randomized study confirming the scientific character of such aims has been published, so far. Opinions on benefit from the follow-up are conflicting. It is supposed, that early relapse detection can contribute to prolonged survival and on the other hand, there are opinions, that regular medical examinations can postpone relapse detection in symptomatic patients. Patients after treatment of an early stage should be followed up in regular intervals according to the presented scheme. Patients in advanced stages of the disease should be treated in a principally different way, based on free access to post primary treatment care. Quality of life has to be emphasized. The main purpose of the follow-up is to detect relapse during the time, when it is curable. When this condition has been fulfilled, the follow- up can have medical and economic relevance. Optimal screening is based on results from prospective randomized studies which objectively compare different models of the follow-up. Routine intensive follow-up might not be cost-effective and might substantially raise patient's anxiety at the same time. Patient education regarding early symptoms of relapse and free access could represent a cost-effective model. In order to decide between minimal and intensive follow-up, needs of all three participating members: patients, doctors and healthcare system have to be taken into account (Tab. 1, Ref. 105).
