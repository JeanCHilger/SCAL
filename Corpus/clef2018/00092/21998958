The role of vimentin during PRRSV infection of Marc-145 cells. The objective of this study was to investigate the function of vimentin in PRRSV infection. Vimentin gene from Marc-145 cells was amplified by RT-PCR, cloned into pET-28a vector and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The expressed vimentin was confirmed by Western blot and purified which was used to immunize BALB/c mice for the production of antibodies. Vimentin and antibodies were tested for blocking PRRSV infection of Marc-145 cells. The binding of vimentin to PRRSV N and GP5 proteins were tested by the ELISA. The results showed that vimentin gene was amplified successfully and expressed as identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Mouse anti-vimentin antibodies were produced with the titer of 10(5). PRRSV infection of Marc-145 cells was blocked partially by vimentin while blocked completely by the antibobies. In addition, vimentin was bound N protein, but not GP5. These results provide additional information on PRRSV entry into Marc-145 cells.
