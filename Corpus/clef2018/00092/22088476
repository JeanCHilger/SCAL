Analytical methods for brain targeted delivery system in vivo: perspectives on imaging modalities and microdialysis. Since the introduction of microdialysis in 1974, the semi-invasive analytical method has grown exponentially. Microdialysis is one of the most potential analysis technologies of pharmacological drug delivery to the brain. In recent decades, analysis of chemicals targeting the brain has led to many improvements. It seems likely that fluorescence imaging was limited to ex vivo and in vitro applications with the exception of several intravital microscopy and photographic imaging approaches. X-ray computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) have been commonly utilized for visualization of distribution and therapeutic effects of drugs. The efficient analytical methods for studies of brain-targeting delivery system is a major challenge in detecting the disposition as well as the variances of the factors that regulate the substances delivery into the brain. In this review, we highlight some of the ongoing trends in imaging modalities and the most recent developments in the field of microdialysis of live animals and present insights into exploiting brain disease for therapeutic and diagnostics purpose.
