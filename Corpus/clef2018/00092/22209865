N-Succinimidyl 4-[(18)F]-fluoromethylbenzoate-labeled dimeric RGD peptide for imaging tumor integrin expression. RGD peptides, radiolabeled with (18)F, have been used in the clinic for PET imaging of tumor angiogenesis in cancer patients. RGD peptides are typically labeled using a prosthetic group such as N-succinimidyl 4-[(18)F]-fluorobenzoate ([(18)F]SFB) or 4-nitrophenyl 2-[(18)F]-fluoropropionate ([(18)F]NPFP). However, the complex radiosynthetic procedures have impeded their broad application in clinical studies. We previously radiolabeled proteins and peptides with the prosthetic group, N-succinimidyl 4-[(18)F]-fluoromethylbenzoate ([(18)F]SFMB), which was prepared in a simple one-step procedure. In this study, we labeled a PEGylated cyclic RGD peptide dimer, PEG(3)-E[c(RGDyK)](2) (PRGD2), using [(18)F]SFMB and evaluated for imaging tumor αvβ3 integrin expression with positron emission tomography (PET). [(18)F]SFMB was prepared in one step using [(18)F]fluoride displacement of a nitrobenzenesulfonate leaving group under mild reaction conditions followed by HPLC purification. The (18)F-labeled peptide, [(18)F]FMBPRGD2 was prepared by coupling PRGD2 with [(18)F]SFMB in pH 8.6 borate buffer and purified with HPLC. The direct labeling on BMBPRGD2 was also attempted. A Siemens Inveon PET was used to image the uptake of the [(18)F]FMBPRGD2 into a U87MG xenograft mouse model. [(18)F]FMBPRGD2, was prepared with a 15% overall radiochemical yield (uncorrected) in a total synthesis time of 90 min, which was considerably shorter than the preparation of [(18)F]SFB- and [(18)F]NPFP-labeled RGD peptides. The direct labeling, however, was not successful. High quality microPET images using [(18)F]FMBPRGD2 clearly visualized tumors by 15 min with good target to background ratio. Early tracer accumulation in the bladder suggests fast renal clearance. No obvious bone uptake can be detected even at 4-h time point indicating that fluorine attachment is stable in mice. In conclusion, N-succinimidyl 4-[(18)F]-fluoromethylbenzoate ([(18)F]SFMB) prosthetic group can be a good alternative for labeling RGD peptides to image αvβ3 integrin expression and for labeling other peptides.
