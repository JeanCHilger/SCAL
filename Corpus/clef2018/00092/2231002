Reconstruction of Fourier coefficients: a fast method to get polar amplitude and phase images of gated SPECT. Gated SPECT (GASPECT) during radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) is a time-consuming procedure requiring extended hard- and software. Furthermore, the procedure suffers from poor count statistics. Our method tries to overcome these difficulties by exploiting the count summation effect of Fourier analysis. The sine and cosine coefficients of the first harmonic are extracted from the gated views and reconstructed. This, in fact, results in an improvement of the count statistics by a factor of four combined with a tremendous reduction of disc space requirements. Using short-axis slices, bull's-eye plots of the amplitude and phase of the left ventricle are calculated. Cardiac functions and localization and extent of any malfunction are documented three-dimensionally without superposition.
