"CORT-EX:" a program for quantitative analysis of brain SPECT data. A program was developed to extract from brain SPECT data global as well as regional concentrations of a radiopharmaceutical while allowing for improved subjective evaluation of its distribution. This program was used to process the data obtained from 17 normal subjects, 20 min, 2 hr, and 4 hr after the injection of iodine-labeled iodoamphetamines. The mean absolute cortical uptake at these three time periods was 0.921 (+/- 0.185), 0.803 (+/- 0.107), and 0.748 (+/- 0.103) in arbitrary units (+/- s.d.), respectively. The regional distribution of the tracer became more uniform with time due to an uneven washout rate. The cerebellum was noted to have a very high variability in its uptake and a high washout rate, making it unsuitable as an internal standard for relative quantification. Finally, a repeat study was performed on 10 subjects. No significant difference could be demonstrated in the mean uptake of the group at 2 and 4 hr, however the difference observed in the 20 min uptake values was significant at the p = 0.05 level.
