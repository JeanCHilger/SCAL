Is abnormal adrenergic activation associated with abnormal Heart Rate Recovery? Heart Rate Recovery (HRR) reflects the capacity of the cardiovascular system to reverse the vagal withdrawal caused by exercise. Scintigraphy with metaiodobenzylguanidine (I(123) MIBG) evaluates innervation and cardiac adrenergic activation. The association of these two methods is not well established.To evaluate the association between HRR and washout rate (WO) of I(123) MIBG in patients with heart failure (HF).Twenty-five patients with ejection fraction < 45% underwent exercise testing, and analysis of the variation of HRR from the 1st to the 8th minute after exertion. Submitted to I(123) MIBG, they were separated into groups by WO: G1) <27% and G2) â‰¥ 27%. For the statistical analysis Mann-Whitney's U test and Spearman's correlation coefficient were used.G2 showed a slower variation of HRR: 1st minute: G1: 21.5 (16.12 to 26.87) vs. G2: 11.00 (8.5 to 13.5) bpm, p = 0.001 2nd minute: G1: 34 (29-39) vs. G2: 20 (14 - 26) bpm, p = 0.001Patients with high HF and WO showed an abnormal HRR compared with patients with normal WO. These findings suggest that adrenergic activation may influence the HRR.
