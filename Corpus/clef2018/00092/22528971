New semi-quantitative 123I-MIBG estimation method compared with scoring system in follow-up of advanced neuroblastoma: utility of total MIBG retention ratio versus scoring method. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new semi-quantitative estimation method using (123)I-MIBG retention ratio to assess response to chemotherapy for advanced neuroblastoma.Thirteen children with advanced neuroblastoma (International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System: stage M) were examined for a total of 51 studies with (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy (before and during chemotherapy). We proposed a new semi-quantitative method using MIBG retention ratio (count obtained with delayed image/count obtained with early image with decay correction) to estimate MIBG accumulation. We analyzed total (123)I-MIBG retention ratio (TMRR: total body count obtained with delayed image/total body count obtained with early image with decay correction) and compared with a scoring method in terms of correlation with tumor markers.TMRR showed significantly higher correlations with urinary catecholamine metabolites before chemotherapy (VMA: r(2) = 0.45, P < 0.05, HVA: r(2) = 0.627, P < 0.01) than MIBG score (VMA: r(2) = 0.19, P = 0.082, HVA: r(2) = 0.25, P = 0.137). There were relatively good correlations between serial change of TMRR and those of urinary catecholamine metabolites (VMA: r(2) = 0.274, P < 0.001, HVA: r(2) = 0.448, P < 0.0001) compared with serial change of MIBG score and those of tumor markers (VMA: r(2) = 0.01, P = 0.537, HVA: 0.084, P = 0.697) during chemotherapy for advanced neuroblastoma.TMRR could be a useful semi-quantitative method for estimating early response to chemotherapy of advanced neuroblastoma because of its high correlation with urine catecholamine metabolites.
