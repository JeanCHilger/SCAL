Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: diagnosis and management. Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms are uncommon but rising in incidence. There have been recent changes in the WHO nomenclature and a newly proposed American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging, which complement each other. These neoplasms are of great medical and radiological interest because of their diverse presenting features and imaging appearances. There is an increased role for both anatomic and functional imaging in the assessment of these neoplasms. A review of the nomenclature, staging, and imaging is presented in this paper.
