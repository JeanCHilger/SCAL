Effects of attenuation in single slow rotation dynamic SPECT. Dynamic imaging using SPECT has been a topic of research interest for many years. Several proposed approaches have considered the reconstruction of dynamic images from SPECT data acquired with a conventional single slow rotation of the camera, which results in an extremely underdetermined reconstruction problem. Accurate attenuation correction (AC) is particularly important in this context, in order to distinguish the actual dynamic behavior of the tracer within a region from the effects of attenuation on the projection data as the camera rotates around the patient. In this paper, we demonstrate that the standard approach to AC used in conventional SPECT imaging is not sufficient to account for the effects of attenuation in dynamic imaging of this type. As a result, artifacts may be created in the reconstructed images. Using realistic dynamic 3D phantom simulations, as well as real-life dynamic renal SPECT data, we assess the severity of these artifacts and investigate a method to eliminate them. The proposed method is shown to substantially improve the accuracy of the reconstructed image.
