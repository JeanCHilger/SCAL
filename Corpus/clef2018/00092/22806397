Nano-particle vaccination combined with TLR-7 and -9 ligands triggers memory and effector CD8‚Å∫ T-cell responses in melanoma patients. Optimal vaccine strategies must be identified for improving T-cell vaccination against infectious and malignant diseases. MelQbG10 is a virus-like nano-particle loaded with A-type CpG-oligonucleotides (CpG-ODN) and coupled to peptide(16-35)  derived from Melan-A/MART-1. In this phase IIa clinical study, four groups of stage III-IV melanoma patients were vaccinated with MelQbG10, given (i) with IFA (Montanide) s.c. (ii) with IFA s.c. and topical Imiquimod
