Myocardial tomography with single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) technique in X syndrome. Compared with the usual planar scintigraphy of the myocardium the single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) has essential advantages. By means of the SPECT a three-dimensional reconstruction of the intersection image is possible which allows a judgement of the myocardium in the transversal, sagittal and coronary planes of section. The scans of the SPECT are richer in contrast and freer from overshadowings of normally of disturbedly perfused areas of the myocardium. 43 patients with angina pectoris complaints in angiographically normal coronary arteries (syndrome X) were examined by means of the SPECT under bicycle ergometer load and at rest. As radionuclide thallium-201 was used. 28 out of 43 patients (65%) showed disturbances of the perfusion, in which cases 21 patients with reversible ischaemias and 7 ones with cicatrised changes and an ischaemia of the marginal zone were conspicuous. Previous own investigations with the planar Tl-201 scintigraphy of the myocardium showed pathological findings in 66% of the cases with a syndrome X. The nearly identical results speak for the high reliability of the scintigraphy of the myocardium, but against the increase sensitivity of the SPECT in contrast to the planar scintigraphy of the myocardium.
