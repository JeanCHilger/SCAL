Automated volume determination of the liver and spleen from Tc-99m colloid SPECT imaging. Quantification of the liver functional and nonfunctional tissue in disease. An automated volume determination program using SPECT imaging with Tc-99m has been validated by both phantom and patient studies. Its use for monitoring change of function of the liver and change in tumor mass during different therapy regimes has been assessed. The technique is not restricted to the estimation of the hepatic functioning tissues it therefore has many potential clinical implementations for volume determination in other organs.
