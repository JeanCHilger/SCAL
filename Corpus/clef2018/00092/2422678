Small hepatocellular carcinomas in chronic liver disease: detection with SPECT. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) performed using a rotating gamma camera was compared with alpha 1-fetoprotein (AFP) assay, conventional liver scintigraphy, ultrasound (US) imaging, computed tomography (CT), and selective celiac angiography in 40 patients with a total of 50 small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs less than 5 cm). The detection rates of US and CT were determined on an initial screening study and on a second, more precisely focused study. The detection rate of small HCCs by the various modalities was as follows: AFP, 13%
