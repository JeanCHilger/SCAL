Pasteurella multocida occurs in a high frequency in the saliva of pet dogs. Pasteurella multocida is a frequent cause of infection after animal bites. In contrast to earlier reports, P. multocida appeared to be as common among dogs as among cats. We found 17 (81%) of 21 pet dogs to harbour P. multocida in their saliva. At normal contact, the risk of transmission from dogs to humans seems to be negligible. Only 1/27 dogs owners was found to harbour the organism. None of 13 cat owners or 23 persons without animal contacts harboured P. multocida.
