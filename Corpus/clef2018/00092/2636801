Inhibition of antiskin allograft immunity induced by infusions with photoinactivated effector T lymphocytes (PET cells). Induction of tolerance for skin allotransplantation requires selective suppression of the host response to foreign histocompatibility antigens. This report describes a new approach which employs pre-treatment with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and ultraviolet A light (UVA) to render the effector cells of graft rejection immunogenic for the syngeneic recipient. Eight days after BALB/c mice received CBA/j skin grafts, their splenocytes were treated with 100 ng/ml 8-MOP and 1 J/cm2 UVA prior to reinfusion into naive BALB/c recipients. Recipient mice were tested for tolerance to alloantigens in mixed leukocyte culture (MLC), cytotoxicity (CTL), delayed-type hypersensitivity assays (DTH), and challenge with a fresh CBA/j graft. Splenocytes from BALB/c recipients of photoinactivated splenocytes containing the effector cells of CBA/j alloantigen rejection proliferated poorly in MLC and generated lower cytotoxic T-cell responses to CBA/j alloantigens in comparison with sensitized and naive controls and suppressed the MLC and CTL response to alloantigen from sensitized and naive BALB/c mice. In vivo, the DTH response was specifically suppressed to the relevant alloantigen in comparison with controls. BALB/c mice treated in this fashion retained a CBA/j skin graft for up to 42 days post-transplantation without visual evidence of rejection. These results showed that reinfusion of photoinactivated effector cells resulted in an immunosuppressive host response which specifically inhibited in vitro and in vivo responses that correlate with allograft rejection and permitted prolonged retention of histoincompatible skin grafts.
