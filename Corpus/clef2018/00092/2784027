Estimation of jeopardized left ventricular myocardium in symptomatic and silent ischemia as determined by iodine-123 phenylpentadecanoic acid rotational tomography. Whether patients with silent myocardial ischemia have a lesser mass of ischemic myocardium than patients with symptomatic ischemia is controversial. Forty-five patients with angiographic coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 70% luminal diameter narrowing) were studied. All patients had ischemic patterns of myocardial uptake and clearance of the long-chain fatty acid perfusion/metabolic imaging agent iodine-123 phenylpentadecanoic acid after maximal exercise. Single-photon emission computed tomography was performed and 25 myocardial segments were analyzed using circumferential activity profile curves. The 21 patients with silent treadmill ischemia exercised longer than the 24 patients with painful treadmill ischemia (430 +/- 137 vs 337 +/- 96 seconds, p less than 0.01) and to a higher heart rate (138 +/- 21 vs 125 +/- 18 beats/min, p less than 0.05). Patients with treadmill silent ischemia had the same number of abnormally perfused myocardial segments as patients with painful treadmill ischemia (8.6 +/- 4.5 vs 6.5 +/- 4.1 segments, difference not significant) and the same number of reversibly ischemic myocardial segments (4.0 +/- 1.4 vs 4.2 +/- 3.0 segments, difference not significant). The angiographic severity and extent of coronary artery disease were similar in the 2 groups. Thus, in this selected group of patients, those with silent treadmill ischemia appear to have at least as great an extent of ischemic myocardium as patients with painful exertional ischemia.
