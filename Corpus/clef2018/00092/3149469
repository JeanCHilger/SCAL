Cerebral glucose metabolism in five patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Regional cerebral glucose metabolic rates were estimated by positron emission tomography, in parallel with electroencephalography and cranial computed tomography in 5 patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The 5 patients, 3 boys and 2 girls, ranged in age from 10-15 years. Computed tomography revealed no gross abnormalities. Each patient received 2-5 mCi of 2-(18F)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) intravenously. Averaged cerebral glucose metabolic rates were reduced in each cerebral region as compared with controls. Unilateral hypometabolism was present in 4 patients: one in the inferior frontal gyrus as well as the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus one in the inferior frontal gyrus
