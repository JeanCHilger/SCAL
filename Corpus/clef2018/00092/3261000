Surgical treatment of intractable neonatal-onset seizures: the role of positron emission tomography. We have performed positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) in eight infants and children (aged 18 days to 5 years) with medically refractory epilepsy of neonatal onset. It was hypothesized that in at least some of these infants a surgical approach (focal resection, cerebral hemispherectomy) might be of benefit in achieving seizure control, and that PET might assist in surgical selection. In three of the eight subjects, interictal PET revealed unilateral diffuse hypometabolism following cerebral hemispherectomy in these three patients, all seizures ceased and there were no adverse effects. In one child, ictal PET showed hypermetabolism in the left frontal cortex, left striatum, and right cerebellum
