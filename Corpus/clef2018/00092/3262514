Measurement of human blood brain barrier integrity using 11C-inulin and positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) using 11C-inulin was demonstrated to be applicable to the clinical measurement of blood brain barrier permeability and cerebral interstitial fluid volume. Kinetic data were analyzed by application of a two compartment model, in which blood plasma and interstitial fluid spaces constitute the compartments. The blood activity contribution was subtracted from the PET count with the aid of the 11CO inhalation technique. The values we estimated in a human brain were in agreement with the reported values obtained for animal brains by the use of 14C-inulin.
