Glucose utilization in the temporal cortex of affectively ill patients: positron emission tomography. As temporal lobe dysfunction has been postulated in the affective disorders, the authors investigated glucose utilization in the temporal lobes of 13 affectively ill patients in comparison with 18 normal volunteer controls and 17 previously reported schizophrenic patients, following injections of fluorine 18-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) during somatosensory stimulation to the right forearm. Using a boundary-finding algorithm to outline each temporal lobe, maximum glucose use relative to maximums elsewhere in the same positron emission tomography (PET) slice were calculated. In a small group of moderately to severely depressed patients, this relative measure was significantly reduced in the right (with a similar trend in the left) temporal lobe compared to normal volunteers and the other comparison groups. The lack of a significant increase in glucose utilization, measured either as a maximum or in relation to other areas in the PET scan slice, suggests that a temporal lobe activation or a seizure-like process is not generally occurring during active depressive phases of the illness.
