Considerations for tomographic imaging of monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies have begun to assume a significant role in clinical research. The ability to label these agents has initiated research in the areas of radioimmunodetection and radioimmunotherapy. In the case of antibodies directed against tumor antigens, imaging has been employed to help assess location and extent of disease, and to provide information and extent of disease, and to provide information concerning biodistribution to be used in subsequent dosimetric calculations. Because of the low counting statistics characteristic of such images, the use of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is suggested as a potential method of improving the diagnostic yield from image data. Careful attention to acquisition parameters and image processing options is needed if these goals are to be achieved.
