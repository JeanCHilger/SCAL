Vector implementation of Chang's attenuation correction method for single photon emission computed tomography. A vector version of Chang's attenuation correction method for single photon emission computed tomography accommodating arbitrary convex body contours is presented and its implementation on a general purpose array processor described. For a constant linear attenuation coefficient mu = 0.10 cm-1 and contour shapes similar to those encountered in clinical work, correction factors calculated with the vector algorithm are the same to within a few percent as those obtained using the original Chang method. Typical execution speed of the new algorithm is 0.01 s/correction factor for a 64 point contour.
