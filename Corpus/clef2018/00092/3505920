Cryptosporidiosis in guinea pigs: a retrospective study. Cryptosporidiosis was diagnosed in 81 guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) from 1979 through 1985 at a research animal diagnostic laboratory. Most of the guinea pigs were juveniles of Hartley stock and originated from 6 commercial laboratory animal suppliers or from one pet store supplier. Common clinical signs reported were failure to gain weight, weight loss, diarrhea, and death. At necropsy, macroscopic findings included emaciation, hyperemia of the small intestine, serosal edema of the cecal wall, and increased fluidity of ingesta throughout the intestines. Oval to round cryptosporidia (1 to 4 microns) were seen microscopically within or on the brush border of mucosal epithelial cells from the duodenum through the cecum. Acute histologic lesions consisted of necrosis and sloughing of enterocytes at the villus tips, inflammation, hyperemia and edema of the lamina propria, and hyperplasia of crypt epithelium. More chronic lesions consisted of marked villus bridging or villus fusion and blunting, metaplasia of the mucosal epithelium, and lymphocytic infiltration of the lamina propria.
