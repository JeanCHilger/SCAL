Measurement of regional substrate utilization rates by emission tomography. Emission tomography can be used to monitor, in vivo and regionally, the utilization of metabolic substrates labeled with positron-emitting radioisotopes produced by a cyclotron. The concept was validated by measuring brain glucose utilization with carbon--11-labeled glucose in rhesus monkeys.
