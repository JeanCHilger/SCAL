Evaluation of methods for isolating Salmonella and Arizona organisms from pet turtles. Two methods for isolating Salmonella and Arizona organisms from turtles, blending and excretion, were evaluated, and the percentage of isolates obtained by each method was compared with the percentage of isolates obtained by culture of turtle organs. The blending and excretion methods were equally effective in detecting the overall incidence of Salmonella and Arizona infections in turtles. The percentage of isolates obtained by specific organ culture, however, was less than the percentage obtained by the other two methods. The blending method detected a greater number of turtles with Arizona infections than did the excretion method, but there was no difference in the number of Salmonella infections detected by the two methods. The frequency of isolation of Arizona organisms from organs other than the small intestine and colon was higher than that of Salmonella.
