Nuclear genes coding the yeast mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase complex. Isolation of ATP2 coding the F1-ATPase beta subunit. A yeast nuclear pet mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking any detectable mitochondrial F1-ATPase activity was genetically complemented upon transformation with a pool of wild type genomic DNA fragments carried in the yeast Escherchia coli shuttle vector YEp 13. Plasmid-dependent complementation restored both growth of the pet mutant on a nonfermentable carbon source as well as functional mitochondrial ATPase activity. Characterization of the complementing plasmid by plasmid deletion analysis indicated that the complementing gene was contained on adjoining BamH1 fragments with a combined length of 3.05 kilobases. Gel analysis of the product of this DNA by in vitro translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate programmed with yeast mRNA hybrid selected by the plasmid revealed a product which could be immunoprecipitated by antisera against the beta subunit of the yeast mitochondrial ATPase complex. A comparison of the protein sequence derived from partial DNA sequence analysis indicated that the beta subunit of the yeast mitochondrial ATPase complex exhibits greater than 70% conservation of protein sequence when compared to the same subunit from the ATPase of E. coli, beef heart, and chloroplast. The gene coding the beta subunit (subunit 2) of yeast mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase is designated ATP2. The utilization of cloned nuclear structural genes of mitochondrial proteins for the analysis of the post-translational targeting and import events in organelle assembly is discussed.
