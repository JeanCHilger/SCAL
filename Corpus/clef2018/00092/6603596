Alzheimer's disease: focal cortical changes shown by positron emission tomography. Local rates of cortical glucose metabolism were estimated by positron emission tomography in 13 right-handed patients with Alzheimer's disease. Individuals with disproportionate failure of language function had markedly diminished metabolism in the left frontal, temporal, and parietal regions. Patients with predominant visuo-constructive dysfunction evidenced a hypometabolic focus in the right parietal cortex. Patients with memory failure as the most apparent feature had no significant metabolic asymmetry in cortical regions. In all subjects, verbal competency generally correlated with metabolic activity in the left frontal and temporal areas, while visuo-constructive test performance was linked to glucose utilization in the right parietal lobe.
