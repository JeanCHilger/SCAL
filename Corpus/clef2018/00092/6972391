Head fixation device for reproducible position alignment in transmission CT and positron emission tomography. A head-positioning device allowing accurate position transference between computed tomography and positron emission tomography is described. A base plate is fixed to the patient's head through either an individual mold or screws into the calvarium. This base plate fits onto the headholders of the two devices, thus ensuring that scans are taken at the same level. Using the regular software, the coordinates of an anatomic structure may be determined and transferred between the two images.
