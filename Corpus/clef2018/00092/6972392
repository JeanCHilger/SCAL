Attenuation correction in gamma emission computed tomography. A method of computing tomographic images from single photon radionuclide emission data is presented. The method takes into account attenuation of gamma rays inside the source and makes use of an iterative technique, based on the difference between the projection data obtained from the source and computed projections, called reprojections, from successive reconstructions of the sources. The method has been tested both by computer simulations and reconstruction of plastic phantoms imaged with 99mTc radionuclides. Substantial improvement in reconstruction accuracy over algorithms uncorrected for internal attenuation is demonstrated. Since the technique is iterative, it can be used with a variety of reconstruction algorithms or combined with other first approximation techniques of attenuation correction.
