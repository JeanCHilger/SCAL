Regional cerebral oxygen supply and utilization in dementia. A clinical and physiological study with oxygen-15 and positron tomography. The cerebral blood flow, oxygen extraction and oxygen utilization has been measured regionally in 22 dements, and 14 aged normal volunteers. Ten demented patients were studied twice at a six-month interval from initial measurements. The use of a steady-state 15O technique and positron tomography for measuring regional cerebral blood flow, regional oxygen extraction fraction and mean cerebral oxygen utilization is discussed. The limitations of measurements are reviewed in the light of the present results and the current state of technological development in positron emission tomography is discussed. A decline in cerebral blood flow and mean cerebral oxygen utilization was correlated with increasing severity of dementia in both degenerative and vascular dements. The decline was coupled, both for the cerebral hemisphere as a whole and regionally. There was no increase in oxygen extraction ratio globally, and therefore no evidence to support the existence of a chronic ischaemic brain syndrome. Focal abnormalities in oxygen utilization were observed for both vascular and degenerative groups. In the vascular group, parietal defects were the most pronounced. Individual derangements of the regional pattern varied, reflecting the different unique patterns of ischaemic damage in these patients. In the degenerative group, parietal and temporal defects were seen in the less severe group, but a profound depression in the frontal regions with relative sparing of occipital area characterized the severe degenerative dements.
