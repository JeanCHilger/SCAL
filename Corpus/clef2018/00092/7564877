Comparison of two pet radioligands for imaging extrastriatal dopamine transporters in human brain. We compared the sensitivity of two dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands ([C-11]cocaine and [C-11]d-threo-methylphenidate) for measurement of extrastriatal DAT availability using positron emission tomography (PET) on separated groups of 10 age matched male volunteers (age range, 21-49 years). DAT availability was obtained using the ratio of the distribution volume in the region of interest to that in the cerebellum (Bmax'/Kd'+ 1). DAT availability measured with [C-11]d-threo-methylphenidate was highest in basal ganglia, followed by thalamus > temporal insula, cingulate > orbitofrontal, frontal and occipital cortices. A similar ranking order for DAT availability was obtained with [C-11]cocaine. Specific binding (Bmax'/Kd') of [C-11]cocaine in thalamus was 25-33% that of basal ganglia and [C-11]d-threo-methylphenidate in thalamus was 11-13% that of basal ganglia. The regional measures with [C-11]cocaine were significantly correlated with those of [C-11]d-threo-methylphenidate (p < or = 0.0001). These results document extrastriatal binding in human brain with two different DAT ligands.
