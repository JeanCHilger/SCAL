Population sizes and frequency of Malassezia pachydermatis at skin and mucosal sites on healthy dogs. Skin and mucosal carriage of Malassezia pachydermatis was studied in 20 healthy pet dogs of various breeds and in 20 kennelled beagles. Using swabs, anal carriage was detected in 10 pet dogs and 11 beagles and the nose, mouth, prepuce and vulva were shown to be infrequently colonised. M pachydermatis was isolated from the external ear canal of 11 beagles and two pet dogs both the population sizes and frequency of isolation were significantly (P < 0.05) greater in the beagles. The yeast was infrequently isolated from the axilla and groin in low numbers using contact plates and detergent scrub samples but was often cultured from the lower lip and the dorsal interdigital spaces
