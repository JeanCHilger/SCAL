Positron emission tomography studies in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer: a method for early therapy evaluation? To investigate if sequential positron emission tomographic (PET) scans with the glucose analog 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG) and/or L-methyl-11C-methionine (11C-methionine) in patients with breast cancer could provide early information on the efficacy of polychemotherapy.Sixteen patients with breast cancer (11 with locally advanced tumors, three with recurrent disease in the contralateral breast, two of them with distant and regional metastases, and two with distant metastases) underwent a baseline and two follow-up PET scans after the first and third/fourth polychemotherapy course. Tumor response was determined clinically/radiographically after three/four polychemotherapy courses.Five patients were investigated with 18FDG, seven with both 11C-methionine and 18FDG, and four with only 11C-methionine before polychemotherapy. 11C-methionine presented a more distinct visualization of primary/contralateral breast cancers in five of seven patients when compared with 18FDG. Twelve of 16 patients demonstrated a response using conventional methods after the third/fourth course of polychemotherapy. Eight of these 12 clinical responders had a significant decrease in tracer uptake at the first PET scan performed 6 to 13 days after the first polychemotherapy course, and these reductions were further augmented after the third/fourth course and corresponded to the conventional therapy evaluation (clinical examination, computed tomography [CT], ultrasonography, and mammography).Our data indicate that PET may be of clinical value in predicting response to chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer and/or metastatic disease earlier than any other method used.
