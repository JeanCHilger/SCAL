Surgical treatment of epilepsy: current status and results of own observations. New diagnostic possibilities make possible a more precise localization of epileptogenetic foci and surgical treatment of epilepsy is associated presently with minimal risk. This was the reason of a surge of interest in recent years even in those countries where this method has not been used. In our country operations for chronic refractory epilepsy have been performed since over 35 years and the gathered experience is sufficient to reach conclusions about the results. The results depend in a certain degree on the location of the focus and the surgical possibility of its removal. In about 50% of the cases cure was effected, and in 15% improvement was achieved near cure. Considering that the treated patients had long-standing and refractory epilepsy with very frequent seizures the results of surgical removal of epileptogenic focus were very good. The authors believe that patients with chronic, focal and refractory epilepsy should be treated surgically, and conservative treatment without considering this possibility is erroneous.
