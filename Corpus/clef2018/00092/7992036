Comparative study of two in vitro models (L-929 fibroblasts and Tetrahymena pyriformis GL) for the cytotoxicological evaluation of packaged water. The preservation of 234 samples of water packaged in polychloride vinyl (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and glass-bottles was concurrently evaluated using both classical chemical analysis oriented to finding organic and inorganic substances which could have been leached by the packaging and in vitro toxicological bioassays using two models: the L-929 established cell line of fibroblasts and the ciliated protozoa Tetrahymena pyriformis GL. Although no significant abnormality was detected with the chemical analysis, cytotoxicity was detected with both models in some samples of water bottled for > 18 months, for either PVC, PET or glass-packaging. However, statistical analysis did not allow a mathematical relationship between the cytotoxic effects, the length of storage and the packaging to be demonstrated.
