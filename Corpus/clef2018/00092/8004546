Attaching and effacing and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli associated with enteric colibacillosis in the dog. The objective of this study was to describe observations from cases of enteric colibacillosis in the dog. Thirteen cases of canine enteric colibacillosis were diagnosed from routine necropsy submissions to our diagnostic laboratory from 1980 to 1992. In all cases there was a clinical history of gastrointestinal disease associated with histological and bacteriological evidence of either attaching and effacing Escherichia coli (AEEC) or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection. Of these 13 cases of enteric colibacillosis, 12 were associated with AEEC and one with ETEC. Eight of the 12 AEEC isolates were available for study. They were of various serogroups, non-hemolytic, and negative for the genes coding for fimbrial antigens F4, F5, F6, F41 and F165 enterotoxins STap, STb and LT
