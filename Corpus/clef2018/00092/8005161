Review of imaging techniques for the diagnosis of breast cancer: a new role of prone scintimammography using technetium-99m sestamibi. Imaging techniques currently used for the diagnosis of breast cancer are reviewed and compared. Besides mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and thallium-201 scintimammography, a new role of technetium-99m sestamibi scintimammography is discussed. It is concluded that while mammography remains the procedure of choice in screening asymptomatic women for breast cancer, other imaging methods play an important role in detecting malignancies in symptomatic patients. 99mTc-sestamibi scintimammography has high sensitivity and improves the specificity of conventional mammography for the detection of breast cancer with this technique, prone imaging is preferable to supine imaging. 99mTc-sestamibi scintimammography thus deserves further study as a screening technique.
