Imaging in epilepsy. Neuroimaging in epilepsy now includes magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission tomography (SPECT), magnetoencephalography, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Recent advances in neuroimaging include improved rates of detection of lesions on structural imaging using quantitative methods, identification of metabolic patterns on functional imaging with PET, and recognition of the value of ictal SPECT in seizure localization.
