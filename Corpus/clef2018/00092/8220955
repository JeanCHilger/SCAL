Clinical high resolution skeletal single photon emission tomography using a triple-headed gamma camera. Planar skeletal scintigraphy has become established as a standard diagnostic test performed within the nuclear medicine department. Since the 1970s good quality images have been produced using an Anger gamma camera and 99Tcm-labelled diphosphonates. Single photon emission tomography (SPET) has improved the sensitivity of detection and the ability to localize bony pathology, particularly benign bone disease in the spine. Recently multi-detector gamma cameras dedicated to SPET have become available. One such system, the Toshiba GCA-9300A, has been used to perform routine clinical skeletal SPET in 81 patients. Good quality images have been obtained using an 8 min acquisition in the axial skeleton and a 16 min acquisition protocol in the peripheral skeleton. Multiple sites can be tomographed in the same patient during the same examination using two or more 8 min acquisitions. Such a multi-detector gamma camera offers advantages over the standard single-headed rotating camera for skeletal SPET in terms of both imaging time and image quality. A cost analysis was performed which demonstrated that the additional cost of purchasing such a multidector gamma camera was less than 30.00 pounds per SPET study.
