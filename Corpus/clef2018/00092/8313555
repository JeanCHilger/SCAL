Regional myocardial sympathetic dysinnervation in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. An analysis using 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. In patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), the frequent provocation of ventricular tachycardia during exercise, the sensitivity toward catecholamines, and the response toward antiarrhythmic drug regimen with antiadrenergic properties suggest an involvement of the sympathetic nervous system in arrhythmogenesis.To analyze the presence, extent, and location of impaired myocardial sympathetic innervation in ARVC, 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) scintigraphy was performed in 48 patients with ARVC. For comparison, 9 patients with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and a control group of 7 patients without heart disease were investigated. In patients with ARVC, the clinical sustained (n = 25 52%) or nonsustained (n = 23In patients with ARVC, regional abnormalities of sympathetic innervation are frequent and can be demonstrated by 123I-MIBG scintigraphy. Sympathetic denervation appears to be the underlying mechanism of reduced 123I-MIBG uptake and may be related to frequent provocation of ventricular arrhythmias by exercise or catecholamine exposure in ARVC. Therefore, in patients with ARVC, the noninvasive detection of localized sympathetic denervation by 123I-MIBG imaging may have implications for the early diagnosis and for the choice of antiarrhythmic drugs in the treatment of arrhythmias.
