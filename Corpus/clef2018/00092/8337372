Tumor imaging and therapy. Oncology applications in nuclear medicine include both the staging of tumors, e.g., bone scanning, and monitoring response to therapy with tumor-specific radionuclides such as 67Ga-citrate and 201Tl-chloride. An increasing role for positron emission tomography and monoclonal antibody studies in oncology is emerging, and therapeutic applications in thyroid cancer and in the treatment of metastatic bone pain are achieving impressive results. This area is likely to become the fastest growing component of nuclear medicine practice over the next decade.
