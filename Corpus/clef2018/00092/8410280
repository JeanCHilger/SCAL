PET and the autoradiographic method with continuous inhalation of oxygen-15-gas: theoretical analysis and comparison with conventional steady-state methods. The steady-state method using 15O gas inhalation and positron emission tomography (PET) is a simple and practical way of imaging cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen metabolism. Several disadvantages do exist, however, including prolonged examination time, requirement of steady-state and a large tissue heterogeneity effect. To avoid the drawbacks of the steady-state method but to preserve its simplicity, we applied the PET/autoradiographic method to the build-up phase during the continuous inhalation of 15O-gas with intermittent arterial sampling. A simulation study was performed to determine the optimal scanning period, evaluate the delay and dispersion effect of the input function and estimate the tissue heterogeneity effect. To assess the clinical feasibility of the proposed technique for the study of oxygen metabolism, sequential measurements with this method and the conventional steady-state method were performed in eight patients. The simulation study showed that a 5-min scan started 3 min after the commencement of 15O-gas inhalation was optimal. With this method, the delay and dispersion effect on CBF was the same as that of the conventional steady-state method, but the tissue heterogeneity effect was reduced. In eight patients, CBF values calculated by this method showed time dependency and were slightly higher than those obtained by the steady-state method. The oxygen extraction fraction showed no significant time dependency and was well correlated with that obtained by the steady-state method. We conclude that the proposed method is a simple and acceptable alternative to the conventional steady-state method.
