Early treatment response in malignant lymphoma, as determined by planar fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose scintigraphy. Clinical oncology needs flexible techniques for routine monitoring of treatment response. We therefore compared planar 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with a conventional gamma-camera and a special collimator to 67Ga scintigraphy in 26 patients with malignant lymphoma during chemotherapy. The scintigraphic appearance of involved sites was essentially the same with both tracers: in patients eventually achieving complete remission, tracer distribution had normalized after two courses high uptake reflected treatment failure
