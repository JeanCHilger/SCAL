A quantitative physiologic model of blood oxygenation for functional magnetic resonance imaging. Variations in venous deoxyhemoglobin levels in response to neuronal activation represent a complex interplay between focal changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and regional metabolism. The authors present a mathematic model that characterizes the response of venous oxygenation to changes in these variables.Using a mass balance approach, the equations for a simple input-output model are derived and solved using Matlab. Changes in blood oxygenation are related to available results from functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments.Increases in CBF produce declines in oxygen extraction fraction and venous deoxyhemoglobin according to Fick's law, and are quantitatively in agreement with available magnetic resonance and positron-emission tomography data. A flow-volume envelope defines the changes in CBF relative to CBV.It is possible to obtain a quantitative understanding of changes in blood oxygenation and to relate these changes to the observed dynamics of magnetic resonance signal change in the setting of functional stimulation.
