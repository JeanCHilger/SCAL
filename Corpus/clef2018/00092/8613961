Uptake of [N-methyl-11C]propionyl-L-carnitine (PLC) in human myocardium. We studied the uptake of propionyl-L-carnitine from plasma by the myocardium in 10 human subjects using positron emission tomography. Propionyl-L-carnitine was labeled in the N-methyl position with carbon-11 (T1/2 = 20.4 min) and administered i.v. in trace amounts. The uptake of the radiolabel by the myocardium was then scanned over a period of 1 1/2 h. The activity-time course of the tracer in blood and plasma and the exchange of the label in plasma between propionyl carnitine, acetyl carnitine and free carnitine was followed during the scans. Myocardial blood flow was also measured in the same subjects. The results show an exchange of the tracer between the myocardium and plasma, and they show an apparently irreversible component of uptake, a result consistent with the incorporation of the label into relatively large intracellular carnitine pools.
