The antitumor phospholipid analog, hexadecylphosphocholine, activates cellular phospholipase D. Hexadecylphosphocholine (HePC), a glycerol-free phospholipid analog, belongs to a new class of drugs that demonstrate selective anticancer activity. The mechanisms underlying the anticancer activity are unclear. To investigate possible signal transduction relationships we examined the influence of HePC on cellular phospholipid metabolism. When HePC was added to cultured human breast fibroblasts (CCD-986-SK cells) that had been radiolabeled with fatty acid, phosphatidylethanol (PEt, the transphosphatidylation product of phospholipase D (PLD)) formation was stimulated as early as 5 min after addition. In cells labeled with [3H]choline, HePC treatment caused release of choline-containing metabolites to the culture medium, concurrent with PEt formation. HePC also elicited formation of diacylglycerol (DG) which, after 30 min increased 3.5-fold over control. As little is known regarding HePC and PLD, attention was directed towards studies on PC metabolism by PLD. PEt formation was shown to be optimal at 20-50 microM HePC, and structure-activity studies showed HePC to be more potent than either lyso-phosphatidylcholine or 1-hexadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine for PLD activation. PLD activity induced by HePC was totally inhibited by cellular pretreatment with phorbol dibutyrate, and 59% diminished by pretreatment of cells with staurosporine, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. Our results demonstrate for the first time that HePC activates PLD, and suggest that PKC participates in this response. The relationship of PLD to the anticancer properties of HePC may be clinically relevant to drug actions.
