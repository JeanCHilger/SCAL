The role of coronary microvascular dysfunction in the genesis of cardiovascular diseases. Positron emission tomography (PET) offers the unique capability of measuring specific flow (flow per unit of mass) in man by means of a regional, tridimensional, noninvasive approach. Using PET, myocardial perfusion abnormalities secondary to microvascular disorders have been investigated in arterial hypertension (AH), dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CM), as well as in ischemic heart disease (CAD). In AH, regional perfusion at rest is within the normal range, while the coronary reserve and flow response to increase in metabolic demand are blunted. These flow abnormalities are independent of the degree of cardiac hypertrophy and the severity of AH appropriate anti-ipertensive therapy is able to improve the perfusion abnormalities after long term treatment, independently of the effect on myocardial hypertrophy. Both dilated and hypertrophic CM demonstrate abnormal vasodilating capability, which has been shown to be present in the subclinical form of dilated DM
