Health hazards to humans associated with domestic pets. Allergy to pets, particularly when manifested as asthma, is an important health hazard. The health impact of severe clinical disease associated with allergy to pets can be minimized by avoidance of pets. Many individuals with milder disease keep their pets and obtain medications for relief of their allergy symptoms. Bird fancier's disease can result in profound deterioration of pulmonary function, and requires avoidance of bird exposure. Animal bites are the commonest health hazard of domestic pets and result in tissue damage and infection risk. Bites are treated by cleaning the wound, and appropriate use of antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis. Diverse infectious diseases are transmitted to humans by their pets these diseases are particularly dangerous to immunocompromised individuals. The infectious diseases can be partly prevented by avoiding ill animals and by washing of hands following exposure to pets or pet-derived secretions. They can be treated by appropriate antibiotics and/or specific immune globulins and/or vaccines.
