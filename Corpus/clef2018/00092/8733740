Brain activation during script event processing. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured with positron emission tomography in seven normal volunteers while they performed various script event verification tasks. The left frontal lobe, left anterior cingulate and the anterior part of the left superior temporal gyrus were more activated in the script event membership and action categorization conditions, whereas the right frontal lobe, left superior temporal gyrus and the middle temporal gyrus bilaterally were more activated in the script event temporal order verification condition. These results indicate that the temporal ordering of script events and determining whether an event belongs to a particular script or action category are processed by distinctive distributed neuronal networks.
