Effect of the duration of fasting on myocardial fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography images in normal males. To evaluate the effect of the duration of fasting on myocardial fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake and distribution, 16 FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) studies were performed in 7 normal volunteers under three different conditions: glucose loading, 6 h fasting and overnight fasting. In the glucose-loaded condition, all subjects had good image quality, and myocardial metabolic rates of glucose (MRGlc) were significantly higher than those in the other two conditions. In the 6 h and overnight fasting conditions, image qualities varied according to MRGlc. Although there were visually distinct regional differences with MRGlc ranging from 0.05 to 0.15 mumol/min per g, these differences were not impressive by a quantitative analysis. The ranges of MRGlc in these two fasted conditions overlapped each other. There was a significant negative linear correlation between MRGlc and serum free fatty acid levels. Thus, MRGlc and image quality in fasted normal subjects varied with the extent of the fed-to-starved transition under clinical fasting conditions (6 h to overnight), and this transition does not depend solely on the duration of fasting. These findings may explain the heterogeneity in FDG studies under fasting conditions.
