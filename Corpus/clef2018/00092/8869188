Focal abnormalities detected by 18FDG PET in epileptic encephalopathies. A prospective study of 32 children with epileptic encephalopathies 12 years or younger revealed a high incidence of focal cortical metabolic defects on 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) not suspected from clinical, EEG, or magnetic resonance imaging findings. PET scans were normal in all five children with typical de novo Lennox-Gastaut syndrome but showed cortical metabolic abnormalities in three out of four with atypical de novo Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, five out of six with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome following infantile spasms, six out of eight with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy, one out of two with epilepsy with myoclonic-astatic seizures, and four out of six with an unclassified epileptic encephalopathy. This suggests that some children with epileptic encephalopathies previously thought to have primary generalised seizures or seizures due to multifocal pathology may have unifocal cortical origin for their seizures. Such an origin may be amenable to surgery.
