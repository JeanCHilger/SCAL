Imaging routines for the esophagus, small bowel, abdomen, and liver in six Norwegian hospitals from 1975 to 1993. The roles of liver scintigraphy in addition to other imaging modalities of the esophagus and the small bowel and the use of abdominal flat films were studied in six Norwegian hospitals between 1975 and 1993. Parallel to the introduction of ultrasonography, the use of liver scintigraphy disappeared almost completely. Barium studies of the esophagus, to some degree, have been replaced by endoscopy, whereas use of barium studies of the small bowel remained unchanged or increased. The number of flat-film studies of the abdomen performed remained unchanged.
