Diagnosis and medical care of raptors in a compilation of cases from 1985-1994. This article summarises the clinical findings in 554 birds of prey, that were admitted to the zoo animal and exotic pet clinic of the veterinary faculty in Zurich between 1 January 1985 and 31 December 1994. Details on the diagnosis, therapy and prognosis are intended to give the practitioner information on the possibilities for the management of diseased raptors. However, it has to be emphasized that the ultimate goal of treatment has to be the rehabilitation of an animal that will be able to survive to a suitable environment. The data presented shows that 31% of the birds of prey were successfully released. The most frequent reason for admission was trauma and 47% of the patients had one or more fractures. But only one out of three fractures was considered suitable for treatment. The management of birds that are starving is a challenge because they require a special dietary regimen. Successful work in the field of the treatment and rehabilitation of raptors requires detailed knowledge of their biology and medicine.
