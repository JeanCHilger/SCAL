A PET study on brain control of micturition in humans. Although the brain plays a crucial role in the control of micturition, little is known about the structures involved. Identification of these areas is important, because their dysfunction is though to cause urge incontinence, a major problem in the elderly. In the cat, three areas in the brainstem and diencephalon are specifically implicated in the control of micturition: the dorsomedial pontine tegmentum, the periaqueductal grey, and the preoptic area of the hypothalamus. PET scans were used to test whether these areas are also involved in human micturition. Seventeen right-handed male volunteers were scanned during the following four conditions: (i) 15 min prior to micturition during urine withholding: (ii) during micturition (iii) 15 min after micturition
