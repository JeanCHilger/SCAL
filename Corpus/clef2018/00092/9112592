Subcortical type cognitive impairment in herpes zoster encephalitis. Nine immunocompetent patients with acute herpes zoster encephalitis (HZE) were studied with the help of neurological investigations. All patients were treated with acyclovir. Neuropsychological performance was compared with that of a group of 16 healthy controls. Computed tomography of the head showed infarct-like hypodense lesions in two patients, involving the internal capsule in one case and the temporoparietal cortex and white matter in another. Hypoperfusion shown by single photon emission computed tomography, mostly involving the frontal areas bilaterally, was seen in six of the seven patients examined. Hyperperfusion as seen in herpes simplex encephalitis was not encountered. One patient remained mildly demented, but all the other patients recovered relatively well. Neuropsychological examination after acyclovir treatment showed a decline in memory and speed of cognitive processes, without circumscribed neuropsychological deficits. Six of the nine patients showed behavioural disinhibition, and mood changes were also observed. Memory impairment in HZE was not as global or as severe as is described after encephalitis due to herpes simplex virus. In HZE both the brain perfusion pattern and the neuropsychological test profile showed features compatible with subcortical dysfunction.
