In vivo imaging of fatty acid incorporation into brain to examine signal transduction and neuroplasticity involving phospholipids. An in vivo method is presented that allows quantification and imaging of fatty acid incorporation into different brain phospholipids in relation to membrane synthesis, neuroplasticity, and signal transduction. The method can be used with positron emission tomography, and may help to evaluate brain phospholipid metabolism in humans with brain tumors, neurodegenerative disease, cerebral ischemia or trauma, or neurotoxic effects of drugs or other agents.
