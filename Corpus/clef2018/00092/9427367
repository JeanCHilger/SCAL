Receptive and expressive language activations for sentences: a PET study. Most language mapping studies have focussed on activations for single-word tasks. We examined activations for verbal auditory and generation tasks using sentence stimuli. [15O]-water PET was performed in 4 female and 5 male normal adults. Listening to sentences (minus rest) activated the superior and middle temporal gyri bilaterally, but mean activation was significantly stronger on the left. The strongest activation for sentence generation (minus repetition) was seen in the left middle and inferior frontal gyri (area 46). This focus appears to be anterior to activations reported for single-word generation, possibly due to greater verbal working memory demands of the sentential task. Additional activation of the left inferior temporal lobe can be attributed to lexicosemantic processing.
