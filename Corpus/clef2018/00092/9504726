Transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMLR) in patients with unstable angina and low ejection fraction. Does perioperative use of the intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) improve the postsurgical outcome of patients presenting with endstage coronary artery disease, unstable angina and low ejection fraction transferred for transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMLR)?TMLR, as sole therapy combined with the perioperative use of an intraaortic balloon pump has been assessed in seven patients with endstage coronary artery disease, unstable angina and low ejection fraction (EF < 35%). Six out of seven patients had signs of congestive heart failure. These patients are compared with 23 patients with endstage coronary artery disease, stable angina and EF > 35%, who were treated with TMLR as sole therapy without the use of IABP. The creation of transmural channels was performed by a CO2-laser. All patients were evaluated by hybrid positron emission tomography (perfusion SPECT and viability PET) and ventriculography preoperatively. Echocardiography, clinical status and hemodynamic assessment by Swan Ganz catheter were performed perioperatively.The perioperative mortality of this combined procedure (TMLR and IABP) was zero. Three out of seven patients had pneumonia with complete recovery. Swan Ganz catheter examinations showed deterioration of LV-function after TMLR intraoperatively and improvement after 2 h and further after 6 h on ICU (P < 0.05). In contrast, a decrease of LV-function in sole TMLR patients with an EF > 35%) has not been observed. Patients with EF < 35% needed the IABP for 2.3 days and moderate dose catecholamines for a mean of 3.0 days. The postoperative EF and resting wall motion score index (WMSI) of all analysed LV segments (evaluated by echocardiography) did not change compared to baseline (EF 31.3+/-2.6 preop. to 32.8+/-3.2 postop. WMSI: 1.75+/-0.14 at baseline to 1.71+/-0.17 postop.). The average Canadian Angina Class at the time of discharge decreased from 4.0+/-0 (baseline) to 2.3+/-0.5 (P < 0.05) and the NYHA-Index from 3.9+/-0.3 to 2.7+/-0.5. No patient had signs of angina pectoris, whereas two patients still had signs of congestive heart failure.The reported data support our concept to start IABP preoperatively in patients with reduced LV contractile reserve in order to provide cardiac support during the postoperative phase of reversible decline of LV-function induced by TMLR.
