Biological basis of emotions: brain systems and brain development. Functional neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography have made it possible to investigate brain metabolism noninvasively during development. Studies have revealed a dynamic period of metabolic maturation and neuronal growth corresponding to the processes of synaptic proliferation and pruning of unused pathways. This physiologic plasticity is believed to be the biological basis for a critical period of learning and emotional development.
