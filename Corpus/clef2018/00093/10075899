Brain activation related to the change between bimanual motor programs. By using positron emission tomography, we aimed to identify cerebral foci of neuronal activation associated with the initiation of a specific motor program. To that end, a state of repeatedly alternating in- and antiphase of bimanual flexion and extension movements was compared with similar movement responses except phase changing. This comparison provided the opportunity to eliminate confounding effects of attention and simple movements. Change between the two bimanual motor programs was related with activation at the posterior border of the left angular gyrus, the right precuneus, and the right premotor and right medial prefrontal cortex. In a subsequent experiment, with attention and random movements as additional variables, activation at the posterior border of the left angular gyrus was found at the same significance level. This posterior parietal activation may indicate an equivalence with the coding of intention in monkey posterior parietal cortex. Lesion of the left posterior parietal cortex in human gives rise to left-right disorientation and ideomotor apraxia. Our results may support the view that these symptoms reflect the inability to transpose a motor plan to the representation of a personal body scheme. Activation of the right premotor and right medial prefrontal cortex was related both to the change between motor programs and to the condition with strictly regular movement in which no additional responses were made to randomly presented signals. This is consistent with the concept that motor preparation is associated with both the selection of internally instructed movements and the suppression of irrelevant environmental stimuli.
