Comparative breast tumor imaging and comparative in vitro metabolism of 16alpha-[18F]fluoroestradiol-17beta and 16beta-[18F]fluoromoxestrol in isolated hepatocytes. 16beta-[18F]Fluoromoxestrol ([18]betaFMOX) is an analog of 16alpha-[18F]fluoroestradiol-17beta ([18F]FES), a radiopharmaceutical known to be an effective positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent for estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) human breast tumors. Based on comparisons of target tissue uptake efficiency and selectivity in a rat model, [18F]betaFMOX was predicted to be as effective an imaging agent as [18F]FES. However, in a preliminary PET imaging study with [18F]FMOX of 12 patients, 3 of whom had ER+ breast cancer, no tumor localization of [18F]betaFMOX was observed. In search for an explanation for the unsuccessful [18F]betaFMOX clinical trial, we have examined the rate of metabolism of [18F]FMOX and [18F]FES in isolated rat, baboon, and human hepatocytes. We have also studied the effect of the serum protein sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which binds [18F]FES better than [18F]betaFMOX, on these rates of metabolism. Immature rat hepatocytes were found to metabolize [18F]FES 31 times faster than [18F]betaFMOX, whereas mature rat cells metabolized [18F]FES only 3 times faster, and baboon and human hepatocytes only 2 times faster than [18F]betaFMOX. In the presence of SHBG, the metabolic consumption rate for [18F]FES in mature rat hepatocytes decreased by 26%. Thus, the very favorable target tissue uptake characteristics of [18F]betaFMOX determined in the rat probably result from its comparative resistance to metabolism (vis-a-vis [18F]FES) in this species, an advantage that is strongly reflected in comparative metabolism rates in rat hepatocytes. In the baboon and human, [18F]FES is extensively protein bound and protected from metabolism, an effect that may be reflected to a degree as a decrease in the rate of metabolism of this compound in baboon and human hepatocytes relative to [18F]betaFMOX. Thus in primates, SHBG may potentiate the ER-mediated uptake of [18F]FES in ER+ tumors by selectively protecting this ligand from metabolism and ensuring its delivery to receptor-containing cells. In addition to current screening methods for 18F-estrogens that involve evaluating in vivo ER-mediated uptake in the immature female rat, studies comparing the metabolism of the new receptor ligands in isolated hepatocytes, especially those from primates or humans, may assist in predicting the potential of these ligands for human PET imaging.
