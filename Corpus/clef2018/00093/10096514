Comparative studies of epibatidine derivatives [18F]NFEP and [18F]N-methyl-NFEP: kinetics, nicotine effect, and toxicity. We have previously shown that [18F]norchlorofluoroepibatidine ([18F]NFEP) would be an ideal radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) however, its high toxicity is a limiting factor for human studies. We, therefore, synthesized its N-methyl derivative ([18F]N-Me-NFEP) and carried out comparative studies. The distribution volumes for different brain regions were higher for [18F]N-Me-NFEP than those for [18F]NFEP (average: 52.5+/-0.9 vs. 36.4+/-0.7 for thalamus), though the distribution volume (DV) ratios were similar (3.93+/-0.27 vs. 3.65+/-0.19 for thalamus to cerebellum). Treatment with nicotine reduced the binding of both radiotracers. Toxicology studies in awake rats showed that N-methyl-NFEP has a lower mortality (0 vs. 30%) and smaller effect on plasma catecholamines than NFEP at a dose of 1.5 microg/kg. However, marked alterations in cardiorespiratory parameters were observed after injection of N-methyl-NFEP (0.5 microg/kg, IV) to an awake dog. Our results suggest that although the binding characteristics of [18F]NFEP and [18F]N-Me-NFEP appear to be ideally suited for PET imaging studies of the human brain, their relatively small safety margin will limit their use in humans.
