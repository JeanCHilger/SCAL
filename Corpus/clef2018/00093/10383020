Comparison of icodextrin and glucose solutions for the daytime dwell in automated peritoneal dialysis. The sustained ultrafiltration achieved by icodextrin is more suited for the daytime dwell in automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) than glucose solutions.Seventeen patients receiving APD underwent assessment using three different solutions for the daytime dwell: 2.27% glucose, 3.86% glucose and 7.5% icodextrin. Patients were then observed on icodextrin for a 6 month period.Daytime ultrafiltration was greater for 3.86% glucose (median 0.10, IQR 0.01 to 0.321) P<0.01 and icodextrin (median 0.26, IQR 0.14 to 0.361) P<0.001 than 2.27% glucose (median -0.19, IQR -0.54 to -0.081), with 3.86% glucose and icodextrin not being significantly different. Positive ultrafiltration occurred in 3/17 patients with 2.27% glucose, 13/17 patients with 3.86% glucose and 16/17 patients with icodextrin (chi2 P<0.0001). The difference in ultrafiltration of icodextrin and 3.86% glucose correlated with the 4 h dialysate/plasma creatinine ratio in a PET test (r = 0.51, P<0.05). Daytime Kt/V urea was greater for 3.86% glucose (median 0.27, IQR 0.20 to 0.48 per week, P<0.01) and icodextrin (median 0.31, IQR 0.27 to 0.49 per week, P<0.0001) than for 2.27% glucose (median 0.22, IQR 0.15 to 0.38 per week), with the difference between 3.86% glucose and icodextrin not reaching statistical significance (P = 0.06). Daytime creatinine clearance was greater for 3.86% glucose (median 10.2, IQR 6.9 to 13.61/week/1.73 m2, P<0.02) and icodextrin (median 12.1, IQR 9.3 to 15.71/week/1.73 m2, P<0.005) than for 2.27% glucose (median 8.8, IQR 4.9 to 11.91/week/1.73 m2). Daytime creatinine clearance was greater for icodextrin than for 3.86% glucose (P<0.005). The effects of icodextrin were sustained for the 6 month observation period.Icodextrin produced enhanced ultrafiltration and clearances compared with 2.27% glucose, without the exposure of the peritoneum to hypertonic glucose solutions.
