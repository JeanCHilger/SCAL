Comparison of dobutamine stress echocardiography and exercise stress Thallium-201 SPECT for detection of myocardial ischemia after acute myocardial infarction treated with thrombolysis. In order to compare the ability of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and exercise Thallium-201 SPECT to detect myocardial ischemia in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) treated with thrombolysis, 43 prospectively selected patients with MI treated with thrombolysis underwent within 1 month from MI DSE, stress-redistribution-reinjection Thallium-201 SPECT and coronary angiography. The echocardiographic and scintigraphic images were analyzed for the presence of myocardial ischemia using a 11-segment left ventricular model. DSE and exercise Thallium-201 SPECT detected myocardial ischemia in the infarct zone in 72% and 72% (31/43) of patients and ischemia at a distance in 12% (5/43) and 19% (8/43) of patients with a concordance of 67% and 88%, respectively. A significant agreement between DSE and exercise Thallium SPECT was found in the evaluation of the extent of both myocardial necrosis and stress-induced myocardial ischemia. DSE and exercise Thallium SPECT showed similar sensitivity (79 vs 76%), specificity (60 vs 60%) and accuracy (77 vs 74%) for detection of a critical stenosis of the infarct-related artery there was also no significant difference between the tests in sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detection of the multivessel disease. In conclusion, initially after thrombolyzed MI, DSE and exercise Thallium-201 SPECT detect myocardial ischemia in the infarct zone in a high proportion of patients and show a similar accuracy for the diagnosis of a critical stenosis of the infarct-related coronary artery and of the multivessel disease.
