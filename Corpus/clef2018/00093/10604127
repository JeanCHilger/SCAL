Single photon emission computed tomography procedure improves accuracy of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in gastro-entero pancreatic tumours. In patients with gastro-enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours the localization of all the neoplastic lesions and an accurate staging of the diseases have important therapeutic implications. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy with In-111 pentatreotide has proved to be useful in detecting gastro-enteropancreatic tumours however, the role of abdominal single photon emission computed tomography has not yet been definitively established. In a series of 52 patients with gastro-enteropancreatic tumours (9 non-functioning islet cell carcinomas, 4 insulinomas, 3 somatostatinomas, 2 VIPomas, 1 glucagonoma and 33 carcinoids) we compared somatostatin receptor scintigraphy with the results of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging performed within one month. Four and 24-hour total body planar images and 4-hour abdominal single photon emission computed tomography were acquired after the i.v. injection of approximately 250 MBq of In-111 pentatreotide. Only abdominal localizations were considered: planar scans detected 16 extrahepatic lesions in 13 patients and 54 liver sites in 21 patients
