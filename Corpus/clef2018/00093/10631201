Prediction of functional recovery after revascularization in coronary artery disease using (18)F-FDG and (123)I-BMIPP SPECT. Clinical studies comparing fatty acid and glucose metabolism in relation to functional recovery of ischemic myocardium after coronary revascularization are scarce. This study evaluated the recovery of regional and global left ventricular function after coronary revascularization in relation to uptake patterns of beta-methyl-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in patients with ischemic myocardial dysfunction.Patients with ischemic regional wall motion abnormality underwent baseline viability imaging with (18)F-FDG, (123)I-BMIPP, and (99m)Tc- methoxyisobutylisonitrile, and the regions with evidence for maintained tissue viability were revascularized. Mismatch of uptake score between two different single-photon emission CT (SPECT) images in the same myocardial region was graded as low or high mismatch. Regional and global left ventricular functional changes after revascularization were analyzed in relation to mismatch severity and difference of total uptake score in each SPECT image pair. A total of 33 vessels in 30 patients related to the asynergic regions were revascularized, and a total of 100 myocardial segments perfused by the revascularized vessels were analyzed.Segments showing high metabolic mismatch (FDG/BMIPP) had lowest regional wall motion score at baseline, representing the most severely impaired ischemic myocardium, and had highest improvement in regional wall motion score after revascularization. Difference of total uptake score between FDG and BMIPP showed a significant positive correlation with difference of ejection fraction between pre- and postrevascularization (r = 0.774, p < 0.0001).Combined metabolic SPECT imaging with FDG and BMIPP has the potential to identify severely impaired ischemic myocardium leading to more efficient therapeutic management of patients with coronary artery disease.
