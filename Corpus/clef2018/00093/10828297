Non-invasive radiotracer imaging as a tool for drug development. Non-Invasive Radiotracer Imaging (NIRI) uses either short-lived positron-emitting isotopes, such as 11C and 18F, for Positron Emis ion Tomography (PET) or single photon emitting nuclides, e.g., 123I, which provide images using planar imaging or Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). These high-resolution imaging modalities provide anatomical distribution and localization of radiolabeled drugs, which can be used to generate real time receptor occupancy and off-rate studies in humans. This can be accomplished by either isotopically labeling a potential new drug (usually with 11C), or indirectly by studying how the unlabelled drug inhibits specific radioligand binding in vivo. Competitive blockade studies can be accomplished using a radiolabeled analogue which binds to the site of interest, rather than a radiolabeled version of the potential drug. Imaging, particularly PET imaging, can be used to demonstrate the effect of a drug through a biochemical marker of processes such as glucose metabolism or blood flow. NIRI as a development tool in the pharmaceutical industry is gaining increased acceptance as its unique ability to provide such critical information in human subjects is recognized. This section will review recent examples that illustrate the utility of NIRI, principally PET, in drug development, and the potential of imaging advances in the development of cancer drugs and gene therapy. Finally, we provide a brief overview of the design of new radiotracers for novel targets.
