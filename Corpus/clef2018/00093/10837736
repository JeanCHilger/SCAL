Radionuclide imaging of cardiac pathology: a mechanistic perspective. Cardiac imaging is performed for a variety of indications using different radiotracers and ligands. The most common is the use of thallium-201 and Tc-labeled tracers for myocardial perfusion imaging. Its uses are manifold, and range from the diagnosis of coronary artery disease to the risk stratification of patients and prognostication. Ischemia is being imaged with nitroimidazole compounds, myocardial necrosis with antimyosin and myocardial infiltration with gallium-labeled leukocytes and somatostatin receptor analogs. The status of myocardial innervation has been evaluated with radiolabeled MIBG. Metabolism in the heart in the normal and ischemic state can be studied with PET and SPECT using fatty acid and glucose analogs. The expression of accessory molecules on the surface of cardiac myocytes in patients with cardiac allograft rejection is now possible. Clearly, much has been accomplished for imaging the heart and pathology related to it. The past has been satisfying, the present interesting and the future promises to be even more exciting!
