Simultaneous analysis of myocardial perfusion and ventricular function. Normal values in the Mexican population. Myocardial perfusion imaging is an useful procedure in the evaluation of patients with coronary artery disease, Gated SPECT technique evaluates simultaneously perfusion and ventricular function, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), ventricular volumes and the transient ischemic dilatation of the left ventricle.To evaluate the normal ventricle volumes and the ejection fraction of the LV obtained automatically with the Gated SPECT in Mexican population.100 patients were studied with low likelihood for CAD. All of them were studied with Tc-99m Sestamibi Gated SPECT. We obtained automatically the LVEF, and the end diastolic and systolic left ventricular volumes.Myocardial perfusion, regional motion and systolic thickening were normal in all patients. We obtained the mean values of EF and end diastolic and systolic volumes. These values were lower in female.Tc-99m Sestamibi myocardial perfusion SPECT is an useful procedure, with high accuracy for the simultaneous evaluation of myocardial perfusion and ventricular function.
