Efficacy of stress-rest myocardial SPET with 99mTc-MIBI in predicting recovery of postrevascularization contractile function. Results of the Spanish multicenter protocol. Working Group of Nuclear Cardiology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of stress-rest 99mTc-MIBI SPET to predict wall motion improvement after revascularization.A prospective and consecutive series of 82 patients (59 +/- 9 years, 12 women), who had some segment with severe impairment of the contractility and underwent coronary revascularization by surgery (n = 64) or angioplasty (n = 18) were studied with rest 99mTc-MIBI SPET. All patients had a rest 99Tc-MIBI SPET, and an exercise test was also performed on 40 of these patients. Before and within 3-6 months after the revascularization a gated blood pool scintigraphy of three projections was performed. The segmentary contractile recovery after revascularization was assessed in relation to the quantification of the 99mTc-MIBI uptake and to the exercise-rest reversibility (exercise uptake < rest uptake).The mean value of the left ejection fraction did not change after the revascularization (41.1 +/- 14.5% vs 41.8 +/- 15.7%). In the post revascularization control a contractile recovery was observed in 40% (113/282) of the segments with severe hypokinesia, akinesia or dyskinesia. Exercise-rest reversibility and rest uptake > 30% were present in 62% (p = 0.002) and 89% (p < 0.0001) respectively of segments that improved contractility after revascularization.For the 99mTc-MIBI SPET an exercise-rest reversibility and > 30% uptake at rest are predictive criteria of contractile recovery after revascularization.
