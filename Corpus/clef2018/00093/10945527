Evaluation of brain metabolism in steno-occlusive carotid artery disease by proton MR spectroscopy: a correlative study with oxygen metabolism by PET. Carotid occlusive diseases may cause ischemic changes in both the gray matter and the white matter as a result of hemodynamic compromise. To validate the use of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in evaluating the carotid occlusive diseases, we compared changes in peaks of choline, in the sum of creatine and phosphocreatine, and in N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) of the white matter with cortical oxygen metabolism measured by PET.Eleven patients with unilateral steno-occlusive carotid artery disease underwent PET and MRS. Ten age-matched healthy volunteers underwent MRS. No subjects had cortical infarction. MRS was performed bilaterally in the centrum semiovale. Regional blood flow, regional metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2), and regional oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF) of the cerebral cortex were measured by the steady-state method with 15O gas.The asymmetry index of the ratio of NAA to the sum of creatine and phosphocreatine (NAA/Cr) correlated positively with the asymmetry index of rCMRO2 (r = 0.77 P < 0.01). Because rCMRO2 is a marker of tissue viability, the NAA/Cr of the centrum semiovale may reflect viable neuronal cells. The asymmetry index of the ratio of choline to the sum of creatine and phosphocreatine (Cho/Cr) showed a significant positive correlation with the asymmetry index of rOEF (r = 0.65The metabolic changes in the centrum semiovale detected by proton MRS reflect a hemodynamically compromised state and are useful in evaluating tissue viability.
