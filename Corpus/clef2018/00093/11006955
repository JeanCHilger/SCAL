PET shows that odors are processed both ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the stimulated nostril. The olfactory nerve is the only cranial nerve with established ipsilateral primary cerebral anatomical projections. Whether these projections correspond to the functional pathways for monorhinal processing of odor perception is, however, unknown. We therefore studied cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with [15O]butanol-PET in 18 healthy females during monorhinal smelling of single odors (OS) and odorless air (AS). Compared with AS, OS activated right amygdala and piriform cortex (confluent cluster), right orbitofrontal cortex, left insula, right thalamus, and anterior cingulate. A post hoc analysis showed that the first three regions were activated independently of the stimulated side, but that right orbitofrontal rCBF was higher during the right nostril stimulations. Left insula was activated mainly by the right nostril stimuli, and right thalamus by the left nostril stimuli. Odors seem to be processed both ipsi and contralaterally, with a right hemisphere preponderance irrespective of the stimulated nostril.
