In vitro comparison of sestamibi, tetrofosmin, and furifosmin as agents for functional imaging of multidrug resistance in tumors. Sestamibi, tetrofosmin, and furifosmin are 99mTc-labeled myocardial perfusion imaging agents which have been shown to be substrates for P-glycoprotein (Pgp), the multidrug-resistance transporter which is overexpressed in some tumors. The three tracers were directly compared in vitro in the human breast cancer cell line MCF7-WT and two multidrug-resistant variants, MCF7-BC19 (MDR1 gene transfected) and MCF7-AdrR (doxorubicin selected). Tracer accumulation over the course of 60 minutes was determined. Dose-response curves were generated for two modulators of Pgp function, GG918 and PSC833. The general shape of accumulation curves for the three tracers in MCF7-WT cells was similar, with accumulation levels being sestamibi > tetrofosmin > furifosmin. Accumulation of sestamibi and furifosmin in MCF7-BC19 cells was reduced to 10% and 21% of MCF7-WT levels, respectively, but this accumulation deficit could be completely reversed by addition of 0.1 microM GG918 or 2 microM PSC833. Accumulation of sestamibi and tetrofosmin in MCF7-AdrR cells was 1.6% and 12% of MCF7-WT levels, respectively, and could only be enhanced to 30% and 45% of MCF7-WT levels by addition of GG918 or PSC833. In contrast, furifosmin showed similar levels of accumulation in MCF7-WT and MCF7-BC19 cells, slightly lower levels in MCF7-AdrR cells, and no consistent response to Pgp modulators. These results support the continued investigation of sestamibi and tetrofosmin as agents for functional imaging of multidrug resistance in human cancer.
