What does positron emission tomography offer oncology? The origins of positron emission tomography (PET) date back 70 years. Since the 1970s, however, its use has increased exponentially in the fields of neurology, cardiology and oncology. [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body scanning is by far the most widely utilised and recognised application of PET in oncology. However, PET is a very versatile and powerful imaging modality capable of helping bridge the gap between the laboratory and the clinic. This article reviews the history and current applications of PET in oncology and then explores some of the newer applications and potential future uses of this versatile technology particularly in the area of cancer research.
