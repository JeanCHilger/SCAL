Evaluation of novel PET ligands (+)N-[11C]methyl-3-piperidyl benzilate ([11C](+)3-MPB) and its stereoisomer [11C](-)3-MPB for muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the conscious monkey brain: a PET study in comparison with. The novel muscarinic cholinergic ligands (+)N-[11C]methyl-3-piperidyl benzilate ([11C](+)3-MPB) and its stereoisomer [11C](-)3-MPB were evaluated in comparison with [11C]4-MPB in the brains of conscious monkeys (Macaca mulatta) using high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET). The regional distribution patterns of [11C](+)3-MPB and [11C]4-MPB at 60-91 min postinjection were almost identical: highest in the striatum and occipital cortex intermediate in the temporal and frontal cortices, cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and thalamus
