Resveratrol inhibits the formation of phosphatidic acid and diglyceride in chemotactic peptide- or phorbol ester-stimulated human neutrophils. Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene, Res) is a naturally occurring antioxidant found in grape berry skins and red wine. It has anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we examined the effect of Res on the formation of phosphatidic acid (PA) and diglyceride (DG), in human neutrophils stimulated by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). We measured the masses of PA and DG by using a nonradioactive method. Our results showed that Res inhibited the formation of PA in a concentration dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 42.4 and 60.9 microM in fMLP- and PMA-stimulated cells, respectively. Res also suppressed the formation of phosphatidylethanol (PEt), thereby implying inhibition of phospholipase D (PLD) activity. In addition, Res inhibited the formation of both diacylglycerol (DAG) and ether-linked acylglycerol (EAG) induced by fMLP and by PMA. Our results suggest that Res inhibition of PLD activity may contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects.
