Automatic milking from a behavioral and welfare viewpoint. Automatic milking systems have been shown to change the behaviour of cows. Because pre-determined milking and feeding times are eliminated, the cows must establish their own daily routine. They have to adapt to being milked according to their lactation. There are, however, indications that not all cows adapt well to the automatic system. Some herd members seem to have inhibitions about entering the milking stall. Too many cows per milking stall and a blocked milking system intensify the situation. Therefore, the cows must either be forced or attracted by food to enter the milking stall. Altogether some cows appear to be more stressed. Furthermore, the human-animal relationship changes due to the new work content. There is less manual work, more observation, and more computer data. The farmer needs to be well educated and must establish a new management program. If care is insufficient, if some herd members are less frequently milked, and if measures to reduce stress are not taken, it is clear that welfare problems could arise. Compared to milk quality and milk hygiene, technical solutions and regulations by law are not as important. Ethological knowledge must be taken into account if automatic milking is to be advantageous for both cow and man.
