An introduction to PET and SPECT neuroreceptor quantification models. PET and SPECT using appropriate radioligands allow imaging of certain critical components of neurotransmission such as presynaptic transporters and postsynaptic receptors in living human brains. PET and SPECT data are commonly analyzed by applying tracer kinetic models. These modeling approaches assume a compartmental system and derive the outcome measure called the binding potential, which reflects the densities of transporters or receptors in a brain region of interest. New models are often noninvasive in that they do not require arterial blood sampling. In this review, the concept and principles of tracer kinetic modeling are introduced and commonly used PET and SPECT neuroreceptor quantification models are discussed.
