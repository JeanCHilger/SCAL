Prediction of effect of beta-blocker therapy in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy by using 123I-BMIPP, 123I-MIBG scintigraphy. We investigated prediction of the efficacy of beta-blocker therapy in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) by using myocardial scintigraphy with 123I-BMIPP (BMIPP) and 123I-MIBG (MIBG). Thirty-seven patients with DCM were examined by myocardial scintigraphy with BMIPP and MIBG before beta-blocker therapy. Patients were classified into two groups, based on whether they improved > 10% of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (improved group, n = 21) or not (unimproved group, n = 16). The extent and severity score of BMIPP for the improved group was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than that for unimproved group. It has been suggested that BMIPP is useful in evaluating the prediction of efficacy of beta-blocker therapy in patients with DCM.
