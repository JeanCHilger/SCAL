Relationship between thallium-201 myocardial SPECT and findings of endomyocardial biopsy specimens in dilated cardiomyopathy. The purpose of this study was to clarify which myocardial histological findings associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are reflected in quantitative 201Tl myocardial SPECT. We obtained studied SPECT images from 21 patients with DCM 10 minutes and 2 hours after they received an injection of 111 MBq 201Tl at rest. We calculated the percent coefficient of variation of myocardial 201Tl counts [%CV(TI)], the washout rate (WR), standard deviation of WR [SD(WR)], extent score (ES) and severity score (SS). We used image analysis to measure % fibrosis, % myocytes, the ratio of fibrous tissue to myocyte tissue (F/My), myocyte size and standard deviation of myocyte size [SD(My)] in left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens. The %CV(Tl) was correlated with % fibrosis and F/My. The ES and SS also correlated with F/My. The correlation between SD(WR) and SD(My) was significant. The present findings suggest that %CV(Tl), ES and SS of rest 201Tl SPECT reflect myocardial fibrosis and that the standard deviation of washout reflects the distribution of myocyte size.
