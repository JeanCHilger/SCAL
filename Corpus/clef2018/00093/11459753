The neural representation of nouns and verbs: PET studies. Neuropsychological studies of patients with selective deficits for nouns or verbs have been taken as evidence for the neural specialization of different word classes. Noun deficits are associated with lesions in anterior temporal regions while verb deficits arise from left inferior frontal lesions. However, neuroimaging studies do not unequivocally support this account, with only some studies supporting claims for regional specialization. We carried out two PET studies to determine whether there is any regional specialization for the processing of nouns and verbs. One study used the lexical decision task and the other used a more semantically demanding task, i.e. semantic categorization. We found robust activation of a semantic network extending from left inferior frontal cortex into the inferior temporal lobe, but no differences as a function of word class. We interpret these data within the framework of cognitive accounts in which conceptual knowledge is represented within a non-differentiated distributed system.
