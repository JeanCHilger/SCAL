Pharmacokinetics of [18F]FETNIM: a potential marker for PET. 18F-labeled fluoroerythronitroimidazole (FETNIM) has been suggested as a marker of tumor hypoxia for use with PET. Our goal was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of [18F]FETNIM in rats and analyze metabolites in human, dog, and rat plasma and urine. Metabolites in liver and tumor homogenates from tumor-bearing rats, as well as the biodistribution of the tracer, were also studied.Radio-thin-layer chromatography and digital autoradiography were used to distinguish metabolites from the parent drug in urine and plasma from 8 patients, 3 dogs, and 18 rats, as well as in liver and tumor homogenates from Sprague-Dawley rats bearing 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene-induced rat mammary carcinoma. Biodistribution of [18F]FETNIM was also studied in rats at 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after tracer injection.Most of the radioactivity in plasma and urine was the unchanged tracer, whereas rat liver homogenates contained almost only metabolites of [18F]FETNIM. None of the species studied showed binding of tracer to plasma proteins. A large variation-3%-70%-in the radioactivity represented by unchanged [18F]FETNIM was found in rat tumor. A negative correlation was found between the percentage of radioactivity represented by unchanged [18F]FETNIM in tumor tissue and tumor uptake (percentage injected dose per gram of tissue) at later times. The highest radioactivity was seen in urine and kidney the lowest uptake was in fat, cerebellum, and bone matrix. In contrast to matrix, bone marrow had high uptake of 18F. The tumor-to-blood ratio reached a maximum of 1.80 +/- 0.64 at 2 h.We conclude that [18F]FETNIM shows low peripheral metabolism, little defluorination, and possible metabolic trapping in hypoxic tumor tissue. These suggest a potential use for this tracer in PET studies on hypoxia of cancer patients.
