Dual time point 18F-FDG PET imaging for differentiating malignant from inflammatory processes. The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in the rates of FDG uptake between malignant and inflammatory cells and processes.(18)F-FDG uptake by different tumor cell lines (human mesothelioma [REN] rat mesothelioma [II45]Except for the SKOV3 cell line, which had only minimally increased FDG uptake (+10% +/- 26% P > 0.3), all other tumor cell lines tested showed significantly increased FDG uptake over time (GM1500, +59% +/- 19%The SUVs of delayed images from the known malignant lesions compared with those of earlier scans increased over time (+19.18% +/- 9.58% n = 31These preliminary data show that dual time imaging appears to be useful in distinguishing malignant from benign lesions. Further research is necessary to confirm these results.
