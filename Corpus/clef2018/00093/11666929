Preparation, Molecular and Electronic Structures, and Magnetic Properties of Face-Sharing Bioctahedral Titanium(III) Compounds: [PPh(4)][Ti(2)(&mgr-Cl)(3)Cl(4)(PR(3))(2)]. Reduction of TiCl(4) with 1 equiv of HSnBu(3) followed by addition of [PPh(4)]Cl and then PR(3) leads to two new dinuclear titanium(III) compounds, [PPh(4)][Ti(2)(&mgr-Cl)(3)Cl(4)(PR(3))(2)] (R = Et and R(3) = Me(2)Ph), both of which contain an anion with the face-sharing bioctahedral type structure. Their crystal structures are reported. [PPh(4)][Ti(2)(&mgr
