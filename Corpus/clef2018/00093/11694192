Three-dimensional cell-scaffold constructs promote efficient gene transfection: implications for cell-based gene therapy. To date, introduction of gene-modified cells in vivo is still a critical limitation for cell-based gene therapy. In this study, based on tissue engineering techniques, we developed a three-dimensional (3-D) transfection system to be cell-based gene delivery vehicle. Human trophoblast-like ED(27) and fibroblastic NIH3T3 cells were used as model cell lines. Cells were seeded onto PET fibrous matrices and plated on polyethylene terephathalate (PET) films as 2-D transfection control. The cell-matrices and cell-films were transfected with pCMV-betagal and pEGFP (green fluorescent protein) reporter gene vectors using LipofectAmine reagent. Gene expression on 3-D versus 2-D growth surface were investigated. The effects of seeding method, seeding density, porosity of the PET matrix, and culturing time of the cell-matrix complex on cDNA transfection and expression in the 3-D cell-matrix complex were also investigated. The beta-gal assay and GFP detection showed that 3-D transfection promoted a higher gene expression level and longer expression time as compared to 2-D transfection. There existed an optimal initial cell seeding density for gene transfection of 3-D cell-matrix complex. Cells seeded on PET matrices with a lower porosity ( approximately 87%) had higher gene expression activities than cells in the matrices with a higher porosity ( approximately 90%). Also, Higher gene expression levels of beta-gal were obtained for the more uniformly seeded matrices that were seeded with a depth-filtration method. The results from this study demonstrate the potential utility of cells seeded onto 3-D fibrous matrices as cell-based gene delivery vehicle for in vitro study of gene expression or in vivo gene therapy.
