Diazepam effects on the cerebral responses to tonic pain: a SPET study. Pain is a complex phenomenon with a strong affective-emotional component in addition to a sensory-discriminative one. This causes the activation of multiple brain areas, which process different aspects of pain simultaneously.We investigated the effects of diazepam (DZ) on a well-known pattern of brain regions activated by cold, tonic pain stimuli.Quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) was assessed by single photon emission tomography (SPET) and the Xe-133 inhalatory method, at rest and during tonic pain activation in eight normal, right-handed, male volunteers. The cold pressor test (CPT) was performed by immersion of the left hand in cold water twice, first during CPT alone, and again 30 min after intravenous administration of diazepam (CPT+DZ).During CPT we observed a significant CBF increase in the right thalamus, primary sensory-motor cortex (S1/M1), frontal and temporal regions, and in the left temporal region and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). During CPT+DZ, the average CBF was significantly lower than during the CPT state (-11%, P<0.05). After normalisation, during CPT+DZ we again observed a significant CBF increase in the right thalamus, S1/M1 and frontal regions, and in the left ACC, though not in the temporal regions. DZ administration first causes a global reduction in CBF, then modifies the pattern of brain activation.During CPT, activation of the temporal regions has been interpreted as part of the affective-emotional component of pain response. DZ seems to affect the "pain-related" pattern of activation by abolishing the CBF increase in the temporal regions, without, however, modifying the pain perception or determining a sedating effect.
