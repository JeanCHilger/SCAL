Immunological characterization of Escherichia coli O157:H7 intimin gamma1. Portions of the intimin genes of Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain E319 and of the enteropathogenic E. coli O127:H6 strain E2348/69 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pET-28a+ expression vectors. The entire 934 amino acids (aa) of E. coli O157:H7 intimin, the C-terminal 306 aa of E. coli O157:H7 intimin, and the C-terminal 311 aa of E. coli O127:H6 intimin were expressed as proteins fused with a six-histidine residue tag (six-His tag) in pET-28a+. Rabbit antisera raised against the six-His tag-full-length E. coli O157:H7 intimin protein fusion cross-reacted in slot and Western blots with outer membrane protein preparations from the majority of enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic E. coli serotypes which have the intimin gene. The E. coli strains tested included isolates from humans and animals which produce intimin types alpha (O serogroups 86, 127, and 142), beta1 (O serogroups 5, 26, 46, 69, 111, 126, and 128), gamma 1 (O serogroups 55, 145, and 157), gamma 2 (O serogroups 111 and 103), and epsilon (O serogroup 103) and a nontypeable intimin (O serogroup 80), results based on intimin type-specific PCR assays. Rabbit antisera raised against the E. coli O157:H7 C-terminal fusion protein were much more intimin type-specific than those raised against the full-length intimin fusion protein, but some cross-reaction with other intimin types was also observed for these antisera. In contrast, the monoclonal antibody Intgamma1.C11, raised against the C-terminal E. coli O157 intimin, reacted only with preparations from intimin gamma 1-producing E. coli strains such as E. coli O157:H7.
