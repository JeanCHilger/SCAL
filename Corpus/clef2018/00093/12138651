The value of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose in positron emission tomography diagnosis of breast carcinoma. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (F-18-FDG-PET) has become an important issue in the diagnosis of malignant tumors within the last years. In breast cancer PET has been established in the diagnosis of the primary tumor as well as in recurrences with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 75%-100% additional a sensitivity of more than 90% and a specificity of about 75% is also seen in axillary lymph nodes detection. With our own results we were able to prove sensitivity of positron emission tomography in diagnosing the primary lesion, locoregional lymph nodes and the staging of metastases. Furthermore, positron emission tomography seems to be superior to conventional imaging modalities in staging primary and recurrent breast cancer, distant metastases and lymph nodes outside the axilla.
