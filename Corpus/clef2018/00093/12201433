Optimization of Ga-67 imaging for detection and estimation tasks: dependence of imaging performance on spectral acquisition parameters. We have compared the use of two (93 and 185 keV) and three (93, 185, and 300 keV) photopeaks for Ga-67 tumor imaging and optimized the placement of each energy window.The bases for optimization and evaluation were ideal and Bayesian signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for the detection of spheres embedded in a realistic anthropomorphic digital torso phantom and ideal SNR for the estimation of their size and activity concentration. Seven spheres of radii ranging from 1 to 3 cm, located at several sites in the torso, were simulated using a realistic Monte Carlo program. We also calculated the ideal SNR for the detection from simple phantom acquisitions.For detection and estimation tasks, the optimum windows were identical for all sphere sizes and locations. For the 93 keV photopeak, the optimal window was 84-102 keV for the detection and 87-102 keV for estimation these windows are narrower than the 20% window often used in the clinic (83-101 keV). For the 185 keV photopeak, the optimal window was 170-220 keV for the detection and 170-215 keV for estimation
