The usefulness of 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT scintimammography in the detection of small size primary breast carcinomas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of supine 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT in the detection of small size breast carcinomas (BC), for which planar scintimammography has showed a low sensitivity. We studied 93 patients with breast lesions </=10 mm, 69 with BC (14 T1a and 55 T1b, 39 palpable and 30 non-palpable) and 24 with benign lesions (16 palpable and 8 non-palpable). All patients had previously undergone clinical examination and mammography. Ten min after 740 MBq 99mTc-tetrofosmin i.v. injection, both planar and SPECT (360 degrees angular step: 3 degrees
