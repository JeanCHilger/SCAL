Automation of [11C]acyl chloride syntheses using commercially available 11C-modules. In implementing published procedures for the incorporation of [11C]carbon dioxide on the immobilized Grignard reagents for the radiosynthesis of [11C]acyl chlorides, several modifications on a commercial PET tracer synthesizer module for 11C-methylations were made to obtain reliable and reproducible production processes for routine clinical applications. High yields of [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635 and [11C]zofenoprilat were obtained via 11C-carboxylation using [carbonyl-11C]cyclohexanecarbonyl chloride and 2-methyl-[l-11C]acryloyl chloride prepared with the modified module.
