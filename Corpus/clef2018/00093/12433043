Distribution of 16alpha-[18F]fluoro-estradiol-3,17beta-disulfamate in rats, tumour-bearing mice and piglets. Based on a high affinity to the enzyme estrone sulfatase (ES), 16alpha-[18F]fluoroestradiol-3,17beta-disulfamate ([18F]FESDS) has been suggested as a potential PET radiotracer for imaging steroid-dependent breast tumours. The distribution of [18F]FESDS was studied in rats, tumour-bearing nude mice and piglets. In all species evidence for binding to a second target, the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA), was obtained. ES and CA inhibitors significantly reduced the radiotracer uptake in various organs but not in tumours. It is concluded that [18F]FESDS binds to ES and CA in vivo but this binding is not strong enough to allow tumour imaging with positron emission tomography (PET).
