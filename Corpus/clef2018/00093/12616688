Epilepsy surgery. Presurgical evaluation. The presurgical evaluation should result in a clear understanding of whether surgery can be undertaken and its associated risks and potential for benefit. The results of surgery are best when there is congruence in the seizure semiology, the irritative zone on interictal EEG, and the ictal onset zone with the epileptogenic lesion as defined on MRI and PET, and when there is a clear understanding of the ictal onset zone's relationship to eloquent cortex as defined by neuropsychologic evaluation, the intracarotid amobarbital test, and cortical functional mapping.
