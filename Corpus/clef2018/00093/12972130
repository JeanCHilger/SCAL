Comparison of two-dimensional echocardiographic tissue harmonic imaging and gated sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic left ventricular ejection fraction measurements. There was good correlation between left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) measurements employing 2-dimensional echocardiography with tissue harmonic imaging and single-photon emission computed tomography using quantitative gated scintigraphy, although in most patients, echocardiographic EF was lower. There was a high degree of agreement between these 2 techniques in assignment of EF to the categories of normal, mildly, moderately, or severely decreased. However, when EF categories did differ, echocardiography always resulted in assignment to a lower category.
