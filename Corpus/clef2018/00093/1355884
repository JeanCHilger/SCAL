Metabolic derangement in viable periinfarct tissue in the course of acute ischaemic infarction: a multitracer positron emission tomography (PET) study. We used a multitracer positron emission tomography (PET) approach to assess metabolic changes in infarcted and periinfarct tissue in acute ischaemic stroke. 16 patients were studied within 6-48 hours (mean, 23 h) after onset of symptoms from a first hemispheric stroke and again 13-25 days later (mean, 15.6 days). Regional cerebral metabolic rates of oxygen (CMRO2) and glucose (CMRGlc), blood flow (CBF) and blood volume (CBV) were measured and oxygen extraction (OEF) as well as glucose extraction (GEF) and microvascular transit time were calculated. PET images were three-dimensionally aligned using serial CT or MRI scans. Regions of interest on the side of the infarction were individually compared to contralateral mirror regions. In the infarction core CBF, CMRO2 and CMRGlc were significantly lower than on the contralateral side and did not change during time. In the periinfarct regions there was a decreased CMRO2 with progressive deterioration over time while CBF slightly increased. Only in a few ischaemic regions with initially increased OEF oxygen metabolism was preserved during the course of time.
