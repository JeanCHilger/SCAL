Pharmacokinetics of 18F-labeled fleroxacin in rabbits with Escherichia coli infections, studied with positron emission tomography. 18F-labeled fleroxacin was used to measure the pharmacokinetics of fleroxacin in healthy and infected animals by positron emission tomography (PET) and tissue radioactivity measurements. In all experiments, a pharmacological dose of unlabeled drug (10 mg/kg) was coinjected with the tracer. The pharmacokinetics of [18F]fleroxacin was measured in groups of healthy mice (n = six per group) at 10, 30, 60, and 120 min after injection and in groups of rats with Escherichia coli thigh infections (n = six per group) at 60 and 120 min after injection by radioactivity measurements in excised tissues. In healthy rabbits (n = 4) and in rabbits with E. coli thigh infections (n = 4), tissue concentrations of drug were determined by serial PET imaging over 2 h after the final image was acquired, animals were sacrificed and concentrations measured by PET were compared with the results of tissue radioactivity measurements. In all three species, there was rapid equilibration of [18F]fleroxacin to significant concentrations in most peripheral organs
