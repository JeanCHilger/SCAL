Use of 123I-MIBG scintigraphy to assess the impact of carvedilol on cardiac adrenergic neuronal function in childhood dilated cardiomyopathy. Iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) cardiac scintigraphy is a useful tool for the assessment of cardiac adrenergic neuronal function, which is impaired in children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In adults with DCM, long-term treatment with carvedilol improves both cardiac adrenergic neuronal function and left ventricular function. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the impact of carvedilol on cardiac adrenergic neuronal function using 123I-MIBG scintigraphy and on left ventricular function using equilibrium radionuclide angiography in children with DCM. Seventeen patients (11 female, six male mean age 39 +/- 57 months, range 1-168 months) with DCM and left ventricular dysfunction underwent 123I-MIBG cardiac scintigraphy and equilibrium radionuclide angiography before and after a 6-month period of carvedilol therapy. A static anterior view of the chest was acquired 4 h after intravenous injection of 20-75 MBq of 123I-MIBG. Cardiac neuronal uptake of 123I-MIBG was measured using the heart to mediastinum count ratio (HMR). Radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed following a standard protocol. MIBG cardiac uptake and left ventricular function respectively increased by 38% and 65% after 6 months of treatment with carvedilol (HMR=223% +/- 49% vs 162% +/- 26%, P<0.0001, and LVEF=43% +/- 17% vs 26% +/- 11%, P<0.0001). Carvedilol can improve cardiac adrenergic neuronal and left ventricular function in children with dilated cardiomyopathy. Further studies are needed to assess the relationship between improvement in MIBG cardiac uptake and the beneficial effects of carvedilol on morbidity and mortality.
