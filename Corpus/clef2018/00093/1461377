Cerebellar diaschisis revisited: pontine hypometabolism and dentate sparing. A unilateral supratentorial lesion may cause hypometabolism in the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere (crossed cerebellar diaschisis). We analyzed glucose metabolism, measured by PET-FDG, in the posterior fossa in 67 patients (78 PET studies) with primary unilateral supratentorial brain tumors selected for visually obvious metabolic asymmetry in the cerebellar hemispheres. We found that glucose utilization was 17% lower in the contralateral cerebellar cortex (compared with the ipsilateral one), consistent with the selection criterion, and 19% lower in the ipsilateral pons, wherein lie the first order synapses of the corticopontocerebellar pathway. This finding helps to validate the prevalent view that cerebellar diaschisis is due to interruption of afferent input from the corticopontocerebellar pathway. However, glucose metabolism in the contralateral dentate nucleus was relatively preserved--only 2% less than the ipsilateral dentate. This "dentate sparing" suggests preservation of afferent input to the largest of the deep cerebellar nuclei from the Purkinje cells in the cortex, despite interruption of the major excitatory input to the Purkinje cells.
