Cardiac pacemakers and central venous lines can induce focal artifacts on CT-corrected PET images. PET/CT imaging can be associated with focal artifactual (18)F-FDG uptake introduced by metallic implants or contrast agents. It is unknown whether cardiac pacemakers or permanent central venous catheters can also result in such artifacts.Twenty-seven patients with permanent central venous lines (13 men and 14 women mean age +/- SD, 53.8 +/- 16.2 y) and 9 patients with pacemakers (7 men and 2 womenCT-corrected PET images revealed focally increased uptake of moderate intensity in all patients with cardiac pacemakers and focally increased uptake of mild intensity in 8 of 27 patients (29.6%) with central venous lines.Cardiac pacemakers and reservoirs of central venous lines can induce artifactual (18)F-FDG on CT-corrected PET images. Thus, in patients with permanent central lines or pacemakers, both corrected and uncorrected PET images need to be reviewed to avoid false-positive PET findings.
