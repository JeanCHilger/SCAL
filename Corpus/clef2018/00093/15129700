FDG PET imaging for grading and prediction of outcome in chondrosarcoma patients. The aims of this study were to assess the potential of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) for tumor grading in chondrosarcoma patients and to evaluate the role of standardized uptake value (SUV) as a parameter for prediction of patient outcome. FDG PET imaging was performed in 31 patients with chondrosarcoma prior to therapy. SUV was calculated for each tumor and correlated to tumor grade and size, and to patient outcome in terms of local relapse or metastatic disease with a mean follow-up period of 48 months. Chondrosarcomas were detectable in all patients. Tumor SUV was 3.38 +/- 1.61 for grade I (n = 15), 5.44 +/- 3.06 for grade II (n = 13), and 7.10 +/- 2.61 for grade III (n =3). Significant differences were found between patients with and without disease progression: SUV was 6.42 +/- 2.70 (n = 10) in patients developing recurrent or metastatic disease compared with 3.74 +/- 2.22 in patients without relapse (P = 0.015). Using a cut-off of 4 for SUV, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for a relapse were 90%, 76%, 64%, and 94%, respectively. Combining tumor grade and SUV, these parameters improved to 90%, 95%, 90%, and 95%, respectively. Pretherapeutic tumor SUV obtained by FDG PET imaging was a useful parameter for tumor grading and prediction of outcome in chondrosarcoma patients. The combination of SUV and histopathologic tumor grade further improved prediction of outcome substantially, allowing identification of patients at high risk for local relapse or metastatic disease.
