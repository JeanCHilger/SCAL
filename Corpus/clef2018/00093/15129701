18F]FDG PET as a substitute for second-look laparotomy in patients with advanced ovarian carcinom. The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) with that of second-look laparotomy (SLL) in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma following primary chemotherapy. Fifty-five patients who had undergone cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for advanced ovarian carcinoma were enrolled in the study. Thirty patients underwent SLL after primary treatment (SLL group), while 25 underwent FDG PET after primary treatment without SLL (PET group) We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of the 55 patients for comparison of progression-free interval and disease-free interval between the two groups. Ovarian carcinomas recurred in 37 of the 55 patients. When the progression-free interval and the disease-free interval in patients in the PET group were compared with those in the SLL group, no significant differences were observed. The progression-free interval in the PET and SLL groups were 28.8 +/- 12.7 months and 30.6 +/- 13.7 months, respectively (P = 0.29). The disease-free interval in the negative PET group was 40.5 +/- 11.6 months, and that in the negative SLL group was 48.6 +/- 12.1 months (P = 0.12). In conclusion, FDG PET has a similar prognostic value to SLL, and can substitute for SLL in the follow-up of patients who have had ovarian carcinoma, especially when there is a high risk for recurrence.
