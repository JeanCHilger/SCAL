Differentiation of mediastinal FDG uptake observed in patients with non-thoracic tumours. In regions with a high prevalence of granulomatous diseases, benign inflammatory fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the mediastinum is frequently observed even in healthy subjects. We examined parameters of mediastinal FDG uptake to determine whether they can differentiate malignancy from benign lesions. Seventy patients with non-thoracic tumours who had mediastinal uptake on FDG positron emission tomography (PET) were included (33 males, 37 females age 57.5 +/- 16.9 years
