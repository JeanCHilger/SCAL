Improved synthesis of [11C]SA4503, [11C]MPDX and [11C]TMSX by use of [11C]methyl triflate. Recently we have clinically used three new radioligands, [11C]SA4503, [11C]MPDX, and [11C]TMSX, for mapping sigma1, adenosine A1, and adenosine A2A receptors, respectively, in the human brain by positron emission tomography. These radioligands are synthesized by methylation of the respective demethyl precursor with [11C]methyl iodide. Here we demonstrate the improved syntheses of these compounds by use of [11C]methyl triflate, a highly reactive alternative to [11C]methyl iodide.
