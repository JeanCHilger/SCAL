A study of cell behaviour on the surfaces of multifilament materials. Since many fibres are very strong, they are considered to have useful potential for fibre reinforcement of orthopaedic and dental implant materials. Fibres exposed on the surface of composites may significantly influence the cellular response not only due to the chemistry but also due to the fibre size and shape. This study has concentrated on investigation of cellular responses to fibre-specific aspects of fibre-reinforced composites. Four multifilament materials with diameter less than 20 microm were used: Kevlar 29(K), silicon carbide(SiC), nylon 66(N), and polyethylene terephthalate(PET). Established cell line L929 fibroblasts were used as the cell model. Cell behaviour on the surfaces of fibres was examined using direct cell counting (after 3, 5, 8 h and 1, 2, 3 days), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (after 2 h and 2 days), and fluorescent staining of F-actin, which was analysed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) (after 2 h and 2 days). The results showed that fibroblasts adhered and grew very well on all fibre surfaces, although less cells were observed on PET from direct cell counting. Significant orientational behaviour of cells was found on all fibre surfaces from the SEM and CLSM analysis, independent of the bulk chemistry of the fibres.
