Diagnosis and management of cervical paragangliomas: the Freiburg experience. Paragangliomas of the head and neck represent rare tumors of neural crest origin that arise from chemoreceptors. They are highly vascular neoplasms that are benign in the majority of cases. There are controversial discussions concerning the different treatment options for cervical paragangliomas.Between January 1992 and November 2003 a total of 13 patients with 15 cervical paragangliomas were treated at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, University of Freiburg. Our study includes eight female and five male patients with a mean age of 39.9 years (range: 20 - 79 years). There were 14 carotid body tumors and one vagal paraganglioma.14 tumors were resected and one underwent primary radiation. In four patients we noted a total of 8 permanent, postoperative nerve deficits. During follow-up no recurrent tumors were seen.Complete surgical removal represents the therapy of choice for the majority of cervical paragangliomas. In cases of multiple head and neck paragangliomas or in patients with underlying diseases, primary radiation should be discussed as a treatment option.
