The development of functional imaging in the diagnosis, management and understanding of childhood brain tumours. Imaging plays a fundamental role in the management of children with brain tumours. A series of new techniques, commonly grouped under the heading functional imaging, promise to give information on the properties and biological characteristics of tissues thereby adding to the structural information available from current imaging. The EPSRC funded a workshop to bring together clinicians from the UK Children's Cancer Study Group and scientific experts in the field to identify clinical problems in childhood brain tumours that may be addressed by functional imaging and to develop a clinical test bed for applying, evaluating and developing this new technology. The presentations and discussion sessions from the workshop are summarised and a review of the current 'state of the art' for this rapidly developing area provided. A key output of the workshop was agreement on a series of hypotheses which can be tested in carefully designed clinical studies.
