Dopamine transporter SPECT in patients with mitochondrial disorders. Mitochondrial disorders may affect basal ganglia function. In addition, decreased activity of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain has been linked to the pathogenesis of dopaminergic cell loss in Parkinson's disease. Objective : To investigate the dopaminergic system in patients with known mitochondrial disorders and complex I deficiency.Dopamine transporter density was studied in 10 female patients with mitochondrial complex I deficiency by (123)I-FP-CIT (N-beta-fluoropropyl-2beta-carbomethyl-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)-nortropane) SPECT.No differences in (123)I-FP-CIT striatal binding ratios were observed and no correlation of the degree of complex I deficiency and striatal binding ratios could be detected.These data argue against the possibility that mitochondrial complex I deficiency by itself is sufficient to elicit dopaminergic cell loss.
