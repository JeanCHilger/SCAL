Evaluation of a 3D reconstruction algorithm for multi-slice PET scanners. A fully 3D reconstruction algorithm based on filtered backprojection was evaluated for the reconstruction of data obtained with multi-slice positron emission tomography (PET) scanners which have had the septa removed. This algorithm uses forward-projection through the reconstructed images of a 2D subset of the data to complete the 3D dataset thus satisfying the condition of shift invariance. This is followed by 3D filtered backprojection. Axial sampling was doubled by combining adjacent polar angles, thus improving reconstructed axial resolution. The algorithm was tested using real and simulated datasets and gave high quality reconstructions without artifacts over a wide range of imaging conditions. Events are placed accurately throughout the imaging volume as determined by measurements with a MRI/PET registration phantom. The forward-projection step leads to degradation in image resolution due to insufficient axial and transaxial sampling. This effect is amplified if multiple iterations of the algorithm are used, with little decrease in image noise. Changing the filter employed in the initial 2D reconstruction can be used to alter the noise and resolution characteristics of the 3D images. This algorithm has proved very robust at reconstructing 3D PET data and is relatively fast. Those small problems which exist can be attributed to detector sampling problems, especially in the axial direction, which is a consequence of the geometry of these scanners, which are designed primarily for 2D data acquisition.
