Relationship between recurrence of esophageal varices and changes of portal circulation after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy: evaluation by single photon emission CT. The relationship between recurrence of esophageal varices after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) and changes of the blood pool of portosystemic collaterals was studied in 36 patients with liver cirrhosis. Examination of the blood pool of portosystemic collaterals was performed by single photon emission CT (SPECT). Seven hundreds and forty MBq of 99mTc-RBCs, labeled by an in vivo technique, were given intravenously, and tomographic imaging of the intraabdominal vascular blood pool was performed. Before EIS, the blood pool images of the coronary vein were demonstrated in 34 cases (94.4%). According to changes of SPECT images, the patients were divided into 3 groups, that is, the groups showing a disappearance, decrease, and no changes of the blood pool images of the coronary vein. The recurrence rates of esophageal varices after EIS were 11.1% (1 of 9 patients), 40.0% (6 of 15 patients), and 90.0% (9 of 10 patients) in the disappeared, decreased and unchanged groups respectively. These values were significantly different between the disappeared group and the unchanged group (P less than 0.01), and between the decreased group and the unchanged group (P less than 0.05). These results indicate that the abdominal blood pool SPECT is useful for evaluating the therapeutic effectiveness of EIS.
