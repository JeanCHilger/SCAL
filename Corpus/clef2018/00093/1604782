Canine hip dysplasia and the breeder. A layman's point of view. Many, though certainly not all, breeders are becoming fairly knowledgeable about CHD and other joint problems. The veterinarian should encourage prevention through selective breeding and lead the client to further understanding of the disorders. Breeders need help in separating scientific evidence from insufficiently tested hypotheses based on testimonials. "Quick-and-easy" cures can be exposed and discounted with just a little search of the literature. The veterinarian's job is similar to that of the teacher in the old one-room country school: some client may have to be taught the basics, whereas those in other stages of progress receive different help. Breeders perhaps need more assistance than do pet owners, because they will affect future generations of dogs. The veterinarian who concentrates on building a trust relationship based on shared facts and a sincere desire to contribute to the well-being of his clients (and his patients) will enjoy a most rewarding relationship with them.
