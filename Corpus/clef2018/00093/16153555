Myocardial contractility is early affected in systemic sclerosis: a tissue Doppler echocardiography study. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by frequent myocardial involvement. Alteration in left ventricular (LV) function is reported to be rare however, it may be underestimated by conventional measurements. Our aim was to prospectively investigate LV function in SSc patients, using Tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDE), a modern and accurate method of assessing myocardial function.Seventeen consecutive SSc patients with normal cardiac examination, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and radionuclide LV ejection fraction (EF) were prospectively investigated. Myocardial perfusion was investigated using single-photon-emission computerized tomography (SPECT). Echocardiography (ECHO), systolic and diastolic strain-rate (SR) measured in the posterior wall by TDE were used to investigate myocardial function, and compared with results of 15 matched controls. All patients (53+/-8 years 14 womenFrequent abnormal myocardial perfusion is confirmed in SSc patients. Reduced contractility is also frequent as detected by TDE, despite normal radionuclide LVEF.
