Patient factors affecting thermal lesion size with an impedance-based radiofrequency ablation system. To evaluate factors that affect the size of the thermal lesion created from radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with an impedance-based system.Thirty-two nonresectable liver tumors, including hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) (N=20 63%) or metastatic tumors (N=12Twenty-eight (88%) of the 32 tumors were durably ablated in a single session. Two patients had residual disease and two had local recurrence. All residual or recurrent lesions were in patients with cirrhosis. Three of these patients were retreated resulting in a durable result in 97% of lesions with a mean/median follow up 443/503 days. Mean tumor diameter and resulting thermal lesion size was similar for HCC and metastatic lesions. A significant difference (P=.02) was observed when comparing the thermal lesion/electrode ratios of HCC (1.01+/-0.36) with metastases (1.26+/-0.22). Nine of 20 HCC ablations (45%) resulted in a ratio>1.0, whereas 11 of 12 metastatic ablations (92%) attained a ratio>1.0 (P=.01). Thermal lesion size did not correlate with time to impedance roll-off for the entire group (r=-0.22 P=.90) or by tumor type (HCC r=0.10Thermal lesion size and the ability to obtain a margin of normal tissue are significantly affected by the presence of cirrhosis when using an impedance-based system. Given this limitation, the majority of small hepatic neoplasms can still be successfully treated with RFA.
