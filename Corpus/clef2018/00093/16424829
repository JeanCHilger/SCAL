Comparative overview of brain perfusion imaging techniques. Numerous imaging techniques have been developed and applied to evaluate brain hemodynamics. Among these are: Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Xenon-enhanced Computed Tomography (XeCT), Dynamic Perfusion-computed Tomography (PCT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC), Arterial Spin-Labeling (ASL), and Doppler Ultrasound. These techniques give similar information about brain hemodynamics in the form of parameters such as cerebral blood flow (CBF) or volume (CBV). All of them are used to characterize the same types of pathological conditions. However, each technique has its own advantages and drawbacks. This article addresses the main imaging techniques dedicated to brain hemodynamics. It represents a comparative overview, established by consensus among specialists of the various techniques. For clinicians, this paper should offers a clearer picture of the pros and cons of currently available brain perfusion imaging techniques, and assist them in choosing the proper method in every specific clinical setting.
