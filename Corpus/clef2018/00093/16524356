Science fiction becomes enlightening reality: diagnostic scans. One of the 20th century's greatest achievements was the development of several imaging methods. These methods facilitate diagnoses and sometimes eliminate the need for surgical exploration. Generally, clinicians and patients consider their benefit worth the minimal risk they pose. Currently, imaging is the fastest growing area of health expense. Each imaging method alone or with contrast media has a unique niche. X-rays, or plain radiographs, can show fracture or simple organ blockage. Computed tomography provides a three-dimensional view with clearer, sharper contrast between the body's structures and tissues. Magnetic resonance imaging can depict musculoskeletal aberrations, tumors, infection, or tissue pathology. Positron-emission tomography quantifies metabolic activity. Consultant pharmacists should be able to differentiate among these scans and understand the benefits and uses of each.
