Imaging procedures for giant cell arteritis (Horton's disease). This review article highlights several diagnostic imaging modalities in giant cell arteritis. Color-coded Duplex sonography is a relatively cost-efficient but strongly observer-dependent imaging modality. It may be difficult to distinguish inflammatory from atherosclerotic mural changes. Positron emission tomography with (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose is very sensitive in detecting extracranial involvement of large vessel vasculitis. However, it provides no information on inflammatory changes of the superficial cranial arteries. High-resolution MRI is a new observer-independent method that allows visualizing and assessing the superficial cranial arteries in high detail. Extracranial large artery involvement can be evaluated during the same investigation. At present, only single-center experiences with this promising but rather complex procedure exist. A comparative multicenter trial is about to be initiated.
