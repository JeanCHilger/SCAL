99mTechnetium-SESTAMIBI uptake in malignant lymphomas. Correlation with chemotherapy response. The rationale of the present study is based on the property of technetium-SESTAMIBI to enter malignant and other highly metabolic cells, and then to be pumped out of them by the multidrug-resistant (MDR) system, strongly depending on the expression of the MDR-1 gene encoded P-glycoprotein (Pgp-170).Forty-one patients with malignant lymphoma were studied before chemotherapy. Images were taken 30 min (early) and 180 min (late) after intravenous injection of (99m)Tc-MIBI, and then visually interpreted. They were correlated with clinical response defined as chemosensitive (ChS) when a >6 month remission was attained, and chemoresistant (ChR) to any other response. Of 41 patients, 27 had an early positive uptake, 18 (67%) were ChS, and 9 (33%) ChR. Of these 27 patients, 19 also had late positive scans 15 (79%) were ChS, and only 4 were ChR (p = 0.037). Conversely, 10 of 14 remaining patients with negative early scans were ChR. Eight patients had an early positive studyThis study takes advantage of the relationship between the ability to uptake and retain (99m)Tc-MIBI, a Pgp-170 substrate, by lymphomatous tumors. This attribute, combined with other clinical data, could help to select tailored treatments for patients that are likely to be chemoresistant before treatment.
