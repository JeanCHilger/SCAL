Cerebral vascular mean transit time in healthy humans: a comparative study with PET and dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI. Cerebral vascular mean transit time (MTT), defined as the ratio of cerebral blood volume to cerebral blood flow (CBV/CBF), is a valuable indicator of the cerebral circulation. Positron emission tomography (PET) and dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DSC-MRI) are useful for the quantitative determination of MTT in the clinical setting. The aim of this study was to establish a normal value set of MTT as determined by PET and by DSC-MRI and to identify differences between these methods. Seven healthy volunteers were studied with (15)O-PET (H(2)(15)O and C(15)O) and gradient-echo echo-planar DSC-MRI at 1.5 T. In the DSC-MRI study with bolus injection of contrast agent, deconvolution analysis was performed. Comparison of gray-to-white matter ratios showed fairly good agreement between PET and DSC-MRI for all parameters (relative CBV, relative CBF, and relative MTT), confirming the validity of relative measurements with DSC-MRI. However, quantitative MTT measured by DSC-MRI was significantly shorter than that measured by PET in cerebral cortical regions (2.8 to 3.0 secs for DSC-MRI versus 3.9 to 4.3 secs for PET) and the centrum semiovale (3.5 secs for DSC-MRI versus 4.8 secs for PET). These discrepancies may be because of the differences in the intrinsic sensitivity of each imaging modality to vascular components whereas PET measurement of CBV is equally sensitive to all vascular components, measurement with DSC-MRI originates from the microvasculature in the vicinity of the brain parenchyma. This underlying difference may influence interpretation of MTT determined by PET or by DSC-MRI for patients with cerebrovascular disease.
