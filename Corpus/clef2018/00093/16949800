Evaluating brain activity in obsessive-compulsive disorder: preliminary insights from a multivariate analysis. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been linked to a dysfunction of brain corticostriatal networks, although functional imaging studies of OCD rarely apply network-sensitive analysis methods. In this study, we compared a univariate and a multivariate analysis of PET data in OCD patients and healthy subjects the latter approach was considered more suitable for characterizing functional networks of brain activity. Although both methods suggested there was abnormal corticostriatal activity in OCD patients, the nature, extent and magnitude of this activity was clearly enhanced by the multivariate approach. Implications for the analysis of such studies are discussed.
