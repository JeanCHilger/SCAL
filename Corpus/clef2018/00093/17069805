Evaluation of a recombinant excretory secretory Haemonchus contortus protein for use in a diagnostic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The nematode Haemonchus contortus (H. contortus) is one of the most pathogenic and economically important parasites of sheep. A 24 kDa protein is one of the important components in H. contortus excretory/secretory (ES), which was shown to have important biological function. In our research, the cDNA of its open reading frame (ES24) was obtained and analyzed. Then the ES24 was sub-cloned into pET-30a expression vector. The recombinant vector that codes hexahistidyl peptide fusion protein (His-ES24) was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain. After induction, a high expression level of His-ES24 was found at 6h taking about 26% of the total bacterial protein analyzed by gel thin-layer scanning. The expressed His-ES24 was purified and then used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect specific antibodies in serum samples. The ELISA was able to differentiate between H. contortus-infected sheep serum and Fasciola hepatica-infected sheep serum or non-infected sheep serum. No cross-reaction was observed in sheep sera that have been experimentally infected with F. hepatica. A total of 153 field sheep serum samples conserved in our laboratory were examined using the His-ES24 ELISA, and 82 (53.6%) of them were found seropositive to H. contortus. Our results demonstrate that the prokaryotic-expressed His-ES24 might be a useful diagnostic reagent for epidemiological studies of H. contortus in sheep.
