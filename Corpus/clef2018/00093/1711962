Adenosine. An evaluation of its use in cardiac diagnostic procedures, and in the treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Adenosine (adenine riboside), administered either as the free base or as the 5'-triphosphate (ATP) by rapid intravenous bolus, depresses atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction, resulting in transient AV block. Adenosine is the active agent and ATP is rapidly converted to adenosine after exogenous administration. By blocking the anterograde AV nodal limb of a re-entrant circuit, adenosine 6 to 12 mg (or ATP 10 to 20 mg) converts almost all episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) involving the AV node within 30 seconds of administration. This is at least equivalent in efficacy to verapamil in adults, and superior to lanatoside C in children, with a considerably more rapid onset of action. Furthermore, if a dose of adenosine is ineffective, the exceptionally short plasma half-life of the adenyl nucleosides (less than 10 sec) allows rapid upward dosage titration until PSVT is terminated. Because the induced conduction block primarily affects the AV node, adenosine is a useful diagnostic tool in patients with broad or narrow QRS complex tachycardia it terminates arrhythmias dependent on the AV node, unmasks other supraventricular mechanisms during transient AV block, but almost always has no effect on ventricular tachycardia. Noncardiac adverse effects, i.e. flushing, dyspnoea and chest pain, may occur during acute arrhythmia termination or diagnosis with adenosine, and arrhythmias may develop
