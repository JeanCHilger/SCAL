Characterization of surgically transposed ovaries in integrated PET/CT scan in patients with cervical cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine the ovarian findings on integrated positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans during follow-up in cervical cancer patients with ovarian transposition.We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data and integrated 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography of women with ovarian transposition during radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer between December 2003 and March 2006.Eighty-four premenopausal women had ovarian transposition performed during the study period. Twelve positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans from 11 patients were registered for the current study and three women were diagnosed with metastasis: two in lung and one in pelvis. Two patients complained of menopausal symptoms during follow-up, and the hormonal tests were consistent with it. In the current study, an integrated positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan detected one patient with right lower abdominal mass with increased 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, which was identified as a transposed right ovary. Clinical information of ovarian transposition was helpful in interpretation of the lesion. In the patient, transposed ovary was associated with increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, with standard uptake values ranging from 3.7 to 5.5. Other positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans did not show abnormal uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose.Transposed ovary in premenopausal women may appear on integrated positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan as a mass with increased 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, which may be associated with preserved ovarian function. Clinical information regarding transposition should be noted in order not to interpret these as recurrent or metastatic lesions.
