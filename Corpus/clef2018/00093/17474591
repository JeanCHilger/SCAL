The role of horse-therapy in improvement of children with Down syndrome. Many years of experience in horse-therapy show that this is the efficient method of rehabilitation of disabled children, also with Down syndrome. This method improves not only proficiency, but also mental sphere and social functions of children. 3 cases of children with Down syndrome in age 7-8 years rehabilitated by horse-therapy, and other methods (physical exercises, swimming, talking exercises) through 1-3 year have been described. In every case adding horse-therapy to other methods of rehabilitation gave measurable advantages both in physical sphere and also in mental and social spheres. In parents' opinion disabled children are highly motivated to take part in the classes of horse-therapy. It should be emphasized that in every described case we have seen high involvement of parents in rehabilitation process.
