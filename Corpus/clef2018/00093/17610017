2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose accumulation in ovarian carcinoma cell lines. To evaluate 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) accumulation in human ovarian carcinoma cell lines compared with control tumor cell lines known to accumulate FDG.FDG accumulation assays were performed in 15 different ovarian carcinoma cell lines at 1, 2, and 3 hours after incubation with 1 microCi of FDG. Results were compared with FDG accumulation in six different control tumor cell lines. 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose accumulation was expressed as counts per minute (cpm) in cells and normalized to initial cpm in medium and total protein content of cell lysates.FDG accumulation in all 15 ovarian carcinoma cell lines was equal to or higher than 0.0005 +/- 8.6 10(-5) cpm in cells/cpm in medium/mug protein at all three different time points. In two ovarian carcinoma cell lines (ES-2, poorly differentiated clear cell carcinoma, and OVCAR-3, poorly differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma), FDG accumulation was not statistically, significantly different compared to the control cell line with the highest FDG accumulation (LS 174T human colorectal adenocarcinoma) at two or more time points (P > or = 0.07). In 2 of 15 (13%) ovarian carcinoma cell lines (OVCAR5 epithelial carcinoma and SKOV3 clear cell carcinoma), FDG accumulation was lower than that in the control cell line with the lowest FDG accumulation (HT-29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma) at one or more time points (P < 0.05).Most human ovarian carcinoma cell lines showed comparable FDG accumulations with control cell lines known to accumulate FDG. This study lays the foundations for further comparisons with other ovarian cancer cell lines and for other positron emission tomography tracers.
