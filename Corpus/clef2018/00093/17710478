Comparison of intrahepatic and pancreatic perfusion on fusion images using a combined SPECT/CT system and assessment of efficacy of combined continuous arterial infusion and systemic chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to compare intrahepatic and pancreatic perfusion on fusion images using a combined single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT system and to evaluate the efficacy of combined continuous transcatheter arterial infusion (CTAI) and systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced pancreatic carcinoma.CTAI was performed in 33 patients (22 men, 11 women age range, 35-77 yearsOn fusion images, pancreatic and intrahepatic perfusion was recorded as hot spot and as homogeneous distribution, respectively, in 18 patients (55%) and as cold spot and heterogeneous distribution, respectively, in 15 (45%). Patients with hot spot in the pancreatic tumor and homogeneous distribution in the liver manifested better treatment results (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Patients with hot spot both in the pancreatic cancer and in the liver survived longer than those with cold spot in the pancreatic cancer and heterogeneous distribution in the liver (median +/- SD, 16.0 +/- 3.7 vs. 8.0 +/- 1.4 months p < 0.05).We conclude that in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, CTAI with systemic chemotherapy appeared to be effective and may prolong their survival. The development of a reservoir port system allowing for the homogeneous distribution of anticancer drugs is necessary to improve the prognosis of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
