Surgery for medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy during early life. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in early life is often a catastrophic disorder with pharmacoresistant seizures and secondary neurological deterioration. there is little data available regarding epilepsy surgery performed in infants and young children and no prior study has focused on tle.We analyzed the results of temporal resection for epilepsy as the primary indication in children less than age 5 years who had at least 2 years of follow-up.20 children (14 males) were identified with a mean age at surgery of 26 months and a mean age at seizure onset of 12 months. Clinical presentation was diverse. Typical psychomotor seizures (n = 4 mean age at surgery 37 months) were followed by prominent motor changes (n = 7TLE presents in early life with varied and severe manifestations. Excisional procedures in this age group are associated with favorable seizure reduction similar to older children and in adults.
