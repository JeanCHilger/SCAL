The role of p53 in the trafficking of copper-64 to tumor cell nuclei. Copper-64 (T(1/2) = 12.7 h beta(+): 17.8%, beta(-): 41%) has applications in both positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and targeted radiotherapy of cancer. Copper-64 radiopharmaceuticals have shown tumor growth inhibition with a relatively low radiation dose in animal models
