Impact of dual-time-point (18)F-FDG PET imaging and partial volume correction in the assessment of solitary pulmonary nodules. Our aim was to assess the diagnostic potential of (18)F-FDG PET using partial volume correction and dual-time-point imaging in the assessment of solitary pulmonary nodules.We included 265 patients in this retrospective study (171 men 94 womenBiopsy and follow-up revealed 72 malignant lung nodules and 193 benign nodules. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the five criteria were as follows: (1) 97, 58 and 68% (2) 65, 92 and 85%Dual-time-point (18)F-FDG PET has potential impact on improving the diagnostic accuracy for malignant lung nodules. Dual-time-point (18)F-FDG PET imaging should be included in the clinical work-up of patients with pulmonary nodule.
