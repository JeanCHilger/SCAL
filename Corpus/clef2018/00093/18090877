Effects of enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) on myocardial perfusion. To evaluate whether enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) exerts an effect on myocardial perfusion.Eleven patients with angina were studied before and after 35 sessions of EECP treatment. Myocardial perfusion was quantified with positron emission tomography and intravenous 13N-ammonia at rest and after dipyridamole, by means of a two-compartment mathematical model.The results suggest that EECP has no effect on myocardial perfusion. However, because of the small number of patients in this study and highly variable clinical responses, additional studies are required to corroborate this finding. The beneficial effects of EECP appear to be mediated by other mechanisms.
