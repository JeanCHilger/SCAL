The detection of myocardial ischemia by thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy in patients with multiple coronary arterioventricular connections. The question of whether myocardial ischemia could be induced in 5 patients with multiple coronary arterioventricular connections by thallium-201 (201Tl) exercise stress myocardial scintigraphy was investigated. Both ST-T changes on ECG and transient myocardial perfusion defects in myocardial scintigrams were observed in 2 patients (40%). In previous reports, all multiple coronary arterioventricular connections, which were shown in angiograms, have been regarded as either Thebesian veins or embryonic sinusoids. However, it is unlikely that Thebesian veins cause myocardial ischemia judging from anatomy. If the vessels cause myocardial ischemia, they should be regarded as multiple coronary arterioventricular fistula. Angiography itself cannot differentiate multiple coronary arterioventricular fistula from Thebesian veins or remnants of embryonic sinusoids. Exercise stress myocardial scintigraphy has a high potential to detect myocardial ischemia due to intracoronary steal. Exercise stress myocardial scintigraphy was used to demonstrate myocardial ischemia in multiple coronary arterioventricular connections. It is concluded that exercise stress myocardial scintigraphy is a reliable test to differentiate multiple coronary arterioventricular fistula from Thebesian veins or remnants of embryonic sinusoids in clinical practice.
