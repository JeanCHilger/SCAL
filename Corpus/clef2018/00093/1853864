Anti-tick saliva antibody: a biologic marker of tick exposure that is a risk factor for Lyme disease seropositivity. Anti-tick saliva antibody (ATSA) has potential as a biologic marker of exposure to tick bites. In 1989, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 304 outdoor workers in Monmouth County, New Jersey, to evaluate associations between self-reported tick exposure, ATSA status, and Lyme disease antibody status. ATSA levels 1) were correlated with an index of tick exposure on the basis of three self-reported measures of tick exposure and outdoor hours worked per week (p = 0.01) 2) were consistently higher in pet owners compared with persons without pets (p = 0.03)
