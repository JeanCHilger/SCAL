Accuracy of 18F-FDG-PET/CT for staging of oral squamous cell carcinoma. This study prospectively assessed 2-[F18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET)/CT (PET/CT) in oral squamous cell carcinoma.Twenty-three patients completed preoperative TNM staging (CT, MR, whole-body fusion imaging PET/CT). In patients who underwent surgical therapy (19 of 23), TNM staging based on PET/CT scan was compared with pTNM.PET/CT correctly staged 16 of 19 primary tumors (accuracy 84.2%, sensitivity 84.2%, positive predictive value 100%) and correctly ruled out bone invasion in 3 patients with false-positive results according to CT and/or MR. PET/CT incorrectly identified neck involvement in 5 of 15 patients (3 false positives, 2 false negatives) who underwent neck dissection (accuracy 66.7%, specificity 76.9%, negative predictive value 83.3%). False-negative cases showed a nodal size not exceeding 10 mm. One patient with a bronchial synchronous primary tumor was identified.PET/CT scan showed good accuracy in determining the extension and/or depth of invasion of the primary tumor. Nevertheless, PET/CT was not accurate to rule out nodal metastases.
