A treatment selection protocol for recurrent ovarian cancer patients: the role of FDG-PET/CT and staging laparoscopy. To investigate the best diagnostic and staging strategy for recurrent ovarian cancer.The negative predictive value, specificity, positive predictive value, sensitivity, and accuracy rates of the fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positive emission tomography computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) and staging laparoscopy in identifying surgically treatable/untreatable patients are assessed in a consecutive series of 70 recurrent ovarian cancer cases. Moreover, the diagnostic performance of each staging procedure in the evaluation of the number of nodules is analyzed.The negative predictive value of the FDG-PET/CT was 83.3%, whereas the positive predictive value was 76.9%. Specificity was 55.6%, whereas sensitivity was 93.0%. Accuracy rate was 78.6%. Negative predictive value, specificity, positive predictive value, sensitivity, and accuracy rate of staging laparoscopy were 88.9, 64.0, 80.8, 95.0 and 83.1%, respectively. Combined radiological and laparoscopic evaluation showed a negative predictive value of 88.9%, a specificity of 59.3%, a positive predictive value of 78.8%, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and an accuracy rate of 81.4%. The number of nodules identified by FDG-PET/CT corresponded in only 23 patients (40.3%) at laparotomy, whereas 15 of 30 patients were correctly diagnosed (50.0%) by staging laparoscopy.The combination of FDG-PET/CT and staging laparoscopy has a significant effect on the multimodal approach to the population of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Such techniques should be considered complementary, because of the potential of each one to identify a different setting of the disease.
