Synthesis of porphyrin-appended terpyridine as a chemosensor for cadmium based on fluorescent enhancement. The design and synthesis of a porphyrin-appended terpyridine, 5-(4-([2,2':6',2'']-terpyridin-4-yl-carboxyamidyl)phenyl)-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrin (H(2)TPPTPy) and its application as potential fluoroionophore for recognition of metal ions are reported. For preparation of the fluoroionophore, a novel simple strategy with improved total yield has been applied for the synthesis of 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine-4'-carboxylic acid as a ligand. H(2)TPPTPy shows chelation-enhanced fluorescence effect with cadmium ion via the interruption of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process, which has been utilized as the basis of the fabrication of the Cd(II)-sensitive fluorescent chemosensor. The analytical performance characteristics of the proposed Cd(II)-sensitive chemosensor were investigated. It shows a linear response toward Cd(II) in the concentration range of 3.2x10(-6) to 3.2x10(-4)M with a limit of detection of 1.2x10(-6)M. The chemosensor shows good selectivity for Cd(II) over a large number of cations, such as alkali, alkali earth and transitional metal ions except Cu(II) and Zn(II). The sensor has been used for determination of Cd(II) in water samples with satisfactory recoveries.
