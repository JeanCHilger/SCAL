Transplantation of embryonic stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons in MPTP-treated monkeys. One of the target diseases of cell-replacement therapy is Parkinson's disease. Clinical experiences with fetal dopaminergic cell graft have shown that the therapy is effective, but limited and accompanied by side effects, such as dyskinesia. So, the therapy needs to be further improved and sophisticated. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are expected to be another donor cell for the treatment, because of its proliferative and differentiation capacities. For clinical application, experiments using non-human primates are important, because size, anatomy, and biological characteristics of the brain are different between rodents and primates. Here, we would like to discuss induction of dopaminergic neurons from monkey ES cells and cell transplantation into the brain of monkey Parkinson's disease model.
