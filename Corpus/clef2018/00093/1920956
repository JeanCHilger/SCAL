New analysis algorithm for regional cerebral blood flow and partition coefficient with dynamic SPECT and N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine: graphical plot method. We developed a new analysis algorithm based on multiple-time graphical plot to estimate the regional cerebral blood flow and partition coefficient using dynamic SPECT and N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP). By assuming the 2-compartment model of the kinetic for 123I-IMP, we derived a linear relationship between the ratio of the tissue activity concentration at the times to the time-integral arterial concentration at the respective times (formula see text) and the ratio of the time-integral tissue concentration to the time-integral arterial concentration (formula
