Immune response to rabies vaccine in Thai dogs: a preliminary report. Serum neutralizing antibody to rabies virus was determined in previously unvaccinated Thai pet dogs after receiving one subcutaneous dose of inactivated tissue culture rabies vaccine (Rabdomun, Coopers Animal Health Company, Germany, 4.55 IU ml-1 potency). Geometric mean titres on days 14, 30, 60, 180 and 360 were 2.14, 2.30, 0.45, 0.14 and 0.05 IU ml-1, respectively, by the rapid immunofluorescent focus inhibition test. Titres of neutralizing antibody to rabies virus did not correlate with the age of the dog at the time of vaccination or with the presence or absence of anaemia or blood parasites. Six out of 50 (12%), 11 out of 43 (25.6%) and 13 out of 31 (42%) dogs had no detectable rabies antibody in serum 60, 180 and 360 days, respectively, after vaccination. Three of these antibody-negative dogs were given another dose of vaccine. Antibody reappeared on day 14 but rapidly declined within 60 days. These data suggest that one dose of tissue culture vaccine in dogs by the subcutaneous route of injection is not adequate to maintain rabies neutralizing antibody in serum for 1 year.
