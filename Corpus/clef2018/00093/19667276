Early and late therapy response assessment with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma: analysis of a prospective multicenter trial. In adult Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) risk stratification after early therapy response assessment with [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) seems to allow tailoring therapy with less toxicity for patients with adequate metabolic response. This study delivers the first prospective data on the potential of FDG-PET for response assessment in pediatric HL.FDG-PET was performed in 40 pediatric HL patients before polychemotherapy (PET-1), after two cycles of polychemotherapy (PET-2), and after completion of polychemotherapy (PET-3). Mean follow-up was 46 months (range, 26 to 72 months).At early and late response assessment, the proportion of PET-negative patients was significantly higher compared with those patients with negative findings in conventional imaging methods (CIMs PET-2, 26 of 40 v CIM-2, one of 40Pediatric HL patients with a negative PET in response assessment have an excellent prognosis while PET-positive patients have an increased risk for relapse.
