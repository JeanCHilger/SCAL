The predictive value of incidental PET/CT findings suspicious for breast cancer in women with non-breast malignancies. On occasion, patients followed with positron emission tomographic (PET)/computed tomographic (CT) imaging for nonbreast malignancies will have incidental breast findings concerning for second primary breast cancers. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of PET/CT imaging to identify breast cancers in these patients.Patients with primary nonbreast malignancies and findings concerning for second primary breast cancers were identified from a prospectively acquired nuclear medicine database from January 2005 to July 2008. Chart reviews were then performed.Nine hundred two women underwent PET/CT imaging to evaluate nonbreast malignancies. Nine women (1%) had concerning breast findings, and 5 (56%) had subsequent breast cancer diagnoses. The positive predictive value of PET/CT imaging in these patients was 63%. Evidence of compliance with current screening guidelines was present in only 22% of these patients.The data suggest that findings concerning for an additional primary breast cancer should be evaluated and that age-appropriate screening tools should not be abandoned.
