Management of the neck after chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancers in Asia: consensus statement from the Asian Oncology Summit 2009. The addition of a planned neck dissection after radiotherapy has traditionally been considered standard of care for patients with positive neck-nodal disease. With the acceptance of chemoradiotherapy as the new primary treatment for patients with locally advanced squamous-cell head and neck cancers, and the increasing numbers of patients who achieve a complete response, the role of planned neck dissection is now being questioned. The accuracy and availability of a physical examination or of different imaging modalities to identify true complete responses adds controversy to this issue. This consensus statement will address some of the controversies surrounding the role of neck dissection following chemoradiotherapy for squamous-cell carcinomas of the head and neck, with particular reference to patients in Asia.
