Aspergillus fumigatus toxicity and gliotoxin levels in feedstuff for domestic animals and pets in Argentina. To evaluate gliotoxin production by Aspergillus fumigatus strains isolated from feedstuff intended for domestic animals and pets, and to determine the amount of gliotoxin in these substrates.A total of 150 feedstuff samples were collected. They were composed of 30 samples each of five different feed types (pigs, poultry, cattle, horse and pets). Aspergillus fumigatus gliotoxin production ability and gliotoxin presence in feedstuff was determined by HPLC. Aspergillus fumigatus strains were isolated from all of the tested samples. Strains from cattle, horses and pet food were able to produce gliotoxin. Corn silage samples intended for cattle did not show gliotoxin contamination. All the other tested samples had gliotoxin levels ranging from 29 to 209 microg g(-1). Horse and poultry feed samples had the greatest contamination frequency.Feed samples contaminated with gliotoxin are potentially toxic to animals.The presence of gliotoxin could affect animal productivity and health. Moreover, there are risks of contamination to farm workers handling improperly stored animal feed. Aspergillus fumigatus strains isolated from different sources should be investigated to determine prevention and control strategies.
