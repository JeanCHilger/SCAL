SPECT with 99m-TC HM PAO in the study of classical hemicrania. Five patients presenting with migraine attacks underwent Electroencephalography (EEC), Computed Tomography (CT) and Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc-HM PAO. EEG and SPECT were subsequently repeated in the intercritical period. We observed that: two patients only showed non-specific abnormalities in EEG scans were normal in all patients
