Low-level chemoluminescence as a marker of ischemic myocardial damage. The low level chemiluminescence of intact and ischemic tissue homogenate of rat and dog heart have been investigated with luminometry. The t-butyl hydroperoxide-induced photoemission is increased in ischemic state and strict differences may be determined between the intact and ischemic samples. The light burst is intensiver in the infarct vs. intact region. On the other hand, the subendocardial layers show higher chemiluminescence.
