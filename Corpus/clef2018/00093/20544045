Optimize your use of stress tests: a Q&A guide. Order exercise stress testing without imaging for patients with a low to intermediate probability of coronary artery disease (CAD), unless preexisting electrocardiographic (EKG) changes would render such a test nondiagnostic. Order stress testing with imaging for patients with preexisting EKG changes and/or a high probability of CAD. Do not use stress testing to screen asymptomatic patients for CAD. Consider pharmacologic testing for patients who are unable to exercise to an appropriate cardiac workload it has the same predictive value as a nuclear exercise stress test.
