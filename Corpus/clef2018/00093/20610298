Relationship between a chronically painful trapezius muscle and its metabolic state analyzed with PET/CT. The aim of this study was to investigate the intramuscular metabolic state in chronically painful muscles using positron-emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET/CT).The study included 140 consecutive noncancer subjects who underwent PET/CT screening for a physical checkup (mean age 56.0 +/- 10.22 y). The demographic data and information on pain in the neck/shoulder region were obtained using a questionnaire. The subjects who had an awareness of pain in the neck/shoulder region for >6 months were regarded to be pain subjects (n = 39). The minimal and maximal standardized uptake values (SUV) of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) of the trapezius muscle in each subject were automatically calculated.The unpaired t test revealed that both the minimal and the maximal SUVs were significantly lower in the pain subjects than in the asymptomatic subjects. A multiple linear regression analysis also demonstrated a significant association between pain in the neck/shoulder region and the SUVs in the trapezius muscle.Uptake of (18)F-FDG was lower in the chronically painful trapezius muscle.
