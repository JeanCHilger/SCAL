Relationship between aging and renal function: a positron emission tomographic study. Blood volume (V), blood flow (F) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) per 100 g (100 ml) of kidney were calculated with C15O, H(2)15O and 68Ga-EDTA, to study age-related changes per unit tissue in 19 subjects using positron emission tomography. Age was negatively correlated with V, F and GFR. The aging-related decrease in V was less marked than those in F and GFR. Analysis by regression formula induced that F, GFR for subjects in their 70s are 76%, 46% and 55% for those in their 20s, respectively.
