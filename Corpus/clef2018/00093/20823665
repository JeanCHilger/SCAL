Cardio-ankle vascular index for evaluating immunosuppressive therapy in a patient with aortitis syndrome. Aortitis syndrome is a chronic vasculitis that leads to arterial wall thickening and stiffening in large elastic arteries. However, there are no established markers for assessing arterial stiffening in aortitis syndrome. The cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) has recently been utilized to assess arterial stiffening that is associated with atherosclerosis-related diseases. We hypothesized that CAVI can be applicable for assessing alterations in arterial stiffness during immunosuppressive therapy for aortitis syndrome. A 69-year-old woman with a 2-month history of recurrent fever, fatigue, and malaise, showed intense 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake in the thoracic aorta and common carotid arteries in 18F-FDG-positron emission tomography. These clinical and imaging findings resulted in the diagnosis of aortitis syndrome. The patient also showed the elevated CAVIs on both sides (right, 10.3 left, 10.4) (normal value for her age, 9.1 +/- 0.8), indicating the arterial stiffness due to aortitis syndrome. The patient was treated for 34 weeks with immunosuppressive therapy, which included oral prednisolone and methotrexate. C-reactive protein (from 4.24 to 0.49 mg/dL) and immunoglobulin G (from 2,627 to 1,524 mg/dL) were decreased by 7 weeks after initiation of the treatment. The decrease in these inflammatory parameters suggests the effectiveness of the immunosuppressive therapy. In addition, after the 34-week treatment, the CAVIs on both sides (right, 9.3
