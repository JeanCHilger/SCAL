18F-FDG PET as a tool to predict the clinical outcome of infliximab treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: an explorative study. 18F-FDG PET is a sensitive, promising method for visualizing disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis. This study aimed to assess the association between changes in 18F-FDG joint uptake after 2 wk of infliximab treatment and clinical outcome.Scans were obtained at the initiation of treatment and at 2 wk. Uptake in metacarpophalangeal and wrist joints was quantified using standardized uptake values.Changes in mean standardized uptake value at 0-2 wk significantly correlated with the disease activity score (DAS) at 14 and 22 wk and contributed significantly to the prediction of DAS at these time points. No significant correlation was found between changes in acute-phase reactants at 0-2 wk and the DAS at later time points.Early changes in 18F-FDG uptake in joints during infliximab treatment of rheumatoid arthritis patients, using PET, may predict clinical outcome.
