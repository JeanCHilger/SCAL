Striatal and extrastriatal microPET imaging of D2/D3 dopamine receptors in rat brain with [¹⁸F]fallypride and [¹⁸F]desmethoxyfallypride. In this study, we compared two different D(2/3) receptor ligands, [¹⁸F]fallypride and [¹⁸F]desmethoxyfallypride ([¹⁸F]DMFP) with respect to the duration of the scan, visualization of extrastriatal receptors, and binding potentials (BP(ND) ) in the rat brain. In addition, we studied the feasibility of using these tracers following a period of awake tracer uptake, during which the animal may perform a behavioral task. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were imaged with [¹⁸F]fallypride and with [¹⁸F]DMFP in four different studies using microPET. All scans were performed under isoflurane anesthesia. The first (test) and second (retest) study were 150-min baseline scans. No retest scans were performed with [¹⁸F]DMFP. A third study was a 60-min awake uptake of radiotracer followed by a 90-min scan. A fourth study was a 150-min competition scan with haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg) administered via tail vein at 90-min post-[¹⁸F]fallypride injection and 60-min post-[¹⁸F]DMFP. For the test-retest studies, BP(ND) was measured using both Logan noninvasive (LNI) method and the interval ratios (ITR) method. Cerebellum was used as a reference region. For the third study, the binding was measured only with the ITR method, and the results were compared to the baseline results. Studies showed that the average transient equilibrium time in the dorsal striatum (DSTR) was at 90 min for [¹⁸F]fallypride and 30 min for [¹⁸F]DMFP. The average BP(ND) for [¹⁸F]fallypride was 14.4 in DSTR, 6.8 in ventral striatum (VSTR), 1.3 in substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), 1.4 in colliculi (COL), and 1.5 in central gray area. In the case of [¹⁸F]DMFP, the average BP(ND) values were 2.2 in DSTR, 2.7 in VSTR, and 0.8 in SN/VTA. The haloperidol blockade showed detectable decrease in binding of both tracers in striatal regions with a faster displacement of [¹⁸F]DMFP. No significant changes in BP(ND) of [¹⁸F]fallypride due to the initial awake state of the animal were found, whereas BP(ND) of [¹⁸F]DMFP was significantly higher in the awake state compared to baseline. We were able to demonstrate that dynamic PET using MicroPET Inveon allows quantification of both striatal and extrastriatal [¹⁸F]fallypride binding in rats in vivo. Quantification of the striatal regions could be achieved with [¹⁸F]DMFP.
