Peritoneal carcinomatosis. Cytoreductive surgery followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is now an established therapy with a curative option for patients with gastrointestinal and gynecological peritoneal carcinomatosis as well as for primary peritoneal carcinomatous tumors. Decisive for the prognosis is a complete cytoreduction, which in most cases necessitates multi-organ resection in addition to a partial or subtotal parietal peritonectomy (PE). The highest priority is given to maintain an adequate quality of life for the patient while performing maximum tumor resection. The morbidity following PE and HIPEC in experienced centers lies between 25% and 35% with a mortality risk of <5%. Consideration must be given not only to the technical surgical aspects and the intraoperative decision-making but also to the intraoperative management, intensive care therapy, pain therapy, management of complications, physiotherapy and many more. The greatest challenge in the management of peritoneal carcinomatosis is still patient selection. Computed tomography imaging together with (18)fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) plays an important role in the assessment of operability.
