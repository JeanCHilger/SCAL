Regional distribution of the opioid receptor agonist N-(methyl-11C)pethidine in the brain of the rhesus monkey studied with positron emission tomography. The regional distribution and kinetics in the brain of Rhesus monkeys of N-(methyl-11C)-pethidine have been studied by positron emission tomography, PET. 11C-Pethidine reached the brain with peak radioactivities appearing within 6-10 min. after administration. Highest radioactivities were measured in areas corresponding to the thalamus, the striatal area and also the lowest transection of the temporal lobes, with an uptake of 2.7-3.1 times the homogenous dilution of the radioactive dose. Low radioactivities were seen in the cerebellum and the occipital lobes. This distribution corresponds to the regional density of opioid receptors using in vitro binding techniques. The 11C-pethidine derived radioactivity left the brain with an initial half-life of 40-60 min., followed by an elimination which paralleled the plasma elimination of unlabelled pethidine. After pretreatment of the monkey with a small dose of naloxone, the radioactivities decreased about 40% in areas corresponding to the thalamus, striatum and lowest section of the temporal lobes, indicating competition for the same binding sites. By the use of a three-compartment model, it was possible to get an estimate of 11C-pethidine receptor binding characteristics in the brain. The ratio of Kon/Koff, equal to Bmax./Kd, was 0.06-0.1. This indicates that pethidine is bound with low affinity to the opioid receptors and is a poor ligand for studies of opioid receptor function with PET. Brain kinetics of 11C-pethidine is mainly determined by its blood kinetics.
