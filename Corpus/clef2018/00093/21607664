Cloning and expression of one chloroplastic ascorbate peroxidase gene from Nelumbo nucifera. A novel ascorbate peroxidase (APX) cDNA was obtained from Nelumbo nucifera (Elian). The phylogenetic analysis indicated that N. nucifera APX grouped together with chloroplastic APX of high plants. The recombinant protein expressed by PET-30a vector showed APX activity (0.04Â mM ascorbate min(-1) mg(-1) protein). The APX mRNA was expressed in young leaves, roots, terminal buds, and leafstalks. Synergistic expression of N. nucifera APX and MnSOD mRNA was indicated in the short-term response to mechanical wounding.
