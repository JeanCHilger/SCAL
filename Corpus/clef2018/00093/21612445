Revision surgery for incidentally detected early gallbladder cancer in laparoscopic era. Incidentally detected early gallbladder cancer (IDEGB) is an early carcinoma first diagnosed on microscopic examination after a cholecystectomy for symptomatic benign gallbladder disease. After diagnosis of IDEGB it is often necessary a completion of treatment by a second tailored revision procedure. Despite early reports contraindicating laparoscopic approach because of high risk of neoplastic seeding, recent data seem to demonstrate that this approach per se does not influence clinical outcomes. We refer our experience in revision surgery by a totally laparoscopic approach that includes hepatic resection, lymphadenectomy, and port-sites excision.From January 2006 to March 2008, four patients with IDEGB were carried out to revision procedure by a totally laparoscopic approach. The mean operative time of procedure has been 162 minutes, whereas blood loss has been <100 mL (mean 85.1±23.3 mL). The postoperative course has been uneventful in all patients and perioperative mortality (within 40 days from intervention) 0. Hospital stay has been, respectively, 4, 5, 5, and 6 days (mean 5 days). During follow-up, at the last fluorine-18-labeled fluordesoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan examination, respectively, 4, 3, and--for 2 patients--2 years after revision laparoscopic procedure, pathologic FDG accumulation was not reported.Totally laparoscopic revision surgery for IDEGC seems to be a legitimate procedure, and, in our experience, reports satisfactory clinical outcomes in terms of perioperative and middle term oncological results. Larger and prospective studies are needed to support definitively oncological safety of this approach.
