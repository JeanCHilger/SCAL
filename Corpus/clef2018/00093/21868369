Treatment of sydenham chorea with intravenous immunoglobulin. Sydenham chorea is a post-streptococcal, autoimmune, neuropsychiatric, movement disorder. There is no effective treatment. In a randomized study, comparison was made of the outcomes of 10 children treated with standard management alone compared to 10 who received additional intravenous immunoglobulin. The outcomes were assessed using a clinical rating scale, brain single-photon emission computed tomography, and the duration of symptomatic treatment. All three outcome measurement tools found improved outcomes in the group that received intravenous immunoglobulin.
