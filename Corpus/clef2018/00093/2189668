European multicenter study of TRUE Test, Panel 2. Panel 2 of the standardized, ready-to-apply patch test, the TRUE Test, has been evaluated on 808 patients with suspected contact dermatitis. The patients were tested with 11 different allergens and the negative control, and compared with corresponding allergens in pet. (or aq.) in Finn Chambers fixed with Scanpor. The TRUE Test, Panel 2 and the control were applied symmetrically on the upper back. Left/right application of the respective test varied at random. Most tests were removed after 48 h and evaluated after 72 or 96 h, according to generally accepted recommendations. There were positive test reactions to all 11 allergens tested in the patient group. The concordance of positive reactions (1+, 2+, 3+) was 63% between TRUE Test, Panel 2 and the control method 17% of positive reactions occurred only with TRUE Test, Panel 2 and 20% only with the compared method. Approximately 75% of all positive test reactions were explained by the patients' present or past history. Irritant/questionable reactions occurred in the same frequency for the 2 methods. Such reactions were recorded in less than 1% of all patches applied. No late reactions were recorded.
