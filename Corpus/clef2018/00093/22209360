Mapping serotonergic dysfunction in MDMA (ecstasy) users using pharmacological MRI. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) is a popular recreational drug that has been shown to induce loss of brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons. The purpose of this study was to determine the usefulness of pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) in assessing 5-HT dysfunction by examining the hemodynamic response evoked by infusion with the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor citalopram. We studied the effects of MDMA on brain hemodynamics using arterial spin labeling (ASL) based phMRI following a citalopram challenge (7.5mg/kg, i.v.), combined with [¹²³I]β-CIT SPECT imaging in ten male MDMA users and seven healthy non-users. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging was used to assess the availability of 5-HT transporters (SERT). Imaging results were compared with the results of behavioral measures and mood changes following drug administration, in both groups (using the Beck Depression Inventory, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and a visual analog scale). Reductions in SERT binding were observed in the occipital cortex of MDMA users. In line with this, citalopram induced decreases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the occipital cortex of MDMA users. ASL based phMRI also detected a CBF decrease in the thalamus of MDMA users. In concordance with imaging findings, behavioral measures differed significantly between MDMA users and controls. MDMA users had higher impulsivity scores and felt more uncomfortable after citalopram infusion, compared with control subjects. Our findings indicate that phMRI is very well suited for in-vivo assessment of 5-HT dysfunction.
