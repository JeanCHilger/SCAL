Positron emission tomography in psychiatric disorders. Positron emission tomography (PET) has been widely used in the study of psychiatric disorders. It has been used most extensively in research to determine pathophysiology as well as prognostic and diagnostic information, and response to various interventions in different psychiatric disorders. PET imaging has also been used in the clinical setting, although primarily to help differentiate or diagnose specific disorders. With the continued development of a large array of radiopharmaceuticals that can evaluate all of the components of different neurotransmitter systems (such as serotonin and dopamine), PET imaging will continue to play a key role in research and clinical applications for psychiatric disorders.
