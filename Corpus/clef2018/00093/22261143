Bombesin analogues for gastrin-releasing peptide receptor imaging. The present study describes the design and development of a series of new bombesin (BBN) antagonist peptide ligands of the form [(64)Cu-(NO2A-X-D-Phe(6)-BBN(6-13)NHEt)], where Cu-64=a positron emitting radiometal NO2A=1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic acid[NO2A-X-D-Phe(6)-BBN(6-13)NHEt] conjugates were manually conjugated with NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid), and the resulting conjugates were labeled with (64)Cu to yield [(64)Cu-(NO2A-X-D-Phe(6)-BBN(6-13)NHEt)]. The metallated and nonmetallated conjugates were purified via reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and characterized by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry.Competitive displacement binding assays displayed nanomolar binding affinities toward human GRPR for all of the newly formed peptide analogues. Biodistribution studies showed very high uptake and retention of tumor-associated radioactivity in PC-3 (a prostate tumor model known to express the GRPR) tumor-bearing rodent models. The radiolabeled conjugates also exhibited rapid urinary excretion and very high tumor to background ratios. Micro-positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging investigations showed clear visualization of tumors in female PC-3 tumor-bearing mice 15 h postinjection.The biodistribution and molecular imaging study suggests that these conjugates can be considered as potential PET tracer candidates for the diagnosis of GRPR-positive tumors in human patients.
