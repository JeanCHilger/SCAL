Varenicline increases in vivo striatal dopamine D2/3 receptor binding: an ultra-high-resolution pinhole [123I]IBZM SPECT study in rats. Ex vivo storage phosphor imaging rat studies reported increased brain dopamine D2/3 receptor (DRD2/3) availability following treatment with varenicline, a nicotinergic drug. However, ex vivo studies can only be performed using cross-sectional designs. Small-animal imaging offers the opportunity to perform serial assessments. We evaluated whether high-resolution pinhole single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging in rats was able to reproduce previous ex vivo findings.Rats were imaged for baseline striatal DRD2/3 availability using ultra-high-resolution pinhole SPECT (U-SPECT-II) and [123I]IBZM as a radiotracer, and randomized to varenicline (n=7 2 mg/kg) or saline (n=7). Following 2 weeks of treatment, a second scan was acquired.Significantly increased striatal DRD2/3 availability was found following varenicline treatment compared to saline (time‚Åétreatment effect): posttreatment difference in binding potential between groups corrected for initial baseline differences was 2.039 (P=.022), indicating a large effect size (d=1.48).Ultra-high-resolution pinhole SPECT can be used to assess varenicline-induced changes in DRD2/3 availability in small laboratory animals over time. Future small-animal studies should include imaging techniques to enable repeated within-subjects measurements and reduce the amount of animals.
