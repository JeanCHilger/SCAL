Pilot randomized controlled study of a histamine receptor inverse agonist in the symptomatic treatment of AD. We performed a clinical trial to evaluate the effects of the histamine subtype-3 receptor inverse agonist MK- 0249 on cognition in AD patients. Mild-to-moderate AD patients were randomized 1:1 to 4 weeks of double-blind daily treatment with oral MK-0249 5-mg or placebo. Pharmacokinetic and PET data suggested that MK-0249 5-mg daily would achieve approximately 85% brain receptor occupancy at Cmax in elderly patients. Primary efficacy measures were the short Computerized-Neuropsychological-Test-Battery (CNTB) summary score and ADAS-Cog score. A secondary efficacy measure was a Cognition Summary Score summarizing results from 7 cognitive tests. Of 144 patients randomized, 132 completed 4 weeks (MK-0249 = 65, placebo = 67). Most patients (88.2%) were on concomitant symptomatic AD treatment. There were no significant differences between treatments on primary and secondary endpoints at week 4: short CNTB summary score = 0.89 (95% CI: -0.74,2.52) ADAS-Cog score s -0.25 (95% CI: -1.61,1.11)
