11C]GSK2126458 and [18F]GSK2126458, the first radiosynthesis of new potential PET agents for imaging of PI3K and mTOR in cancer. GSK2126458 is a highly potent inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) with low picomolar to subnanomolar activity. [(11)C]GSK2126458 and [(18)F]GSK2126458, new potential PET agents for imaging of PI3K and mTOR in cancer, were first designed and synthesized in 40-50% and 20-30% decay corrected radiochemical yield, and 370-740 and 37-222GBq/Î¼mol specific activity at end of bombardment (EOB), respectively.
