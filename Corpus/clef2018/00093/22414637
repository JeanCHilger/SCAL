Multifunctional profiling of non-small cell lung cancer using 18F-FDG PET/CT and volume perfusion CT. The aim of this study was to investigate correlations between glucose metabolism registered by (18)F-FDG PET/CT and tumor perfusion quantified by volume perfusion CT and immunohistochemical markers Ki67 and microvessel density (MVD) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Between February 2010 and April 2011, 24 consecutive patients (21 women, 3 men mean age ± SD, 67.6 ± 6.8 yMean SUV, SUV(max), and the metabolic tumor volume (mL) were 5.8, 8.7, and 32.3, respectively, in adenocarcinoma and 8.5, 12.9, and 16.8, respectively, in SCC. Mean BF (mL/100 mL/min), mean BV (mL/100 mL), and K(trans) (mL/100 mL/min) were 35.4, 7.3, and 27.8, respectively, in adenocarcinoma and 35.5, 10.0, and 27.8, respectively, in SCC. Moderate correlations were found between the (18)F-FDG PET/CT parameters and Ki67 as well as between CT perfusion parameters and MVD but not vice versa. For all tumors, the following correlations were found: between SUV(max) and Ki67, r = 0.762 (P = 0.017) between SUV(max) and MVD, r = -0.237 (P = 0.359)(18)F-FDG uptake correlates with Ki67, whereas BF, BV, and K(trans) correlate with MVD. Therefore, (18)F-FDG uptake and perfusion parameters provide complementary functional information. An improved tumor profiling will be beneficial for both prognosis and therapy response evaluation in these tumors.
