Dopaminergic differentiation of neural progenitors derived from placental mesenchymal stem cells in the brains of Parkinson's disease model rats and alleviation of asymmetric rotational behavior. Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the mesencephalic substantia nigra and is accompanied by behavioral abnormalities. Pharmacological administration of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-dopa) improves the abnormalities in the early phase of the illness, but numerous adverse effects hinder long-term administration. Transplantation of fetal mesencephalic tissues has been suggested as an alternative to l-dopa treatment however, the use of human fetal tissues is controversial. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are capable of self-renewal and differentiation and are thus a promising substitute for fetal tissue for the replacement of diseased tissues or organs. Previously, this group isolated 17 independent MSCs from the first trimester human placenta (termed first trimester placental MSCs, or fPMSCs) and reported their successful in vitro differentiation into fPMSC-derived neural progenitors (fPMSC-NPs) (Park et al., Placenta 2011
