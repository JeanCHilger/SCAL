Exercise-induced silent myocardial ischemia in patients with vasospastic angina. To clarify the incidence and clinical characteristics of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with vasospastic angina, we performed exercise thallium computed tomography in 25 patients who had no significant coronary artery stenosis greater than 70%. Coronary artery spasm was documented by coronary angiography in all patients. Eleven patients (44%) developed exercise-induced perfusion defects, but only four of them had anginal pain (36%). Diltiazem (90 mg, administered orally) prevented the development of exercise-induced perfusion defects in all patients. Multivessel coronary spasm was documented by coronary angiography in 11 patients, and nine of them (82%) showed exercise-induced perfusion defects (p less than 0.05).(1) Exercise-induced myocardial ischemia was demonstrated in 44% of patients who had vasospastic angina without fixed coronary stenosis, and 64% of them were asymptomatic. (2) Patients with multivessel spasm had a greater prevalence of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia than those with single-vessel spasm.
