Phorbol diesters stimulate the accumulation of phosphatidate, phosphatidylethanol, and diacylglycerol in three cell types. Evidence for the indirect formation of phosphatidylcholine-derived diacylglycerol by a phospholipase D pathway and direct formation of diacylglycerol by a phospholipase C pathway. The effect of the tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), on phospholipid degradation was investigated in three cell lines of dissimilar origin, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK), rat aorta smooth muscle cells (RASM), and bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAE). In cells prelabeled with [3H]myristic acid, which is predominantly incorporated into phosphatidylcholine (PC), TPA treatment (80 nM) in the absence or presence of ethanol (2%) in the culture medium resulted in either the rapid generation of [3H]phosphatidate (PA) or the sustained accumulation of [3H]phosphatidylethanol (PEt), respectively. Increases in [3H]PA and [3H]PEt were paralleled by quantitative decreases in cellular [3H]PC radioactivity. TPA-induced [3H]PEt formation occurred in a similar fashion, irrespective of the presence of Ca2+ in the culture medium. The experiments demonstrate that TPA elicits PC degradation by phospholipase D (PLD) in cells of diverse origin. Data from further experiments revealed a complex relationship between TPA-induced [3H]PA and [3H]diacylglycerol (DG) generation in the three cell lines that was suggestive of dual pathways for the generation of [3H]DG. Experiments to discern the pathways for TPA-induced, PC-derived DG were conducted by comparing the variation of [3H]PA and [3H]DG formation in the absence and in the presence of increasing ethanol concentrations in the culture medium. With increasing amounts of ethanol, the formation of [3H]PA decreased at the expense of [3H]PEt formation, and depending upon the pathway operable, the amount of [3H]DG formed was either decreased, indicative of indirect formation of DG via PA phosphohydrolase, or not modified, indicative of DG formation by a direct phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. Increasing the concentration of ethanol in the medium blocked TPA-induced [3H]DG generation in MDCK cells in a concentration-dependent manner, while the formation of [3H]PEt increased at the expense of [3H]PA formation. In BPAE cells the presence of ethanol likewise reduced TPA-elicited formation of DG. Conversely, in two smooth muscle cell lines, RASM and A-10, ethanol was without influence on TPA-induced formation of [3H]DG, although [3H]PEt was generated at the expense of [3H]PA. In RASM cells prelabeled with [3H]choline, TPA induced the release to the medium of [3H]choline and [3H]phosphocholine, indicative of both PLD and PLC activation. These results show that TPA elicits DG formation from PC in MDCK cells predominantly by an indirect pathway, whereas in arterial smooth muscle cells DG is formed in part by the direct action of PLC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
