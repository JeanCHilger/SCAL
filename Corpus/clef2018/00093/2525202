Age-related decrease of 11C-N-methylspiperone in vivo binding to human striatum detected by PET. The effect of aging on 11C-N-methylspiperone binding to living human striatum was demonstrated using positron emission tomography. The 11 normal volunteers (22 to 72 years old) participated in this study. The uptake of 11C-N-methylspiperone in the brain following intravenous injection was highest in the striatum in individual subject. And the uptake in the striatum only gradually increased until the end of the study. The uptake of 11C-N-methylspiperone in cerebellum peaked within 10 minutes following injection and then rapidly dropped. The association rate constant "k3" was calculated from the slope of the radioactivity-ratio of striatum to cerebellum versus the equivalent time. The equivalent time was calculated from the radioactivity of cerebellum as an input function. The exponential decrease of the k3 value with aging was observed. The k3 value of the youngest subject (22 years old, male) was 0.035/min, while that of the oldest one (72 years old, male) was found to be 0.020/min. These data suggested that the dopaminergic activity through D2 dopamine receptors reduces with aging in human striatum.
