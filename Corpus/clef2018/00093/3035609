In vivo quantitation using SPECT of radiopharmaceutical uptake by human meningiomas. A single photon emission computed tomographic method was designed for the measurement of radiopharmaceutical uptake in brain tumors. Results of phantom studies showed a correlation coefficient of .99 when measured volume was compared with actual volume. The correlation coefficient for measured radioactivity concentration compared with the actual concentration was .97. In 13 meningiomas the correlation between in vivo SPECT measurements of uptake and in vitro measurements in samples of the same tumors removed surgically was .84 when two tumors that contained regions of necrosis and fibrosis were excluded it was .93. This method can be used for in vivo quantitative assessment of pharmacokinetics of labeled drug uptake in human brain tumors.
