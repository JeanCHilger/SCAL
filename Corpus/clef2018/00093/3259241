Single-scan Bayes estimation of cerebral glucose metabolic rate: comparison with non-Bayes single-scan methods using FDG PET scans in stroke. Three single-scan (SS) methods are currently available for estimating the local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (LCMRG) from F-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan data: SS(SPH), named for Sokoloff, Phelps, and Huang SS(B), named for Brooks
