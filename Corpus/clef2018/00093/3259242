Measurement of the ratio of cerebral oxygen consumption to glucose utilization by positron emission tomography: its consistency with the values determined by the Kety-Schmidt method in normal volunteers. The regional interrelationship between cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) and cerebral glucose utilization (CMRGlc) was studied in normal subjects using positron emission tomography (PET) and the 15O steady-state inhalation and the [18F]fluoro deoxyglucose method. The use of standard sets of rate constants and the model lumped constant of 0.52 as well as the regional blood-brain partition coefficient for water and the blood volume correction for oxygen extraction fraction provided a CMRO2/CMRGlc ratio of 4.89 in the cortical gray matter, 5.27 in the basal ganglia and 5.82 in the centrum semiovale (white matter). The values of CMRO2/CMRGlc for the basal ganglia and the white matter were consistent with those reported for the whole brain with the Kety-Schmidt method. There was no significant difference in the CMRO2/CMRGlc between the basal ganglia and the white matter indicating the similar nature of in vivo oxidative metabolism of glucose in neuron-rich region and glial cell-rich region.
