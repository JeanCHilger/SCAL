Semi-quantitative method of N-isopropyl-(123I)-p-iodoamphetamine accumulation in cerebrum: cerebrum to cerebellum accumulation ratio. Semi-quantitative method of N-isopropyl-(123I)-p-iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) accumulation in cerebrum by using 123I-IMP SPECT was tried. Ratio of counts in whole cerebrum to those in normal cerebellum was calculated, and this accumulation is defined as cerebrum to cerebellum accumulation ratio. In group of patients with dementia or patients who were remaining in bed, significantly low accumulation ratio was observed, while in "normal" group, no differences in sex and aging were observed. Calculation of cerebrum to cerebellum accumulation ratio was concluded as a useful method of evaluating the accumulation of 123I-IMP in cerebrum.
