Planar imaging of emission-computed tomograms of the left ventricular myocardium using 201T1 chloride. A new method of processing SPECT of 201T1 myocardial images is demonstrated based on the idea that 3-dimensional myocardium might be a curved area which can be presented in an unfolded form as a single planar image. An example of the procedure including parametric pictures is demonstrated.
