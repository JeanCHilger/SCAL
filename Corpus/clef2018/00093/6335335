Single-photon emission computer tomography of the brain in the clinical neurology. Using a new method of radionuclide diagnosis (monophoton emission computer-aided tomography), the authors examined 89 patients with vascular, inflammatory and sizable lesions of the brain and 16 clinically healthy subjects. The method was found to be valuable for obtaining a three-dimensional image of the pathological changes in the brain, for specifying the localization of these changes and their pathomorphological basis. The technique is particularly helpful when the focus is deeply sited and is adjacent to bone and other structures actively accumulating radionuclide where usual scintigraphy of the head and in some cases even computer-aided roentgenotomography prove insufficiently informative.
