Single-photon emission computed tomography of the normal liver. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a new imaging method that offers the advantage of cross-sectional imaging and improved contrast resolution as compared with conventional planar imaging. Preliminary SPECT studies of the liver for detection of metastatic disease are very promising. However, these studies indicate some potential pitfalls in the interpretation of the normal liver SPECT images. Experience with 58 tomographic studies obtained with a General Electric 400T rotating gamma camera is presented, with special emphasis on the areas of potential misinterpretation and on recognition of the normal anatomy as seen by this technique.
