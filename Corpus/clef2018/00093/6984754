SPECT (201T1) of the myocardium after experimental infarction. On the basis of an experimental model the extent was studied to which even small intramural myocardial ischemia can be demonstrated by SPECT. For this purpose ligature of the Ramus interventricularis anterior (n = 10) or of the Ramus circumflexus (n = 2) of the left coronary artery was performed in 12 dogs to produce myocardial lesions of the anterior and posterior wall. Transmission computed tomography (TCAT) served as a control method in 10 dogs showing that 6 lesions were transmural and 4 intramural. All infarctions could be detected by SPECT with a rotating gamma camera (TCAT: 9/10). TCAT after contrast media enhancement with its morphological advantages (high resolution) should, however, not be used in the acute phase of myocardial infarction because of its hemodynamic side effects. Thus, SPECT with 201T1 remains the method of choice even for the proof of minor intramural (acute) ischemic lesions.
