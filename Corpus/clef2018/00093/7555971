Induction of pseudoseizures with intravenous saline placebo. For a 2-year period, all patients admitted to the inpatient adult EEG videotelemetry unit of the University of Miami School of Medicine underwent attempted event induction with intravenous normal saline placebo. Of 175 patients monitored during that period, 101 underwent attempted placebo saline induction, whereas 58 patients were either in the pediatric age group, were undergoing a repeat hospitalization (i.e., depth electrode monitoring), or refused induction. The final diagnosis in each patient was established after review of the history physical, interictal, and ictal EEG findings
