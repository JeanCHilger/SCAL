Brain hypometabolism of glucose in anorexia nervosa: a PET scan study. Cerebral glucose metabolism was studied in 20 underweight anorectic girls and in 10 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers using positron emission tomography with (18-F)-fluorodeoxy-glucose. Both groups were scanned during rest, with eye closed and with low ambient noise. Compared to controls, the underweight anorectic group showed a global hypometabolism (p = .002) and an absolute (p < .001) as well as relative (p < .01) hypometabolism of glucose in cortical regions, with the most significant differences found in the frontal and the parietal cortices. Within the underweight anorectic and the control groups, no correlations were found between absolute or relative rCMRGlu and BMI, anxiety scores, or Hamilton scores of depression. Different factors might explain this reduction of glucose metabolism in anorexia nervosa. It might be the consequence of neurophysiological or morphological aspects of anorexia nervosa and/or the result of some associated symptoms such as anxiety or depressed feelings. Supported by cognitive studies, we can also hypothesize a primary corticocerebral dysfunctioning in anorexia nervosa.
