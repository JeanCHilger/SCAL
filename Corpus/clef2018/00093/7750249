Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis: absence of contact sensitivity to glucocorticoids, oestrogen and 17-alpha-OH-progesterone. Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is a rare condition, characterized by recurrent premenstrual exacerbations of a dermatosis, in which sensitivity to progesterone can be demonstrated. The sensitizing mechanism is unknown. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that cross-sensitivity between steroid groups could induce allergy to endogenous progesterone in these patients. 5 patients with autoimmune progesterone dermatitis and 1 with oestrogen-sensitive dermatitis have been patch tested with a corticosteroid series, conjugated oestrogen 1% in petrolatum (pet.), and 17-alpha-OH-progesterone 2% pet. There were no immediate or delayed reactions at 2 and 4 days to any steroid group. We have therefore been unable to demonstrate steroid cross-sensitivity, or a use for 17-alpha-OH-progesterone in the investigation of oestrogen - and progesterone-sensitive dermatoses.
