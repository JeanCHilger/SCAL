Patch test results with serial dilutions of nickel sulfate (with and without detergent), palladium chloride, and nickel and palladium metal plates. Clinical experience suggests the existence of different degrees of sensitivity in nickel-allergic patients. For quantification of this phenomenon, 462 consecutive patients with previously diagnosed or strongly suspected nickel allergy were tested with serial dilution patch tests with 5 ppm to 5% nickel sulfate in pet. (Ni), and 5 ppm to 1% nickel sulfate in pet. with 1% detergent (Ni/D). Additionally, nickel and palladium metal plates were tested in 103, and cobalt salts, dichromate and palladium chloride (PdCl2) in most patients. 332 patients reacted positively to Ni or Ni/D. The influence of a concomitantly administered detergent was not significant. A significant correlation was found between positive reactions to low concentrations of Ni (or Ni/D), i.e., 0.1% or less (N = 166), and concomitant reactions to nickel metal plates, cobalt salts and PdCl2 and a history of ear piercing with metal intolerance. The clinical relevance of reactions to PdCl2 is at present not clear. A subgroup of nickel-allergic patients with "high sensitivity" can be defined. In future studies further addressing the clinical relevance of high versus low sensitivity, patch testing with 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 5% nickel sulfate in pet. is recommended instead of routine tests with 5% only.
