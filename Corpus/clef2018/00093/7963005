Functional brain imaging and hearing. Functional brain imaging techniques such as PET, SPECT, and functional MRI have frequently been applied to the study of speech, language, and cognition, but have seldom been used in investigations of hearing. Even the limited research that combines functional brain imaging and acoustic stimuli has often been concerned with processes other than audition, such as attention. This paper provides brief descriptions of these currently available functional brain imaging procedures and gives examples of what may be learned about hearing from their applications. Possible reasons for the limited use of functional brain imaging in studying hearing are explored because attention to these issues may enhance interest in the use of brain imaging for investigating the neurophysiology of hearing. Several potential research questions that apply functional brain imaging while measuring psychoacoustic performance are considered briefly and strategies for increasing brain imaging research on psychoacoustic topics are discussed.
