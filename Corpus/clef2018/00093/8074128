Brain glucose metabolism in Alzheimer's disease. In vitro determination of brain glucose metabolism in the temporal cortex from patients with Alzheimer's disease showed a marked decrease when compared with nondemented, age-matched control subjects. Additional determinations on normal human temporal cortex obtained at autopsy demonstrated an age-dependent decline in the rate of glucose use. These data provide an in vitro correlate for positron emission tomography studies that suggest decreased brain glucose use in Alzheimer's disease.
