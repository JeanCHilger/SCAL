Acetazolamide effect on vascular response in crossed cerebellar diaschisis as measured by 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT. We studied the effect of acetazolamine (DIAMOXR) on vascular response in areas with crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) using consecutive 99mTc-hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) SPECT studies before and after DIAMOX administration with a subtraction method. Regions of interest were drawn over the bilateral cerebellar cortices and interhemispheric asymmetry indices (IAI) were obtained. Eleven of 14 patients with CCD at baseline showed decrease of IAI after DIAMOX administration. Although there is a possibility of underestimation of increase in perfusion in unaffected cerebellar hemisphere, this result suggests a greater increase in perfusion in the affected cerebellar hemisphere as compared with in the contralateral unaffected one and suggests more dilatation of the arterioles in areas with CCD post-DIAMOX than in areas without CCD. However nonsignificant correlation between IAI at baseline and difference of IAI from baseline to post-DIAMOX did not support the hypothesis of more dilatation post-DIAMOX of more constricted arterioles.
