Potbellied pigs. Miniature porcine pets. The potbellied pig was introduced into the United States in 1985 and has since become a desirable pet throughout the country. When seeking medical or husbandry advice, pig owners often seek the counsel of their local small animal practitioner. The practitioner may feel at a loss to adequately respond to requests for veterinary care because they do not remember pig medicine from veterinary school. Large animal practitioners, who have knowledge of the medicine and surgery of commercial pigs, often do not like caring for potbellied pigs because they are pets and not production animals. This article is intended to provide the small animal practitioner with some practical knowledge in the husbandry and medical care of the pet pig, also known as the yuppy puppy.
