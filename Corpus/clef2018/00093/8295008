Pinhole SPECT: an approach to in vivo high resolution SPECT imaging in small laboratory animals. The performance of pinhole SPECT and the application of this technology to investigate the localization properties of radiopharmaceuticals in vivo in small laboratory animals are presented.System sensitivity and spatial resolution measurements of a rotating scintillation camera system are made for a low-energy pinhole collimator equipped with 1.0-, 2.0- and 3.3-mm aperture pinhole inserts. The spatial detail offered by pinhole SPECT for in vivo imaging was investigated in studies of the brain and heart in Fisher 344 rats by administering 201TICI, 99mTc-HMPAO, 99mTc-DTPA and 99mTc-MIBI. Image acquisition is performed using a rotating scintillation camera equipped with a pinhole collimator projection data are acquired in conventional step-and-shoot mode as the camera is rotated 360 degrees around the subject. Pinhole SPECT images are reconstructed using a modified cone-beam algorithm developed from a two-dimensional fanbeam filtered backprojection algorithm.The reconstructed transaxial resolution of 2.8 mm FWHM and system sensitivity of 0.086 c/s/kBq with the 2.0-mm pinhole collimator aperture provide excellent spatial detail and adequate sensitivity for imaging the regional uptake of the radiopharmaceuticals in tumor, organs and other tissues in small laboratory animals.The resolution properties of pinhole SPECT are superior to those which have been achieved thus far with conventional SPECT or PET imaging technologies. Pinhole SPECT provides an important approach for investigating localization properties of radiopharmaceuticals in vivo.
