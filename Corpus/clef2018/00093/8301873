Clinicopathological correlations of visual depth perception in patients with cerebrovascular disease. Visual depth perception in 100 patients with cerebrovascular disease was evaluated using the Titumus stereotest. Twelve patients showed depth perception impairment. CT scans revealed that the lesion was located on the right hemisphere in 6 patients and on the left hemisphere in 3 patients, and that the remaining 3 patients had multiple infarctions. 123I SPECT was performed in 7 patients with moderate to severe depth perception impairment, of whom 6 patients showed a reduced blood flow in the posterior half of both the right and left cerebral hemispheres. Moderate to severe impairment of depth perception was more frequently observed in patients with a lesion in the right hemisphere or in the posterior half of either hemisphere.
