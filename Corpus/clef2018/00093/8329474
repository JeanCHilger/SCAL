Correction of attenuation in SPECT with an attenuation coefficient map: a new method. Attenuation coefficient (mu) maps, measured from transmission scan, are now becoming available. A simple method of attenuation correction is needed for routine implementation, however. Significant attenuation compensation can be mathematically obtained by dividing each actual pixel value of emission projections by the average of all the attenuation factors [exp (-sigma mu)] of all voxels along the same projection ray. This simple method, compatible with filtered back projection algorithms, was tested on simulations of cardiac and cerebral transaxial images on a Vax computer using the RECLBL library. In the models, the different structures received different activity and mu values. Three types of emission projections were generated: the ideal projections obtained by summation of the activity along each projection ray, the corresponding attenuated projections, and the projections corrected for attenuation. Comparison of projections on a pixel by pixel basis showed differences of less than 20% between the corrected and ideal projections. After reconstruction, both absolute and relative quantification were greatly improved by the correction of attenuation. Further validation of the method is in progress with actual patient data.
