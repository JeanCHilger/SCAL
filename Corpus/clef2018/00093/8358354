Preparation of [1-11C]dopamine, [1-11C]p-tyramine and [1-11C]m-tyramine. Autoradiography and PET examination of [1-11C]dopamine in primates. A method for no-carrier-added 1-11C-labelling of 3-hydroxy-, 4-hydroxy- and 3,4-dihydroxy-substituted phenethylamines is described. [11C]Dopamine, [11C]p-tyramine and [11C]m-tyramine were prepared from on-line produced [11C]nitromethane. Condensation of [11C]nitromethane with various protected and unprotected benzaldehydes was investigated. A one-pot two-step reduction of the substituted 11C-labelled nitrostyrene intermediates, gave after hydrolysis and reversed-phase semi-preparative HPLC-purification the corresponding labelled amines in a total radiochemical yield of 8-20% (based on [11C]CO2 and decay-corrected). The total synthesis time was 45-50 min with a specific radioactivity of 400-1000 Ci/mmol (15-37 GBq/mumol). The radiochemical purity was higher than 98% [11C]Dopamine was used for in vitro autoradiography on human post-mortem brain sections and for positron emission tomography (PET) on Cynomolgus monkeys. Autoradiographic examination of [11C]dopamine binding on human brain section post-mortem demonstrated specific binding in the caudate putamen and the substantia nigra, regions with a dense dopaminergic innervation. Some binding was also seen in the globus pallidum, nucleus ventralis of the thalamus and in nucleus dentatus of the cerebellum, regions where the dopaminergic innervation is very low. In PET examinations of [11C]dopamine binding in Cynomolgus monkeys there was a high uptake of radioactivity in the pituitary, the kidneys and the heart. Any passage of [11C]dopamine across the blood-brain barrier could not be demonstrated. In human PET studies [11C]dopamine has potential as a radioligand for examination of the myocardium, pituitary and kidneys.
