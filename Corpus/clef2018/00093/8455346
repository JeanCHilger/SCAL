Comparison between 180 degrees and 360 degrees data collection in 99mTc-Tetrofosmin SPECT of the myocardium. We compared 360 degrees data collection technique with 180 degrees technique in SPECT using a new myocardial perfusion imaging agent, 99mTc-Tetrofosmin. Eight patients were examined at stress and at rest on separate days. Following the injection of 555 MBq 99mTc-Tetrofosmin, 64 views of 15 sec each were collected during a 360 degrees rotation, and 32 views of 30 sec each during a 180 degrees rotation. The 180 degrees data collection provided superior images in sharpness in 14 of 16 scans. The interpretation was concordant in 123 of 128 regions (96.1%), and hypoperfusion was considered to be underestimated in 5 regions using the 360 degrees technique. It was suggested that the 180 degrees data collection technique is more effective in myocardial SPECT employing 99mTc-Tetrofosmin than the 360 degrees technique.
