Positron emission tomography with 4-[18F]fluoro-L-m-tyrosine in MPTP-induced hemiparkinsonian monkeys. PET imaging studies with 4-[18F]fluoro-L-m-tyrosine (FMT) in normal macaca monkeys showed selective accumulations of radioactivity in the striatum with time. In monkeys rendered hemiparkinsonian by intracarotid infusion of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), FMT uptake was eliminated in the lesioned striatum. FMT-PET studies were able to detect dopaminergic terminals in both normal and hemiparkinsonian monkeys, and clearly showed a reduction in aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) activities in the MPTP-lesioned striatum. These results show that FMT is promising as a PET tracer for the evaluation of central dopaminergic systems in parkinsonism.
