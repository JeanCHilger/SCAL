Identification of severe and extensive coronary artery disease by automatic measurement of transient ischemic dilation of the left ventricle in dual-isotope myocardial perfusion SPECT. This study sought to assess whether a transient ischemic dilation ratio, determined from automatically derived stress and rest left ventricular volumes during stress technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi/rest thallium-201 dual-isotope myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), is useful for the identification of patients with severe and extensive coronary artery disease.Transient ischemic dilation of the left ventricle on stress/redistribution thallium-201 scintigraphy has been shown to be a clinically useful marker of severe and extensive coronary artery disease. However, in practice, its assessment is highly subjective. This study automatically assessed the transient ischemic dilation ratio on the basis of a previously described algorithm to estimate three-dimensional ventricular boundaries.Normal limits for the transient ischemic dilation ratio were developed using data from 54 patients with a low likelihood (< 5%) of coronary artery disease, and criteria for abnormality were developed based on data from 97 who under-went catheterization, of whom 34 had severe and extensive coronary artery disease, defined as > or = 90% stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery or in two or more coronary arteries, and 63 had no coronary artery disease (15 patients) or mild to moderate coronary artery disease (48 patients). The criteria were then tested in a validation cohort of 77 additional patients who underwent catheterization, of whom 36 had severe and extensive coronary artery disease. The quantitative results of the dilation ratio were compared with the visual results of the dilation ratio and perfusion defect analysis.For normal limits, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that abnormal transient ischemic dilation ratio values corresponded to left ventricular endocardial volume ratios > 1.22 (mean +/- 2 SD). Transient ischemic dilation assessment using these criteria for abnormality showed high sensitivity (24 [71%] of 34) and very high specificity (60 [95%] of 63) for severe and extensive coronary artery disease. When the analysis was applied to the prospective catheterization group, similar sensitivity and specificity for severe and extensive coronary artery disease were observed (77% and 92%, respectively). Significant agreement (p = 0.0001) was found between the degree of transient ischemic dilation and the Tc-99m sestamibi defect extent, the latter assessed by semiquantitative visual analysis (summed stress score).The automatic measurement of transient ischemic dilation in dual-isotope myocardial perfusion SPECT is a clinically useful marker that is sensitive and highly specific for detection of severe and extensive coronary artery disease.
