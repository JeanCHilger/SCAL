Validation study in quantitative measurement of regional cerebral blood flow using N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) and SPECT. We validated following five methods to quantitate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using 123I-IMP and SPECT 1) microsphere method, which is based on a microsphere model using the SPECT image at five minutes after 123I-IMP injection with continuous withdrawal of arterial blood, 2) microsphere+ one-point sampling method, which is the same as the microsphere method except for using one-point sampling instead of continuous withdrawal, 3) conventional microsphere + one-point sampling method, which is the same as the microsphere + one-point sampling method except for using a later SPECT image corrected with the ratio of alteration of measured entire brain activity, 4) Table look-up method, which is based on a two-compartment model (influx
