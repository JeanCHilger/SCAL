Development of simple on-line [oxygen-15]water infuser. A [15O]water production and infusion system was newly developed for blood flow study with positron emission tomography. The system utilizes a electrostatic cooling unit to liquify [15O]vapor in a coiled plastic tube. Labeled [15O]water is collected into an infusion syringe by a wash of the trapping tube with saline. The system is simple and efficient the recovery rate of [15O]water is over 90% at 10 degrees C of cooling temperature.
