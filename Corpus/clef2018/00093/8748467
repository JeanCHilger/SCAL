A single photon emission computed tomography study of cerebral regional perfusion changes induced by a learning task in subjects with mild memory impairment. Fifteen nondemented subjects with memory complaints underwent serial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies with technetium-99m-d, l-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime (HMPAO) as tracer. Scans were carried out under a baseline conditions and during the learning phase of the Memory Efficiency Profile (MEP), a combined visual perception and memory task developed by Rey. Results indicate a positive correlation between activation, as indexed by HMPAO uptake, and neuropsychological assessment. Right temporal activation was correlated with MEP immediate recall. The right cerebellum was correlated with both MEP immediate and delayed recall. This study suggests that SPECT can show cortical activation during cognitive performance in subjects with mild memory impairment.
