Streptokinase increases luxury perfusion after stroke. Recent acute stroke trials have reported that intravenous streptokinase is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes. We aimed to study the effect of streptokinase on the nature of reperfusion and the relation between reperfusion and clinical outcome.We studied 24 patients in the Australian Streptokinase Trial with acute middle cerebral cortical infarction using 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission CT. Eleven of the 24 patients were scanned before therapy and again 24 hours later. The remaining 13 were scanned once either before therapy (1 patient) or after therapy (12 patients). All patients had outcome scans after 3 months. Infarct hypoperfusion was measured with a validated volumetric technique. Neurological impairment and functional outcome were assessed with the Canadian Neurological Scale and the Barthel Index, respectively.Fifteen patients received streptokinase and 9 received placebo. There was no difference in early reperfusion between streptokinase and placebo. However, streptokinase was associated with a greater amount of nonnutritional reperfusion than was placebo (P = .04). This luxury perfusion was associated with poor functional outcome (P = .02).This study suggests that streptokinase augments luxury perfusion after stroke. Luxury perfusion is associated with a worse outcome, which might be due in part to reperfusion injury.
