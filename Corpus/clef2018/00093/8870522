Brain imaging and behavioral outcome in traumatic brain injury. Brain imaging studies have become an essential diagnostic assessment procedure in evaluating the effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Such imaging studies provide a wealth of information about structural and functional deficits following TBI. But how pathologic changes identified by brain imaging methods relate to neurobehavioral outcome is not as well known. Thus, the focus of this article is on brain imaging findings and outcome following TBI. The article starts with an overview of current research dealing with the cellular pathology associated with TBI. Understanding the cellular elements of pathology permits extrapolation to what is observed with brain imaging. Next, this article reviews the relationship of brain imaging findings to underlying pathology and how that pathology relates to neurobehavioral outcome. The brain imaging techniques of magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography, and single photon emission computed tomography are reviewed. Various image analysis procedures, and how such findings relate to neuropsychological testing, are discussed. The importance of brain imaging in evaluating neurobehavioral deficits following brain injury is stressed.
