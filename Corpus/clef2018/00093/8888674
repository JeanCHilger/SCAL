Diastolic time during exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with myocardial infarction. The relation between diastolic time and myocardial perfusion defect redistribution of the infarct-related region was studied during upright bicycle exercise with thallium-201 scintigraphy in 37 patients with recent anterior myocardial infarction. In addition to the higher incidence of residual stenosis of the infarct-related artery, a disproportionate shortening of diastolic time in patients with myocardial perfusion defect redistribution permitted further reduction of subendocardial blood flow during exercise.
