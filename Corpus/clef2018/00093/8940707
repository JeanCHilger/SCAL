A review of new oncotropic tracers for PET imaging. We have developed three biochemical probes to determine if they are sensitive probes of early biochemical change in a tumor. All three probes appear to have the appropriate properties for in vivo imaging, but must now be evaluated as probes for the sensitive detection of changes in early malignant disease.
