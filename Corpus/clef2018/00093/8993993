Neuronal dysfunction in heart failure assessed by cardiac 123-iodine metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. In patients with chronic heart failure, increased sympathetic activity and cardiac sympathetic neuronal dysfunction are present and have been related to unfavourable clinical outcome. Modification of these alterations with the objective to improve prognosis has become an important aim of pharmacological therapy for these patients. A noninvasive technique to assess sympathetic neuronal function at the cardiac level may be valuable in evaluating newly developed therapeutic strategies. 123-iodine metaiodobenzylguanidine can be used to visualize cardiac sympathetic nerve function and activity. Single photon emission computerized tomographic is preferred to planar scintigraphy since it does not depend on superposition of other anatomical structures and may allow assessment of regional cardiac 123-iodine metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake. Although the quantitation of cardiac uptake in these tomographic images has several limitations, the use of the left ventricular cavity as a reference, calibrated by the 123-iodine activity in a blood sample drawn at the time of acquisition, may have clinical applications, with respect to the evaluation of therapeutical intervention in patients with heart failure.
