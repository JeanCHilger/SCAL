Correlations between SPECT regional cerebral blood flow and psychometric testing in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Thirty-nine patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) were studied with [99mTc]HMPAO SPECT and a standardized neuropsychological battery testing intellect, memory, attention, language, motor and praxis functions, and depression. Spearman rank correlations and multivariate regression analyses were performed to correlate quantitative regional perfusion deficits to these tests. Patients were found to have decreased perfusion of left frontal, parietal, and temporal regions relative to right. WAB repetition scores and bilateral temporal flow were significantly correlated (P < 0.01). Correlations between visual memory and bilateral temporal flow and those between Mini-Mental State/ Geriatric Depression Scale scores and bihemispheric flow approached significance. Although in this study regional cerebral blood flow was relatively insensitive to neuroanatomical abnormalities underlying specific cognitive deficits, it may have some specificity for identifying the language disorder in AD.
