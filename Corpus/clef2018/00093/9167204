18F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in neonatal acute lung injury measured by positron emission tomograph. The objective of this study was to evaluate positron emission tomography (PET) of [18F]fluorodexoyglucose (18FDG) uptake as a measure of neonatal acute lung injury. Inasmuch as intrapulmonary sequestration of neutrophils is a hallmark of acute lung injury, quantification of neutrophil activity using 18FDG may offer a novel, in vivo technique to examine the progression and resolution of this disease. Ten newborn piglets were studied: six received bronchoalveolar lavage followed by 4 h of high pressure ventilation of create acute lung injury. Four healthy piglets served as controls. 18FDG (0.8 mCi/kg 29.6 MBq) was given i.v. and PET (ECAT 953/31, Siemens) was performed for 90 min. During PET, all animals were sedated, paralyzed, and ventilated to maintain normal blood gases. The time course of radioactivity in lung regions and in plasma was used to calculate the rate constant for the metabolic trapping of 18FDG in tissue according to the method of C. S. Patlak. Median 18FDG influx constants were significantly higher in injured piglets (0.0187 min-1) than in control piglets (0.0052 min-1) (p < 0.01). Moreover, consistent with the 18FDG uptake data, injured piglets had moderate to severe injury on lung histology whereas control piglets had only slight and focal histologic changes. We conclude that PET of 18FDG uptake is an accurate, readily repeatable in vivo measure of neonatal acute lung injury.
