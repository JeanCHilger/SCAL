99mTc-pingyangmycin imaging to assess treatment response of patients with lung cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of functional imaging for the assessing of treatment response in patients with lung cancer. Thirty one patients were studied by 99mTc-Pingyangmycin (PYM) imaging. A region-of-interest technique was used in planar scan and the retention index (RI) was obtained to evaluate quantitatively the degree of 99mTc-PYM retention in the lesions. It was found that the RI was significant difference between responder (-5.01 +/- 4.97, -6.78 +/- 3.05) and nonresponder (4.38 +/- 2.13, 15.25 +/- 5.92, P < 0.05, P < 0.001) to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Significant difference was also seen between patients with stable disease (-6.07 +/- 8.45) and those with disease progression (12.66 +/- 5.23, P < 0.01) after surgical treatment. Repeated examinations showed good correlation between difference of pretreatment and posttreatment RI and reduction of tumor volume (r = 0.8959, P < 0.01). Therefore, RI can be taken as a predictive index in assessing tumor response to treatment and in monitoring lung cancer patients surgically treated.
