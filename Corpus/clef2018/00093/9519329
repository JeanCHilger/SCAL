Echocardiography and fatty acid single photon emission tomography in predicting reversibility of regional left ventricular dysfunction after coronary angioplasty. The present study was performed to evaluate whether echocardiographic assessment of end-diastolic wall thickness and myocardial fatty acid metabolic single-photon emission tomographic imaging with 123I-beta-methyl-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid could be used to predict the reversibility of dysfunctional left ventricular segments after coronary artery revascularization.Twenty-eight patients with wall motion abnormalities related to stenosed coronary arteries underwent resting two-dimensional echocardiography and 123I-beta-methyl-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid single photon emission tomography before coronary angioplasty. A dysfunctional segment was considered viable by the presence of either preserved wall thickness (> or = 75% of the thickness of a normal segment) or preserved fatty acid uptake (> or = 50% of that in normal region). Echocardiography was repeated after successful angioplasty. Functional recovery was observed in 32 (74%) of 43 hypokinetic and nine (100%) of nine akinetic segments with preserved wall thickness and in 11 (79%) of 14 thinned akinetic segments with preserved fatty acid uptake. In contrast, no functional recovery was observed in any of the 13 thinned segments with < 50% fatty acid uptake (eight akinetic and five dyskinetic). Using combined evaluation of both methods, positive and negative predictive values for post-revascularization functional outcome were 79% and 100%, respectively, in all dysfunctional segments and 87% and 100%, respectively, in akinetic/dyskinetic segments.The present study showed that echocardiographic findings of preserved wall thickness and single-photon emission tomography evaluated preserved fatty acid uptake in thinned segments are reliable predictors of post-revascularization functional recovery and the concordant absence of both accurately predict negative outcome.
