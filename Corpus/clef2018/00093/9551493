Chemical and physiologic brain imaging in schizophrenia. Technologic advances in functional brain imaging have provided exciting and informative insights into the functional neuroanatomy and neurochemistry of schizophrenia. Using MR spectroscopy, it has been possible to examine in vivo brain metabolism and to relate observed changes to physiological processes occurring at a cellular level. Positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography have revealed disturbances of cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism in patients with schizophrenia. More recently, these tools have also proved most useful in studying the relative receptor occupancy of typical and atypical antipsychotic medications.
