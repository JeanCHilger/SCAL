Nuclear cardiology, Part II: Scintigraphic evaluation of cardiac function. Different methods are currently available to assess cardiac function, especially left ventricular ejection fraction, using either planar or tomographic imaging, first-pass or equilibrium techniques, and blood-pool or myocardial perfusion agents. This is the second article of a four-part series on nuclear cardiology. In this article the authors review the most widely used radiopharmaceuticals and methodologies.
