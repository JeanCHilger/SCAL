Role of positron emission tomography using fluorine-18 fluoro-2-deoxyglucose in predicting improvement in left ventricular function in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Improvement in left ventricular (LV) function in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) by medical treatment has been suggested. Thus, it is important to evaluate which patients will respond to medical therapy. Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) and cardiac catheterization were performed in 20 patients with DCM before the initiation of medical therapy. The regional myocardial glucose utilization rate (rMGU) was measured with FDG PET. Subjects were divided into two groups, group 1 (event-free patients, n=10) and group 2 (clinical cardiac events, n=10). Haemodynamic and PET parameters before the initiation of medication were compared between the two groups and between patients with and patients without improvement in LV function. Ejection fraction (EF) was significantly higher in group 1 (35.8%+/-9.0%) than in group 2 (24.8%+/-7.0%) and LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was significantly lower in group 1 (8.4+/-1.7 mmHg) than in group 2 (11.6+/-3.5 mmHg). Average rMGU (mg min-1 100 g-1) was similar in group 1 (11.2+/-2.5 mg min-1 100 g-1) and group 2 (11.2+/-2.9 mg min-1 100 g-1), while %CV of rMGU was significantly lower in group 1 (11.1%+/-6.3%) than in group 2 (29. 9%+/-13.9%, P<0.01). Furthermore, LV function normalized in seven patients in group 1. In these seven patients, EF (35.1%+/-10.9%), LVEDP (8.2+/-2.0 mmHg) and average rMGU (11.8+/-2.7 mg min-1 100 g-1) were comparable with those in patients without LV functional improvement (EF: 31.6%+/-9.1% LVEDP: 10.7+/-3.3 mmHg
