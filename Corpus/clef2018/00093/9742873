Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and single photon emission CT in patients with olivopontocerebellar atrophy. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and single photon emission CT (SPECT), the cerebellum of patients with olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) and of age-matched control subjects was studied. A spectrum was collected from a 27 cm3 (3 x 3 x 3 cm) voxel in the cerebellum containing white and gray matters in order to measure the distribution and relative signal intensities of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cre) and choline (Cho). In the cerebellum of the patients with OPCA, mean NAA/Cre ratios for OPCA patients were significantly decreased compared with normal control subjects (OPCA, 1.01 +/- 0.247 controls, 1.526 +/- 0.144: p < 0.001). Mean NAA/Cho ratios for OPCA patients were slightly decreased (OPCA, 1.285 +/- 0.228
