Functional connectivity in depressive, obsessive-compulsive, and schizophrenic disorders: an explorative correlational analysis of regional cerebral metabolism. In order to investigate the changes in functional relationships between brain regions in three psychiatric disorders, an exploratory statistical analysis of the regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rCMRglu) obtained with positron emission tomography (PET) was performed. Correlations between various rCMRglu were computed in control, depressive, obsessive-compulsive, and schizophrenic groups to determine whether alterations of the correlation pattern were found in the psychiatric groups. The absence of correlation between left and right frontal lobes was common to the three psychiatric groups studied. Depressive patients recovered a better frontal interhemispheric coupling after successful treatment and the alterations in the depressed state also involved the relation between the right temporal cortex and the right thalamus. Obsessive-compulsive patients had not only lateral frontal dysfunction but also alterations in the functional relationships between cortex and thalami. In schizophrenic patients, the modifications of regional cerebral metabolic correlations involved both anterior and posterior cortical regions. Thus, although the relationship between left and right frontal lobes was altered in three psychiatric disorders, the pattern of functional connectivity between frontal regions, posterior cortical and subcortical regions differed depending on the diagnostic group.
