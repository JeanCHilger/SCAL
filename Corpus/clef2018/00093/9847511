Quantification of cerebral blood flow with 99mTc-ECD SPECT based on a 3-compartment model. In the present study we developed a method for quantifying regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using 99mTc-ECD SPECT based on a 3-compartment model. The dynamic SPECT scanning and sequential sampling of arterial blood were performed on 12 subjects with cerebrovascular diseases and etc. We defined brain fractionation index (BFI) as a parameter of rCBF, which was obtained from a single SPECT data and arterial input. The relationship between the values of BFI and rCBF obtained by the 133Xe inhalation method was analyzed by approximation with exponential function. In this method, rCBF was calculated from the values of BFI using the inverse function of the exponential function as a regression curve. The method was applied seven other patients with cerebrovascular diseases and the values of rCBF were compared with those obtained by the 133Xe inhalation method. We observed a good correlation (r = 0.854), and the inclination was approximately 1. This method can be applied to not only large field SPECT cameras but also conventional SPECT cameras.
