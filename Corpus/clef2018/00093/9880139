Comparative value of thallium and glucose SPECT imaging in childhood brain tumors. Thallium-201 chloride (201Tl) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) detects a high percentage of histologically and anatomically diverse pediatric brain tumors. Thallium-201 chloride SPECT and F-18 fluoro-deoxy-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) are the most commonly used radionuclide techniques in neuro-oncology. Having developed a methodology to image 18F-FDG with SPECT, the authors performed SPECT scans coupled with magnetic resonance imaging to assess the comparative sensitivity of 201Tl and 18F-FDG in 19 children with brain tumors. Tumors were detected using 201Tl SPECT in 14 of 19 patients. Five of five postoperative residual tumors were detected by 201Tl SPECT, and six of seven after irradiation recurrences were detected. F-18 fluoro-deoxy-glucose SPECT detected tumors in only three of 19 patients, all of whom had abnormal 201Tl studies (all three after therapy recurrences). Thallium-201 chloride SPECT could be interpreted in 18 of 19 patients without magnetic resonance imaging confirmation, but none of the 19 18F-FDG SPECT studies could be interpreted without magnetic resonance imaging. Thallium-201 chloride SPECT is more sensitive than 18F-FDG SPECT in the detection of primary or recurrent childhood brain tumors. The failure of 18F-FDG SPECT in follow-up after therapy is primarily a problem of limited fluoro-deoxy-glucose uptake, not spatial resolution. Thallium-201 chloride SPECT is a promising imaging modality in neuro-oncology.
