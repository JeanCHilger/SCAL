Liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer: assessing the risk of occult irresectable disease. Liver resection is standard therapy for selected patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Extrahepatic metastases and inability to remove all hepatic disease usually preclude curative resection and are the most common contraindications. This study analyzes irresectability in patients considered to have resectable disease taken to operation for potentially curative hepatic resection. We describe preoperative factors associated with irresectability and propose a preoperative scoring system that identifies patients at particularly high risk for occult irresectable disease.Patients considered to have resectable hepatic colorectal metastases were identified from a prospective database. Intraoperative findings that precluded liver resection were recorded. Demographic data, characteristics of the primary tumor, and characteristics of the hepatic metastases were recorded and analyzed.From April 1992 through July 1997, 416 patients were explored with the intention of performing a potentially curative liver resection 329 (79%) were resected. Eighty-seven patients (21%) had apparently resectable tumors on preoperative imaging but irresectable disease at laparotomy. Forty-four patients (51%) had irresectable disease limited to the liverStandard preoperative investigations predicted resectability in 79% of patients with hepatic colorectal metastases. Unresectable disease limited to the liver and extrahepatic disease were seen with nearly equal frequency. The majority of patients with extrahepatic metastases had resectable hepatic disease (31 of 43, 72%). A preoperative scoring system is proposed that identifies patients at high risk for unrecognized irresectable disease and may help focus the use of additional diagnostic modalities such as laparoscopy and positron emission tomography (PET).
