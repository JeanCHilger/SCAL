Effect of clot removal and surgical manipulation on regional cerebral blood flow and delayed vasospasm in early aneurysm surgery for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Effect of clot removal and surgical manipulation on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and delayed vasospasm was studied in early aneurysm surgery for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).Thirty-two patients in this study fulfilled the following criteria: ruptured anterior communicating aneurysms, computed tomography (CT) within 2 days and unilateral pterional approach within 3 days after the ictus, bilaterally symmetrical clots without intracerebral hematoma, no postoperative complication, and CBF studies with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 123I-IMP.Postoperative regional hypoperfusion due to brain retraction was frequently recognized on 123I-IMP-SPECT without infarction. The regional CBF (rCBF) showed a continuous fall during the first 4 weeks after the ictus, followed by improvement. The rCBF in the vicinity of the surgical route was significantly lower, especially in the acute stage (Day 3-7). A significant association between decrease of cisternal blood after surgery and the degree of local vasospasm and local CBF values during spasm stage was observed in the interhemispheric cisterns, A2 and medial frontal cortex, but not in the sylvian fissure or insular cisterns, M1 or M2, and frontal watershed and temporal cortex.The present study provides evidence for the effectiveness of direct clot removal by early surgery for SAH on local vasospasm and CBF reduction. However, a potential improvement in local CBF with clot removal could be masked by brain retraction, which was demonstrated to affect rCBF adversely. Therefore, it is critical to perform brain retraction as gently as possible.
