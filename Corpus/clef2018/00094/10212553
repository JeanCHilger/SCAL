Assessing the machinery of mind: synapses in neuropsychiatric disorders. Neural connectivity in postmortem human brain can now be studied with the use of antibodies that react with synapse-enriched proteins. Using a range of antibody-based techniques, the authors observed abnormalities in connectivity in Alzheimer's disease, temporal lobe epilepsy, and schizophrenia. They also found disease-related differences in the individual protein markers affected and in the anatomical distribution of differences from controls. Molecular and cellular abnormalities in neural connectivity may underlie functional abnormalities observed in vivo using positron emission tomography or functional magnetic resonance imaging.
