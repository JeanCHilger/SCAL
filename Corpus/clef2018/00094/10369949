Reverse redistribution on thallium-201 single-photon emission tomography after primary angioplasty: a one-year follow-up study. The prognostic significance of reverse redistribution (RR) on thallium-201 single-photon emission tomography (SPET) images after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has not been studied in detail. Moreover, RR data in patients treated with primary angioplasty are lacking. Fifty consecutive patients (including 40 men with a mean age of 54+/-11 years) with a first AMI were treated with primary angioplasty and followed up for 13+/-5 months for the following end-points: death, reinfarction and recurrent angina requiring revascularisation. Admission and peak creatine kinase myocardial enzyme (CKMB) and ejection fraction (EF) at discharge were studied as markers of myocardial damage. Thallium-201 stress-redistribution SPET studies at 1 month were analysed using a 13-segment, 4-point scoring system. Segments showing a worsening of perfusion by at least 1 point on redistribution studies were defined as showing RR. RR was present in 13 (26%) patients (group 1) and absent in 37 (74%) (group 2). Both groups were comparable for age, sex, peak CKMB release, EF and Q-wave myocardial infarctions. TIMI flow 3 was obtained in 92% in group 1 and 95% in group 2 (P = 0.95). On admission, CKMB was significantly lower in group 1 (18+/-14 vs 44+/-41 U/l, P = 0.03). Also, segments showing reversible perfusion were significantly more frequent in group 2 (1/169 vs 57/481, P = 0. 01). During follow-up, no death occurred and the combined documented endpoint of reinfarction and recurrent angina requiring angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting was significantly more frequently reached in group 2 (0/13 vs 10/37, P = 0.046). In conclusion, RR is common (26%) after primary angioplasty for a first AMI and is associated with lesser myocardial damage on admission. Patients with RR rarely have reversible segments on 201Tl SPET and tend to have a favourable outcome after 1 year of follow-up.
