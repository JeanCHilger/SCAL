Dobutamine stress thallium-201 single-photon emission tomography versus echocardiography for evaluation of the extent and location of coronary artery disease late after myocardial infarction. Dobutamine stress echocardiography and thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy are clinically useful methods for the evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the relative merits of these imaging modalities in the evaluation of the extent of CAD after myocardial infarction have not been well studied. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of dobutamine stress echocardiography and simultaneous 201Tl single-photon emission tomography (SPET) imaging for the diagnosis and localization of CAD late after acute myocardial infarction. Dobutamine (up to 40 micrograms kg-1 min-1)-atropine (up to 1 mg) stress echocardiography in conjunction with stress-reinjection 201Tl SPET was performed for the evaluation of myocardial ischaemia in 90 patients with previous myocardial infarction who underwent coronary angiography. Significant CAD was predicted on bases of myocardial ischemia (new or worsening wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography and reversible perfusion defects on 201Tl SPET). Significant CAD (> or = 50% luminal diameter stenosis) was detected in 73 (81%) patients. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of echocardiography in detecting remote ischaemia for the diagnosis of remote CAD (present in 53 patients) were, respectively, 79% (CI 70%-88%), 85% (CI 77%-93%) and 81% (CI 73%-90%), while the corresponding figures for 201Tl SPET were 75% (CI 66%-85%), 78% (CI 69%-87%) and 76% (CI 67%-86%) respectively (P = NS vs echocardiography). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of echocardiography in detecting peri-infarction ischaemia for the diagnosis of infarct-related artery stenosis (present in 70 patients) were, respectively, 77% (CI 68%-86%), 85% (CI 78%-92%) and 79% (CI 70%-87%) while the corresponding figures for 201Tl SPET were 73% (CI 64%-82%), 85% (CI 78%-92%) and 76% (CI 67%-84%) respectively (P = NS vs echocardiography). The agreement between the two methods for the diagnosis of peri-infarction and remote ischaemia was 70% (kappa = 0.37) and 80% (kappa = 0.59) respectively. It is concluded that dobutamine stress echocardiography and 201Tl SPET have comparable accuracy for the diagnosis of infarct related and remote CAD in patients with previous myocardial infarction. The agreement between the methods is higher for the diagnosis of remote CAD than for that of peri-infarction ischaemia.
