Allogeneic vascularized transplantation in cases of bone and joint defects. This paper presents preliminary results of allogeneic vascularized transplantations of three femoral diaphyses and four total human knee joints. Grafts were harvested from multi-organ-donors and immediately transplanted. Osteosyntheses were performed employing intramedullary nails. Vascular pedicles of the grafts were anastomosed in end-to-side technique. Immunosuppression mainly based on Cyclosporine and Azathioprine. Grafts' perfusion was demonstrated by DSA and Duplex-sonograms, bone metabolism by SPECT-scintigraphy. Five months following transplantation osteotomies demonstrated consolidation in conventional X-rays. Biopsies of the grafted bone revealed intact osteocytes and arthroscopy demonstrated intact synovial, chondral and ligamentous structures. From the technical aspect vascularized transplantation of the femoral diaphyses and total knee joints is feasible. The main problems are of immunologic nature. Transplantations were performed respecting the ABO-compatibility but with a large HLA-mismatch. Acute and chronic rejection crises may damage the grafts. At least in synovial joints live-long immunosuppression of the recipients seems to be unavoidable.
