Relationship between brain electrical activity and cortical perfusion in normal subjects. Cerebral glucose uptake and perfusion are accepted as tightly coupled measures of energy utilization in both normal and diseased brain. The coupling of brain electrical activity to perfusion has been demonstrated, however, only in the presence of chronic brain disease. Very few studies have examined the relationship between cerebral electrical activity and energy utilization in normal brain tissue. To clarify this relationship, we performed 33 H2(15)O-positron emission tomography (PET) scans in six normal subjects both at rest and during a simple motor task, and acquired surface-recorded quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) data simultaneously with isotope injection. We examined the associations between cerebral perfusion directly underlying each recording electrode and three QEEG measures (absolute power, relative power, and cordance). All EEG measures had moderately strong coupling with perfusion at most frequency bands, although the directions of the associations differed from those previously reported in subjects with stroke or dementia. Of the three QEEG measures examined, cordance had the strongest relationship with perfusion (multiple R2 = 0.58). Cordance and PET were equally effective in detecting lateralized activation associated with the motor task, while EEG power did not detect this activation. Electrodes in the concordant state had a significantly higher mean perfusion than those in the discordant state. These results indicate that normal brain electrical activity has a moderately strong association with cerebral perfusion. Cordance may be the most useful QEEG measure for monitoring cerebral perfusion in subjects without chronic brain disease.
