A Phase I trial of bryostatin-1 in children with refractory solid tumors: a Pediatric Oncology Group study. Bryostatin-1, a macrocyclic lactone, appears to elicit a wide range of biological responses including modulation of protein kinase C (PKC). PKC, one of the major elements in the signal transduction pathway, is involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, gene expression, and tumor promotion. Because of the potential for a unique mechanism of interaction with tumorgenesis, a Phase I trial of bryostatin-1 was performed in children with solid tumors to: (a) establish the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) (b) establish the pharmacokinetic profile in children
