Perception and conception: separate memory systems in the medial temporal lobe. The purpose of the present study was to investigate, by using positron emission tomography, whether the functionally different types of information are subserved by different memory systems in human medial temporal lobe structures. Before explicit retrieval tests during scans, subjects studied words in perceptually and conceptually processed manners separately. It was found that different parts of the medial temporal lobe structures were involved in each of the different conditions. These results indicated that perceptually and conceptually processed types of information were subserved by at least two partially segregated memory systems in human medial temporal lobe structures.
