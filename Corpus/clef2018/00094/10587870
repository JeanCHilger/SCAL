Optimal injection protocol for CT evaluation during hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy. As an imaging modality for follow-up during continuous or repeated hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy using a hepatic intra-arterial indwelling catheter, the usefulness of CT while infusing contrast through the indwelling catheter (reservoir port) was examined.Using reservoir ports implanted in eight patients with hepatic metastasis from colon cancer, radioisotope perfusion scintigraphy (RI), CT (three rates of infusion of contrast were used), and digital subtraction angiography (AG) were performed to compare the modalities' ability to visualize the intrahepatic and abnormal extrahepatic distributions.CT (infusion rate 0.1 mL/sec) was superior to AG and RI in terms of the ability to visualize intrahepatic distribution, particularly in small areas, and facilitated 3D delineation of the distribution. In evaluating extrahepatic distribution, CT also outperformed the other modalities.For imaging study follow-up during hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, CT proved to be more useful than conventional RI and AG.
