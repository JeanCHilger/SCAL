Present status of PET images: clinical FDG PET in oncology. The clinical application of positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG PET) in the field of cancer diagnosis is expanding rapidly. FDG PET has been proven to be a clinically useful tool for the detection and staging of malignant tumors, differentiation of mass lesions, and follow-up and monitoring of malignant diseases after treatment. Several factors relating to the clinical spread of FDG PET, including the simplification of FDG production, establishment of an FDG delivery system, shortening of the data acquisition time for whole body imaging, development of a coincidence gamma camera, and reimbursement from medical insurance, are reviewed and discussed in this article. PET oncology currently has greater potential as a result of the development of new radiopharmaceuticals based on the tumor characteristics of biochemical and genetic processes. The recent development of clinical FDG PET might be simply a stepping stone for the development of more advanced PET oncology in the near future.
