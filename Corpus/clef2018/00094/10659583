Assessment of regional quantitative analysis by ECG-gated myocardial SPECT after coronary artery bypass surgery. ECG-gated myocardial SPECT (G-SPECT) was performed before and after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) to investigate how this operation would affect the assessment of regional quantitative analyses.Nineteen patients with coronary artery disease underwent G-SPECT before and 1 month after uncomplicated CABG. 99mTc-MIBI 740 MBq was injected at rest, then G-SPECT was performed 60 min later. Regional ejection fraction (rEF), wall motion (WM), systolic wall thickening (WT) and % tracer uptake were evaluated by quantitative gated SPECT program (QGS). Parameters were obtained quantitatively in 16 segments based on the functional bull's eye map.Percent tracer uptake increased in septum from 75 +/- 11% to 78 +/- 11% (p < 0.001), while WT did not change (40 +/- 19% to 41 +/- 20%) after CABG. However, in septum rEF decreased from 17 +/- 13% to 6 +/- 9% (p < 0.001) and WM decreased in septum from 1.6 +/- 1.1 mm to 0.6 +/- 0.9 mm (p < 0.001).Significant reduction of rEF and WM despite of no deterioration of WT and % tracer uptake suggested that rEF and WM were affected by pseudoparadoxical asynergy after uncomplicated CABG. For the evaluation of regional function after CABG by G-SPECT, WT might be the preferred parameter.
