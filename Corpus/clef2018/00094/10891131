PhSeSiR(3)-Catalyzed Group Transfer Radical Reactions. A novel design for initiating radical-based chemistry in a catalytic fashion is described. The design of the concept is based on the phenylselenyl group transfer reaction from alkyl phenyl selenides by utilizing PhSeSiR(3) (1) as a catalytic reagent. The reaction is initiated by the homolytic cleavage of -C-Se- bond of an alkyl phenyl selenide by the in situ generated alkylsilyl radical (R(3)Si(*)), obtained by the mesolysis of PhSeSiR(3)](*)(-)( )()(1(*)(-)). The oxidative dimerization of counteranion PhSe(-) to PhSeSePh functions as radical terminator. The generation of 1(*)(-) is achieved by the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) promoted reductive activation of 1 through a photosystem comprising of a visible-light (410 nm)-absorbing electron rich DMA as an electron donor and ascorbic acid as a co-oxidant (Figure 1). The optimum mole ratio between the catalyst 1 and alkyl phenyl selenides for successful reaction is established to be 1:10. The generality of the concept is demonstrated by carrying out variety of radical reactions such as cyclization (10, 15-18), intermolecular addition (25), and tandem annulations (32).
