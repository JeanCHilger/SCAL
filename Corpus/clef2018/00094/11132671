Evidence of Bartonella henselae infection in cats and dogs in the United Kingdom. Sera from cats and dogs in the UK were tested by ELISA for antibodies to Bartonella henselae. Seropositivity was confirmed in 28 of 69 pet cats (40.6 per cent), 33 of 79 feral cats (41.8 per cent) and three of 100 pet dogs. Reactivity to specific B. henselae antigens was confirmed by Western blotting and demonstrated that consistent antigenic bands were bound by sera from the cats and dogs.
