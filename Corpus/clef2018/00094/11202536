Regulation of the compounding of positron emission tomography drugs. Controversial aspects of the regulatory framework for compounding drug products used in positron emission tomography (PET) are discussed. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA), which amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), required that FDA establish approval (new drug application [NDA] and abbreviated new drug application [ANDA]) procedures and current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements for PET drugs this seems to conflict with differentiation between manufacturing and compounding in FFDCA. Compounding by pharmacists is implied in the FDAMA section on PET, but specific mention of "pharmacist" needs to be included. Congress apparently did not intend for compounded PET drugs to be regulated differently from other drugs. Although FDA has waived NDA and ANDA fees for three PET radiopharmaceuticals, revision of FDAMA to exempt PET drug products from regulations placed on manufacturing is needed. Without relief from the current regulations, many academic PET centers are likely to close
