Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of ecteinascidin 743 administered as a 72-hour continuous intravenous infusion in patients with solid malignancies. Ecteinascidin 743 (ET-743) is a cytotoxic tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid that covalently binds to DNA in the minor groove. The in vitro chemosensitivity of cancer cells to ET-743 is markedly enhanced by prolonging the duration of exposure to the drug. A Phase I study of ET-743 given as a 72-h continuous i.v. infusion every 21 days was performed. Characteristics of the 21 adult patients with refractory solid tumors enrolled in the study were as follows: (a) 12 men (b) 9 women
