The basis for differences in ethanol-induced myocardial depression in normal subjects. The acute effects of ethanol (ETOH) on cardiac function in 32 normal subjects has been studied utilizing systolic time intervals. Seven (group I) 13 (group II), and 12 subjects (group III), reported an average daily consumption of less than 1 oz, 1-2 oz, and more than 2 oz of ETOH, respectively. Progressively higher control values from group I to group III in PEP, PEPI, ICT and PET/LVET were observed (PEP-I vs PEPI-III: P smaller than 0.05 PEP/LVET-I vs PEP/LVET-II and PEP/LVET-III: P smaller than 0.05). There was progressively less change in these variables following acute ETOH (P smaller than 0.02-0.05 in group I
