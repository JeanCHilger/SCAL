Event-related potentials from a visual categorization task. Investigation of the neural bases of human perceptual categorization is a continuously growing territory of visual sciences. Recently, several papers appeared on the cortical bases of human categorization performance, using functional brain imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, the cheaper commercially available laboratory tests are not always the best methods to study multiple aspects of visual categorization. In this study, we describe the electrophysiological correlates of natural scene categorization in humans. The subject's task was to decide whether briefly presented natural scenes contained animal or non-animal items. Analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded during the categorization task, revealed more negative potentials for non-animal stimuli (NAS) in the time windows of 150-250 ms (N1) and 350-500 ms (N2), and more positive potentials for animal stimuli (AS) in the time window of 250-350 ms (P2). Our work provides an inexpensive noninvasive method to study both early perceptual and late phases of semantic information processing by recording ERPs during the categorization of natural scenes.
