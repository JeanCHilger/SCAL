Federal regulations and reimbursement for PET. The regulatory and reimbursement environment for PET has changed significantly over the past several years. The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) findings of the safety and efficacy of key PET drugs have been published, as well as guidelines for the applications to produce PET drugs. In addition, the national Medicare coverage policy for PET has been expanded, most recently with additional indications and coverage restrictions added as of July 2001. The payment rates under the new Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (HOPPS) have been set for PET as well. This communication reviews these recent changes and discusses their impact on the development and operation of a PET center.
