Suppression of fatty acid metabolism after exercise stress in patients with no electrocardiographic ST segment shift during balloon angioplasty. Although ST segment shift is a marker of myocardial ischemia, some patients have no ST segment shift during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The aim of this study is to investigate myocardial perfusion and metabolism in adaptation for ischemia using 201TI and 123I-BMIPP dual exercise stress myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (dual stress SPECT). In 28 patients with coronary artery disease, dual stress SPECT was performed 3 weeks before PTCA. Early and delayed images were obtained at 5 minutes and at 3 hours after termination of ergometer stress, respectively. During PTCA, 12-lead ECG was recorded, and a significant ST segment shift was defined as more than 1 mm elevation or a depression of the J-point at the first ballooning. No collateral circulation on the coronary angiogram or 201TI filling on the delayed images were observed on any of the target regions of PTCA. Patients were divided into 2 groups: with (Group A: n = 15) and without (Group B: n = 13) significant ST segment shift during PTCA. A redistribution of TI was observed in 14 (93%) of Group A and 10 (77%) of Group B patients. Incidence of BMIPP redistribution was significantly higher in Group B (11 [85%]) than in Group A (3 [20%]) (p < 0.05). Redistribution of BMIPP means suppression of fatty acid metabolism during exercise stress. Augmentation of glucose metabolism is speculated to be an energy source in ischemic preconditioning.
