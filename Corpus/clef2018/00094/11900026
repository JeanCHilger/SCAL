Method for reducing background artifacts from images in single-photon emission computed tomography with a uniformly redundant array coded aperture. Uniformly redundant array coded apertures have proven to be useful in the design of collimators for x-ray astronomy. They were initially expected to be equally successful in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Unfortunately, the SPECT images produced by this collimator contain artifacts, which mask the true picture and can lead to false diagnosis. Monte Carlo simulation has shown that the formation of a composite image will significantly reduce these artifacts. A simulation of a tumor in a compressed breast phantom has produced a composite image, which clearly indicates the presence of a 5 mm x 5 mm x 5 mm tumor with a 6:1 intensity ratio relative to the background tissue.
