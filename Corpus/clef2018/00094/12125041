Comparative effects of methamphetamine and nicotine on the striatal [(11)C]raclopride binding in unanesthetized monkeys. Although a very large literature exists on the in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo effects of nicotine on dopamine release in rodents, similar data in primates are scant. This study was initiated to compare methamphetamine to nicotine given i.v. to normal unanesthetized monkeys using positron emission tomography (PET) techniques. Release of dopamine in the striatum using [(11)C]raclopride was determined indirectly in four nicotine-na√Øve adult Macaca mulatta monkeys under conscious and isoflurane-anesthetized conditions using high-resolution PET. [(11)C]Raclopride was given i.v. as a bolus injection followed by continuous infusion with steady state over 30-45 min. Nicotine bitartrate was then given as a bolus plus infusion for 30 min in doses of 32 microg/kg + 0.8 microg/kg/min or 100 microg/kg + 2.53 microg/kg/min as base. The larger doses of nicotine caused significant cardiovascular effects these doses did not displace [(11)C]raclopride binding in either dorsal or ventral striatum under the anesthetized conscious condition. In contrast, isoflurane-anesthesia induced a slight but significant dose-dependent reduction of [(11)C]raclopride binding by nicotine even at the same doses used in the anesthetized condition. Methamphetamine in bolus doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg i.v. under conscious condition caused a significant displacement of [(11)C]raclopride and isoflurane-anesthesia facilitated the displacement induced by nicotine. These results indicate that nicotine, in high tobacco-smoking-related doses, does not release sufficient brain dopamine to displace [(11)C]raclopride in the striatum in the awake and fully conscious state, in contrast to small doses of methamphetamine.
