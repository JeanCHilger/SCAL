Tissue reaction to polypyrrole-coated polyester fabrics: an in vivo study in rats. Electrically conductive polypyrrole is very attractive for tissue engineering because of its potential to modulate cellular activities through electrical stimulation. However, its in vivo behaviors have not been fully studied. This paper investigates the in vivo biocompatibility and biostability of PPy-coated polyester fabrics. Three PPy-coated fabrics were prepared using phosphonylation (PPy-Phos), plasma activation (PPy-Plas), and plasma activation plus heparin treatment (PPy-Plas-HE). Virgin and fluoropassivated fabrics (F-PET) were controls. The specimens were implanted subcutaneously in the back of rats for 3-90 days, then harvested and processed for enzymatic, histological, and morphological analyses. A noninvasive MRI method was used to continuously monitor the inflammation. The level of acid and alkaline phosphatase showed a similar or a less intensive cellular reaction by the PPy-coated fabrics, when compared to the controls. Histology supported the enzymatic results and showed a fast collagen infiltration at 28 days for the PPy-Phos fabric. MRI reported an overall decrease of inflammation over time, with the PPy-coated fabrics showing a similar or mild inflammation in contrast to the non-coated fabrics. PPy clusters and excessive PPy laminary coating on the PPy-Plas and PPy-Plas-HE were lost with the implantation. This experiment suggests a similar in vivo biocompatibility of the PPy-coated and noncoated polyester fabrics and the importance of achieving a thin, uniform PPy coating.
