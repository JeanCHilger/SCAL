Efficient principal component analysis for multivariate 3D voxel-based mapping of brain functional imaging data sets as applied to FDG-PET and normal aging. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a well-known technique for reduction of dimensionality of functional imaging data. PCA can be looked at as the projection of the original images onto a new orthogonal coordinate system with lower dimensions. The new axes explain the variance in the images in decreasing order of importance, showing correlations between brain regions. We used an efficient, stable and analytical method to work out the PCA of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images of 74 normal subjects using [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) as a tracer. Principal components (PCs) and their relation to age effects were investigated. Correlations between the projections of the images on the new axes and the age of the subjects were carried out. The first two PCs could be identified as being the only PCs significantly correlated to age. The first principal component, which explained 10% of the data set variance, was reduced only in subjects of age 55 or older and was related to loss of signal in and adjacent to ventricles and basal cisterns, reflecting expected age-related brain atrophy with enlarging CSF spaces. The second principal component, which accounted for 8% of the total variance, had high loadings from prefrontal, posterior parietal and posterior cingulate cortices and showed the strongest correlation with age (r = -0.56), entirely consistent with previously documented age-related declines in brain glucose utilization. Thus, our method showed that the effect of aging on brain metabolism has at least two independent dimensions. This method should have widespread applications in multivariate analysis of brain functional images.
