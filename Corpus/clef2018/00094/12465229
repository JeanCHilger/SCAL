Differentiation between vital heart muscle tissue and infarct scar using magnetocardiography. Magnetocardiography provides touchless information about myocardial excitation propagation and repolarization. This evolving diagnostic technique has been used so far to risk-stratify patients in terms of sudden cardiac death and to detect myocardial ischemia. We evaluated its potential to assess myocardial viability in patients with coronary artery disease. Magnetocardiography was performed using a shielded prototype 49-channel LTS SQUID system. A specific algorithm was developed to calculate automatically a set of magnetocardiographic parameters. Regional myocardial viability was determined using 18F-labeled fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography. We found that magnetocardiography may contribute essentially to discriminate between viable myocardium and infarct scar.
