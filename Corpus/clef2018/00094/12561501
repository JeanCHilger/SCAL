A community survey of dog bites, anti-rabies treatment, rabies and dog population management in Bangalore city. This survey was conducted by using a 30 cluster random sampling technique to comprehensively study the nature and magnitude of rabies and its related problems in human and dog population. The city has an estimated dog population of 3.25 lakhs of which 2 lakhs (61.5%) are stray dogs and 1.25 lakhs (38.5%) are pet dogs. The dog:man ratio was about 1:12 and the pet:stray dog ratio of 1:2. The awareness about Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme was low (34%) and only 20% had faith in it. The annual incidence of dog bites was 1.9% persons. It was more in males (64%) and mostly from stray dogs (64%). About 86% of them received anti-rabies vaccination and none received life saving Anti-Rabies Serum (ARS). The annual incidence of human rabies was 15 and dog rabies 58 resulting in a ratio of 1:4 approximately as a rabies contagion index. The implementation of ABC programme was weak (10.4% coverage) and is recommended for acceleration and improvement. Similarly modern anti-rabies immunization, including anti-rabic serum, shall replace the outdated sample (sheep brain) vaccine.
