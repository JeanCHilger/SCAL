Using non-invasive radionuclide imaging to detect esophagitis in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate technetium-99m tetrofosmin SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) of the chest as a potential non-invasive method to evaluate esophagitis among gastroesophageal reflux disease patients.In this study, we used non-invasive radionuclide imaging technetium-99m tetrofosmin chest SPECT to detect and grade esophagitis in 60 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.Based on the endoscopic findings according to the Savary-Miller system, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rates of technetium-99m tetrofosmin chest SPECT in detecting esophagitis were 95.2%, 72.2%, and 88.3%, respectively. The agreement between the endoscopic and technetium-99m tetrofosmin chest SPECT findings was evaluated and found to be good (kappa: 0.633, p < 0.001).Non-invasive technetium-99m tetrofosmin chest SPECT has excellent sensitivity and good accuracy as a screen for esophagitis among gastroesophageal reflux disease patients.
