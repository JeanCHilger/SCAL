Renal single photon emission computed tomography: should we do it? Although single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has established a place for itself in clinical nuclear medicine for heart and brain studies, its place in renal imaging is not yet clear. Renal SPECT has been subject to limitations imposed by the efficiency of imaging equipment, and has been confined to use with static imaging agents such as technetium-99m (99mTc) dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA). SPECT has been used to investigate space-occupying lesions and anatomical abnormalities, and for quantitative studies of renal uptake and volume. In these areas, it has provided little advantage over conventional imaging, but it has been helpful in individual cases. High-resolution SPECT is a promising new development, which may have applications in detecting and classifying renal scarring. It deserves careful evaluation.
