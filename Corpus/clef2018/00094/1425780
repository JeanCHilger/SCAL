Motor stimulation response by technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime split-dose method and single photon emission tomography. We applied the technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) split-dose method in order to evaluate the feasibility of assessing cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes with single photon emission tomography (SPET) during a motor activation task. Eleven normal subjects were studied using the Tomomatic 564 (Medimatic, DK). Five subjects were studied twice at rest and 6 subjects at rest and during a motor task performance (finger opposition movements). A total of 28 mCi of 99mTc-HMPAO was injected in 2 doses with a 1:3 ratio. The first scan was obtained after injection of 7 mCi at rest in all subjects. The second scan was obtained a few minutes later, after injection of the remaining dose (21 mCi), under similar resting conditions or during a motor task performance. The mean brain uptake was proportional to the amount of tracer injected and to the acquisition time for both the first scan (5263 +/- 1266 counts x mCi x min) and the second (5034.4 +/- 966 counts x mCi x min). The grey/white matter ratio was 1.67 +/- 0.019 and 1.67 +/- 0.097 for the two scans, respectively. A three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measure showed no significant effects of side, slice and region of interest (ROI) on the CBF in the 5 subjects studied twice at rest, and the mean regional CBF change was -0.2% +/- 5%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
