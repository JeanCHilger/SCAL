Bilateral fetal grafts for Parkinson's disease: 22 months' results. Five patients with severe Parkinson's disease underwent bilateral multiple graft implants of nondissociated fetal mesodiencephalic tissues. Graft implantation was performed in China following CT-guided stereotactic placement of a novel delivery system. Follow-up has demonstrated substantially reduced levodopa requirements and clinical improvements of motor, postural functions and reduction of freezing and on-off phenomenon. PET utilizing [18F]-dopa, at 14 months in the first case, suggested graft-induced restoration of dopaminergic transmission in the striatum.
