Regional cerebral blood flow in Parkinson's disease with and without dementia. Tc99 HMPAO SPECT and T1 weighted 3D MRI scans were acquired in cognitively intact subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 31), and in PD subjects with dementia (PDD) (n = 34), healthy controls (n = 37), those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 32), and those with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (n = 15). We used SPM99 to look for regions which showed a reduction in perfusion on SPECT not related to associated structural brain changes assessed by a MRI scan. The precuneus and inferior lateral parietal regions showed a perfusion deficit in Parkinson's disease with dementia, similar to the pattern observed in DLB. In comparison, AD showed a perfusion deficit in the midline parietal region, in a more anterior and inferior location than in PDD, involving the posterior cingulate as well as the precuneus. The perfusion deficits in PDD are similar those in DLB, and in a location associated with visual processing, and may be associated with the visuospatial perception deficits which are present in persons with DLB and PDD.
