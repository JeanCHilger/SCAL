The relationship between cerebral blood flow and cognitive function in patients with brain insult of various etiology. The relationship between the mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cognitive function was investigated in patients with brain insult. This study included 72 patients aged 24-85 years treated for the following diseases: cerebral infarction (21), intracerebral hemorrhage (4), subarachnoid hemorrhage (2), brain tumor (14), cerebral contusion (12), normal pressure hydrocephalus (13), Alzheimer's disease (2), and others (4). First-pass radionuclide angiography using Technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) was performed for the measurement of the mean CBF, and the Sturb-Black Mental Status Examination for the neuropsychological evaluation. The mean CBF and the score of the neuropsychological test were significantly reduced compared with those of the age-matched controls. Regardless of etiology, the mean CBF and the score of neuropsychological test were significantly reduced, and a significant correlation was observed except for the patients with cerebral contusion. The quantitative measurement of CBF using 99mTc-HMPAO is reliable to estimate the neuropsychological state.
