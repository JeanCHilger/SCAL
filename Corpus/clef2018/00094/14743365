Cortical motor activation in akinetic schizophrenic patients: a pilot functional MRI study. Akinesia is associated with supplementary motor area (SMA) dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. We looked for a similar association in patients with schizophrenia. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we compared motor activation in 6 akinetic neuroleptic-treated schizophrenic patients and 6 normal subjects. Schizophrenic patients had a defective activation in the SMA, left primary sensorimotor cortex, bilateral lateral premotor and inferior parietal cortices, whereas the right primary sensorimotor cortex and a mesial frontal area were hyperactive. SMA was hypoactive in akinetic schizophrenic patients, emphasizing the role of this area in motor slowness. Other abnormal signals likely reflect schizophrenia-related abnormal intracortical connections.
