Tumors and tumor-like lesions of the neck: from childhood to adult. In childhood, tumors and tumor-like lesions of the neck are rare and tend to be benign. Very common are congenital cystic lesions (thyroglossal duct cysts, branchial cysts, dermoid cysts, lymphangiomas, cystic hygromas). Common neoplastic lesions are hemangiomas and papillomas. The most common malignant tumors in the head and neck region are lymphomas and rhabdomyosarcomas. Lymph node enlargements, reactive or/and infectious, account also for a significant amount of cervical masses.
