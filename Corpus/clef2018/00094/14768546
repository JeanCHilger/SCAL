The cotransduction of pET system plasmids by mutants of T4 and RB43 bacteriophages. The study of the cotransduction of the plasmid pairs pET-3a-pLysE and pET-3a-pLysS by the mutant phage T4alc7 showed that the antibiotic resistance markers of the plasmids were cotransduced with a high frequency. The analysis of the plasmid DNA of cotransductants and cotransformants showed that the mutant phage T4alc7 can be used for obtaining the monomeric and oligomeric forms of plasmids and for the cotransduction of two-plasmid overproduction systems into E. coli strains. The plaque mutants RB43-03 and RB43-13 derived from bacteriophage RB43 were found to be able to cotransduce the antibiotic resistance markers of pET-3a and pLysE plasmids.
