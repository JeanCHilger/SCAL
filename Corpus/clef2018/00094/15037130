Neural systems behind word and concept retrieval. Using both the lesion method and functional imaging (positron emission tomography) in large cohorts of subjects investigated with the same experimental tasks, we tested the following hypotheses: (A) that the retrieval of words which denote concrete entities belonging to distinct conceptual categories depends upon partially segregated regions in higher-order cortices of the left temporal lobe and (B) that the retrieval of conceptual knowledge pertaining to the same concrete entities also depends on partially segregated regions
