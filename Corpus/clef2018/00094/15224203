Frequency of silent myocardial ischemia in type 2 diabetic patients and the relation with poor glycemic control. The aim of the study was to investigate the frequency of silent myocardial ischemia in type 2 diabetic patients without any clinical or laboratory findings of myocardial ischemia and to examine the related factors for silent myocardial ischemia. A total of 116 type 2 diabetic patients (82 women) with a disease duration of 5-20 years were included in the study. All patients underwent stress and resting myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) study with (99m)Tc-MIBI. Coronary angiography was performed in patients with ischemia established at myocardial perfusion SPECT. Ischemia was determined in 18 (15.5%) patients by myocardial perfusion SPECT. Coronary angiography performed in 17 of these patients confirmed coronary stenosis >50% in 11 patients. Thus, the prevalence of silent myocardial ischemia was 9.6%. Significant relations were found between silent myocardial ischemia and male sex, high HbA(1C) level and retinopathy. Type 2 diabetic patients (especially men) with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or retinopathy should be screened for silent myocardial ischemia.
