Prognostic validation of a 17-segment score derived from a 20-segment score for myocardial perfusion SPECT interpretation. Recently, a 17-segment model of the left ventricle has been recommended as an optimally weighted approach for interpreting myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Methods to convert databases from previous 20- to new 17-segment data and criteria for abnormality for the 17-segment scores are needed.Initially, for derivation of the conversion algorithm, 65 patients were studied (algorithm population) (pilot group, n = 28 validation group, n = 37). Three conversion algorithms were derived: algorithm 1, which used mid, distal, and apical scoresAn algorithm for conversion of 20-segment perfusion scores to 17-segment scores has been developed that is highly concordant with expert visual analysis by the 17-segment model and provides nearly identical prognostic information. This conversion model may provide a mechanism for comparison of studies analyzed by the 17-segment system with previous studies analyzed by the 20-segment approach.
