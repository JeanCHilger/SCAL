Adenosine sestamibi SPECT post-infarction evaluation (INSPIRE) trial: A randomized, prospective multicenter trial evaluating the role of adenosine Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT for assessing risk and therapeutic outcomes in survivors of acute myocardial infarction. Preliminary studies indicate that adenosine myocardial perfusion single photon tomography (SPECT) can safely and accurately stratify patients into low and high risk groups early after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).INSPIRE is a prospective, randomized multicenter trial which enrolled 728 clinically stable survivors of AMI. Following baseline adenosine sestamibi gated SPECT, patients were classified as low, intermediate or high risk based on the quantified total and ischemic left ventricular (LV) perfusion defect size (PDS). A subset of high risk patients with a LV ejection fraction > or =35% were randomized to a strategy of either intensive medical therapy or coronary revascularization. Adenosine SPECT was repeated at 6-8 weeks to determine the relative effects of anti-ischemic therapies on total and ischemic PDS (primary endpoint). All patients were followed for one year. The baseline demographic, clinical and scintigraphic characteristics of the study population are presented. Adenosine SPECT was performed within 1 day of admission in 12% of patients and in 64% by Day 4.The unique study design features of INSPIRE will further clarify the role of adenosine sestamibi SPECT in defining initial patient risk after AMI and in monitoring the benefits of intensive anti-ischemic therapies.
