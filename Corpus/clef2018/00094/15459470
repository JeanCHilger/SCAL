Detecting viable myocardium and predicting functional improvement: comparisons of positron emission tomography, rest-redistribution thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), exercise thallium-201 reinjection SPECT, I-123 BMIPP SPECT and dobutamine stress echocardiography. Low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography (LDDE) has become a useful and safe method for identifying hibernating or stunned myocardium and for predicting improvement in wall motion after coronary revascularization.In the present study, fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), rest-redistribution thallium-201 ((201)Tl) single-photon emission computed tomography (RR-Tl SPECT), (123)I-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) and LDDE were performed in 30 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at 10+/-3 days after the onset of AMI. Also, exercise (201)Tl reinjection SPECT (RI-Tl SPECT) was performed at 14+/-2 days. Follow-up echocardiography was performed 5+/-3 months later in all patients after interventional therapy for the assessment of functional recovery. Of the 390 segments analyzed by echocardiography, 110 (28%) had abnormal wall motion. There were no significant differences between RR-Tl SPECT and LDDE in sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value using the chi(2)-test however, in akinetic segments, there was a significant difference in sensitivity. Among FDG-PET, RI-Tl SPECT, BMIPP and LDDE, there were significant differences in 3 variables. In akinetic segments, LDDE is superior to RR-Tl SPECT in sensitivity and to FDG-PET in specificity. In hypokinetic segments, LDDE is superior to RI-Tl SPECT and BMIPP in sensitivity, and to FDG-PET and BMIPP in specificity.LDDE could detect functional recovery of viable myocardium in the early period of AMI and can be performed easily and safely.
