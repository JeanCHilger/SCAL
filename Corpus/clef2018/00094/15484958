Use of pet food-grade poultry by-product meal as an alternate protein source in weanling pig diets. Three experiments were conducted to evaluate pet food-grade poultry by-product meal (PBM) as a replacement protein source for fish meal (FM), blood meal (BM), and spray-dried plasma protein (SDPP) in weanling pig diets. In the first study, 200 crossbred pigs (initial BW = 6.5 kg) were weaned (21 d) and randomly allotted to one of four dietary treatments, which included a control and three test diets where PBM was substituted for FM, blood products, or both. Experimental diets were fed during Phase I (d 0 to 5 postweaning) and Phase II (d 5 to 19), and a common Phase III diet was fed from d 19 to 26. Overall (d 0 to 26), there was no difference in performance of pigs fed PBM in place of the other ingredients. However, during Phase I, BW (P < 0.05), ADG (P < 0.02), and intake (P < 0.001) in pigs fed diets containing SDPP were greater than those fed diets with PBM. In Exp. 2, the performance of pigs (n = 100, initial BW = 6.5 kg) fed diets containing 20% PBM (as-fed basis, replacing SDPP, BM, FM, and a portion of the soybean meal) in all phases of the nursery diet was compared with a group fed conventional diets without PBM. There were no differences in overall performance (d 0 to 26) however, ADG (P < 0.10) and feed intake were higher (P < 0.01) for pigs fed the conventional diet than for pigs fed the 20% PBM diet during Phase I (d 0 to 5). Experiment 3 was a slope-ratio assay to determine the ability of PBM to replace SDPP. A total of 320 pigs (initial BW = 7.32 kg) was weaned (21 d) and allotted to five treatment groups in three trials in a blocked design with product (SDPP or PBM) as the first factor, and lysine level (1.08, 1.28, 1.49%
