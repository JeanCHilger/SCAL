Preoperative risk stratification for endovascular surgery using pharmacologic stress myocardial imaging. To stratify perioperative cardiac risk for endovascular surgery, pharmacologic stress single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed in 206 patients. Of 8 patients who had cardiac events, 7 occurred in 67 patients with positive SPECT results, whereas only 1 occurred in 139 patients with negative SPECT results (7 of 67 vs 1 of 139, p <0.002). Furthermore, a scintigraphic marker of a summed stress score >/=14 was the most important factor identifying patients who subsequently had cardiac events by multivariate analysis.
