Magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of coronary artery disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is gaining importance in cardiology as the noninvasive test of choice for patients with a multitude of cardiovascular problems. Recently, cardiovascular MRI has emerged as an important noninvasive diagnostic modality in the assessment of coronary artery disease. Because of its superior spatial resolution, integration of qualitative and quantitative methodology, and excellent reproducibility, MRI has advantages over conventional noninvasive modalities currently used in the evaluation of coronary artery disease. This article reviews the rapidly expanding recent literature that has now established cardiovascular MRI as an ideal choice in the evaluation of myocardial ischemia (including dobutamine cine MRI and vasodilator perfusion MRI techniques). We further discuss the role of delayed contrast-enhanced MRI and low-dose dobutamine cine MRI for evaluation of myocardial viability. Comparisons with more established techniques, such as dobutamine stress echocardiography, single-photon emission computed tomography perfusion imaging, and positron emission tomography, are reviewed.
