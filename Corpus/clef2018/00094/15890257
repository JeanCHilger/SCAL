Development of wavelet de-noising technique for PET images. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging provides the functional information and precise physiological uptake of radioactivity in a patient's body. But the shortcoming of PET is low signal to noise ratio (SNR) due to photon noise. The noise may influence image quality, and cause the mistake of clinical interpretation. The purpose of this research is to develop a wavelet de-noising technique to reduce the noise of PET images. By processing the image through the optimum wavelet parameters we selected, we keep the resolution and contrast but reduce almost half of coefficient of variation in the region of interest of PET images.
