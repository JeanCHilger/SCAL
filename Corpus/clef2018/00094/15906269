The role of supplementary dietary antioxidants on immune response in puppies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplementary antioxidants (AOX) and whey protein on the immune function health of puppies. Four groups of 10 puppies were fed a control and 3 different test foods (control + antioxidants (AOX), control + AOX + 1% whey protein, and a grocery brand (low AOX)) for 6 weeks. A standard vaccination protocol with a combination canine parvovirus (CPV) and distemper (CDV) vaccine was carried out at 2 and 4 weeks. The results showed that animals on high AOX foods had significantly increased titers, memory cells and serum E concentrations compared to the control and groc groups respectively.
