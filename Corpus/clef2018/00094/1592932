Scatter, spatial resolution, and quantitative recovery in high resolution SPECT. The potential use of single photon emission CT (SPECT) for quantification depends on its physical performance characteristics. We investigated the performance of a high resolution four-head brain SPECT scanner (Neuro-Spect Summit/Hitachi). With an attenuation coefficient of 0.11 cm-1 and the Chang correction method, the calibration factor of the scanner was 515 (cpm/ml)/(microCi/ml) and showed only a minimal but systematic dependence on object size. Without scatter, the resolution was 4.7 mm (full width at half-maximum)
