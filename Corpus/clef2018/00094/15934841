Gene therapy for Parkinson's disease using recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors. Existing strategies for gene therapy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease include the delivery of genes encoding dopamine (DA)-synthesising enzymes, leading to localised production of DA in the striatum genes encoding factors that protect nigral neurons against ongoing degeneration, such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor
