A positron emission tomography radioligand for the in vivo labeling of metabotropic glutamate 1 receptor: (3-ethyl-2-[11C]methyl-6-quinolinyl)(cis- 4-methoxycyclohexyl)methanone. A selective metabotropic glutamate 1 receptor (mGlu1) antagonist was labeled with the positron-emitting radioisotope carbon-11 and evaluated in ex vivo biodistribution studies and micro-positron emission tomography (micro-PET) imaging experiments in rats. Results from animal experiments demonstrate that the radioligand [11C]2 is the first PET tracer capable of labeling the rat mGlu1 receptor in vivo.
