Multimodality preoperative imaging of pancreatic insulinomas. Pancreatic insulinomas are rare tumours of the islet cells of the pancreas, which account for the majority of functional neuroendocrine tumours of the pancreas. There is often a typical history of recurrent hypoglycaemic collapse and dizzy spells. Insulinomas are usually solitary, and the vast majority are intra-pancreatic in location. They are characteristically small with approximately 66% being less than 2cm at presentation. Insulinomas continue to pose a diagnostic challenge to physicians, surgeons and radiologists alike. The role of imaging is to detect and provide precise anatomical localization and staging of tumours prior to surgery. Due to their small size at clinical presentation, they are notoriously difficult to localize radiologically, and specifically designed protocols are necessary to aid detection. In this review, we describe the current "state of the art" imaging protocols that may be used in the preoperative localization of insulinomas.
