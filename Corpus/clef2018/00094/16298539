Soft tissue sarcoma: role of imaging for initial diagnosis and treatment. Soft tissue sarcomas are uncommon heterogeneous group of tumour derived from mesenchym. The most common location is the lower extremity, but they can occur in the upper extremity, and abdominal and chest walls. The first radiological evaluation may include plain films and ultrasonography in viewing to assess the probability of soft tissue sarcomas. MRI with contrast is the main modality to evaluate these lesions and choose which part of tumour must be biopsied. Computer tomography (CT) is secondary used to perform core needle biopsy and detect lung metastases. The role of PET begins to be more clear in case of need global assessment before radical surgery. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to perform rational treatment planning and avoid partial surgery.
