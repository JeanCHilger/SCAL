Single-photon emission CT imaging in acute stroke. Single-photon emission CT (SPECT) is an underused noninvasive imaging tool for the management of patients who have acute or chronic ischemia. SPECT was introduced in the late 1970s and is a proven, cost-effective means for the evaluation of regional cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reserve. Evaluation of cerebral blood flow using SPECT has become more accessible with the commercial availability of tracers that cross the blood-brain barrier and are retained by cells of the central nervous system.
