Positron emission tomography as a research tool in the investigation of psychiatric and psychological disorders. The principles of positron emission tomography (PET) are described, and illustrations of how these can be applied to clinical psychiatric questions relating to schizophrenia and depression are delineated. The metabolic changes in the frontal lobes which have been described in both depression and schizophrenia and depression are reviewed and discussed. More recent PET techniques allow several serial measurements of changes in regional blood flow in response to either a pharmacological challenge or a specific psychological task. This method provides a promising new approach to the study of the dopaminergic system in schizophrenia. New tracer methods of quantitating changes in in vivo concentrations of opioid receptors allow direct pharmacological access to the endogenous opioid system in the brain. Observations of regional cortical differences in opioid receptor concentration in relation to the medial and lateral pain systems are described. In addition, changes in receptor occupancy during sleep using [11C]diprenorphine and changes in the mu-specific tracer [11C]carfentanil in temporal lobe epilepsy are discussed.
