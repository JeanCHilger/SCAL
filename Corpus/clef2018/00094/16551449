Longitudinal changes in cortical glucose hypometabolism in children with intractable epilepsy. In children with partial epilepsy, there is increasing evidence to suggest that not all cortical regions showing glucose hypometabolism on positron emission tomography (PET) represent epileptogenic cortex but that some hypometabolic areas might be the result of repeated seizures. Most of the supportive data, however, have come from cross-sectional imaging studies. To evaluate longitudinal changes in cortical glucose hypometabolism, we compared two sequential [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans performed 7 to 44 months apart in 15 children with intractable nonlesional partial epilepsy. The extent of hypometabolic cortex on the side of the electroencephalography-verified epileptic focus and its changes between the two PET scans were measured and correlated to clinical seizure variables. The change in seizure frequency between the two PET scans correlated positively with the change in the extent of cortical glucose hypometabolism (r = .8, P <.001). Most patients with persistent or increased seizure frequency (one or more seizures per day) showed enlargement in the area of hypometabolic cortex on the second PET scan. In contrast, patients whose seizure frequency had decreased below daily seizures between the first and second PET scans showed a decrease in the size of the hypometabolic cortex. These results support the notion that the extent of cortical glucose hypometabolism on PET scanning can undergo dynamic changes, and these are, at least partly, related to the frequency of seizures. The findings have implications on how aggressively persistent seizures should be treated in children. (J Child Neurol 200621:26-31).
