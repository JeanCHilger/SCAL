Correlation of visual hallucinations with occipital rCBF changes by donepezil in DLB. The authors explored the neural substrate of visual hallucinations in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) by investigating changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and psychiatric symptoms, before and after cholinesterase inhibitor treatment. Twenty subjects with DLB were treated with donepezil for a 12-week period. Hallucinations attenuated while receiving therapy, whereas occipital rCBF focally increased, suggesting that functional visual association cortex deficits may cause visual hallucinations in patients with DLB.
