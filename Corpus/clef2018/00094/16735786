Imaging in inflammatory breast carcinoma. In this section, imaging findings of inflammatory breast carcinoma using the following modalities - mammography, ultrasonography, computerized tomography, and positron emission tomography - are described. Differential diagnoses are presented. The key finding in IBC is its inflammatory component, which can be well demonstrated on all of the modalities. Because no pathognomonic feature exists for IBC, biopsy is always needed for diagnosis. Nevertheless, there is a substantial and expanding role for imaging in the characterization and definition of the extent of disease, and in the monitoring its therapy.
