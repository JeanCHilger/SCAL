Residency training as technology matures a survey of radiology residents' training experiences. The aim of the study is to assess radiology resident training experience in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), obstetrical (OB) ultrasound (US), carotid US, and barium esophagram.One hundred eighteen radiology residents completed surveys. Surveys assessed resident year of residency training, hospital size, program affiliation with an academic institution, state, performance of the examinations listed, number of examinations performed per week, and number of weeks spent on rotations for each modality. The study was approved by the institutional review board and was Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant. t-Test and chi-square test were performed, and results were analyzed for statistical significance.Most (94 respondents 80%) respondents were third-year residents, 101 residents (86%) stated their program was affiliated with an academic institution, 92 residents (78%) performed cardiac MRI, 104 (88%) performed PET, 84 (71%) performed OB US, 71 (60%) performed carotid US (one did not respond), and all performed esophagrams (although one did not respond). Only performance of cardiac MRI and PET correlated positively with a larger average hospital size (P < .01). Residents at an academically affiliated program were significantly more likely to perform cardiac MRI (P < .05). Geographic region significantly affected likelihood of performance of cardiac MRI only.Such factors as hospital size, academic institution affiliation, and geography affect radiology resident training, particularly for such maturing applications as cardiac MRI and PET. This information may be useful in attempts to standardize radiology residency training.
