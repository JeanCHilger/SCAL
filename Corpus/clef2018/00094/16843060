Vascular prostheses with controlled release of antibiotics Part 2. In vitro biological evaluation of vascular prostheses treated by cyclodextrins. Viability tests by the colony forming method show no toxicity for all CDs (beta-CD, gamma-CD, HPbeta-CD and HPgamma-CD) and their associated polymer. A survival rate of 100% is observed for all CDs at high concentration 400 ppm. Proliferation tests revealed a low proliferation of L132 cells on grafted vascular prostheses and untreated prostheses and good proliferation on Melinex (film form of PET). A proliferation of 17% is observed after 3 days of incubation and decrease at 4% after 6 days on prostheses. Melinex exhibits a proliferation rate as the controls. Vitality tests confirm proliferation tests and show a good vitality of cells even for low cell amounts. From these experiments it becomes obvious that the decreasing proliferation rate is not a cytotoxic effect but is due to the chemical and/or physical surface characteristics. A similar result is obtained for cell adhesion kinetics between grafted vascular prostheses and control. After 2 h adhesion, a lower adhesion is observed on untreated prostheses. Theses results were confirmed by immunochemistry and morphology tests. This cell adhesion inhibiting effect of the PET prostheses contributes to a better "survival" of vascular prostheses without secondary obstruction or stenosis.
