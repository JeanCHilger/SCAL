Characterization of dopaminergic dysfunction in familial progressive supranuclear palsy: an 18F-dopa PET study. We analyzed (18)F-dopa PET data from 11 members of kindreds with familial progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) to characterize their cerebral dopaminergic dysfunction. Three clinically-affected PSP patients showed reduced (18)F-dopa uptake in the striatum, orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala. One asymptomatic subject exhibited progressive putamen dopaminergic dysfunction. 60% of subjects with abnormal (18)F-dopa scans developed PSP subsequently. This is the first in vivo documentation of cortical dopaminergic deficiency in PSP. Reduced striatal (18)F-dopa uptake in susceptible relatives may predict later clinical disease.
