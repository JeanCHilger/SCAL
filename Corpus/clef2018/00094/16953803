Kupffer cells are obligatory for Plasmodium yoelii sporozoite infection of the liver. Previous studies suggested Plasmodium sporozoites infect hepatocytes after passing through Kupffer cells, but proof has been elusive. Here we present new information strengthening that hypothesis. We used homozygous op/op mice known to have few Kupffer cells because they lack macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 required for macrophage maturation due to a deactivating point mutation in the osteopetrosis gene. We found these mice to have 77% fewer Kupffer cells and to exhibit reduced clearance of colloidal carbon particles compared with heterozygous phenotypically normal littermates. Using a novel quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for P. yoelii 18S rRNA, we found liver infection of op/op mice to be decreased by 84% compared with controls. However, using another way of limiting Kupffer cells, treatment with liposome-encapsulated clodronate, infection of normal mice was enhanced seven- to 15-fold. This was explained by electron microscopy showing temporary gaps in the sinusoidal cell layer caused by this treatment. Thus, Kupffer cell deficiency in op/op mice decreases sporozoite infection by reducing the number of portals to the liver parenchyma, whereas clodronate increases sporozoite infection by opening portals and providing direct access to hepatocytes. Together these data provide strong support for the hypothesis that Kupffer cells are the portal for sporozoites to hepatocytes and critical for the onset of a malaria infection.
