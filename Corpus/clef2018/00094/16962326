Rapid microwave-assisted fluorination yielding novel 5'-deoxy-5'-fluorouridine derivatives. The preparation of (18)F-labeled ligands for positron emission tomography (PET) and the subsequent imaging have to be completed within a half-life of the neutron-deficient isotope ((18)F=110 min). In this paper, we report a rapid fluorination approach to obtain 5'-deoxy-5'-fluoro-substituted uracil nucleoside analogues. Nucleophilic substitution at the 5'-position of the nucleosides was achieved within 45 min providing excellent yields of 75-92% by application of microwaves.
