Imaging response assessment in oncology. The role of imaging in the clinical setting as well as in the drug development process is expanding rapidly. Imaging technology now exists that is capable of detecting tumor response within hours. In parallel with this advance, a new array of more targeted and specific therapies are being developed. This paradigm shift in turn demands a more sophisticated way of quantifying response. There is a need to update and modify the current response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST), which rely solely on anatomic size measurement of tumors. In addition, response assessment guidelines will need to be increasingly disease-specific. Response assessment by imaging is now intimately involved with all stages of the drug development process, from exploratory drug discovery through clinical trials, as well as in clinical use. Imaging biomarkers and surrogate endpoints have the potential to speed drug approval significantly. The major funding institutions and the pharmaceutical industry are working more and more with researchers to help maintain progress in this multidisciplinary area involving oncologists, radiologists, molecular imaging specialists, medical physicists, and computer scientists.
