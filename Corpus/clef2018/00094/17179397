Multiple Myeloma: Molecular Imaging with 11C-Methionine PET/CT--Initial Experience. To prospectively assess molecular imaging of multiple myeloma (MM) by using the radiolabeled amino acid carbon 11 ((11)C) methionine and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT).The study was approved by the institutional local ethics committee and the national radiation protection authorities. All patients with MM and control patients gave written informed consent. Nineteen patients with MM (11 women, eight men age range, 42-64 years) and 10 control patients with hyperparathyroidism without hematologic diseases (six women, four men(35)S-methionine uptake of plasma cells was five- to sixfold higher than in normal BM cells. (11)C-methionine BM uptake in control patients was homogeneous and low. All patients with MM except one with exclusively extramedullary myeloma had (11)C-methionine-positive lesions. Maximal lesion and normal BM (11)C-methionine mean SUV(max) were 10.2 +/- 3.5 and 4.3 +/- 2.0, respectively, and thus were significantly higher than that of BM in the control group (mean, 1.8 +/- 0.3 P < .001). Extramedullary MM was clearly visible in three patients (mean SUV(max), 7.2 +/- 2.4). Additional (11)C-methionine-positive lesions in normal cancellous bone were found in nearly all patients with MM. In pretreated patients with MM, a moderate fraction of osteolytic lesions had no (11)C-methionine uptake.On the basis of increased methionine uptake in plasma cells, active MM can be imaged with (11)C-methionine PET/CT.
