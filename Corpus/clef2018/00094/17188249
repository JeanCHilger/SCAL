Nicotinamide inhibits B lymphocyte activation by disrupting MAPK signal transduction. Nicotinamide (NAm) represents both a pharmacological agent known to express cell preserving and anti-inflammatory properties, and a useful investigational tool to elucidate cellular pathways regulating a wide range of cellular functions. We demonstrate in this study that exogenous NAm, when used at pharmacological doses, inhibits activation of primary murine B lymphocytes in response to multiple ligands. NAm appears to affect a membrane proximal event leading to MAPKs activation, a transduction pathway shared by multiple receptors including the antigen-specific B cell receptor, CD38, CD40 and TLR4 receptors. NAm inhibited phospho-ERK accumulation, and only marginally affected phospho-p38 and phospho-JNK induction upon BCR stimulation of naive B lymphocytes. Accordingly, NAm also affected the expression of known targets of the MAPK ERK pathway such as CD69 and cyclin D2. Based on a comparison with well-characterized pharmacological inhibitors, we suggest in this work that NAm may inhibit a post-translational modification mediated by a yet unidentified mono(ADP-ribose)transferase. Collectively, our observations indicate that in addition to its previously described effect on cells of the innate immune system, NAm is able to modulate the activity of B lymphocytes suggesting a potential role of this vitamin in regulating antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders.
