Automated three-dimensional analysis of histological and autoradiographic rat brain sections: application to an activation study. Besides the newly developed positron emission tomography scanners (microPET) dedicated to the in vivo functional study of small animals, autoradiography remains the reference technique widely used for functional brain imaging and the gold standard for the validation of in vivo results. The analysis of autoradiographic data is classically achieved in two dimensions (2D) using a section-by-section approach, is often limited to few sections and the delineation of the regions of interest to be analysed is directly performed on autoradiographic sections. In addition, such approach of analysis does not accommodate the possible anatomical shifts linked to dissymmetry associated with the sectioning process. This classic analysis is time-consuming, operator-dependent and can therefore lead to non-objective and non-reproducible results. In this paper, we have developed an automated and generic toolbox for processing of autoradiographic and corresponding histological rat brain sections based on a three-step approach, which involves: (1) an optimized digitization dealing with hundreds of autoradiographic and histological sections (2) a robust reconstruction of the volumes based on a reliable registration method
