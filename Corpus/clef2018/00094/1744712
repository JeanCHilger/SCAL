Application of (methyl-11C)-methionine in the multicellular spheroid system. Human glioma (U-343 MGa) and human colon carcinoma (HT-29) cell lines were cultured as multicellular spheroids, and the accumulations of the L- and D-enantiomers of 11C-methionine were investigated. The accumulation of radioactivity in the spheroids was expressed as relative counts, by dividing the radioactivity measured in the spheroid with the radioactivity of the same volume of the incubation medium. The experiments were verified using 14C-labeled L- and D-methionine. The influence of spheroid volume, specific activity, incubation time, washing time, and the environmental temperatures were investigated. The spheroid model was used to determine the effect of the lipoxygenase inhibitors BW A4C and AA-861, the ether-phospholipid type PAF-antagonist CV-6209 and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide on methionine uptake. The results showed that 11C-L-methionine can be applied in the study of drug effects on multicellular tumor cell aggregates.
