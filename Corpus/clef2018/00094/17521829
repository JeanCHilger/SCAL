Cerebral metabolism and mood in remitted opiate dependence. Opiate-dependent individuals are prone to dysphoria that may contribute to treatment failure. Methadone-maintenance therapy (MMT) may mitigate this vulnerability, but controversy surrounds its long-term use. Little is known about the neurobiology of mood dysregulation in individuals receiving or removed from MMT.Fifteen opiate-abstinent and 12 methadone-maintained, opiate-dependent subjects, who lacked other Axis I pathology, and 13 control subjects were compared on the Cornell Dysthymia Rating Scale (CDRS) and regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMRglc) using [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.CDRS scores showed no group differences. Opiate-abstinent subjects had lower rCMRglc than control subjects in the bilateral perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), left mid-cingulate cortex, left insula and right superior frontal cortex. Methadone-maintained subjects exhibited lower rCMRglc than control subjects in the left insula and thalamus. In opiate-abstinent subjects, rCMRglc in the left perigenual ACC and mid-cingulate cortex correlated positively with CDRS scores.In remitted heroin dependence, opiate-abstinence is associated with more widespread patterns of abnormal cortical activity than MMT. Aberrant mood processing in the left perigenual ACC and mid-cingulate cortex, seen in opiate-abstinent individuals, is absent in those receiving MMT, suggesting that methadone may improve mood regulation in this population.
