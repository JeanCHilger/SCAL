Attachment of enteric viruses to bottles. Storage of water that was deliberately contaminated with enteric viruses in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles led to a rapid decrease of the apparent viral load, thereby hampering the development of samples for a collaborative evaluation of viral detection methods for bottled water. To determine if this decrease was due to spontaneous inactivation or to adhesion, an elution protocol was developed and combined with a rapid and sensitive real-time reverse transcription-PCR-based method to quantify adsorbed norovirus (NV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), and rotavirus (RV) on bottle walls. The NV retention on PET bottle walls after 20 and 62 days reached an average level of 85% and 95% of the recovered inoculum, respectively. HAV and RV also showed adsorption onto PET bottles, reaching 90% and 80%, respectively, after 20 days of storage. NV and RV attachment was demonstrated to be dependent on the presence of autochthonous flora, whereas HAV adsorption was independent of it. Application of the elution and viral detection protocol to 294 commercially available water bottles obtained from 25 different countries did not give any positive result, thereby providing further evidence that the sources used for this product are free from enteric viruses and support for the theory that bottled water is not a vehicle for viral diseases.
