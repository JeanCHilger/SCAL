High-risk melanoma: accuracy of FDG PET/CT with added CT morphologic information for detection of metastases. To prospectively determine the accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) with added CT morphologic information for depiction of metastases in patients with high-risk melanoma and negative findings for metastases at PET, by using histologic findings or additional imaging and/or follow-up findings as reference standard.Institutional review board approval was obtained. Informed consent was obtained from patients. One hundred twenty-four consecutive high-risk melanoma patients (65 female, 59 male mean age, 54.4 yearsIn 53 of 124 patients, metastases were found. In 46 of 53 patients with metastases, lesions had increased FDG uptake. In seven patients with metastatic disease, metastases did not have increased FDG uptake (maximum standard uptake value [SUV], <1.5 n = 5) or had faint FDG uptake (maximum SUV, 2.5 and 2.9Dedicated analysis of coregistered CT images significantly improves the accuracy of integrated PET/CT for depiction of metastases in patients with high-risk melanoma.
