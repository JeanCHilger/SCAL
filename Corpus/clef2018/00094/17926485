Comparative analysis of methods used for coronary artery disease diagnostics. The aim of the study was to determine effective diagnostic methods for use in patients with different probabilities of coronary artery disease (CAD). The 102 subjects were distributed into 3 groups according to CAD risk: low risk (n = 13), moderate risk (n = 29), and high risk (n = 60). The following examinations were performed: Holter ECG monitoring (88 patients), treadmill test (67 patients), stress-echoCG with dobutamine (31 patients), single phase emission computed tomography (SFECT) (30 patients), and multispiral computed tomography (MSCT) with coronary arterial contrasting (14 patients). After non-invasive tests, all patients underwent coronaroangiography. According to the study, MSCT and SPECT were the most effective techniques for CAD diagnostics. The application of all these tests is justified most in cases of moderate risk of stenosing coronary arterial lesion.
