Chronic intermittent hypoxia increases the CO2 reserve in sleeping dogs. We hypothesized that chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) would induce a predisposition to apnea in response to induced hypocapnia. To test this, we used pressure support ventilation to quantify the difference in end-tidal partial pressure of CO(2) (Pet(CO(2))) between eupnea and the apneic threshold ("CO(2) reserve") as an index of the propensity for apnea and unstable breathing during sleep, both before and following up to 3-wk exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia in dogs. CIH consisted of 25 s of Pet(O(2)) = 35-40 Torr followed by 35 s of normoxia, and this pattern was repeated 60 times/h, 7-8 h/day for 3 wk. The CO(2) reserve was determined during non-rapid eye movement sleep in normoxia 14-16 h after the most recent hypoxic exposure. Contrary to our hypothesis, the slope of the ventilatory response to CO(2) below eupnea progressively decreased during CIH (control, 1.36 +/- 0.18 week 2, 0.94 +/- 0.12
