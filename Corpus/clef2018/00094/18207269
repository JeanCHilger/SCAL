The integration of PET-CT scans from different hospitals into radiotherapy treatment planning. To integrate PET-CT scans from different hospitals into radiotherapy treatment planning.A cylindrical phantom with spheres of different diameters was scanned on three different Siemens Biograph PET-CT scanners in three hospitals. The spheres and cylinder were filled with 18F-FDG such that different sphere-to-background (S/B) ratios were obtained. Scans were analyzed using dedicated software for automated delineation based on standardized uptake value (SUV) and using different reconstruction parameters.SUV thresholding curves for different S/B ratios were obtained for the different scanners. Differences in SUV auto-contouring thresholds were found to be significant for PET-CT simulators from different radiotherapy and nuclear medicine departments. A change in PET reconstruction parameters showed a significant effect on the results.Synchronization of PET-CT imaging protocols between cooperating hospitals is important for reliable determination of SUV auto-contouring thresholds. Whenever this goal has been achieved automated SUV delineation based on a S/B ratio using PET-CT images from different institutions can reliably be performed using individually determined threshold curves.
