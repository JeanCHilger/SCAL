Understanding stem cell-mediated brain repair through neuroimaging. Transplantation of stem cells into the damaged brain can lead to behavioral recovery. However, at present, the mechanisms by which these cells exert their beneficial effects are still poorly understood. Survival, migration and differentiation are but a few of the factors that are thought to be involved in stem cell-mediated brain repair. It is hoped that neuroimaging, by MRI and PET, will provide serial in vivo assessments of transplanted cells that can lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms involved in brain repair.
