Bayesian reconstructions from emission tomography data using a modified EM algorithm. A novel method of reconstruction from single-photon emission computerized tomography data is proposed. This method builds on the expectation-maximization (EM) approach to maximum likelihood reconstruction from emission tomography data, but aims instead at maximum posterior probability estimation, which takes account of prior belief about smoothness in the isotope concentration. A novel modification to the EM algorithm yields a practical method. The method is illustrated by an application to data from brain scans.
