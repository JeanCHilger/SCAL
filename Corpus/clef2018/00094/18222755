An evaluation of maximum likelihood reconstruction for SPECT. A reconstruction method for SPECT (single photon emission computerized tomography) that uses the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion and an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm solution is examined. The method is based on a model that incorporates the physical effects of photon statistics, nonuniform photon attenuation, and a camera-dependent point-spread response function. Reconstructions from simulation experiments are presented which illustrate the ability of the ML algorithm to correct for attenuation and point-spread. Standard filtered backprojection method reconstructions, using experimental and simulated data, are included for reference. Three studies were designed to focus on the effects of noise and point-spread, on the effect of nonuniform attenuation, and on the combined effects of all three. The last study uses a chest phantom and simulates Tl-201 imaging of the myocardium. A quantitative analysis of the reconstructed images is used to support the conclusion that the ML algorithm produces reconstructions that exhibit improved signal-to-noise ratios, improved image resolution, and image quantifiability.
