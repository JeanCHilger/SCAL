Immobilization device for in vivo and in vitro multimodality image registration of rodent tumors. Biological image-guided radiotherapy requires that PET accurately identifies biologically relevant sub-volumes within a tumor. In this framework, an immobilization device was developed to study multi-imaging (CT, micro-MRI, micro-PET, and autoradiography) registration of mouse tumors. The registration accuracy assessed by calculating the average minimal distance between two skew lines was in the order of 0.2-0.3 mm.
