Pharmacological MRI in animal models: a useful tool for 5-HT research? Pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) offers the potential to provide novel insights into the functioning of neurotransmitter systems and drug action in the central nervous system. To date, much of the neuropharmacological research that has applied phMRI techniques has focused on the dopaminergic system with relatively few studies into serotonergic function. In this article, we discuss the current capabilities of, and future potential for phMRI to address fundamental questions in serotonergic research using animal models. Firstly we review existing literature on the application of phMRI to the serotonergic system by exploring 3 broad research themes: (i) the functional anatomy of the serotonergic system (ii) drug-receptor targeting and distribution
