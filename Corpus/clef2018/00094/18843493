CT, MR, US,18F-FDG PET/CT, and their combined use for the assessment of cervical lymph node metastases in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare the diagnostic value of four different imaging methods-computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, ultrasonography (US), and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT-and their combined use for preoperative detection of cervical nodal metastases in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Sixty-seven patients (58 men and 9 women mean age, 60.1 years) with head and neck SCCs underwent CT, MR, US, and PET/CT before surgery. First, each study was reviewed separately for the presence of nodal metastases. Then, the value of combined images was assessed based on a confidence rating score for each modality assigned by observers. These results were verified, on a level-by-level basis, with histopathologic findings. Histopathologic examination revealed nodal metastases in 74 of 402 nodal levels. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 77.0%, 99.4%, and 95.3% for CT and MR
