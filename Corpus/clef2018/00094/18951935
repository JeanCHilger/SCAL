Plasma brain natriuretic peptide at rest and after adenosine-induced myocardial ischemia in normotensive and essential hypertensive patients with suspected coronary artery disease. This study investigated plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in normotensive and hypertensive patients with suspected coronary artery disease during radionuclide pharmacological stress testing. Twenty-seven normotensive patients (15 males, aged 63.0+/-4.5 years and 12 females, aged 63.0+/-4.1 years) and 38 essential hypertensive patients (25 males, aged 63.3+/-3.3 years and 13 females, aged 64.6+/-2.6 years) with chest pain and exercise stress testing inconclusive for coronary artery disease underwent myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using adenosine infusion. SPECT identified patients without (16 normotensive and 22 hypertensive) and patients with (11 normotensive and 16 hypertensive) transient perfusion defects. Basal BNP levels in normotensive patients without transient myocardial ischemia (3.1+/-1.2 fmol/ml) were significantly (P<0.01) lower than those observed in normotensive patients with transient ischemia (8.2+/-1.2 fmol/ml), whereas BNP levels in hypertensive patients without transient ischemia (8.2+/-1.0 fmol/ml) did not significantly differ from those in hypertensive patients with transient ischemia (8.1+/-2.0 fmol/ml). No significant difference was found in BNP levels between males or females either in normotensive or hypertensive patients without or with ischemia. Adenosine infusion did not significantly change BNP levels in any subject group without or with myocardial perfusion defects. Our findings show that increases in BNP allow early detection of myocardial ischemia in normotensive patients, but not in hypertensive patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Adenosine-induced myocardial ischemia does not affect BNP production already activated by coronary artery disease in normotensive patients and by hemodynamic changes in hypertensive patients.
