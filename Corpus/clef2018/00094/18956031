99m-Technetium carbohydrate conjugates as potential agents in molecular imaging. This feature article covers recent reports of work towards the development of (99m)Tc-carbohydrate based agents for use in SPECT imaging, particularly of cancerous tissue. An outline of some of the key biological functions and coordination chemistry of carbohydrates is given, along with an introduction to bioconjugation and molecular imaging. Technetium coordination chemistry and the subset of this involving bioconjugates are discussed before moving into the focus of the article: glycoconjugates of (99m)Tc(v) and the more recently developed [(99m)Tc(I)(CO)(3)](+). Significant work in the last decade has featured the very attractive [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+) core, and the ligand sets designed for this core are discussed in detail.
