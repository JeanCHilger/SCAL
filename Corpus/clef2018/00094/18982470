Clinical significance of diastolic function as an indicator of myocardial ischemia assessed by 16-frame gated myocardial perfusion SPECT. Studies have suggested that ischemia-induced diastolic dysfunction persists longer than systolic dysfunction. We examined whether global left ventricular (LV) diastolic function during stress testing assessed by 16-frame gated myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is useful as an indicator of myocardial ischemia.Thirty-nine patients underwent 16-frame technetium-99m (Tc-99m) quantitative gated SPECT (QGS), including treadmill exercise testing for suspected ischemic heart disease. Diastolic parameters of the first-third filling fraction (1/3FF), and the peak filling rate (PFR) were calculated by a time-volume curve from the QGS data.The patients were divided into four groups, namely, IS, NL, DN, and DD, on the basis of tracer accumulation and the LV ejection fraction (LVEF) at rest. In the IS group (reversible tracer uptake reduction suggesting ischemia n=11), LVEF, 1/3FF, and PFR after stress were significantly lower than those at rest, whereas in the NL group (normal perfusionAltered global LV diastolic function during stress assessed by 16-frame gated myocardial perfusion SPECT is useful for the detection of myocardial ischemia. However, similar findings are observed in patients with cardiac dysfunction but without detectable ischemia. Our findings do suggest that tests should be performed with caution to determine whether ischemia exists on the basis of altered global LV function after stress in patients with cardiac dysfunction.
