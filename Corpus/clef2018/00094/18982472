Correlation between FDG-PET findings and GLUT1 expression in salivary gland pleomorphic adenomas. One reason for the difficulty in accurate preoperative pathological diagnosis of major salivary gland tumors with fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is the tendency of pleomorphic adenomas to have a high, standardized uptake value (SUV). The expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and the quantity of GLUT1 messenger RNA (mRNA) were analyzed in specimens of pleomorphic adenoma to identify whether GLUT1 is responsible for the increased glucose uptake in FDG-PET examinations of these tumors.Eighty salivary gland tumors resected at Yokohama City University Hospital were retrospectively investigated. FDG-PET was performed prior to surgery. PET images were evaluated by two experienced radiologists. GLUT1 was immunohistochemically stained, and GLUT1 mRNA density was quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction in 10 of 40 pleomorphic adenomas.The pleomorphic adenomas stained positively for GLUT1, and there was significant correlation between the GLUT1 index and the SUV in FDG-PET.GLUT1 is expressed in salivary gland pleomorphic adenomas. Furthermore, the GLUT1 index shows significant correlation with the SUV of FDGPET. This result suggests that GLUT1 plays an important role in increasing FDG uptake in salivary gland pleomorphic adenomas.
