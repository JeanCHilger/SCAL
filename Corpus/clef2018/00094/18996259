The role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the evaluation of oesophageal carcinoma. Integrated positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is now established in the management of oncology patients. With increasing availability and a constantly advancing body of evidence, the role of FDG PET/CT in oesophageal cancer is set to expand to include initial staging, assessment of disease response, therapy planning, and detection of disease recurrence. This article reviews the utility of FDG PET/CT in the management of oesophageal carcinoma, discussing its role and limitations in the imaging of these patients.
