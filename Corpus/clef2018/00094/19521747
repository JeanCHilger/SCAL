Characterization of Japanese standards for myocardial sympathetic and metabolic imaging in comparison with perfusion imaging. The standard patterns of myocardial radiotracer distribution of (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and (123)I-beta-methyl-p-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) should be defined in a Japanese population. The purpose of this study was to present and provide data on the characteristics of MIBG and BMIPP with respect to myocardial single photon emission computed tomography.The normal database included (123)I-MIBG and (123)I-BMIPP imaging and a (99m)Tc-sestamibi/tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion study. The projection images were transferred by digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) format and reconstructed and analyzed with polar maps.The projection data from multiple centers were successfully transferred to a common format for SPECT reconstruction. When the average values were analyzed using a 17-segment model, MIBG uptake in the inferior and apical wall appeared to be slightly lower than anterior uptake (P < 0.05). The inferior and apical uptake of MIBG has a larger standard deviation (10.7 units in males, 12.6 units in females). BMIPP uptakes in the septal wall have higher than that of (99m)Tc-tracer uptake (P < 0.05).Myocardial sympathetic nerve and metabolic scintigraphy data that were specific for the Japanese population were generated and found to be different from that of perfusion tracers. The normal database can serve as a standard for nuclear cardiology work conducted in Japan.
