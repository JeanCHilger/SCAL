PET--a simpler approach for determining prescriptions for adequate dialysis therapy. Fast Pet test is a modified version of original PET. Only one dialysate sample for glucose and creatinine is taken from the total drained dialysate and a blood sample at the end of the test exchange. It can be used both for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. The Pet and clearance measurements are complementary studies which can guide in dialysis prescription.
