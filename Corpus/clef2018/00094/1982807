A method to assess efficacy of CAPD: preliminary results. Adequacy of dialysis is a primary concern when caring for patients undergoing continuous peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). To determine objectively the efficacy of CAPD, the use of an 'efficacy number' (EN) calculated from the data obtained in a peritoneal equilibration test (PET) for creatinine (cr) is proposed: EN = [cr(D/P) x V24] divided by ACPPD3 Where, cr(D/P) is PET-derived dialysate/plasma ratio for creatinine at 4 hrs V24 is the volume of exchanges (L) prescribed for 24 hrs
