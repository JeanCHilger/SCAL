Novel imaging modalities in gynecologic cancer. Novel imaging modalities continue to emerge in medicine, and the advent of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has had a significant impact in the imaging of gynecologic malignancies. In cervical cancer, FDG-PET has excellent sensitivity and specificity for evaluation of initial disease, as well as assessment of post-treatment response and long-term surveillance. In ovarian cancer, FDG-PET can be a useful tool in assessing recurrent disease, especially in the setting of a rising cancer antigen-125 with a negative or equivocal CT or MRI. In uterine cancer, FDG-PET has been investigated in evaluating the extent of disease including nodal metastases, and in assessing recurrence. This article reviews novel imaging modalities in gynecologic cancer, with a special focus on FDG-PET/CT.
