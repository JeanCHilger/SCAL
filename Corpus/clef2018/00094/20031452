Advanced carotid plaque imaging. Treatment of carotid artery stenosis by endarterectomy or stenting can significantly reduce stroke risk. In clinical practice, indication for surgery or stenting is primarily based on the degree of stenosis, but there is growing awareness that pathophysiological features within a vulnerable plaque play a key role in predicting stroke risk. Important molecular processes associated with plaque vulnerability are inflammation, lipid accumulation, proteolysis, apoptosis, angiogenesis and thrombosis. The rapidly emerging field of molecular and functional imaging strategies allows identification of pathophysiological processes in carotid artery stenosis. We aimed to review the literature regarding the current most promising advanced imaging techniques in carotid artery disease. Various advanced imaging methods are available, such as high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET) and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF). Radionuclide and fluorescent tracers that identify inflammation, apoptosis and proteolysis, such as FDG, MMP probes and Annexin A5, are promising. A combination of activity of molecular processes and detailed anatomic information can be obtained, providing a powerful tool in the identification of the vulnerable plaque. With these developments, we are entering a new era of imaging techniques in the selection of patients for carotid surgery.
