Magnetic resonance lymphography in gynaecological malignancies. Following the submission of this article to Cancer Imaging, unfortunately the European manufacturer of ferumoxtran-10 (Guerbet) has withdrawn the product pending further phase III studies. This is secondary to the view of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use that the phase III data did not provide adequate statistical demonstration of the product's efficacy. Magnetic resonance lymphography holds much promise for the non-invasive evaluation of lymph nodes. The technique utilizes ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide and has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of malignant lymph nodes. This article reviews the technique and the performance of magnetic resonance lymphography in studies to date alternative newer methods of nodal assessment such as fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging are also discussed, with emphasis on gynaecological malignancies.
