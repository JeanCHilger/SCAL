Imaging in radiation oncology: a perspective. An inherent goal of radiation therapy is to deliver enough dose to the tumor to eradicate all cancer cells or to palliate symptoms, while avoiding normal tissue injury. Imaging for cancer diagnosis, staging, treatment planning, and radiation targeting has been integrated in various ways to improve the chance of this occurring. A large spectrum of imaging strategies and technologies has evolved in parallel to advances in radiation delivery. The types of imaging can be categorized into offline imaging (outside the treatment room) and online imaging (inside the treatment room, conventionally termed image-guided radiation therapy). The direct integration of images in the radiotherapy planning process (physically or computationally) often entails trade-offs in imaging performance. Although such compromises may be acceptable given specific clinical objectives, general requirements for imaging performance are expected to increase as paradigms for radiation delivery evolve to address underlying biology and adapt to radiation responses. This paper reviews the integration of imaging and radiation oncology, and discusses challenges and opportunities for improving the practice of radiation oncology with imaging.
