A meta-analysis of 18FDG-PET, MRI and bone scintigraphy for diagnosis of bone metastases in patients with breast cancer. To perform a meta-analysis comparing the diagnostic value of (18)FDG-PET, MRI, and bone scintigraphy (BS) in detecting bone metastases in patients with breast cancer.MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Web of Knowledge, EBSCO, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review databases were searched for relevant original articles published from January 1995 to January 2010. Inclusion criteria was as follows: (18)FDG-PET, MRI or (99m)Tc-MDP BS was performed to detect bone metastases (the number of published CT studies was inadequate for meta-analysis and therefore could not be included in this study) sufficient data were presented to construct a 2 × 2 contingency tableThirteen articles consisting of 23 studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria. On a per-patient basis, the pooled sensitivity estimates for MRI (97.1%) were significantly higher than those for PET (83.3%) and BS (87.0% P <0.05). There was no significant difference between PET and BS (P <0.05). The pooled specificity estimates for PET (94.5%) and MRI (97.0%) were both significantly higher than those for BS (88.1%Magnetic resonance imaging was found to be better than (18)FDG-PET and BS for diagnosis of bone metastases in patients with breast cancer on a per-patient basis. On a per-lesion basis, (18)FDG-PET had lower sensitivity, higher specificity, a higher DOR, and a higher *Q index than BS.
