Plastic transformation of PET images. A theory and technique are presented that allow nonlinear resampling of positron emission tomography data to remove nonlinear differences in brain shape. The resampling is determined empirically by a function relating the observed image and a desired template. The validity, reliability, and precision of the plastic transformation are compared with linear rescaling alone, within, and between subjects.
