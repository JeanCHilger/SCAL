 The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) plays a major role in a variety of brain functions, such as appetite, sleep, and mood. Neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease (1-3), involve a dysfunction of the brain’s 5-HT system. The serotonergic neurons – present in wide areas of the brain, including the raphe nuclei, hypothalamus, thalamus, and cerebral cortex – bear a protein called “serotonin transporter” (SERT) (4).The SERT, located on the cell bodies and terminals of 5-HT neurons, is a specific marker for the number and integrity of presynaptic terminals of serotonin-producing neurons. It regulates neurotransmission by removing released 5-HT from the extracellular space back into the presynaptic neuron. Commonly prescribed antidepressants are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and their effects are obtained through interaction with (and inhibition of) the SERT (5). For that reason,
