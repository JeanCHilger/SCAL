 Apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of many diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, vascular disorders, and chronic hepatitis, as well as in the biology of normal cells, such as epithelial cells and immune cells (1). During apoptosis, there is rapid redistribution of phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) from the inner membrane leaflet to the outer membrane leaflet, exposing the anionic head group. Duramycin (Mw = 2 kDa) is a tetracyclic peptide of 19 amino acids that is produced by
