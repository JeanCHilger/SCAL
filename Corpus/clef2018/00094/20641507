 Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a 53-amino acid cytokine (6.2 kDa) secreted by ectodermic cells, monocytes, kidneys and duodenal glands (1). EGF stimulates growth of epidermal and epithelial cells. EGF receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane protein with an intracellular tyrosine kinase present on most cells. EGFR is overexpressed on many solid tumor cells such as breast, non-small-cell lung, head and neck, and colon cancer (2-4). The high level of EGFR expression on cancer cells is associated with a poor prognosis (5-7). Inhibition of EGF receptor functions by C225 (also known as centuximab), an anti-EGFR chimeric monoclonal antibody, has been shown to inhibit tumor angiogenesis, growth and metastasis (8, 9).
