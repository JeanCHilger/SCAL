 Bisphosphonates (BPs) or nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (NBPs) are often used for the management of pain palliation and disorders related to skeletal tissue, including those arising from cancer metastases, because these compounds exhibit a very high affinity for hydroxyapatite (HA), a component of the bone matrix (1). The NBPs tend to accumulate in osteoclasts at areas of increased bone metabolism by inhibiting the farnesyl diphosphate synthase, an important enzyme of the mevalonate pathway in the cell (2). Several BPs and NBPs are available commercially for clinical use to treat different bone disorders, and there are ongoing clinical trials approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to evaluate these compounds for the treatment of various bone ailments. In addition, BPs are often labeled with
