A simple positron emission tomography-based calibration for perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance maps to optimize penumbral flow detection in acute stroke. Perfusion-weighted (PW) MRI is increasingly used to identify the tissue at risk. The adequate PW-MRI map and threshold remain controversial due to a considerable individual variation of values. By comparative positron emission tomography, we evaluated a simple MR-based and positron emission tomography-validated calibration of PW maps.PW-MRI and quantitative positron emission tomography (15O-water) of patients with acute stroke were used to calculate averaged as well as individual thresholds of penumbral flow (positron emission tomography cerebral blood flow (<20 mL/100 g/min) for maps of time to peak, mean transit time, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral blood volume. A linear regression analysis studied the variability of the individual thresholds using 3 different PW reference regions (hemispheric, white matter, gray matter). The best model was used for volumetric analysis to compare averaged and scaled individual thresholds and to calculate look-up tables for PW maps.In 26 patients, the averaged thresholds were (median/interquartile range): cerebral blood flow 21.7 mL/100 g/min (19.9 to 32) cerebral blood volume 1.5 mL/100 g (0.9 to 1.8)The individual variation of PW values, even if calculated by deconvolution, remains a major obstacle in quantitative PW imaging and can be significantly improved by a simple MR-based calibration. Easily applicable look-up tables identify the individual best threshold for each PW map to optimize mismatch detection.
