Nanoparticulate radiolabelled quinolines detect amyloid plaques in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Detecting aggregated amyloid peptides (Abeta plaques) presents targets for developing biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Polymeric n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (PBCA) nanoparticles (NPs) were encapsulated with radiolabelled amyloid affinity (125)I-clioquinol (CQ, 5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline) as in vivo probes. (125)I-CQ-PBCA NPs crossed the BBB (2.3 +/- 0.9 ID/g) (P < .05) in the WT mouse (N = 210), compared to (125)I-CQ (1.0 +/- 0.4 ID/g). (125)I-CQ-PBCA NP brain uptake increased in AD transgenic mice (APP/PS1) versus WT (N = 38 2.54 x 10(5) +/- 5.31 x 10(4) DLU/mm(2)
