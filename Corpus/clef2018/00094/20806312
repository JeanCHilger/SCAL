Synthesis and evaluation of bombesin analogues conjugated to two different triazolyl-derived chelators for (99m)Tc labeling. Overexpression of the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) in a variety of human carcinomas has provided a means of diagnosis and treatment. Previously we reported a metabolically stable (N(α)His)Ac-βAla-βAla-[Cha(13),Nle(14)]BBS(7-14) analogue with high affinity for the GRPR. We have also shown that the biodistribution pattern of this fairly lipophilic, radiolabeled peptide can be enhanced by glycation, which is easily carried out by Cu(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition. Herein, we further elaborate this "click approach" in the synthesis of a new series of triazole-based chelating systems as alternatives to the (N(α)His)Ac chelator for labeling with the (99m)Tc(CO)(3) core. The bombesin analogues, containing these new chelating systems, were evaluated with regard to their synthesis and in vitro and in vivo properties, and were compared with their (N(α)His)Ac counterparts. The influence of the chelator on biodistribution properties was less than that of glycation, which clearly improved the tumor-to-background ratios.
