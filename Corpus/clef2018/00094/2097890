SPECT in the presurgical evaluation of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy--a preliminary report. Twenty-eight patients with drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (DRTLE) were studied using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using xenon-133 inhalation and Tc99m-d, 1-HMPAO with TOMOMATIC 64 as part of a presurgical evaluation programme. The visually evaluated flow-images were studied after blinding and the results subsequently compared to the EEG, MRI and CT scanning studies. In 24 patients a significant low flow region was seen in one temporal lobe. The SPECT result corresponded to the EEG findings in all but 6 patients. In 2 of these patients no side localization was indicated by EEG, while in four patients the EEG suggested that the opposite side was epileptogenic. Ictal SPECT and MRI/CT agreed with the resting SPECT study in three patients, while one patient has remained undiagnosed with respect to side-localization. In 14 patients discordance between SPECT and the CT scan was observed, but in 11 of these patients the SPECT study correlated with the other focal diagnostic tools. In 11 of the 21 patients studied by MRI, the results corresponded to SPECT in 7 of the 10 which did not correspond, ictal studies of EEG and SPECT defined the side, in four of these 7 patients. Using the neuroimaging tools in concert 16 patients have been selected for surgery. All patients have benefited from surgery. These preliminary results correspond favourably with earlier studies comparing SPECT and PET with CT, MR and EEG.
