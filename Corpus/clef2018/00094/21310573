A new arginase enzymatic reactor: development and application for the research of plant-derived inhibitors. This work was dedicated to the development of a new micro immobilized enzyme reactor (IMER) by using an in situ procedure. Arginase was covalently immobilized on an ethylenediamine (EDA) monolithic convective interaction media (CIM) disk (12mm Ã— 3mm i.d.) previously derivatized with glutaraldehyde. The activity of this IMER was investigated by inserting this micro-IMER in a HPLC system. The effect of the arginase inhibitors was evaluated by the simultaneous injection of each inhibitor with the nitro guanidino benzene (NGB) substrate. The relative IC50 values were found in agreement with those derived by the conventional spectrometric method. This arginase micro-IMER system was also used to study the effects of plant-derived products on the arginase activity. The pet ether extract from the stem bark of the plant Ficus glomerata Roxob. and the procyanidin oligomers of cocoa and chocolate inhibit the arginase activity. Our results confirmed the direct effect of some plant extracts on the arginase activity and their interest in therapies for treating several NO-dependent smooth disorders.
