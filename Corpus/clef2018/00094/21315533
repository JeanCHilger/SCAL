Arterial spin-labeling MR imaging in moyamoya disease compared with SPECT imaging. Arterial spin-labeling (ASL) is a noninvasive magnetic resonance (MR) imaging method used to obtain brain perfusion information on various cerebrovascular diseases. We retrospectively compared the use of ASL-MRI and single-photon emission CT (SPECT) imaging to determine absolute cerebral blood flow (CBF) in moyamoya disease.CBF examinations using ASL-MRI on 3-T MRI and SPECT imagings with iodine-123-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine at resting (rest-IMP) and after acetazolamide challenge (ACZ-IMP) were performed on 12 patients with moyamoya disease (men, 5 women, 7The ASL-value, rest-IMP-value, ACZ-IMP-value, and CVR (average±standard deviation) were 26.6±14.8 (mL/100 g/min), 27.5±6.4 (mL/100 g/min), 37.1±13.2 (mL/100 g/min), and 35.9±44.3 (%), respectively. Significant relationships between the ASL-value versus (vs.) the rest-IMP-value (rs=0.500, p<0.05), the ASL-value vs. the ACZ-IMP-value (rs=0.863, p<0.01), and the ASL-value vs. the CVR (rs=0.699, p<0.01) were observed.Although the ASL-value was lower than the rest-IMP-value, the significant relationship between the ASL-value and the rest-IMP-value may suggest that perfusion imaging by ASL-MRI could be used to recognize the condition of brain perfusion. In particular, the stronger correlation coefficient between the ASL-value and ACZ-IMP-value might suggest that perfusion imaging by ASL-MRI could show the potentially dangerous zone for ischemia.
