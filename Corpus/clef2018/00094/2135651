The investigation of osteoradionecrosis of the mandible by 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate radionuclide bone scans. The need for a reliable non-invasive investigation in osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the mandible is discussed. The results of 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scans using single photon emission tomography, and measuring dynamic uptake in 13 patients are presented. These suggest that sites of osteoradionecrosis may be defined by a paradoxically increased uptake of 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate.
