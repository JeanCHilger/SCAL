Single-photon emission computed tomography enhanced Tc-99m-pertechnetate disodium-labelled red blood cell scintigraphy in the localization of small intestine bleeding: a single-centre twelve-year study. To present our experience with the detection of bleeding in the small intestine by means of scintigraphy with in vivo-labelled red blood cells (RBCs) in the period of 1998-2009.A 12-year prospective study was accomplished with 40 patients (23 men, 17 women, aged 12-91, mean 56 years) who had lower gastrointestinal bleeding (obscure-overt bleeding) and underwent scintigraphy with in vivo-labelled RBCs by means of technetium 99m. The scintigraphy was usually performed after other diagnostic tests had failed to locate the bleeding.A total of 26 patients had a positive scintigraphy with in vivo-labelled RBCs and 14 patients had negative scintigraphy. The final diagnosis was confirmed in 20 of 26 patients with a positive scintigraphy by push enteroscopy (6/20), intraoperative enteroscopy (7/20), surgery (4/20), duodenoscopy (1/20), double-balloon enteroscopy (1/20) and X-ray angiography (1/20). The correct location of the bleeding site was identified by RBC scintigraphy in 15 of 20 (75%) patients with the confirmed source. The locations of the bleeding site identified by scintigraphy and enteroscopy (push, intraoperative) and surgical investigations were highly correlated in patients with a positive scintigraphy within the first 3 h. Eleven of the 20 correctly localized studies and none of the incorrectly localized studies were positive in the dynamic phase of imaging. In 5 patients (all erroneously localized), scintigraphy was positive only at a period longer than 18 h.RBC scintigraphy is an effective imaging modality in localizing lower gastrointestinal bleeding in patients for whom other diagnostic tests have failed to locate the bleeding. RBC scintigraphy can be successful in the detection of bleeding sites in the small intestine.
