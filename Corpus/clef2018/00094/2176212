Rapid protein kinase C-dependent activation of phospholipase D leads to delayed 1,2-diglyceride accumulation. We have shown previously that the major source of diglyceride (DG) formed following muscarinic receptor (mAChR) stimulation of 1321N1 astrocytoma cells is phosphatidylcholine (PC) rather than the phosphoinositides (Martinson, E. A., Goldstein, D., and Brown, J. H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 14748-14754). We have also noted that there is a delay of several minutes before significant DG accumulation is observed. In the present work, we examine the time course and mechanism of PC hydrolysis in response to mAChR stimulation. Treatment of 1321N1 cells with carbachol results in increases in radiolabeled choline, phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylethanol (PEt), metabolites that are products of phospholipase D (PLD) action on PC. These products are all formed within 15 s of mAChR stimulation and reach a plateau within 30-60 s. The time course of PEt formation suggests that PLD is no longer activated after several minutes of mAChR stimulation. Thus there is a discrepancy between the rapid and transient activation of PLD and the delayed accumulation of DG. It appears that most of the DG is formed through the action of PLD, since propranolol (which inhibits the conversion of PA to DG) and down-regulation of protein kinase C (which prevents activation of PLD by carbachol) both markedly inhibit DG production. Using a protocol in which cells are stimulated with carbachol for only one minute (a period during which PLD and PA formation are maximally activated), we show that DG mass continues to increase following removal of agonist. We suggest that the rapid and transient activation of PLD results in delayed accumulation of DG due to the relatively slow conversion of PA to DG by PA phosphatase.
