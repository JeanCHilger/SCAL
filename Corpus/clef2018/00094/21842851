Flexible graphene-based electroluminescent devices. For the first time, large-area CVD-grown graphene films transferred onto flexible PET substrates were used as transparent conductive electrodes in alternating current electroluminescence (ACEL) devices. The flexible ACEL device based on a single-layer graphene electrode has a turn-on voltage of 80 V at 480 V (16 kHz), the luminance and luminous efficiency are 1140 cd/m(2) and 5.0 lm/W, respectively. The turn-on voltage increases and the luminance decreases with increasing stacked layers of graphene, which means the single-layer graphene is the best optimal choice as the transparent conductive electrode. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the graphene-based ACEL device is highly flexible and can work very well even under a very large strain of 5.4%, suggesting great potential applications in flexible optoelectronics.
