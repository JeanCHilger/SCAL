Diagnostic strategy of incidental findings of focal thyroid FDG uptake identified on PET/CT. Incidental findings of focal fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the thyroid occurs more frequently with increased use of positron emission tomography (PET) with a frequency of 1-4% and a risk of cancer in the thyroid of > 30%. This article reviews the existing literature and recommends a diagnostic strategy to identify patients with high risk of thyroid malignancy. The diagnostic process should include measurement of thyroid function, thyroid scintigraphy and in patients with cold nodules detected by scintigraphy additional ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy.
