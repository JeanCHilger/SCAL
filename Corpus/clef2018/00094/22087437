Currently applied cross-sectional diagnostic modalities and imaging guided interventional modalities for treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. Technological advances in conventional cross-sectional diagnostic imaging have allowed important modalities like ultrasonography, endoscopic ultrasonography, multi-detector computed tomography, nuclear medicine single photon emission tomography, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to exhibit an increasingly important role in the diagnosis and management of patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET). The arterial supply of metastatic lesions provides promising treatment options through the arterial route, hence transcatheter arterial embolization has a key role in the therapeutic management of metastatic NET. The various transcatheter methods of NET treatment are discussed, including radio-embolization. Imaging-guided percutaneous interventional radiologic methods of ablation are also discussed as applicable for the effective management of primary and metastatic NET. An approach to represent the physical and technical principles on which ablative methods rely and their clinical significance has been attempted.
