Transbilayer phospholipids molecular imaging.  Nuclear medicine has become a key part of molecular imaging. In the present review article, we focus on the transbilayer phospholipids as exquisite targets for radiolabelled probes in molecular imaging. Asymmetry of phospholipid distribution is a characteristic of mammalian cell membranes. Phosphatidylcholine and sphyngomyelin cholinophospholipids are primarily located within the external leaflet of the cell membrane. Phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine aminophospholipids, and also phosphatidylinositol are primarily located within the internal leaflet of the cell membrane. New radiolabelled tracers have been designed in preclinical and clinical research for PET-CT and SPECT-CT molecular imaging of transbilayer phospholipids.
