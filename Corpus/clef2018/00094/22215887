Clinical utility of ¹⁸F FDG-PET/CT in the detection of bone marrow disease in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential role of fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT in the detection of bone/bone marrow disease in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL).We retrospectively reviewed ((18)F)-FDG-PET/CT scans of 122 newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven cases of HL performed between November 2009 and June 2010. All the patients were staged before treatment by both PET/CT and bone marrow biopsy (BMB). Patients were subdivided into three groups based on the findings of FDG-PET/CT. Group A consisted of patients showing diffuse FDG uptake, Group B consisted of patients showing unifocal FDG uptake and Group C patients showed multifocal FDG-avid foci on PET/CT scans. Bone marrow results were also reviewed and considered positive if lymphomatous involvement was detected on bone marrow trephine biopsy. BMB results were correlated with FDG-PET/CT findings.There were 122 patients in total-81 (66.4%) were male and 41 (33.6%) were female. The age range was from 6 years to 78 years (mean 35.70 years). PET/CT was reported as negative for bone/bone marrow involvement in 85 (69.7%) patients, while the remaining 37 showed abnormal FDG uptake. The sensitivity of FDG-PET/CT was calculated to be 100%, the specificity was 76.57%, the negative predictive value was 76.57%, the positive predictive value was 29.72% and the diagnostic accuracy was 78.62%.(18)F-FDG-PET/CT and BMB are complementary in the evaluation of bone marrow disease.
