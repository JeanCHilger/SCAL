Costimulated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are a feasible and safe alternative donor cell therapy for relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), a standard relapse treatment after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (AlloSCT), has limited efficacy and often triggers GVHD. We hypothesized that after AlloSCT tumor-infiltrating donor lymphocytes could be costimulated ex vivo to preferentially activate/expand antitumor effectors. We tested the feasibility and safety of costimulated, tumor-derived donor lymphocyte (TDL) infusion in a phase 1 trial. Tumor was resected from 8 patients with B-cell malignancy progression post-AlloSCT tumor cell suspensions were costimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 Ab-coated magnetic beads and cultured to generate TDL products for each patient. Costimulation yielded increased proportions of T-bet(+)FoxP3(-) type 1 effector donor T cells. A median of 2.04 Ã— 10(7) TDL/kg was infused
