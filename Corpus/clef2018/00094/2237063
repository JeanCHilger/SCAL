Diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of the initial epileptic seizure. We present the concept of an 'epileptic syndrome' which is important for prognostic statements and the application of appropriate therapeutic measures. We then discuss the epileptic seizure and the assessment of suspected seizure, indications for admission to a hospital, diagnostic measures (EEG, CT scan, laboratory tests, lumbal puncture, MRI scan, PET scan, angiography), therapy and procedures for imminent status epilepticus. Finally, we try to answer the question whether anticonvulsant medication should be instituted after a first epileptic seizure.
