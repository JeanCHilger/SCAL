 Endothelial cells are important cells in inflammatory responses (1, 2). Bacterial lipopolysaccharide, virus, inflammation, and tissue injury increase tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and secretion of other cytokines and chemokines. Leukocyte emigration from blood is dependent on rolling of leukocytes along endothelial cell surfaces and subsequent adherence to endothelial cell surfaces. Inflammatory mediators and cytokines induce chemokine secretion from endothelial cells and other vascular cells and increase their expression of cell surface adhesion molecules, such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), integrins, and selectins. Chemokines are chemotactic to leukocytes attracting them to sites of inflammation and tissue injury. The movement of leukocytes and tumor cells through endothelial junctions into the extravascular space is highly orchestrated through various interactions with different adhesion molecules on endothelial cells (3, 4). P-selectin is found on the cell surface of endothelial cells and platelets (5, 6). It binds to glycoprotein on the cell surface of leukocytes. IL-1 and TNFα, released from inflammatory and ischemic stimuli, stimulate expression of P-selectin and other adhesion molecules on the vascular endothelial cells leading to leukocyte adhesion to the activated endothelium and platelets. P-selectin and other adhesion molecules are involved in rolling and arresting leukocytes on the endothelium prior to leukocyte migration into the extravascular space. Fucoidan (a sialy-Lewis
