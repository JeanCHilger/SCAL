Localization of peripheral cholecystokinin receptors in vivo using the cholecystokinin antagonist [3H](+/-)-MK-329. Cholecystokinin (CCK) regulates various gastrointestinal functions through specific receptors. The mechanisms responsible for disorders of these functions could be elucidated by non-invasively localizing CCK receptors and quantifying their number in vivo. MK-329 is a highly selective and very high affinity antagonist at the peripheral CCK receptor. We investigated the in vivo binding of [3H](+/-)-MK-329 in mice to determine if binding to CCK receptors could be detected after systemic administration of the tracer. The uptake of [3H](+/-)-MK-329 increased in the pancreas from 5 min to 4 h after administration. The binding was saturable, stereospecific, and more than 80% specific. A total/non-specific binding ratio of 43 was reached at 8 h post-injection. The pancreas was the only organ where specific binding could be detected. Our results suggest that MK-329 labeled with a positron emitter such as C-11 could be used with positron emission tomography to image and quantify peripheral CCK receptors in man.
