The measurement of cerebral perfusion and hemodynamic reserve using SPECT: use in cerebral vascular pathology. The isolated measurement of cerebral blood flow can lead to gross errors in vascular disease, particularly ischaemic disease, because of disruption of the relations between blood flow and metabolism. In contrast, the measurement of cerebral blood flow combined with measurement of the haemodynamic reserve overcomes these difficulties, regardless of the method of evaluation: reactivity to CO2 or to acetazolamide measurement of the flow/volume ratio. The author demonstrates that these measurements are even more valuable in situations in which morphological examinations (MRI or computed tomography) are of little value: transient ischaemic attacks, asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, etc. However, these measurements are useful in constituted infarctions or in vasospasm to assess the distant effects or to guide the therapeutic adjustment or even to provide prognostic elements. Combined measurement of perfusion and haemodynamic reserve, although it does not constitute a formal proof, is now largely accessible by means of non-specialized gamma cameras with determination of the flow/volume ratio.
