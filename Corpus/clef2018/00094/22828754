Preprocedural imaging for patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure. Various electrophysiological procedures and device implantation has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and patients with heart failure (HF). Noninvasive cardiac imaging is used extensively in the preprocedural patient selection and for procedural guidance. In this review, we will discuss the application of preprocedural cardiac imaging in patients with AF prior to pulmonary vein and left atrial ablation as well as insertion of left atrial occluder device. We also discuss the role of noninvasive cardiac imaging in the selection of appropriate HF patients for device therapy as well as their use in guiding implantation of biventricular pacemaker for cardiac resynchronization therapy by assessing left ventricular ejection fraction, coronary venous anatomy, mechanical dyssynchrony and myocardial scar. We describe new research associated with preprocedural imaging in these patient cohorts.
