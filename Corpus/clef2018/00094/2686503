Applications of magnetic resonance imaging and three-dimensional computed tomography in emergency medicine. Numerous technical advances have occurred in diagnostic imaging during the past decade, including digital subtraction angiography, ultrafast computed tomography (CT) scanning, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and availability of three-dimensional graphic representation of anatomy acquired through cross-sectional imaging methods. The potential applications of MRI and three-dimensional display CT scanning in the diagnosis of acute trauma are the focuses of this review.
