Clinical results of extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery in patients with hemodynamic cerebrovascular disease. The importance of hemodynamic factors in the pathogenesis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease remains uncertain. The extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass trial has been criticized for failing to identify and separately analyze those patients with chronic reduction in regional cerebral perfusion pressure (rCPP) who might be most likely to benefit from surgery. Positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and blood volume (rCBV) were performed on 29 patients with symptomatic occlusion or intracranial stenosis of the carotid arterial system prior to undergoing EC-IC bypass surgery. Twenty-four patients had evidence of reduced rCPP (increased rCBV/rCBF ratio) distal to the arterial lesion. Of 21 patients who survived surgery without stroke, three suffered ipsilateral ischemic strokes during the 1st postoperative year. A nonrandomized control group of 23 nonsurgical patients' with similar clinical, arteriographic, and PET characteristics experienced no ipsilateral ischemic strokes during the 1st year following PET. Based on these results in 44 patients, the probability that successful surgery reduces the occurrence of ipsilateral ischemic stroke 1 year later was calculated. This probability ranged from 0.045 for a 50% reduction to 0.168 for a 10% reduction. Thus, there was little evidence to suggest that measurements of cerebral hemodynamics can identify a group of patients who would benefit from EC-IC bypass surgery.
