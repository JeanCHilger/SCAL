A unified design algorithm of two-dimensional digital filters for radioisotope image processing. A unified design algorithm of two-dimensional digital filters for radioisotope image processing based on the Fourier-Bessel transform and the weighted least-squares method is described. The algorithm presented here can treat the various kinds of two-dimensional digital filters in a unified approach. Design examples are presented and several graphs are included to show the relationships between the design parameters as an aid in practical applications. The application of the method in radioisotope image processing is also presented. Several low-pass, Wiener and band-pass filters were designed using the method and applied to some clinical data in nuclear medicine including SPECT images. The digital filter design technique proposed here is considered to provide a powerful tool for extraction of additional qualitative information and improvement of the quality of nuclear medicine images both in research and in routine clinical work.
