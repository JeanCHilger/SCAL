Analysis of proteins in developing rd (retinal degeneration) chick retina using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The rd (retinal degeneration) chick possesses an autosomal recessive mutation which results in behavioral and electrophysiological blindness at hatch. Using the technique of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we have identified two groups of proteins whose expression in the retina/pigment epithelium/choroid (RET/PE/CH) of +/+, +/rd and rd/rd chicks is related to genotype. The two proteins within Group 1 had an apparent mass (Mr) of 63 kDa and isoelectric points (pI) of 6.48 and 6.55. The four proteins in Group 2 had an apparent Mr of 98 kDa and pI values ranging from 6.08 to 6.25. Quantities of the Group 1 proteins in RET/PE/CH of each of the three types of animals were found to be related to genotype the amounts of each did not change with development. The expression of the Group 2 proteins in PET/PE/CH was found to change during retinal development. Proteins P98-6.08 (Mr-pI) and P98-6.13 were found in all rd/rd and +/rd RET/PE/CH and in most +/+ embryonic tissues. Proteins P98-6.19 and P98-6.25, which were present in the majority of +/+ embryonic and in all +/+ E21 (hatch RET/PE/CH, did not appear in +/rd tissues until hatch. P98-6.19 and P98-6.25 were never observed in rd/rd RET/PE/CH.
