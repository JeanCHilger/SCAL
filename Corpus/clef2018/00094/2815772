Tl-201 myocardial SPECT in silent myocardial ischemia and angiographically proven coronary heart disease. Silent myocardial ischemia is defined as true myocardial ischemia without angina pectoris in patients with angiographically detected coronary artery disease. In this study 52 patients (46 male, 8 female: mean age 53 years) with a pathological exercise test but no symptoms were investigated. They showed stenosis of 75% or more of the diameter in at least one coronary segment on angiography. Prior to or after catheterization (within 14 days) Tl-201 SPECT was done and evaluated independently of angiography. A clear correlation between angiographically confirmed stenosis and reversible perfusion defects with Tl-201 SPECT was established (62 out of 76 lesions). Furthermore, there was a significant relation between angiographically detected subtotal or total occlusions of coronary vessels and irreversible perfusion defects using Tl-201 SPECT (35 in 44 lesions) (p less than 0.001). In patients with ST depression but without angina pectoris during the exercise test, the Tl-201 SPECT is highly suited to determine the hemodynamic effect of coronary stenoses.
