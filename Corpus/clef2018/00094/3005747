Determination of the size of a myocardial infarct by the technic of single-photon emission computer tomography. A study of 38 patients with acute myocardial infarction verified by clinical, laboratory and electrocardiographic data made use of single-photon emission computered tomography, a new radiodiagnostic method for the assessment of the extent of myocardial lesion. Its findings were compared with cardiospecific enzyme activity data and showed good correlation. The new technique was found to be more informative as compared to plane scintigraphy. Possibilities of single-photon emission computered tomography are discussed with reference to the diagnosis of acute infarction at different sites and showing different radionuclide inclusion patterns.
