Immunoscintigraphy in intraocular malignant melanoma. Immunoscintigraphy of malignant tumours has become an encouraging tool in nuclear medicine. Early diagnosis of small lesions is mandatory for successful cancer therapy. The scintigraphic detectability of small lesions (less than 1 cm in diameter) by immunoscintigraphy is shown in 39 patients suffering from ocular tumours (37 malignant choroidal melanoma, two benign choroidal naevi) using 99Tcm-labelled F(ab')2 fragments of the anti-melanoma monoclonal antibody 225.28S this antibody recognizes the high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen. No adverse effects were observed. In terms of true-positive results, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) proved to be superior to planar scans (73% versus 41% true-positive results).
