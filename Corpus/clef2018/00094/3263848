Complex partial seizures. Correlation of clinical and metabolic features. We compared metabolic patterns on 18F-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) with closed circuit television and simultaneous electroencephalographic ictal recordings of complex partial seizures in 48 patients. Closed circuit television and electroencephalographic data and PET scans were scored by "blinded" raters. Of the 48 patients, 26 had unilateral temporal three, frontal
