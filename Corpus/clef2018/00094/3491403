Cortical hypometabolism after a thalamic lesion in man: positron tomography study. We used positron emission tomography to study the effects of unilateral vascular thalamic lesions on cortical oxygen or glucose utilisation in 10 patients. There was a significant ipsilateral cortex hypometabolism in 9 of the 10 patients, affecting diffusely the whole cortical mantle. The only patient spared was free of neuropsychological deficit at time of PET study. In 4 patients, the magnitude of ipsilateral cortical hypometabolism was significantly less at follow-up PET study, together with improved neuropsychological function. When plotted altogether, the 14 studies showed a significant tendency for the hypometabolism to improve with time elapsed since clinical onset. On the whole, these data suggest that the ipsilateral cortical hypometabolism reflects an essentially functional alteration an not only a degenerating process. This most likely indicates a cortical deafferentation due to loss of non-specific thalamo-cortical connections, i.e. a phenomenon akin to "diaschisis". However, a causal relationship between cortical hypometabolism and neuropsychological deficit cannot be firmly established from the present data.
