Hemodynamic and metabolic study using positron emission tomography in a case of right thalamo-capsular ischemic stroke. The authors report the results of a Positron Emission Tomographic (PET) study of local cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption in one patient with a right capsulo-thalamic ischemic lesion. That lesion is well demonstrated using X-ray CT Scan. PET study demonstrates a decreased perfusion and metabolism at three levels: first in right thalamus region, second in whole right hemisphere, more marked at orbitofrontal area and third at the level of the left cerebellar hemisphere. The authors point out the usefulness of PET studies which allow a better understanding of clinical signs by demonstrating functional consequences of damage in deeply located structures such as thalamus and internal capsule on cerebral and cerebellar cortices.
