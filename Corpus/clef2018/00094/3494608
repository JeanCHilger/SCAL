Initial experience with SPECT of the brain using 99mTc-hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HM-PAO). A recently developed 99mTc radiocompound, hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HM-PAO) exhibits favorable properties for regional cerebral tomograms in man utilizing conventional instrumentation (SPECT). Planar and tomographic studies using a rotating gamma camera equipped with a high sensitivity, low energy, collimator were performed in 5 normal subjects and 20 patients suffering from different cerebral diseases. SPECT abnormalities observed in patients with CVD, brain tumors and hydrocephalus were compared with results from X-ray CT. Our preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility of assessing regional brain perfusion using SPECT and a 99mTc radiopharmaceutical which is lipid soluble and has a high extraction fraction in the brain.
