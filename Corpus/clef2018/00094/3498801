Functional and morphological abnormalities in temporal lobe epilepsy: a comparison of interictal and ictal EEG, CT, MRI, SPECT and PET. Ten patients suffering from drug-resistant complex partial seizures, with EEG abnormalities in the temporal region, were studied by means of non-invasive electrophysiological techniques (video-monitored, 16-channel, prolonged surface and sphenoidal EEG) as well as by imaging techniques (CT, MRI, SPECT and PET). Analysis of interictal and ictal EEG indicated the localization of epileptic activity in one side in eight cases. CT demonstrated focal abnormalities in three, SPECT in five unequivocally (in another four questionably, with the same lateralization as indicated by PET), MRI in eight, and PET in all cases. While only EEG provided specific diagnostic information, the focus definition was consistently good on PET images, poor on CT scans, and generally good but less consistent on MRI.
