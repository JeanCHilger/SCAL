11C-glucose metabolism in manic and depressed patients. The authors used positron emission tomography (PET) and 11C-labeled glucose to study 15 unmedicated patients with affective disorders and 7 control subjects. Diagnoses of affective disorders were based on DSM-III criteria, and symptomatology was evaluated by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Blood counts of 11C in both unipolar and bipolar patients did not differ from those in controls after oral administration of 11C-glucose. By contrast, brain counts of 11C in unipolar depressed patients were significantly lower, whereas those in bipolar manic patients were significantly higher, than in normal controls.
