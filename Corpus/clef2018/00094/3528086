Potential of NMR and PET for determining tumor metabolism. The basic principles underlying nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and positron emission tomography (PET) are explained. Examples of work relating to tumor metabolism are given and some of the important findings of clinical interest are presented. The future prospects of both systems are explored.
