Zoonoses acquired from pet primates. Laws regulating the importation of primates have drastically reduced the number of primates seen as pets and, thus, the hazard both to the potential owner and veterinarian. Active disease and latent carrier states in primates potentially have severe consequences for the contact person. This potential for human transmission makes it imperative that medical and veterinary professionals collaborate to educate the public on the danger of the primate as a pet.
