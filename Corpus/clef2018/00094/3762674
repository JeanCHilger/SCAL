Localization of D-2 dopamine receptors to intrinsic striatal neurones by quantitative autoradiography. Recent work with positron emission and single photon emission computed tomography has demonstrated the feasibility of studying striatal dopamine receptors in the living human brain. For the proper interpretation of these studies in normal and diseased states, the cellular localization of these receptors must be definitively established. It has been claimed, on the basis of receptor binding studies with tissue homogenates in rats, that 30-50% of striatal D-2 dopamine receptors are located on axons or terminals of the corticostriatal pathway. This finding has been incorporated into major reviews and classifications of dopamine receptors. The recent development of quantitative autoradiographic methods for diffusible ligands has facilitated the study of neurotransmitter receptors in cytoarchitechtonically intact tissue. Because this technique provides the necessary anatomic resolution that is lacking in homogenate binding studies, we have used it to re-examine the localization of striatal dopamine receptors. Here we present evidence that D-2 receptors are located exclusively on kainic acid-sensitive intrinsic neuronal elements in the striatum. We report that discrete cortical ablation does not alter 3H-spiperone binding to rat striatum and thus our results do not support the existence of D-2 dopamine receptors on the terminals of the corticostriatal pathway.
