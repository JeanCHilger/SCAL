Feasibility of gated single-photon emission transaxial tomography of the cardiac blood pool. A procedure for gated single-photon emission transaxial tomography of the cardiac blood pool using a commercially available rotating camera and a computer is described. During image acquisition, the end-diastolic and end-systolic frames are retained after each of the 16 angular steps of the rotation of the camera around the anterior side of the patient's chest. Complete acquisition takes 25 minutes 10 more minutes are required for the reconstruction and processing of the sections. One set of images is oriented transaxially
