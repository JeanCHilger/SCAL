Comparison study of CT and positron emission tomographic data in recent cerebral infarction. To better understand the pathophysiologic correlates of the computed tomographic (CT) scan changes seen in recent cerebral infarction, 17 patients (20 studies) underwent both x-ray transmission and positron emission CT investigations within 18 days after clinical onset of complicated ischemic stroke in the internal carotid artery territory. The density changes before and after contrast study measured within the CT lesion were correlated to the local cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen utilization (CMRO2), and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) measured with the oxygen-15 steady-state positron technique. Statistically significant linear correlations were found between hypodensity and CBF, hypodensity and CMRO2, and contrast enhancement and CBF, such that the more CBF and CMRO2 were depressed, the more marked was the hypodensity and the more CBF was elevated, the more marked was the contrast enhancement. Although marked contrast enhancement was associated with decreased OEF (luxury perfusion), it was only rarely associated with increased CBF. Various hypotheses are discussed to explain these findings.
