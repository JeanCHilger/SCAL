The effects of sustained lung inflation on the pattern of breathing in man. 1. Continuous positive-pressure breathing (CPPB) at airway pressures of 0.65-1.00 kPa above ambient pressure has been used to produce a sustained inflation of the lungs of approximately 1 litre in six normal male subjects. 2. Lung inflation produced a reduction in the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide inhalation by slow rebreathing in oxygen over approximately 45 min, with a reduction in the slope of the VE/Pet,CO2 and VT/Pet,CO2 relations (Pet,CO2, = end-tidal PCO2). 3. The pattern of breathing is altered, so that for any given expired minute ventilation (VE), tidal volume (VT) is reduced with a fall in breath duration (Tt) resulting from a decrease in inspiratory time (Ti) with no change in expiratory time (Te). 4. The break point on the VT/Ti relation is lowered.
