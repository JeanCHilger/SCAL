The effect of certain variables on the tumor and tissue distribution of tracers: VI. False-carrier effect, Part III, Fe. Previous work has shown that Fe3+, when administered in the proper dose and time sequence, increases the tumor uptake of gallium-67 (67Ga) while decreasing its uptake by normal tissues. The purpose of this series of experiments was to examine further the postulate that the false carrier effect is mediated at the cellular as well as the vascular level, determine the lowest concentration of ionic Fe3+ that will induce near maximum tumor/background ratios (T/Bkg), determine the best technique for its administration, and decide whether Benadryl and dexamethasone could be used to offset side effects of the Fe3+ without altering tumor and tissue kinetics. Fe3+ altered tissue levels of 67Ga prior to changes in the blood. The threshold for initiation of the false-carrier effect varied to some extent from one organ to another. Tumor uptake of 67Ga was either enhanced or unaltered at 4 hours after injection 0.3 mg Fe3+/kg administered 0.5 hour before and 2 hours after the 67Ga enhanced 4-hour T/Bkg by a factor of about ten. Twenty-four-hour ratios were improved (to a lesser extent than 4-hour), but decreased concentrations of 67Ga occurred in the tumor. Dexamethasone and Benadryl did not alter the outcome of the experiment. This technique should be useful for imaging with gallium-68 and the PET camera.
