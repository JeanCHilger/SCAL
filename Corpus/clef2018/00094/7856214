Chronic fatigue syndrome: immune dysfunction, role of pathogens and toxic agents and neurological and cardial changes. 375 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) were examined using a standardized questionnaire and subsequent interview on 11 risk factors and 45 symptoms. Additionally immunologic, serologic, toxicologic, neuroradiologic, neurophysiologic and cardiologic investigations were performed. Immunologic tests showed cellular immunodeficiences particularly in functional regard (pathological lymphocyte stimulation in 50% of the patients, disorders of granulocyte function in 44%). Furthermore variable deviations were found in the lymphocyte subpopulations (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, DR, Leu 11 + 19). In the humoral part tendencies to low IgG-3- and IgG-1-subclass-levels occurred (59% respectively 11% of the patients) also as decreases in complement system (CH50, C3, C4, C1-esterase-inhibitor). In the group of activation markers and cytokines 42% of the investigated patients had circulating immune complexes (CIC), 47% increases of tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF-a) and 21% increases of soluble interleukin-2-receptor (IL-2-R). The increased occurrence of autoantibodies in the CFS-patients (specially antinuclear anti-bodies [ANA], microsomal thyroid antibodies) suggest, that CFS is associated with or the beginning of manifest autoimmune disease. Under the pathogens 78% of the patients had a striking serological constellation of Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV-EA positive, low EBNA-titers), in the HHV-6-Virus 47% showed increased antibody-titers. Tests on further herpes viruses and on Borreliae, Chlamydiae, Candida and Amoebae were positive in 8 to 36% of the examined patients. Furthermore there were found variable deficits of vitamins and trace elements also as hormonal disturbances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
