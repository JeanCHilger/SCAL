An acute effect of triazolam on muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding in the human brain measured by positron emission tomography. An acute effect of triazolam, a potent benzodiazepine agonist, on cholinergic receptor binding in the human brain was measured by PET (positron emission tomography) using [11C]N-methyl-4-piperidylbenzilate ([11C]NMPB), a potent muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist. Two PET scans were performed in each subject: (1) control scan (2) after oral administration of 0.5 mg triazolam or placebo. The previously discussed amnestic effect of triazolam was measured by immediate and delayed recall of meaningful and meaningless syllables. A compartment model employing the radioactivity in the cerebellum as an input function was used for the quantification of receptor binding. The binding parameter, k3, was decreased after triazolam administration in all measured regions, whereas no change was observed after placebo treatment. The reduction compared to the control study varied from 8.6 +/- 3.7% in the temporal cortex to 16.3 +/- 6.3% in the thalamus. Triazolam administration impaired both immediate and delayed recall of syllables, whereas placebo administration had no effects. Benzodiazepine agonists are reported to decrease the cortical acetylcholine release. The decrease of acetylcholine release in the synaptic cleft might be the explanation for the decreased binding of [11C]NMPB.
