Monosomy 1p is correlated with enhanced in vivo glucose metabolism in meningiomas. The 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake of 25 human meningiomas was preoperatively evaluated in vivo by positron-emission tomography (PET). After surgery, meningioma biopsies were analyzed cytogenetically. Five meningiomas showed partial monosomy for chromosome 1p additional to other typical chromosome aberrations. This aberrant karyotype was correlated with increased FDG uptake. Three of five meningiomas with monosomy 1p were classified as grade II according to WHO, while only one of 20 tumors without monosomy 1p was classified as grade II. Thus, monosomy 1p and elevated FDG uptake in PET are to be regarded as cytogenetic and metabolic parameters for the aggressiveness of meningiomas.
