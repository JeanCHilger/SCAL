Brain HMPAO-SPECT and ocular microangiopathic syndrome in HIV-1-infected patients. The pathogenesis of neurologic and neuropsychologic dysfunction in HIV-1 infection is unclear. The purpose of the study was to determine an association between cerebral perfusion and HIV-1-related ocular microangiopathic syndrome.We studied 28 HIV-1-infected patients, seven of whom presented with asymptomatic HIV infection, nine with lymphadenopathy syndrome or AIDS-related complex, and 12 with AIDS. Cerebral perfusion was semi-quantitatively measured by single photon emission computed tomography of the brain using technetium-99 hexamethyl-propylenamine oxime (HMPAO-SPECT). The conjunctival manifestation of HIV-1-related microangiopathic syndrome was measured by a rating scale determining blood-flow sludging and, retinal cotton-wool spots were counted. CD4 count, neopterin, beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M), haemoglobin, and age were determined as putative confounding variables.Mean conjunctival sludge in patients with normal HMPAO-SPECT findings was 1.3 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- s.e.m.) no cotton-wool spots were present. In patients with slightly impaired HMPAO-SPECT, it was 2.1 +/- 0.6 and mean cotton-wool spot count was 1.1 +/- 0.4. In patients with severely impaired HMPAO-SPECT, mean conjunctival sludge was 4.5 +/- 0.3 and mean cotton-wool spot count was 4.9 +/- 1.1 HMPAO-SPECT findings were closely associated with conjunctival sludge (r = 0.72There was a close association between severity of HIV-1-related ocular microangiopathic syndrome and severity of cerebral hypoperfusion. Microvascular alterations might contribute to the pathogenesis of neurological and neuropsychological symptoms in patients with HIV-1 disease. Furthermore, the conjunctival sludge rating and the number of cotton-wool spots might be appropriate indicators for severity of microvascular changes of the central nervous system [corrected].
