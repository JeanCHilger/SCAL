Effects of cyclic GMP and analogues on neurogenic transmission in the rat tail artery. 1. The effects of membrane permeable analogues of guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP), and of the NO donor, 3-morpholinosydnonimine-N-ethylcarbamide (SIN-1) were investigated on [3H]-noradrenaline release and neurogenic vasoconstriction in electrical field stimulated rat tail arteries. 2. Two 8-substituted analogues of cyclic GMP (8-bromoguanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate 8-bromo-cyclic GMP and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate
