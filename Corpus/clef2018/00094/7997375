Comparison of D2 receptor scintigraphy (123I-IBZM) with cerebral perfusion (99m-Tc-HMPAO) in extrapyramidal disorders. The aim of this SPECT study was to determine whether there is a correlation between rCBF (99mTc-HMPAO) and D2 receptor binding (123I-IBZM) in disorders of the extrapyramidal system and in which situation the 99mTc-HMPAO scan could predict the outcome of the 123I-IBZM study. 13 patients with Parkinson's syndrome and 13 patients with hyperkinetic extrapyramidal disorders were studied. In all patients the two SPECT studies were performed within 2-7 days. ROIs were placed over the basal ganglia (BG), the frontal cortex (FC) and the cerebellum (CE). The ratios BG/FC and BG/CE were calculated. In both groups the scatter was lower when the frontal cortex was used as reference region. Among the patients with hyperkinetic extrapyramidal disorders the two patients with Huntington's chorea had lower rCBF and D2 receptor binding compared to other hyperkinetic extrapyramidal disorders. There was no correlation between D2 receptor binding and rCBF in the basal ganglia. The 99mTc-HMPAO studies did not provide clinically useful information, except in Huntington's chorea.
