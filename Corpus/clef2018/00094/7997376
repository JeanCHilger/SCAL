Preoperative evaluation of drug resistant focal epilepsies with 123I-iomazenil SPECT. Comparison with vidio/EEG monitoring and postoperative results. SPECT with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist 123I-Iomazenil was performed in 33 patients with intractable partial seizures for pre-operative evaluation. The results combined with MRI and 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT findings were compared with the video-assisted EEG monitoring ("gold standard") which localised the focus in 25 patients. 11 patients underwent surgical resection of the epileptogenic area and became seizure-free for a period up to 13 months. The Iomazenil SPECT had a significantly higher sensitivity compared to 99mTc-HMPAO in the visualization of an epileptogenic area and should be regularly used in the diagnostic of medically intractable partial seizures.
