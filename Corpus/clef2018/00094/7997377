123I-IBZM SPECT: reconstruction methodology and results in parkinsonism and dystonia. In 58 patients with Parkinsonism or dystonia striatal dopamine D2 receptors were investigated using 123I-iodobenzamide (123I-IBZM) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The influence of SPECT reconstruction methodology on semiquantification and the clinical value of 123I-IBZM SPECT were evaluated. Delineation of the striatal uptake and striatum/frontal cortex (ST/FC) ratios were improved by the use of compensation procedures for scatter and attenuation as well as the choice of an adequate filter. Satisfactory results were achieved using a Metz prefilter with a comparatively high order number (i.e. high cut-off and low suppression of higher frequencies via roll-off). Regarding clinical diagnoses it was not possible to differentiate between advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IP) and Parkinsonism of other aetiology (OP) on the basis of 123I-IBZM SPECT. But patients with IP and favourable response to L-Dopa showed significantly higher ST/FC ratios than those with fluctuating response. In patients with dystonia ST/FC ratios were significantly higher compared to patients with IP or OP.
