Myocardial kinetics of potassium-38 in humans and comparison with copper-62-PTSM. The aim of this study was to define the kinetics of 38K and its suitability to evaluate myocardial blood flow at rest and during pharmacological vasodilation in normal subjects. Potassium-38's kinetic characteristics were also compared to those of a 62Cu-pyruvaldehyde bis(n4-methyl-thio-semicarbazone) copper (II) (PTSM) flow tracer.Potassium-38 and 62Cu-PTSM were injected at rest and after pharmacological vasodilation in six healthy volunteers. Dynamic PET acquisition was performed over 20 min and myocardial tracer retention calculated. Homogeneity of regional myocardial tracer distribution was also evaluated.High image quality of the heart was observed at rest and after dipyridamole with both tracers. Potassium-38 demonstrated prolonged myocardial retention with minimal lung and liver accumulation. In contrast to 38K, 62Cu-PTSM demonstrated high liver uptake which may hinder observation of the inferior wall of the myocardium. Copper-62-PTSM dipyridamole-to-rest retention ratio was 1.49.Potassium-38 and 62Cu-PTSM display suitable kinetics for the qualitative evaluation of blood flow and flow reserve in the human heart. Compared to 62Cu-PTSM, potassium-38, which does not show high liver uptake, may more accurately estimate blood flow in the inferior wall of the heart. However, accurate quantification of myocardial blood flow using 38K or 62Cu-PTSM retention appears to be limited to decreasing retention fraction at hyperhemic states.
