PET in cardiology: current status and clinical expectations. The development of positron emission tomography (PET) in the clinical environment along with the synthesis of biologically active molecules and tracer kinetic principles has provided a diagnostic tool for in vivo tissue characterization in humans. Moreover, based on the growing knowledge of cellular function on the molecular level of diseases PET biological imaging has stimulated the synthesis of numerous metabolic compounds labelled with the four primary positron-emitting radioisotopes C-11, F-18, N-13 and O-15. While the concept of biological imaging has gained attraction for probing both the central nervous system and neoplastic tissues, current diagnostic benefit from PET is probably best defined in cardiovascular medicine.
