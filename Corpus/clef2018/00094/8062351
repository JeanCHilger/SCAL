Increased parasellar activity on gallium SPECT is not specific for active cluster headache. We have performed Gallium SPECT head scans in 30 successive cluster headache (CH) patients and in 7 migraineurs without aura. Parasellar hyperactivity was judged as present in 81% of chronic CH patients, 54% of episodic CH patients in an active period, 56% of episodic CH patients in remission and 71% of migraineurs. No significant correlations were found between the SPECT images and the duration of the disease, of cluster periods or of remissions. Increased parasellar activity on Gallium SPECT is thus not specific for CH, nor for the active period of episodic CH. The method lacks reliability for investigation of putative cavernous sinus inflammation.
