Changes in global cerebral blood flow in humans: effect on regional cerebral blood flow during a neural activation task. 1. The primary objective of this study was to examine in man, how induced changes in global cerebral blood flow (gCBF) affected a regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) increase resulting from a neural activation task (opening of eyes). A secondary objective was to quantify how such induced changes in gCBF were distributed between representative regions of either predominantly grey matter or white matter. 2. Positron emission tomography with intravenous infusion of H2(15)O, was used to measure gCBF in six normal males. Concomitant measures of rCBF were obtained in three different regions of interest (ROI): a representative area of predominantly grey matter, a representative area of predominantly white matter and an area of visual cortex. 3. Cerebral blood flow was altered by establishing steady-state changes in PCO2 at a near constant ventilation of approximately 30 l min-1. The mean PET,CO2 (+/- S.D.) levels (mmHg) that resulted were: low, 21.8 +/- 1.8 normal, 39.8 +/- 1.0, and high, 54.8 +/- 1.2. The normal and high levels were obtained by adding appropriate amounts of CO2 to the inspirate. The corresponding mean gCBF levels across all six subjects with eyes closed were: low, 24.2 +/- 4.6
