Evaluation of the cardiac and pulmonary uptake of Thallium 201 in subject with suspected ischemic heart disease examined by single-photon emission tomography with Thallium 201, at rest and after exertion. Counts in selected lung and heart ROI were taken in 10 thallium-201 stress SPECT. They were tested for diseased or welfare status of the patient. Eighteen parameters from scintigraphies and from stress test for each patient were placed in a file and tested for correlation in a minicomputer. Lung/heart ratio was found to be not indicative of disease while it is a sign of thallium distribution in the body. Numerical evaluation of scintigraphies was however found to be a sign of disease.
