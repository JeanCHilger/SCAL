Pharmacokinetics of [18F]fleroxacin in healthy human subjects studied by using positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]fleroxacin was used to study the pharmacokinetics of fleroxacin, a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, in 12 healthy volunteers (9 men and 3 women). The subjects were infused with a standard therapeutic dose of fleroxacin (400 mg) supplemented with approximately 20 mCi of [18F]fleroxacin. Serial PET images were made and blood samples were collected for 8 h, starting at the initiation of the infusion. The subjects were then treated with unlabeled drug for 3 days (400 mg/day). On the fifth day, infusion of radiolabeled drug, PET imaging, and blood collection were repeated. In most organs, there was rapid accumulation of radiolabeled drug, with stable levels achieved within 1 h after completion of the infusion. Especially high peak concentrations (in micrograms per gram) were achieved in the kidney (> 34), liver (> 25), lung (> 20), myocardium (> 19), and spleen (> 18). Peak concentrations of drug more than two times the MIC for 90% of Enterobacteriaceae strains tested (> 10-fold for most organisms) were achieved in all tissues except the brain and remained above this level for more than 6 to 8 h. The plateau concentrations in tissues (2 to 8 h, in micrograms per gram +/- standard error of the mean) of drug were as follows: brain, 0.83 +/- 0.032 myocardium, 4.53 +/- 0.24
