[111In]-DTPA-D-phenylalanine octreotide SPECT for the scintigraphic imaging of enhanced somatostatin-receptor density in endocrine ophthalmopathy. Recently, [111In]-DTPA-D-phenylalanine-octreotide was introduced for clinical use. This radioligand binds specifically to somatostatin receptors and is suitable for SPECT examinations. The aim of this study was to clarify whether an increased somatostatin receptor density can be imaged and quantified in patients with endocrine ophthalmopathy (e.o.). 7 patients between 34 and 55 years with e.o. at stages III to VI and 4 controls between 38 and 63 years were examined. All patients and controls received approximately 200 MBq [111In]-DTPA-D-phenylalanine-octreotide by IV injection. A SPECT examination was performed 4 hours after injection and a normalised tracer uptake (A(n)) was calculated for both orbitae. In patients with e.o. the values of A(n) were significantly higher compared with controls (P = 0.002). There was a correlation between A(n) and exophthalmus stages according to Hertel with r = 0.844 (P = 0.001). These results indicate that [111In]-DTPA-D-phenylalanine-octreotide SPECT might be useful for the in vivo assessment of an increased somatostatin receptor density in e.o. These findings could have an impact on the treatment with somatostatin analogous in e.o.
