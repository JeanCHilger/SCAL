Radiologic imaging in cancer. Radiologic procedures are extremely valuable in the diagnostic work-up of many cancers but are limited for screening purposes to a few diseases. Radiologists have developed an extensive armamentarium of tools, from plain radiographs and nuclear-medicine scans to ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and single-photon emission computed tomography. This article includes suggested protocols for working up the most common cancers.
