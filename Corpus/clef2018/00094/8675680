The effect of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity on glucose transport and phosphorylation in skeletal muscle. Defects of glucose transport and phosphorylation may underlie insulin resistance in obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). To test this hypothesis, dynamic imaging of 18F-2-deoxy-glucose uptake into midthigh muscle was performed using positron emission tomography during basal and insulin-stimulated conditions (40 mU/m2 per min), in eight lean nondiabetic, eight obese nondiabetic, and eight obese subjects with NIDDM. In additional studies, vastus lateralis muscle was obtained by percutaneous biopsy during basal and insulin-stimulated conditions for assay of hexokinase and citrate synthase, and for immunohistochemical labeling of Glut 4. Quantitative confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to ascertain Glut 4 at the sarcolemma as an index of insulin-regulated translocation. In lean individuals, insulin stimulated a 10-fold increase of 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) clearance into muscle and significant increases in the rate constants for inward transport and phosphorylation of FDG. In obese individuals, the rate constant for inward transport of glucose was not increased by insulin infusion and did not differ from values in NIDDM. Insulin stimulation of the rate constant for glucose phosphorylation was similar in obese and lean subjects but reduced in NIDDM. Insulin increased by nearly twofold the number and area of sites labeling for Glut 4 at the sarcolemma in lean volunteers, but in obese and NIDDM subjects translocation of Glut 4 was attenuated. Activities of skeletal muscle HK I and II were similar in lean, obese and NIDDM subjects. These in vivo and ex vivo assessments indicate that impaired glucose transport plays a key role in insulin resistance of NIDDM and obesity and that an additional impairment of glucose phosphorylation is evident in the insulin resistance of NIDDM.
