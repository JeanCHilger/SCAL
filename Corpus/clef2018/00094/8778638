99Tcm-HMPAO SPET and 1H-MRS (proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy) in patients with ischaemic cerebral infarction. Brain 99Tcm-HMPAO single photon emission tomography (SPET) and 1H-MRS (proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy) were used to determine correlations between alterations in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and changes in neuronal metabolites in 21 patients (28 examinations) with ischaemic cerebral infarction examined in different phases. rCBF was determined semi-quantitatively using Lassen's linearization algorithm. SPET provided evidence of the hypoperfused site of necrosis within a few hours after the acute event and alterations in rCBF were detected in both the infarcted and diaschistic areas at all stages. 1H-MRS was used to monitor the concentration of the following metabolites: N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), creatine and phosphocreatine (CR + PCr), compounds containing choline (Cho) and lactate (Lac). A significant correlation was found between reduction in rCBF and a fall in NAA and Cr + PCr in both the acute and chronic phases, but not during "luxury perfusion' in the subacute phase. The presence of LAC in the infarcted area up to 9 months post-ictus was totally unexpected. Simultaneous SPET and 1H-MRS thus provides additional information regarding the physiopathogenesis of cerebral ictus by clarifying the relation between alterations in rCBF and biochemical neuronal changes. We believe that NAA and Cr + PCr concentrations are the best expression of agreement between flow and metabolism in infarcted areas, particularly with regard to hypoperfused areas not clearly detectable by magnetic resonance imaging in the early post-ictus stage.
