Phosphorus-31 MR spectroscopy in the preoperative evaluation of symptomatic unilateral carotid artery stenosis. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential of 31P-MRS (MR spectroscopy) in the pre- and postoperative evaluation of patients referred for endarterectomy.Nine patients with unilateral, hemodynamically significant stenosis in the region of the common carotid bifurcation were examined pre- and post-operatively with CT, SPECT (regional cerebral blood flow), transcranial Doppler, and duplex sonography, and they also underwent neuropsychologic investigation. Phosphorus-31 MRS of each hemisphere was performed before and 27-148 days after surgery. The relative concentrations of phosphomono- and -diesters, inorganic phosphate, phosphocreatine, and ATP were estimated.No definite changes in concentrations could be detected for any of the metabolites.The lack of changes was probably due to well-functioning collaterals and to the partial volume effect, whereby changes in a focal region are hidden when larger volumes are studied.
