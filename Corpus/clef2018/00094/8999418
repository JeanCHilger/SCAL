Impairment of myocardial perfusion reserve in microvascular angina (syndrome X): assessment by 99mTc-MIBI-SPECT. In 22 patients with typical chest pain and normal coronary arteries (microvascular angina, syndrome X) 99mTc-MIBI-SPECT was examined in regard to assess impairment of myocardial perfusion reserve.The study was performed with 99mTc-MIBI-SPECT at rest and under vasodilation with dipyridamole. The findings were compared with a normal database. A normal perfusion reserve was said to be an increase > 20% of the 99mTc-MIBI-activity.In 2/22 (9%) of the patients the perfusion reserve lay > 20% i.e. 37%. In 91% of the patients a diminution or even decrease of the perfusion was to be seen. From these 9/22 (41%) of the patients showed a diminution of the 99mTc-MIBI-uptake by 6%. 1/22 patients had a decrease of the perfusion under vasodilation with dipyridamole i.e. a lower activity of 99mTc-MIBI by 13%Vasodilation 99mTc-MIBI-SPECT offers good imaging quality and enables semi-quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion reserve in patients with microvascular angina.
