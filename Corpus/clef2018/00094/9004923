Perspectives in the rehabilitation of vision in blind subjects. The normal development of the visual system from birth until the end of the critical period involves, for the young subject to achieve a number of visual experiments. In cases of late blindness, the visual system has been normally developed, which is not the case when early blindness is considered where an abnormal cerebral organization exists. Accordingly, attempts to rehabilitate vision in the blind have to consider these discrepancies. When the invasive visual prosthesis acting by electrical stimulation of spared parts of the visual system is suitable in case of late blindness, sensory substitution prostheses coding visual information into signals addressing an intact sensory modality seems devoted to cases of early blindness. This later approach takes into account the early blind's brain specific organization, whose undeveloped occipital cortex has been shown to be involved in the sensory substitution process using positron emission tomography.
