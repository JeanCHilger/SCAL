Cardiac imaging for risk stratification with dobutamine-atropine stress testing in patients with chest pain. Echocardiography, perfusion scintigraphy, or both? Pharmacological stress echocardiography and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy are used frequently for risk stratification in patients with suspected myocardial ischemia. However, their relative prognostic strength has never been explored.Two hundred twenty consecutive patients with chest pain (mean age, 60 +/- 12 years 124 men, 115 with previous myocardial infarction) were studied with dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography (ECHO) and simultaneous 99mTc sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography imaging (MIBI). Ischemia was defined as deterioration in left ventricular wall motion and reversible perfusion defects, respectively. ECHO was positive for ischemia in 76 and MIBI in 91 patients (agreement, 77%Dobutamine-atropine ECHO and MIBI provide comparable prognostic information. The addition of MIBI to ECHO may be useful in patients with nondiagnostic ECHO studies.
