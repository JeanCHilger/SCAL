Octreotide scanning for carcinoid tumours. The somatostatin analogue octreotide may be used in the diagnosis of carcinoid and other neuroendocrine tumours. Radionuclide scanning following intravenous injection of 111Indium-labelled octreotide (111In-DTPA-pentetreotide) provides a sensitive, non-invasive method of localising somatostatin-positive tumours. The technique may also be used to identify patients who may respond to 'cold' octreotide therapy and to monitor therapeutic efficacy.
