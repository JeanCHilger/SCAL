Imaging motor-to-sensory discharges in the human brain: an experimental tool for the assessment of functional connectivity. We present a new approach to studying functional connectivity in the human brain. This approach is based on the observation that when we engage in motor activity, a discharge corollary to the motor command is sent from motor to sensory structures. Thus, as long as movement-related sensory input is either prevented or masked, modulation of neuronal activity in sensory structures would indicate the presence of functional connectivity between the motor and the sensory regions. Using positron emission tomography, such a central interaction between motor and sensory regions can be assessed by measuring regional changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in sensory regions. In this paper, we describe the experimental design and the results of two studies of corollary discharges, namely those generated during eye movements and speech. In these studies, a graded approach was used to establish the relationship between the number of eye movements or utterances and CBF in visual or auditory regions, respectively. Significant covariations between the number of movements and CBF in sensory regions were found, thus indicating the presence of functional connectivity between motor and sensory regions. In addition, interregional CBF covariations were computed and the effect of removing the intersubject variance on these covariations was evaluated. The corollary-discharge-based approach to studying functional connectivity is discussed in the context of more traditional computational approaches to network analysis in functional brain imaging.
