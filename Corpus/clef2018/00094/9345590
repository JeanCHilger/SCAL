Positron emission tomography and brain tumours. The first applications of positron emission tomography (PET) for the study of brain tumours appeared early in the development of this technology. New trends in these particular PET applications tend to take into account the histological heterogeneity of these tumours and the necessity to integrate PET data in their surgical management. Better knowledge on PET tracers behavior in brain tumours should lead to new clinical uses, in particular in the promising field of cancer treatment evaluation.
