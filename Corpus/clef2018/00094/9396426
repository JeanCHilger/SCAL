Effects of dobutamine at maximally tolerated dose on myocardial blood flow in humans with ischemic heart disease. This study tests the hypothesis in humans with ischemic heart disease that myocardial blood flow response to dobutamine is linearly correlated with blood flow response to adenosine.PET with [13N]ammonia was used to measure myocardial blood flow at rest and during adenosine and dobutamine at the maximally tolerated dose. Myocardial segments were defined physiologically on the basis of blood flow response to adenosine: normal, > or = 2 mL x min(-1) x g(-1) abnormal, < 2 mL x min(-1) x g(-1)In humans with ischemic heart disease, myocardial blood flow responses to dobutamine and adenosine are linearly correlated over a wide range. The hyperemic response to dobutamine is in excess of that predicted by rate-pressure product and reflects the unmeasured inotropic, oxygen-wasting, and beta2-agonist effects of the drug. Dobutamine induces coronary steal with a frequency approaching that of adenosine.
