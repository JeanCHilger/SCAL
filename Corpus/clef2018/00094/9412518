Brain dopamine neurotoxicity in baboons treated with doses of methamphetamine comparable to those recreationally abused by humans: evidence from [11C]WIN-35,428 positron emission tomography studies and direct in vitro determinations. The present study sought to determine whether doses of methamphetamine in the range of those used recreationally by humans produce brain dopamine (DA) neurotoxicity in baboons and to ascertain whether positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the DA transporter (DAT) ligand [11C]WIN-35,428 ([11C]2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane) could be used to detect methamphetamine-induced DAT loss in living primates. Baboons were treated with saline (n = 3) or one of three doses of methamphetamine [0.5 mg/kg (n = 2) 1 mg/kg (n = 2)
