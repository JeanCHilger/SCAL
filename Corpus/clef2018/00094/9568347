Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (SPECT) during adenosine stress can be performed safely early on after thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with Tc-99 m sestamibi during adenosine stress in patients with recent thrombolytically treated myocardial infarction. Eighty-four patients with thrombolytically treated myocardial infarction, 59 males and 25 females, aged 62.9 +/- 8.4, were eligible for myocardial perfusion scintigraphy during adenosine provocation. Exclusion criteria for adenosine stress were hypotension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac failure, pericarditis and atrioventricular block (AV block) II-III. Adenosine-stress and resting myocardial perfusion scintigraphy was performed 2-5 days after thrombolysis. Scintigraphy at rest was done 24 h after the stress study. Sixty patients (71%) experienced some kind of side-effects during adenosine infusion. The most frequent side-effects were dyspnoea in 43/84 patients (51%) and unspecific chest discomfort in 26/84 patients (31%). During infusion, ST depressions or elevations on ECG were seen in 9 patients (11%), 5 of whom experienced atypical chest discomfort. Five patients (6%) described typical angina but none of them showed electrographic signs of myocardial ischaemia during infusion. Six patients (7%) developed transient AV block I-II. Reversible scintigraphic perfusion defects were seen in 67 patients (79%). No serious complications, such as death, reinfarction or severe arrhythmias, occurred during adenosine infusion or during a 3-day clinical follow-up period. In conclusion, MIBI-SPECT during adenosine stress is a safe diagnostic method that can be performed in most patients early on after thrombolytically treated acute myocardial infarction. Side-effects are common but benign, and not different from those seen in patients with chronic coronary artery disease.
