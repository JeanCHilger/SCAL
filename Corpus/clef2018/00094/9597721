The principles and practical application of enteral nutrition. The enteral route is the preferred method of nutritional support in patients with functional gastrointestinal tracts. Many techniques for obtaining enteral access are available, and the decision regarding which one to use depends on several issues, including the functional integrity of each part of the gastrointestinal tract, the duration of anticipated nutritional support, and the risk of aspiration and gastroesophageal reflux. Nasoesophageal tubes are useful for short-term supplementation however, patients needing nutritional support for longer than 2 weeks may be better served with a more permanent tube. Blenderized pet food diets are recommended for nutritional support because these diets do not need to be supplemented with protein or micronutrients. Commercial human enteral formulas provide a useful alternative for patients with specific nutrient requirements or for feeding via nasoesophageal or jejunostomy tubes.
