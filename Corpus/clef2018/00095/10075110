Regional brain metabolic activation during craving elicited by recall of previous drug experiences. Cocaine cues elicit craving and physiological responses. The cerebral circuits involved in these are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to assess the relation between regional brain activation and cocaine cue elicited responses. Thirteen right-handed cocaine abusers were scanned with positron emission tomography (PET) and [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) twice during an interactive interview about neutral themes and during an interactive interview about cocaine themes designed to elicit cocaine craving. In parallel the behavioral (rated from 0: felt nothing to 10: felt extreme) and cardiovascular responses were recorded. During the cocaine theme interview subjects reported higher self reports for cocaine craving (+2.5+/-3.3, p < or = 0.02) and had higher heart rates (+4.7+/-7.2%, p < or = 0.001), systolic (+4+/-4%, p < or = 0.0001), and diastolic blood pressures (+2.6+/-3.8%, p < or = 0.003) than during the neutral interview. Absolute and relative metabolic values in the orbitofrontal (+16.4+/-17.1%, p < or = 0.005
