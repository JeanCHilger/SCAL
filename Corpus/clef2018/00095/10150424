SPECT reveals causes of painful lumbar spine. SPECT greatly enhances the utility of radionuclide bone scanning and is superior to planar techniques in many instances. Its unique ability to localize sites of increased metabolic activity to specific anatomic sites is a significant advance in clinical science, with meaningful applications to daily patient care.
