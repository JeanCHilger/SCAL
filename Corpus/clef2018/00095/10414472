Companion animal issues and the physician. The companion animal population in the United States is both large in numbers and diverse in composition. Nearly 60% of households have one or more animals. Associated with this large and diverse group of animals are considerable risks for injuries and transmission of infections to humans.Through a review of the relevant literature and our collective professional experience in public health and veterinary medicine, we framed issues regarding companion animals and human health and safety.We placed the identified issues in general contexts that could be applied to varying circumstances.Physicians, veterinarians, public health officials, and others need to work together to ensure that animal ownership is as risk free for people as possible.
