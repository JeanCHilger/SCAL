cAMP-dependent protein kinase is in an active state in rat small arteries possessing a myogenic tone. The hypothesis that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A PKA) is in an active state in small arteries possessing a myogenic tone was investigated in pressurized rat tail small arteries. At a pressure of 80 mmHg, these vessels constricted to 71.6 +/- 1.0% (n = 32) of the diameter of the fully relaxed state. The PKA inhibitors Rp-8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphothioate (Rp-CPT-cAMPS) and N-(2-([3-(4-bromophenyl)-2-propenyl]amino)-ethyl)-5- isoquinolinesulfonamide HCl (H-89) constricted these vessels dose dependently. For example, 300 microM Rp-CPT-cAMPS and 9 microM H-89 reduced vessel diameter by 11.0 +/- 1.2% (n = 8) and 14.3 +/- 3.6% (n = 5), respectively. The cGMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase G
