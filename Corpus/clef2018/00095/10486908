Compounds labelled with short-lived beta(+)-emitting radionuclides and some applications in life sciences. The importance of time as a parameter. Some examples of recent development of the synthesis of compounds labelled with short-lived beta(+)-emitting radionuclides will be discussed with an emphasis on the importance of time in selecting a synthetic strategy. Furthermore the use of such labelled compounds to monitor certain processes in areas within the field of analytical chemistry and in various applications in drug development will be presented.
