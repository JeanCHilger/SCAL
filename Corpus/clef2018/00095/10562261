Early dipyridamole (99m)Tc-sestamibi single photon emission computed tomographic imaging 2 to 4 days after acute myocardial infarction predicts in-hospital and postdischarge cardiac events: comparison with submaximal exercise imaging. Because of its brief hemodynamic effects and minor effect on determinants of myocardial oxygen demand, vasodilator stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) can be applied very early after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for risk stratification, allowing management decisions to be made earlier and thus potentially shortening hospitalization stays, reducing costs, and preventing early cardiac events. This multicenter randomized trial compared the prognostic value of early dipyridamole MPI and standard predischarge submaximal exercise MPI in patients who presented with AMI.Patients who presented with their first AMI (n=451) were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to undergo either both an early (day 2 to 4) dipyridamole (99m)Tc-sestamibi MPI study and a predischarge (day 6 to 12) submaximal exercise (99m)Tc-sestamibi MPI study or only the predischarge study. Multivariate predictors of in-hospital cardiac events included nuclear imaging summed stress and summed reversibility scores and peak creatine kinase. For postdischarge cardiac events, multivariate predictors in patients undergoing dipyridamole MPI included only the summed stress, reversibility, and rest imaging scores and anterior MI. For a given summed stress score, the interaction of reversibility score further improved the predictive value. Dipyridamole MPI showed better risk stratification than submaximal exercise MPI.Dipyridamole MPI very early after MI predicts early and late cardiac events, with superior prognostic value compared with submaximal exercise imaging. The extent and severity of the stress defect and reversibility of the defect were the most important predictors of cardiac death and recurrent MI. This technique can allow management decisions to be made earlier with regard to AMI patients and could have important economic impact if applied widely.
