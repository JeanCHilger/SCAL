Modulation of the corticospinal control of ventilation by changes in reflex respiratory drive. We have determined whether changes in PCO(2) above and below eucapnia modulate the precision of the voluntary control of breathing. Twelve trained subjects performed a compensatory tracking task in which they had to maintain the position of a cursor (perturbed by a variable triangular forcing function) on a fixed target by breathing in and out of a spirometer (ventilatory tracking at 10 l/min). Before each task, subjects hyperventilated for 5 min, and the end-tidal PCO(2) (PET(CO(2))) was controlled
