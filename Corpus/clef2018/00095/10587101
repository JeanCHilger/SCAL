In vivo positron emission tomography studies on the novel nicotinic receptor agonist [11C]MPA compared with [11C]ABT-418 and (S)(-)[11C]nicotine in rhesus monkeys. The novel 11C-labeled nicotinic agonist (R,S)-1-[11C]methyl-2(3-pyridyl)azetidine ([11C]MPA) was evaluated as a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for in vivo characterization of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain of Rhesus monkeys in comparison with the nicotinic ligands (S)-3-methyl-5-(1-[11C]methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)isoxazol ([11C]ABT-418) and (S)(-)[11C]nicotine. The nicotinic receptor agonist [11C]MPA demonstrated rapid uptake into the brain to a similar extent as (S)(-) [11C]nicotine and [11C]ABT-418. When unlabeled (S)(-)nicotine (0.02 mg/kg) was administered 5 min before the radioactive tracers, the uptake of [11C]MPA was decreased by 25% in the thalamus, 19% in the temporal cortex, and 11% in the cerebellum, whereas an increase was found for the uptake of (S)(-)[11C]nicotine and [11C]ABT-418. This finding indicates specific binding of [11C]MPA to nicotinic receptors in the brain in a simple classical displacement study. [11C]MPA seems to be a more promising radiotracer than (S)(-)[11C]nicotine or [11C]ABT-418 for PET studies to characterize nicotinic receptors in the brain.
