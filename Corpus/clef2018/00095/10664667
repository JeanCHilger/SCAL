Imaging prostate cancer. In the detection of prostate cancer, the most important role of imaging is ultrasound-guided prostatic biopsy. In the staging evaluation of prostate cancer, each presently used modality--transrectal US (TRUS), MR imaging, CT, nuclear medicine, and positron emission tomography--has advantages and disadvantages. Evidence-based guidelines on the use of CT and nuclear medicine bone scan, in assessing the risk of distant spread of prostate cancer, are available. There is no consensus and there are no guidelines, however, for the use of imaging in the evaluation of prostate cancer local tumor extent. Results on the value of TRUS vary widely, and prospective multicenter studies suggest that TRUS is no better than digital rectal examination in predicting extracapsular extension. MR imaging offers the most promise for local staging of prostate cancer, but it must resolve problems of reproducible image quality and interobserver variability, and it should prove its efficacy in multicenter trials before it can be recommended for general clinical use. The introduction of MR spectroscopic imaging further expands the value of MR imaging, offering anatomic and metabolic evaluation of prostate cancer.
