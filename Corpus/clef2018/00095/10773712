An appraisal of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for melanoma staging. Positron emission tomography (PET scan) using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is increasingly recognized as a reliable diagnostic method to detect metastases of malignant melanoma (MM).To compare the diagnostic performance of 18-FDG PET scan to that of conventional imaging.A total of 28 assessments were conducted in 24 patients at risk of metastatic MM.The diagnostic accuracy was over 80% and similar for PET scan and conventional imaging.Both the specificity and sensitivity of PET scan are high although not perfect. Confrontation of data with anatomical location and clinicopathological findings remains mandatory.
