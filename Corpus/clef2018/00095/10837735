Utilization of metabolic, transport and receptor-mediated processes to deliver agents for cancer diagnosis. The use of radiopharmaceuticals for the non-invasive diagnosis of cancer has been established in diagnostic radiology over the last few decades. In particular, with the use of sophisticated imaging modalities such as PET and SPECT and a myriad of radioisotopes, advances have been made in the detection and treatment of cancer. This article focuses on three available methods of tumor targeting with radiopharmaceuticals: the utilization of metabolic, transport and receptor-mediated processes to deliver agents for cancer diagnosis. With selected reference to both clinically approved drugs and drugs currently under development, methods of uptake are presented either in terms of flow, metabolic or receptor mediated uptakes. A section of this article is devoted to the monitoring of cancer therapy regimes using radiopharmaceuticals. This review also discusses some mechanistic approaches available in radiopharmaceutical chemistry to be able to effectively diagnose and treat sufferers of cancer in the future.
