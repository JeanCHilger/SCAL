Use of bolus intraperitoneal aminoglycosides for treating peritonitis in end-stage renal disease patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis. Peritonitis is the most common complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and accounts for the most drop-out from PD among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Antibiotic protocols to treat peritonitis recommend initial treatment for both gram-positive and gram-negative infections, pending culture results. Current literature also suggests comparable therapeutic success using bolus (single-dose) parenteral aminoglycosides to treat systemic gram-negative infections compared to conventional divided-dose aminoglycosides. The single bolus dose antibiotic regimen has the potential for reduced nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. We therefore hypothesized that intermittent bolus dose intraperitoneal (i.p.) aminoglycosides may be superior to conventional continuous dose i.p. aminoglycosides in treating dialysis-associated peritonitis, and have fewer side effects. Six patients with clinical peritonitis were treated with single, bolus-dose, i.p. gentamicin or tobramycin (5 mg/kg ideal body weight), range 250-440 mg (mean: 355 +/- 68.25 mg) at the start of therapy. No patient grew gram-negative organisms aminoglycosides were therefore not repeated. Three patients used four continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) exchanges per day
