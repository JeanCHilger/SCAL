Novel approaches to imaging brain tumors. Brain imaging techniques are assuming a greater range of roles in neuro-oncology. New techniques promise earlier recognition of the spread of tumors to the brain, which is useful in staging of disseminated disease, as well as better definition of small lesions associated with presentations of epilepsy. There is the promise that entirely noninvasive, specific diagnosis of brain tumors may become possible. Imaging methods are being used increasingly to direct and monitor therapy. Preoperative and intraoperative imaging are being used for guiding tumor surgery. An exciting potential goal for greater use of imaging is in the individualization of medical therapies either by analysis of in vitro responses or by visualization of drug responses on the tumor in situ. An important focus for technical development is in the robust integration of complementary information to allow optimization of the sensitivity and specificity of multimodal examinations.
