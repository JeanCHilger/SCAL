Relationship between cardiac metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake and hemodynamic, functional and neurohormonal parameters in patients with heart failure. Sympathetic activation plays a pivotal role in heart failure attributing to the disease process and symptoms of the patient. Myocardial sympathetic activity can be visualized using radioiodinated metaiodobenzylguanidine 123I-MIBG, a structural analogue of norepinephrine (NE).We investigated whether a relation exists between myocardial MIBG uptake and different functional, hemodynamic and neurohormonal parameters in patients with chronic heart failure.The study comprised 52 patients with stable congestive heart failure functional class II or III and left ventricular ejection fractions of <35%. The heart/mediastinum ratio (H/M ratio) was calculated to quantify myocardial MIBG uptake. A significant correlation was found between peak oxygen consumption and maximal exercise duration as exercise parameters and H/M ratio of MIBG (R, respectively, 0.36 and 0.4, P<0.05). From all other measured parameters, only plasma NE showed a significant correlation with the H/M ratio of MIBG.Cardiac sympathetic activity, as measured by myocardial MIBG uptake, is correlated with peak exercise parameters.
