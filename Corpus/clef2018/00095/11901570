An epidemiological survey of Clostridium perfringens-associated enterotoxemia at an army veterinary treatment facility. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of Clostridium perfringens-associated vomiting and diarrhea in canine and feline patients at the Okinawa Branch Veterinary Service and to establish a relationship between dietary indiscretion and the presence of clostridial enterotoxemia. Stool samples were obtained from 38 control animals and 44 animals with vomiting and diarrhea during a 3-month period. For each sample, fecal cytology were examined for the presence of C. perfringens, white blood cells, and red blood cells. A survey was also completed by the animal's owner, which provided the researcher with information on the owner's pet feeding practices. After the data were analyzed, 27% of animals with vomiting and diarrhea were found to have C. perfringens upon examination of their fecal samples (p < 0.05), compared with 11% for control animals. Results of our survey revealed that when owners were questioned regarding their feeding practices, 45% of the animals with C. perfringens-positive fecal samples and with clinical signs of vomiting and/or diarrhea had an episode of dietary indiscretion soon before the illness (p < 0.05). Therefore, we conclude that C. perfringens is an important cause of vomiting and diarrhea in our patient population and that a causal relationship may exist between dietary indiscretion and C. perfringens-associated intestinal disease.
