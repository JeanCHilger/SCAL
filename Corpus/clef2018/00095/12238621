Temporal lobe epilepsy and corpora amylacea in the hippocampus: clinicopathologic correlation. Corpora amylacea (CoA) have been found in about 60% of neurosurgical specimens showing hippocampal sclerosis (HS). To determine clinical and neuroimaging differences between HS with and without CoA, we studied 29 patients (21 male, 8 female age at surgery, 12 to 49 years) who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy for intractable medial temporal lobe epilepsy. No CoA were noted in the hippocampus of 11 cases, and deposition of CoA was mild and limited to the subependymal and vestigial hippocampal sulcus regions in nine cases
