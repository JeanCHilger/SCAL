Dentition of the older animal. Ageing is accompanied by the natural loss and wear of hard and soft dental tissues. While ageing can influence pathological processes affecting the dentition, it is not the cause of these processes. The development, growth, attrition, abrasion, and loss of teeth is determined in part by ageing. Periodontal disease is the result of the accumulation of dental plaque and can occur in young animals. Unfortunately, gingivitis or periodontitis is often not diagnosed or diagnosed too late by pet owners and veterinarians.
