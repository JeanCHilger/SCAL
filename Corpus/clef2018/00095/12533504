Evidence for central command activation of the human insular cortex during exercise. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether central command activated regions of the insular cortex, independent of muscle metaboreflex activation and blood pressure elevations. Subjects (n = 8) were studied during 1) rest with cuff occlusion, 2) static handgrip exercise (SHG) sufficient to increase mean blood pressure (MBP) by 15 mmHg, and 3) post-SHG exercise cuff occlusion (PECO) to sustain the 15-mmHg blood pressure increase. Data were collected for heart rate, MBP, ratings of perceived exertion and discomfort, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by using single-photon-emission computed tomography. When time periods were compared when MBP was matched during SHG and PECO, heart rate (7 +/- 3 beats/min P < 0.05) and ratings of perceived exertion (15 +/- 2 units
