Pharmacological evaluation of (S)-8-[123I]iodobretazenil: a radioligand for in vivo studies of central benzodiazepine receptors. In vitro studies on cortical membranes indicated (S)-8-[(123)I]iodobretazenil bound saturably to a single population of binding sites (B(max) = 2.33 pmol/mg protein) with a dissociation constant K(d) = 1.9 nM. (R)-8-[(123)I]Iodobretazenil displayed only non-specific binding. In vivo biodistribution of (S)-8-[(123)I]iodobretazenil in rats indicated high accumulation in regions of high BZR density. Radioactivity was blocked by preadministration with iodobretazenil and flumazenil, while non-BZR drugs had no effect on the uptake of activity in any brain region. (S)-8-[(123)I]Iodobretazenil uptake was saturable in a dose dependent manner (ID(50) = 0.13 mg/kg) in all brain regions. With the (R)-enantiomer no specific uptake was observed. Metabolite studies at 1-3 h p.i. indicated that greater than 95% of activity extracted from brain tissue corresponded to unchanged radiotracer while that in plasma was over 70%. (S)-8-[(123)I]Iodobretazenil potently and selectively labels BZR in vivo and deserves further investigation as a possible SPECT radiotracer.
