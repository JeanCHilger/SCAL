Visualisation of the normal adrenals at SPET examination with 111In-pentetreotide. On single-photon emission tomography (SPET) examinations with indium-111 pentetreotide, we have often observed a small "hot" spot close to the upper portion of the left kidney. While it was initially believed that this represented a tumour in the tail of the pancreas or in the left adrenal, we now understand that it represents normal adrenal uptake. Since the adrenals have not been described as normally visualised, this uptake may interfere with the interpretation of the examination. We have studied how often the normal adrenals are visualised at such examinations. One hundred consecutive clinical (111)In-pentetreotide examinations in adults including SPET of the abdomen and with normal findings were studied. All examinations with a hot spot attributable to the adrenals were, when available, compared with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen performed on clinical grounds within 3 months before or at any time after the scintigraphy. In 11 patients both adrenals were visualised. In 27 patients only the left and in one only the right adrenal was visualised. CT or MRI examinations were available for comparison in 25 of these 39 patients. Two of these showed a pathological finding in the left adrenal. A conservative interpretation is that the normal adrenal is visualised on one or both sides in at least one-quarter of adults at SPET examination with (111)In-pentetreotide.
