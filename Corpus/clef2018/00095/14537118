2-Deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography monitoring disease progress in a patient with islet carcinoma of the pancreas. A woman with islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas proven by biopsy at an exploratory laparotomy underwent six cycles of chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin. After the chemotherapy to monitor her primary tumor and hepatic metastases, she had three consecutive 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) determinations that correlated with an In-111 octreotide single photon emission computer tomography. FDG-PET might have utility in monitoring islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas in evaluating metabolic changes following chemotherapy.
