Effect of bushen yiqi recipe on bioactivity behavior of human cytotrophoblast of early pregnancy. To investigate the effect of Chinese drugs for tonifying Shen on the bioactivity, cell proliferation, invasion and differentiation of human cytotrophoblast of early pregnancy.The human early pregnant cytotrophoblast was cultured in vitro, and treated with saline (as blank control) and drug containing serum in different concentrations (5%, 10% and 20%) respectively. The changes of morphology, proliferation and invasive capacity of cells were examined by scanning electron microscopy, MTT method, flow cytometry, Transwell invasive assay at 24 hrs, 48 hrs and 72 hrs after treatment.After cells being cultured with drug containing serum, the cytotrophoblast became abundant in microvilli, with more and prolonged pseudopodia. The cell absorbency in 490 nm wave length increased significantly (P < 0.01), cells of sub-G1 and G2/M phase obviously decreased and that of S phase increased (P < 0.01), and the cells penetrated through PET membrane in each visual field significantly increased (P < 0.01).Chinese herbs for tonifying Shen could promote the proliferation and invasive capacity of cytotrophoblast and might influence its differentiation.
