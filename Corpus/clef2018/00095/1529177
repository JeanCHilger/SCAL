Assessment of coronary hemodynamics and myocardial perfusion in patients with syndrome X by digital subtraction angiography and 201Tl-myocardial scintigraphy. To evaluate coronary hemodynamics and myocardial perfusion, left coronary digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and Tl-201 myocardial scintigraphy were performed in patients with syndrome X. The coronary circulation time (CCT) was significantly prolonged after the injection of isosorbide dinitrate and contrast medium i.c. Apical T1/2 was also prolonged on ergonovine malate provocation test. We suspected that the vascular response of the coronary peripheral artery was impaired, and microvascular spasm probably existed in patients with syndrome X. The prevalence of abnormal myocardial perfusion defect on exercise Tl-201 SPECT in syndrome X was very high, and coronary hemodynamics was significantly disturbed in the group of syndrome X with abnormal Tl-201 SPECT. Tl-201 lung/heart count ratio significantly increased in syndrome X on treadmill test. Because of this, exercise induced left ventricular dysfunction was suspected. We concluded that the main pathophysiological finding of impaired coronary circulation in syndrome X was microvascular spasm.
