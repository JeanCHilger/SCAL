Prevalence of silent myocardial ischemia in asymptomatic individuals with subclinical atherosclerosis detected by electron beam tomography. Electron beam tomography coronary calcium imaging is an evolving technique for the early detection of coronary atherosclerosis, and recent studies have established its prognostic value in asymptomatic individuals. The relationship of coronary artery calcium scores (CAC) to obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) has been poorly studied but is clinically relevant because it determines which individuals are likely to benefit from revascularization procedures. Hence, we prospectively evaluated the prevalence of myocardial ischemia in asymptomatic patients with cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical atherosclerosis.We studied 864 asymptomatic patients with no previous CAD but with cardiovascular risk factors, referred for electron beam tomography coronary calcium imaging to our institution over an 18-month period. From this group, 220 consecutive patients (85% men mean age, 61 +/- 9 yearsIn comparison to previously published data, we detected a higher prevalence of silent ischemia even in patients with moderate coronary atherosclerosis (18%). This may reflect the differing risk factor profile of our patient population. When coronary calcium screening is used to preselect asymptomatic patients with cardiovascular risk factors for myocardial perfusion imaging, the optimum coronary calcium score threshold will depend on the population prevalence of risk factors and asymptomatic obstructive CAD.
