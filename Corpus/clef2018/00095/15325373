Identifying spatial relationships in neural processing using a multiple classification approach. The application of statistical classification methods to in vivo functional neuroimaging data makes it possible to explore spatial patterns in task-related changes in neural processing. Cluster analysis is one group of descriptive statistical procedures that can assist in identifying classes of brain regions that exhibit similar task-related functionality. In practice, a limitation of cluster analysis is that the performances of clustering algorithms rely on unknown characteristics of the data, making it difficult to determine which procedure best suits a particular analysis. We present a multiple classification approach that incorporates numerous algorithms, evaluates the associated classifications, and either selects a plausible partition relative to the others considered or pools the results from the numerous methods. The multiple classification approach utilizes a new performance criterion, called the relative information (RI) measure, to evaluate the quality of the candidate partitions and as the basis for producing a composite classification image. Employing multiple classifications, rather than a single algorithm, our methodology increases the chance of detecting the functional relationships within the data and, therefore, produces more reliable results. We apply our methodology to a PET study to explore spatial relationships in measured brain function associated with increasing blood alcohol concentration levels, and we perform a simulation study to evaluate the performance of RI.
