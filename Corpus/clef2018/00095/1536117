Estimation of right ventricular pressure in children by thallium-201 myocardial imaging using single-photon emission computed tomography. Thallium-201 myocardial imaging using single-photon emission computed tomography was performed to estimate right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure in 34 children (aged 4.1 to 16.1 years, mean 7.9 +/- 2.9). Acquisition of the images was performed using a semicircular arc of 180 degrees. On a short-axis slice, a line drawn perpendicular to the ventricular septum so as to cross the RV free wall showing maximum uptake was defined as the region of interest. Thallium-201 counts in regions of interest over both RV and left ventricular (LV) free walls were measured. The ratio of RV-to-LV peak thallium-201 counts was compared with RV peak systolic pressure and the ratio of RV-to-LV peak systolic pressure measured at cardiac catheterization. Both RV peak systolic pressure and the ratio of RV-to-LV peak systolic pressure correlated well with the ratio of RV-to-LV peak thallium-201 counts (r = 0.95 and 0.96, respectively). The ratio of RV-to-LV peak thallium-201 counts greater than or equal to 0.45 could predict RV pressure overloading with a sensitivity of 92%, and a specificity of 88%. Thus, the quantitative analysis of thallium-201 myocardial imaging using single-photon emission computed tomography permits the noninvasive and accurate estimation of RV systolic pressure in children.
