Viruses of pet fish. Investigation of a fish kill should begin with water quality analysis and use of standard necropsy techniques to rule out the role of parasites or bacteria. The presence of a virus does not mean necessarily that it is a pathogen. Another point to consider is the potential influence of water temperature on pathogenicity this may be an important factor in developing disease.
