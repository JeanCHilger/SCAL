Results of induction chemotherapy in children older than 1 year with a stage 4 neuroblastoma treated with the NB 97 French Society of Pediatric Oncology (SFOP) protocol. To test the metastatic response rate in stage 4 neuroblastoma, using dose-intensive induction chemotherapy in a multi-institutional setting.From 1998 to 1999, 47 consecutive children were treated according to N7 protocol. Children received cyclophosphamide 140 mg/kg, doxorubicin 75 mg/m(2), and vincristine 0.066 mg/kg (CAV) in cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6, and cisplatinum 200 mg/m(2) and etoposide 600 mg/m(2) (P/VP) in cycles 3, 5, and 7. The International Neuroblastoma Staging system was used with an emphasis on skeletal evaluation by 123-iodine-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy. A phase II study evaluating the metastasis complete response rate after induction chemotherapy was conducted in patients who had positive metastatic sites on MIBG scans at diagnosis.Forty-six patients were assessable for toxicity. Hematologic toxicity was the main toxicity observed. Neutropenia was more frequent after CAV than after P/VP (P < .001). A higher rate of thrombocytopenia was observed after P/VP (P = .03). Forty patients with positive MIBG were assessable for metastatic response, and complete regression of metastases was achieved in 17 patients (ie, 43% 95% CI, 27% to 59%). Of all 47 patients, 21 achieved complete metastatic response.The N7 induction chemotherapy protocol was feasible in a multicentric setting. The observed metastasis complete response rate was similar to that obtained in our previous studies and significantly lower than that published in a previous series using the same regimen. In our hands, escalating doses of cyclophosphamide and prolonging conventional chemotherapy with the same drugs failed to improve the metastasis complete response rate.
