Accuracy and reproducibility of co-registration techniques based on mutual information and normalized mutual information for MRI and SPECT brain images. We implemented a 3D co-registration technique based on mutual information (MI) including 2D image matching as a coarse pre-registration. The 2D coarse pre-registration was performed in the transverse, sagittal and coronal planes sequentially, and all six parameters were then optimized as fine registration. Normalized mutual information (NMI) was also examined as another entropy-based measure that was invariant to the overlapped area of two images. In order to compare accuracy and precision of the present method with a conventional two-level multiresolution approach, simulation was performed by 100 trials with the random initial mismatch of +/-10 degrees and +/-17.92 mm (Type-I) and +/-20 degrees and +/-40.32 mm (Type-II). For Type-I, no significant differences were found between registration errors of the multiresolution approach and the present method with the MI criterion. No biases were observed (< or =0.13 degrees and < or =0.57 mm for the multiresolution approach < or =0.12 degrees and < or =0.57 mm for the present method) and the SDs were very small (< or =0.18 degrees and < or =0.12 mm for the multiresolution approach
