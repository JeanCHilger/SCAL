18F-FDG PET in malignant lymphoma: significance of positive findings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of increased uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in patients with malignant lymphoma (ML) studied by positron emission tomography (PET).A total of 1,120 consecutive scans carried out in 848 patients were reviewed all patients had a diagnosis of ML [574 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 274 Hodgkin's disease (HD)] and were studied at completion of therapy, for suspected recurrence or during follow-up. PET was carried out after intravenous injection of 370 MBq of 18F-FDGOverall, 354 scans (in 256 patients) showed increased FDG uptake (244 scans in NHL and 110 in HD): in 286 cases, FDG uptake was considered pathological and indicative of ML, in 41 cases the findings were described as uncertain or equivocal and in 37 cases, FDG uptake was considered unrelated to ML (in ten scans, concurrent findings of abnormal FDG uptake attributed to ML and uptake assigned to other causes were obtained) . Of the 286 patients with positive PET findings, 274 (95.8%) were found to have residual or recurrent ML (i.e. true positives). Four of the 41 patients with inconclusive findings turned out to have ML, while in 13 patients, pathological processes other than ML could be identified as the cause of FDG uptake. ML was excluded in all patients with findings reported as non-pathological (100% true-negative rate). Therefore, the false-positive rate in our series was about 5%. The main cause of increased FDG uptake mimicking ML was inflammation.Our data confirm that 18F-FDG-PET has very high but not absolute specificity for ML. As already suggested, increased FDG uptake may also be observed in patients without active disease in most cases, however, non-pathological FDG accumulation is properly identified. Less frequently, inconclusive scans are encountered
