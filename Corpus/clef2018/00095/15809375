Exercise single-photon emission computed tomography provides effective risk stratification of elderly men and elderly women. In a recent study, we reported that the Duke treadmill score was unable to effectively stratify elderly patients according to risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of exercise single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in this same population and to examine results by gender.A cohort of 247 elderly (age > or =75 years) patients (108 women, 139 men, age 77+/-3 years) who underwent exercise thallium-201 SPECT were followed up for a median duration of 6.4 years. SPECT variables were significantly associated with cardiac death: summed stress score (SSS) chi2=19.5, P<0.001 summed difference score chi2=12.3, P<0.001SPECT classified most elderly patients into clinically useful low- and high-risk categories and accurately predicted outcomes in both genders. If these results can be validated in future studies, exercise SPECT rather than standard treadmill testing may emerge as the initial noninvasive testing strategy in elderly patients who are able to exercise.
