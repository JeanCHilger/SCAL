Compensation for three-dimensional detector response, attenuation and scatter in SPECT grey matter imaging using an iterative reconstruction algorithm which incorporates a high-resolution anatomical image. The use of SPECT to diagnose physiological alterations in disease states depends on the potential of SPECT to provide a quantitatively accurate reconstructed image. However, the reconstructed values depend upon the shape and size of the brain region as strongly as they depend upon true radioactivity concentration. We report here the results of applying an iterative reconstruction algorithm (IRA) to compensate for shape- and size-dependence, as well as for attenuation and scatter. The IRA is designed only for the reconstruction of images for which the true radioactivity in the white matter within the actual brain is negligible compared with the true radioactivity in the grey matter within the actual brain. The IRA incorporates an accurate three-dimensional model of detector response and utilizes an MRI image which defines the anatomical features of the brain being imaged by segmenting the grey, white and ventricular regions. It is the assumption of radioactivity localization exclusively in the grey matter which permits the efficient incorporation of the MRI image. The IRA was validated by simulation studies that utilized a slice through the basal ganglia in the realistic Hoffman three-dimensional mathematical brain model. FBP images deviate significantly from true radioactivity distribution, whereas IRA images are nearly identical to true radioactivity distribution, except for random fluctuations due to the presence of statistical noise. These results indicate that the application of the IRA will permit SPECT to distinguish deficits due to true physiological changes from apparent deficits due to imaging/reconstruction artifacts.
