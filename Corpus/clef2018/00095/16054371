Prostate cancer PET bioprobes: synthesis of [18F]-radiolabeled hydroxyflutamide derivatives. Approximately 80-90% of prostate cancers are androgen dependent at initial diagnosis. The androgen receptor (AR) is present in most advanced prostate cancer specimens and is believed to have a critical role in its development. Today, treatment of prostate cancer is done by inhibition of AR using antiandrogens such as flutamide (pro-drug of hydroxyflutamide), nilutamide, and bicalutamide. However, there is currently no noninvasive imaging modalities to detect, guide, and monitor specific treatment of AR-positive prostate cancer. (R)-3-Bromo-N-(4-fluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-propanamide [18F]-1 and N-(4-fluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide [18F]-2, derivatives of hydroxyflutamide, were synthesized as a fluorine-containing imaging agent candidates. A three-step fluorine-18 radiosynthesis route was developed, and the compounds were successfully labeled with a 10+/-3% decay corrected radiochemical yield, 95% radiochemical purity, and a specific activity of 1500+/-200 Ci/mmol end of bombardment (n = 10). These labeled biprobes not only may enable for the future quantitative molecular imaging of AR-positive prostate cancer using positron emission tomography but may also allow for image-guided treatment of prostate cancer.
