Rosiglitazone treatment increases subcutaneous adipose tissue glucose uptake in parallel with perfusion in patients with type 2 diabetes: a double-blind, randomized study with metformin. We have shown that rosiglitazone increases whole-body and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity in humans.The aim of this study was to further examine whether possible changes in adipose perfusion could explain increased adipose tissue glucose uptake (GU).Thirty-seven patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes were included.Patients were randomized into treatment with rosiglitazone, metformin, or placebo for 26 wk in a double-blinded trial.Femoral adipose flow and GU were measured with [15O]H2O, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia. Adipose masses were measured using magnetic resonance imaging.Metformin and rosiglitazone treatment improved glycemic control, but only rosiglitazone increased whole-body insulin sensitivity. Rosiglitazone treatment increased flow by 72% (P < 0.01) and GU by 23% (P < 0.05) and thereby decreased adipose tissue glucose extraction by 18% (P < 0.05) no changes were observed in the metformin or placebo-treated groups. When the adipose masses were taken into account, rosiglitazone treatment increased flow by 73% (P < 0.01) and GU by 24% (P < 0.05). During hyperinsulinemia, flow correlated with GU (r = 0.63In conclusion, s.c. GU is associated with flow in patients with type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone treatment enhances GU and flow but decreases glucose extraction, suggesting that perfusion may contribute to adipose tissue insulin sensitization by rosiglitazone.
