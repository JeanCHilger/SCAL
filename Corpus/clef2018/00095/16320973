Sensitivity and related factors in iodine-123-beta-methyl-p-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid myocardial scintigraphy to detect stable effort angina pectoris. This study evaluated the sensitivity and the related factors in iodine-123-beta-methyl-p-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) scintigraphy to detect stable angina.The subjects were 198 patients with stable angina who underwent BMIPP before percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary bypass graft surgery. Patients with unstable angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy and vasospastic angina were excluded. After investigation of the sensitivity of BMIPP, the patients with single-vessel disease without collateral flow were classified into the normal (123)I-BMIPP uptake group (normal group)or decreased (123)I-BMIPP uptake group (decreased group), and various factors were compared between the two groups.Sensitivity was 61% overall, 58% in single-vessel disease, 69% in double-vessel disease, 53% in triple-vessel disease, 43% in only left main vessel disease, and 89% in left main and other vessel disease (NS). In single-vessel disease, the sensitivity was 40% in 75% coronary artery stenosis, 58% in 90% stenosis, 89% in 99% stenosis, and 69% in total occlusion (p = 0.003). Comparing the deoreased and normal groups, diabetes mellitus was more frequent in the normal group (14.6% vs 39.5%), minimal lumen diameter was smaller (0.75 +/- 0.37 vs 0.98 +/- 0.49 mm) and lesion length was longer in the decreased group (15.4 +/- 4.9 vs 11.6 +/- 5.5 mm). Logistic multivariate analysis showed that the independent factors were diabetes mellitus [odds ratio 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.87, p = 0.03], minimal lumen diameter (odds ratio 0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.48, p = 0.003) and lesion length (odds ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.00-1.25, p = 0.03).BMIPP is useful in stable angina patients because of the acceptable sensitivity. Diabetes mellitus, minimal lumen diameter and lesion length were independent factors associated with decreased BMIPP uptake.
