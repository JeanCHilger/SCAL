Comparison of Tc-99m sestamibi and F-18 FDG-PET in the assessment of multiple myeloma. Tc-99m methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (MIBI) has been reported to be a useful tracer in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Few articles have reported the potential value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in the evaluation of MM. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic abilities of the MIBI scan and the FDG-PET scan in the evaluation of MM.Twelve patients with MM were included. All patients received a radiological skeletal survey, MIBI scan and FDG-PET scan.Thirty-four lesions (19 soft tissue lesions and 15 skeletal lesions) plus 5 cases of bone marrow involvement were detected. The conventional skeletal X-ray survey detected 4 soft tissue lesions (21.1%), 12 skeletal lesions (80%), but no bone marrow involvement (0%). The MIBI scan found 4 cases of bone marrow involvement (80%), 13 soft tissue lesions (68.4%) and 12 skeletal lesions (80%). The PET scan detected 5 cases of bone marrow involvement (100%), 17 soft tissue lesions (89.5%) and 14 skeletal lesions (93.3%).Both the MIBI and the FDG-PET scans are useful in the evaluation of patients with MM. However, FDG-PET can detect more lesions than the MIBI scan in patients with MM.
