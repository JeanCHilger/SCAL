Comparison of Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT with fractional flow reserve in patients with intermediate coronary artery stenoses. Myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is an established noninvasive method for the assessment of the functional significance of coronary artery stenoses. Intracoronary pressure measurements to determine fractional flow reserve (FFR) are increasingly performed during coronary angiography whenever an immediate decision regarding possible intervention is required. We hypothesized that the regional summed difference score (SDSr), reflecting reversible perfusion defects in the myocardial supply area of the FFR target vessel, would be the best predictor of an abnormal FFR in patients without prior myocardial infarction. Otherwise, a regional summed stress score (SSSr) should be the best predictor of an abnormal FFR in patients with prior myocardial infarction for different patient subgroups with coronary artery disease.In this study 50 patients (mean age, 65 +/- 9.1 years 18 women) with coronary artery disease and a 50% to 75% coronary stenosis (target vessel) were prospectively investigated. Dobutamine myocardial SPECT was performed as a single-day stress/rest protocol by use of technetium 99m sestamibi. For image interpretation, semiquantitative analysis was conducted by calculating SSSr and SDSr. Within 8 (+/-14.9) days, coronary angiography was performed and FFR was calculated by use of a pressure wire (normal FFR, > or = 0.75). The mean FFR of all patients was 0.78 +/- 0.14. Of 50 patients, 17 had an FFR lower than 0.75 in the target vessel. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified an SDSr of 1 or greater and an SSSr of 3 or greater as the best threshold values for predicting ischemic FFR. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of SDSr and SSSr for the detection of FFR values lower than 0.75 in the target vessel were 80%, 76%, 53%, and 92%, respectively, and 70%, 93%, 78%, and 90%, respectively, in patients without prior myocardial infarction and 57%, 50%, 67%, and 40%, respectively, and 100%, 50%, 78%, and 100%, respectively, in patients with prior myocardial infarction. Weak correlation was found between the single values of FFR with both SDSr and SSSr for the different patient subgroups.Among the dobutamine myocardial scintigraphy variables studied, SDSr was the best predictor of an abnormal FFR (cutoff value of 0.75) in patients without prior myocardial infarction. As assumed, SSSr was the best predictor of an abnormal FFR in patients with prior myocardial infarction in the target region.
