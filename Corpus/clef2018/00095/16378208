Follow-up assessment of the collateral circulation in patients with Kawasaki disease who underwent dipyridamole stress technetium-99m tetrofosmin scintigraphy. To assess the alteration of myocardial ischemic findings and the role of collateral vessels in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD), we used dipyridamole stress technetium-99m tetrofosmin (Tf) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). A comparison study of coronary angiography and dipyridamole stress (0.70 mg/kg) Tf-SPECT was repeated at least twice in 20 patients. The subjects included 7 patients with coronary stenosis, 1 with pre- and post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to coronary stenosis, 1 with progression to coronary stenosis, and 11 with persistent coronary aneurysms. In the stenosis group, Tf-SPECT revealed that 6 of the 7 patients had some degree of ischemic findings, and 5 of these 6 did not show any change in their ischemic findings during follow-up. In 1 patient, the ischemic findings changed according to the collateral circulation changes. The patient who underwent CABG had pre-CABG ischemic changes that disappeared after CABG. In the patient whose coronary arteries progressed to stenosis, the ischemic findings progressed as the coronary stenosis progressed. In the persistent aneurysm group, there were no ischemic findings. In the future Tf-SPECT may become one of the most useful methods for monitoring the progressive changes of myocardial ischemia in KD.
