Transcranial sonography and [123I]FP-CIT SPECT disclose complementary aspects of Parkinson's disease. Hyperechogenic signal of substantia nigra (SN) in transcranial sonography (TCS) and reduced striatal uptake in FP-CIT SPECT are common findings in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). But so far it is unknown whether the extent of SN hyperechogenicity represents a correlate for the degeneration of presynaptic dopaminergic neurons in PD. We performed TCS and 123I-labelled N-(3-fluoropropyl)-2ss-carbomethoxy-3ss-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane ([123I]FP-CIT) SPECT in 53 patients with PD. Striatal FP-CIT uptake was quantified by measuring the striatal/posterior lobe binding of [123I]FP-CIT. SN echogenicity was quantified by planimetric measurement of the maximum extension of hyperechogenic signals. We found no correlation between striatal FP-CIT uptake and echogenicity of the SN, neither contralateral to the clinically more affected body side (r = +0.08, P = 0.57 Pearson's correlation) nor ipsilateral (r = +0.01
