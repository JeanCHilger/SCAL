Treatment of neuroblastoma using the fused imaging guided radiotherapy (FIGURA) system. The purpose of this study was to describe our department's experience with the fused imaging-guided radiotherapy (FIGURA) system for planning radiation treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma.Between 1999 and 2002, 11 patients received radiation therapy as consolidation after chemotherapy in 9 and for palliation in 2. Diagnostic metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging was used, which is specific for neuroblastoma, to identify the residual tumor, followed by computed tomography scanning in the radiation treatment position. The FIGURA software fused the images obtained by the 2 modalities and transferred the result to a 3-dimensional radiation treatment planning system. Radiation was delivered at a total dose of 25.2 Gy according to the FIGURA.Five patients achieved complete remission and 2 partial remission 3 were stabilized. One child with a highly rapid progressive course died of the disease.FIGURA is a new, feasible technique for defining target volumes. By using standard hospital equipment, it is possible to treat residual disease identified by sensitive metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging and localized with the anatomic computed tomography scan. Treating a more accurate target volume spares normal tissue and organs and minimizes side effects.
