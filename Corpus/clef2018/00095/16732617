The efficacy of cylindrical titanium mesh cage for the reconstruction of a critical-size canine segmental femoral diaphyseal defect. The authors developed a novel technique for the reconstruction of large segmental long bone defects using a cylindrical titanium mesh cage (CTMC). Although the initial clinical reports have been favorable, the CTMC technique has yet to be validated in a clinically relevant large animal model, which is the purpose of this study. Under general anesthesia, a unilateral, 3-cm mid-diaphyseal segmental defect was created in the femur of an adult canine. The defect reconstruction technique consisted of a CTMC that was packed and surrounded with a standard volume of morselized canine cancellous allograft and canine demineralized bone matrix. The limb was stabilized with a reamed titanium intramedullary nail. Animals were distributed into four experimental groups: in Groups A, B, and C (six dogs each), defects were CTMC reconstructed, and the animals euthanized at 6, 12, and 18 weeks, respectively in Group D (three dogs), the same defect reconstruction was performed but without a CTMC, and the animals were euthanized at 18 weeks. The femurs were harvested and analyzed by gross inspection, plain radiography, computed tomography (CT), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The femurs were mechanically tested in axial torsion to failure
