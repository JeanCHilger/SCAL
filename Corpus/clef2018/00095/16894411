Evaluation of the left ventricular hemodynamic function and myocardial perfusion by gated single photon emission tomography, in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus prodromal signs of cardiovascular disease after four years. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in hemodynamic function and myocardial perfusion of the left ventricle occurring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) 47-49 months after the first assessment. We have studied 20 asymptomatic patients, five females and 15 males, aged 22-46 y. The patients were under intensive insulin treatment and had normal electrocardiogram (ECG) at rest. In all patients gated single photon emission tomography (GSPET) was performed at rest and after exercise (examination I). After 47-49 months this test was repeated (examination II). GSPET was performed 60 min after the intravenous injection of 740 MBq of technetium-99m 2-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile ((99m)Tc-MIBI), using a dual-headed gamma-camera. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), end diastolic volume (EDV) and end systolic volume (ESV) were calculated using quantitative GSPET (QGS). The intensity of perfusion defects was also evaluated based on a four degree QGS scale. Our results were as follows: a) In examination I, performed at rest: LVEF was 56.1%+/-7.5%, EDV 96.9+/-25.8 ml and ESV 42.6+/-16.3 ml. b) In examination I at stress: LVEF was 57.2%+/-7.5%, EDV 94.1+/-24.0 ml and ESV 40.5+/-15.5. c) In examination II performed at rest: LVEF was 58.1%+/-6.5%, EDV 112.1+/-26.1 ml and ESV 46.6+/-14.9 ml and d) In examination II at stress: LVEF 57.8%+/-5.6%, EDV 107.9+/-27.4 ml and ESV 44.9+/-14.4 ml. Significant differences were found between examinations I and II, regarding: a) EDV at rest (P<0.001) and at stress (P<0.001) and b) ESV at rest (P<0.05) and at stress (P<0.005). Correlation analysis revealed significant correlation between LVEF at rest and at stress both in examination I (r=0.83 P<0.001) and also in examination II (r=-0.897
