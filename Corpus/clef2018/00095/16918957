The BRAF mutation is useful for prediction of clinical recurrence in low-risk patients with conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma. The activating BRAF(V600E) mutation is the most common genetic alteration reported in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). While some reports suggest the BRAF(V600E) mutation is associated with factors predicting a poor prognosis and recurrence, this remains a controversial issue.To determine whether the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation is a prognostic indicator for clinical recurrence in low-risk patients with conventional PTC.The study involved 203 conventional PTC patients who underwent total or near-total thyroidectomy followed by immediate 131I ablation of the remnants. Patients with antithyroglobulin antibodies and those with extracervical metastases at presentation were excluded. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tumour specimens, and the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation was evaluated using PCR amplification and direct sequencing.The BRAF(V600E) mutation was found to be present in 149 (73.4%) of 203 patients. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was correlated with male gender (P = 0.006) and with tumour size (P = 0.005). While there appeared to be an association between the BRAF(V600E) mutation and extrathyroid extension, this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.062). During follow-up of the 203 patients (median 7.3 years range 0.7-10.0 years), 36 (18%) patients experienced recurrence. While univariate analysis showed the BRAF(V600E) mutation was associated with tumour recurrence (21% with mutation vs 7% without mutationAlthough the BRAF(V600E) mutation was found to be associated with a higher clinical recurrence of disease in low-risk conventional PTC patients, it was not an independent predictor.
