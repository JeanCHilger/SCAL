Liver metastases: 3D shape-based analysis of CT scans for detection of local recurrence after radiofrequency ablation. This HIPAA-compliant pilot study had internal review board approval informed consent was waived. The purpose was to determine retrospectively the diagnostic performance of a computer-aided three-dimensional (3D) analytic tool for assessing local recurrences of liver metastases by quantifying shape changes in ablated tumors on computed tomographic (CT) scans for follow-up of radiofrequency (RF) ablation. Positron emission tomographic and long-term CT follow-up images were reference standards. Fifty-six follow-up CT scans of 12 liver metastases (mean size, 4.0 cm) in nine patients treated with RF ablation were retrospectively analyzed. After the 1st month following RF ablation, the 3D analytic tool helped quantify ablated tumor shape variations and revealed recurrences even in the absence of abnormal enhancement (sensitivity, seven of seven
