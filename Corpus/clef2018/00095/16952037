Usefulness of preoperative FDG-PET for detection of gastric cancer. Positron emission tomography (PET), using 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) as a tracer, can detect malignant neoplasms with altered glucose metabolism. To clarify the usefulness of FDG-PET for detecting gastric cancer, we evaluated preoperative PET imaging in gastric cancer patients.Sixty-two gastric cancer patients who underwent FDG-PET imaging and gastric resection with lymphadenectomy were evaluated.For primary tumor assessment by PET, detection rates were significantly different in the following order: tumor size 30 mm or more (76.7%) > tumor size less than 30 mm (16.8%) advanced gastric cancer (AGC, 82.9%) > early gastric cancer (EGCLarger or more advanced tumors with nodal involvement had a higher detection rate by PET. In EGCs, only the intestinal type was detectable by PET. PET-positive EGC may be aggressive, and an adequate lymphadenectomy must be done. Preoperative PET was useful for the detection of other malignancies and distant metastasis.
