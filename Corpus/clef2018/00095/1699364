Localization of premature and ectopic ventricular depolarization using a new nuclear medicine tomographic technique. In planar radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) identification of the site of initial contraction is possibly by the Fourier phase. First clinical experiences will be presented with a new integrated tomographic technique--ISPECT--in noninvasively assessing the site of ectopic or premature ventricular depolarization. In six patients Fourier phases of RNV and ISPECT were performed and compared in five with results from the corresponding electrophysiologic study. It was possible to exactly localize the beginning of mechanical contraction in the two orthogonal planes: during pacemaker stimulation at the apex of the right ventricle, at the lateral border of a large aneurysm during ventricular tachycardia, and at the site of three of five WPW bundles. In the other two bundles the site of first contraction was near the area found during invasive mapping procedure. Thus, this new ISPECT approach together with planar radionuclide imaging may help in noninvasively localizing the site of ectopic and premature depolarization in addition to surface ECG.
