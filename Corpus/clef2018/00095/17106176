Evaluation of no-reflow phenomenon using 201TlCl/123I-BMIPP dual-isotope myocardial SPECT. We assessed the usefulness of (201)thallous chloride (TlCl)/(123)I-beta-methyl iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) dual-isotope single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to identify the "no-reflow phenomenon," defined as inadequate myocardial perfusion through a given segment of the coronary circulation without angiographic evidence of mechanical vessel obstruction.(201)TlCl/(123)I-BMIPP SPECT was performed in 73 patients within approximately 1 week of initial acute myocardial infarction (AMI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We divided the left ventricular myocardium into 17 segments on each SPECT image and scored tracer accumulation in each segment with a five-point scoring system according to the American Heart Association criteria. Total severity scores were calculated by summing the scores for all 17 segments. The mismatch ratio between myocardial perfusion and metabolism was derived from the (201)TlCl and (123)I-BMIPP total severity scores: mismatch ratio=((123)I-BMIPP total severity score -(201)TlCl total severity score)/(123)I-BMIPP total severity score. Patients were classified according to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade as having TIMI reflow grade 0-I (TIMI 0-I reflow group n=11), II (TIMI II reflow groupThe mismatch ratios in the TIMI II (0.4 +/- 0.3) and TIMI III (0.4 +/- 0.2) reflow groups were significantly higher than that in the TIMI 0-1 reflow group (0.1 +/- 0.1, p<0.05). Although coronary angiography revealed TIMI III flow after reperfusion, the mismatch ratios in the TIMI III (B) reflow group (0.2 +/- 0.1) and in the TIMI 0-I reflow group (0.1 +/- 0.1) were significantly lower than that in the TIMI III (A) reflow group (0.4 +/- 0.2, p<0.01), reflecting noneffective recanalization (so called no-reflow phenomenon).(201)TlCl/(123)I-BMIPP dual-isotope myocardial SPECT reveals the biochemical degree of the no-reflow phenomenon, whereas coronary angiography shows recanalized vascular flow only. Dual-isotope myocardial SPECT might be useful for evaluating reperfusion therapy.
