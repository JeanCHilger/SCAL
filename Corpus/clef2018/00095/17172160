Synthesis modules and automation in F-18 labeling. Fast implementation of PET into clinical studies and research has resulted in high demands in the automated modules for the preparation of PET radiopharmaceuticals in a safe and reproducible manner. 18F-labeled radiotracers are of considerable interest due to longer half-life of fluorine-18 allowing remote site application, as demonstrated by [18F]FDG. In this chapter, the state of the art of commercially available modules for [18F]FDG is reviewed with the emphasis on multibatch production of this important radiotracer. Examples are given on the syntheses of other clinically relevant 18F-labeled radiotracers by using existing [18F]FDG synthesizers or with the help of general-purpose [18F]nucleophilic fluorination modules. On-going research and progress in the automation of complex radio labeling procedures followed by development of flexible multipurpose automated apparatus are discussed. The contribution of radiochemists in facilitating automation via introduction of new 18F-labeling techniques and labeling synthons, on-line reactions and purifications etc. is outlined.
