Value of electrocardiographically gated single-photon emission computed tomographic myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in a cohort of symptomatic postmenopausal women. The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the clinical value of electrocardiographically gated single-photon emission computed tomographic myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) imaging in a cohort of postmenopausal women with symptoms suggestive of ischemic heart disease. Forty-six postmenopausal women with no history of coronary artery disease (CAD), but with typical or atypical angina and >or=1 risk factor for CAD, were enrolled and underwent both coronary angiography and technetium-99m sestamibi MPS with exercise (n = 36) or pharmacologic stress (n = 10). All women were followed up for 5.0 +/- 3 years for the occurrence of hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, and/or new-onset or worsening angina. CAD prevalence (>or=50% diameter stenosis) was 62% (26 of 42 patients). Fifteen patients (36%) had 1-vessel disease, 7 (17%) had 2-vessel disease, and 4 (10%) had 3-vessel disease. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the exercise electrocardiogram were 67% and 69%, respectively. By comparison, sensitivity of MPS was 88% and specificity was 87.5% (p <0.0001). Cox survival analysis showed 3- and 5-year cumulative event-free survival rates of 97% and 94% for patients with normal MPS results compared with 60% and 48% for those with abnormal MPS findings (p <0.001). In conclusion, results of this study indicate high diagnostic and prognostic accuracy for MPS in symptomatic postmenopausal women.
