Positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging: a review and a local circuit neurons hypo(dys)function hypothesis of schizophrenia. A review of brain imaging (PET and MRI) studies on schizophrenia and recent data from neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neuropathology, neurochemistry, neuropsychology, and cortical organization theory is integrated with the concept of local circuit neurons (LCNs) in a new hypothesis--the local circuit neurons hypo(dys)function hypothesis of schizophrenia--that attempts to explain the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of schizophrenia through a hypofunction (or dysfunction) of the local circuit neurons in prefrontal and limbic-temporal areas. This hypofunction (dysfunction) is then related to the neurocircuitry, neuropsychology, and psychopathology of schizophrenia.
