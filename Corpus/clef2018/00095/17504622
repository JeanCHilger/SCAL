Peritoneal equilibration test and results analysis in children undergoing chronic peritoneal dialysis. To explore the characteristics of peritoneal transport in children undergoing chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD).Peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was carried out 10 times in 6 children (aged from 2 to 14 years) who were maintained by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and the peritoneal solution transport rate was evaluated by the standards of Twardowski's and Pediatric Peritoneal Dialysis Study Consortium (PPDSC)'s criteria.In this study, the initial PET was performed at (38.7 +/- 15.6) days following initiation of PD, the 4-hours of peritoneal creatinine clearance (4 h-D/P) and glucose absorption (4 h-D/D(0)) was (0.85 +/- 0.24) and (0.34 +/- 0.19), respectively. According to the standards of Twardowski's and PPDSC criteria, the peritoneal transport categories were divided into high transport (H) (6/10), high average transport (HA) (1/10), low average (LA) (3/10) for peritoneal solution transport, and H (3/10), HA (4/10), LA (1/10), low transport (2/10) for glucose absorption. No low transport type of solution was used in the patients. The coincidence rate of peritoneal creatinine and glucose transport types were 100% and 90% between the Twardowski's and PPDSC criteria, respectively. The different changes of peritoneal transport type were found in two patients with continuous PET. The value of 4 h-D/P increased after peritonitis episodes.The results showed that the PET in 70% of CAPD children fell into high and high average transport categories elevated by PPDSC's and adult standards, no-sinusoid distribution. The peritoneal solute clearance was adequate in the children, but net water ultrafiltration was lower. Standard pediatric PET and its criteria are consistent with the adult criteria. The capability of peritoneal solute transport increased after peritonitis episodes.
