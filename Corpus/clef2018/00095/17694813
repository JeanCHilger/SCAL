Study of the impact of intramyocardial implantation of stem cells on myocardial perfusion and contractility in patients with coronary heart disease concurrent with postinfarct cardiosclerosis and chronic heart failure. to study of intramyocardial implantation of cultured bone marrow stem cells on myocardial perfusion and contractility in the surgical treatment of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and chronic heart failure (CHF), by synchronized single-photon emission computed tomography (SSPECT) of the myocardium.The study included 11 patients. Intramyocardial injection of cell injections into the myocardial periscarring areas was made at coronary bypass surgery. All the patients underwent 99mTc myocardial SSPECT MIBI before and 3, 6, 12 months after surgery.Implantation of bone marrow stem cells into the left ventricular myocardium favorably affects left ventricular remodeling and contributes to the improvement of myocardial perfusion and contractility, as evidenced by 99mTc.
