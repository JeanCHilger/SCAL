Voxel-based investigations of regional cerebral blood flow abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease using a single-detector SPECT system. To evaluate the feasibility of using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) program for an automated, voxel-by-voxel assessment of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects relative to age-matched controls studied with a conventional, single-detector SPECT system.We used a databank of 99mTc-HMPAO images of 19 patients with a diagnosis of probable AD and 15 elderly healthy volunteers data were acquired using an Orbiter-Siemens single-detector SPECT system. Using SPM, images were transformed spatially, smoothed (12mm), and the data were compared on a voxel-by-voxel basis with t-tests.There were significant rCBF reductions in AD patients relative to controls involving regions predicted a priori to be affected in AD, namely the left temporal and parietal neocortices, and the right posterior cingulate gyrus (p<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons).The location of rCBF reductions in AD subjects in our study is consistent with the deficits detected in previous functional imaging studies of AD using higher-resolution devices. This suggests the potential usefulness of using SPM for the analysis of data acquired with single-detector SPECT systems, despite the limited sensitivity and spatial resolution of such equipment.
