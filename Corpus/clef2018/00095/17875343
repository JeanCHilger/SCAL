Jaburetox-2Ec: an insecticidal peptide derived from an isoform of urease from the plant Canavalia ensiformis. Canatoxin, a urease isoform from Canavalia ensiformis seeds, shows insecticidal activity against different insect species. Its toxicity relies on an internal 10 kDa peptide (pepcanatox), released by hydrolysis of Canatoxin by cathepsins in the digestive system of susceptible insects. In the present work, based on the N-terminal sequence of pepcanatox, we have designed primers to amplify by PCR a 270-bp fragment corresponding to pepcanatox using JBURE-II cDNA (one of the urease isoforms cloned from C. ensiformis, with high identity to JBURE-I, the classical urease) as a template. This amplicon named jaburetox-2 was cloned into pET 101 vector to obtain heterologous expression in Escherichia coli of the recombinant protein in C-terminal fusion with V-5 epitope and 6-His tag. Jaburetox-2Ec was purified on Nickel-NTA resin and bioassayed in insect models. Dysdercus peruvianus larvae were fed on cotton seed meal diets containing 0.01% (w/w) Jaburetox-2Ec and, after 11 days, all individuals were dead. Jaburetox-2Ec was also tested against Spodoptera frugiperda larvae and caused 100% mortality. In contrast, high doses of Jaburetox-2Ec were innocuous when injected or ingested by mice and neonate rats. Modeling of Jaburetox-2Ec, in comparison with other peptide structures, revealed a prominent beta-hairpin motif consistent with an insecticidal activity based on either neurotoxicity or cell permeation.
