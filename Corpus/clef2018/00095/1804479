Companion animal illness and human emotion. Historical overview. The historical changes in practitioner response to client emotions during a companion animal's illness are outlined. In the not too distant past, veterinarians, frustrated by lack of technical competence, ignored the emotional needs of clients. The 1970s witnessed the development of a concerted interest in resolving the lack of knowledge in the subject. The American Veterinary Medical Association and other professional organizations have disseminated proven insights into client emotions. Client sophistication, increased competition, and the threat of litigation have forced practitioners to understand and appreciate human psychologic needs. Major publishers and institutions have accepted the responsibility of making material available. In the final analysis, establishing rapport with clients will prove gratifying to the practitioner and will gain client loyalty.
