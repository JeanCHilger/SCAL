A technique for lung ventilation-perfusion SPECT in neonates and infants. Single photon emission tomography (SPECT) of the lung is a well-established non-invasive technique for quantitative assessment of regional lung ventilation and perfusion distribution in children and in adults. However, its application in neonates as well as infants has been scarce because of several practical limitations, such as the trade off between image quality and restricted effective radiation doses and the lack of suitable inhalations agents and administration techniques.In this paper, a new technique for quantitative regional lung SPECT based on a passive Technegas administration procedure is described and clinically applied. The first clinical findings in neonates are reported.This technique overcomes some of the limitations of commercial ventilation systems by making patient compliance unnecessary, avoiding difficult breathing manoeuvres and by minimizing both facemask dead space and inspiratory-expiratory resistance.This technique satisfies requirements for routine applications in neonates, infants and even older patients and has a potential use also for mechanically ventilated patients. It has the potential to allow a more precise functionally oriented diagnosis, which is of importance for treatment and follow-up in patients with severe lung diseases.
