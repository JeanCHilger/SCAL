Radioimmunoimaging of osteosarcoma with BMP monoclonal antibodies. The author employed the radioimmunoimaging technique in localizing osteosarcoma with the use of bone morphogenetic protein monoclonal antibodies (BMP-McAb). BMP-McAb which had been labelled with 125I or 131I by the chloramine T method was given in injection to patients, and imaging was performed on SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) 24 or 48 hrs after the injection of antibodies. There were seven patients with osteosarcoma and one with parosteal osteosarcoma. The result of SPECT imaging confirmed of the tumor areas of osteosarcoma clearly visualized and the T/NT ratio of radioactivity the highest is 11.5 and average on 5.92. There is no positive imaging in parosteal sarcoma the technique of the radioimmunoimaging presented have those advantages: specificity and sensitivity powerful, easy to operate and harmless to health. The result of our study demonstrated biodistribution that the BMP-McAb retained in osteosarcomas tissues and indicated there are most BMP in tumor areas. It is therefore proposed that BMP are one kind of related antigen with osteosarcomas and has a satisfactory to clinical study.
