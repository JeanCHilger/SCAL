Correlation between FDG uptake and glucose transporter type 1 expression in neuroendocrine tumors of the lung. Neuroendocrine (NE) lung tumors are subdivided into the following types typical (TC) and atypical carcinoids (AC), large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). Moreover, the determinants of the FDG uptakes of NE lung tumors have not been elucidated. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between FDG uptake and glucose transporter type 1 (Glut-1) expression in these NE tumors. Tissue-proven NE lung tumor patients (n=32
