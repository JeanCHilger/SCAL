Bayesian fused classification of medical images. In many applications in computer vision and signal processing, it is necessary to assimilate data from multiple sources. This is a particularly important issue in medical imaging, where information on a patient may be available from a number of different modalities. As a result, there has been much recent research interest in this area. The authors suggest an additional Bayesian method which generates a segmented classification concurrently with improving reconstructions of a set of registered images. A synthetic example is used to demonstrate the subjectives and benefits of this proposed approach. Two medical applications, one fusing computed tomography (CT) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain scans, and the other magnetic resonance (MR) images at two different resolutions, are considered.
