Cardiac computed tomography: indications and perspectives. The increased number of detectors on CT systems has improved spatial resolution, which is becoming close to that of coronary angiography. Simultaneously, manufacturers are working hard at improving temporal resolution, so that uninterpretable cardiac CT examinations will progressively disappear. Cardiac CT scanners are used primarily to rule out coronary disease in patients with a low cardiovascular risk but must also be able to perform thoracic and cardiac computed tomography. Assessment of bypass graft patency, analysis of ventricular function, myocardial diseases (ischemic or not), valvular disease, diagnosis of chest pain in the emergency department--all can be studied perfectly with this technique. In the near future analysis of the composition of coronary plaque and its monitoring during statin treatment will also become possible.
