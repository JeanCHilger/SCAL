Analysis of apical remodeling in gated myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging in ischemic cardiomyopathy. A divergent pattern (DP) of the left ventricle (LV) is an expression of apical remodeling in myocardial perfusion gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM).We consecutively studied 156 patients (mean age, 63 years 24 women) with ICM (LV ejection fraction, < or =40%) using gated SPECT and technetium-labeled agents. Apical remodeling was considered to exist when a DP was observed. Apical remodeling was noted in 30% of patients, all of whom had a history of anterior myocardial infarction. A divergent pattern was observed more frequently in younger patients and in those with ST-segment elevation on their electrocardiograms. The longer the interval between the infarction and the performance of gated SPECT, the more prevalent were the LV dilatation and DP. A divergent pattern was associated with cardiac death and heart failure only in patients with scintigraphic criteria for myocardial viability.A divergent pattern in gated SPECT, as an expression of apical remodeling, can be observed in up to a third of patients with ICM, all with a history of anterior infarction. The longer the time between the infarction and the gated SPECT, the more prevalent the LV dilatation becomes. Apical remodeling is a variable predicts mortality in patients with scintigraphic criteria for viability.
