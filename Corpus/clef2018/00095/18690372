Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy 2006 in Germany. Results of the query and current status. This second survey was to deliver further information on myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) in Germany in 2006.351 questionnaires were evaluated: 207 private practices (PP), 117 hospitals (HO), 27 from university hospitals (UH).MPS of 106 331 patients were reported, 85% were investigated with (99m)Tc-perfusion tracers. 74% [2005 = 72%] were performed in PP, 17% [2005 = 15%] in HO and 9% [2005 = 13%] in UH. PP, which participated in 2005 and 2006, demonstrated an increase by 3,9% (HO 0%, UH - 13,0%). The type of stress was pharmacological in 27% [2005 = 22%] 54% adenosine (of these 29% with exercise), 37% dipyridamole (of these 56% with exercise), and 9% dobutamine. Gated SPECT was performed in 42% [2005 = 36%] of all rest- and in 39% [2005 = 32%] of all stress MPS. An attenuation correction was used by 69 [2005 = 78] institutions. 40% of all MPS were performed in patients suspected to have CAD. 24% of all institutions reported changes in the use of MPS by competing methods.There is a small increase of MPS between 2005 and 2006 despite competing methods. Gated SPECT has experienced more acceptance. Suspicion of CAD is an important indication of MPS. In order to tap the full potential of MPS a gated SPECT should be performed routinely.
