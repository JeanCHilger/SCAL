Simultaneous MR/PET imaging of the human brain: feasibility study. The purpose of this study was to apply a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-compatible positron emission tomographic (PET) detector technology for simultaneous MR/PET imaging of the human brain and skull base. The PET detector ring consists of lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) scintillation crystals in combination with avalanche photodiodes (APDs) mounted in a clinical 3-T MR imager with use of the birdcage transmit/receive head coil. Following phantom studies, two patients were simultaneously examined by using fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and MR imaging and spectroscopy. MR/PET data enabled accurate coregistration of morphologic and multifunctional information. Simultaneous MR/PET imaging is feasible in humans, opening up new possibilities for the emerging field of molecular imaging.
