Stimulation-induced increases of astrocytic oxidative metabolism in rats and humans investigated with 1-11C-acetate. The purpose of this study was to investigate astrocytic oxidative metabolism using 1-(11)C-acetate. 1-(11)C-acetate kinetics were evaluated in the rat somatosensory cortex using a beta-scintillator during different manipulations (test-retest, infraorbital nerve stimulation, and administration of acetazolamide or dichloroacetate). In humans a visual activation paradigm was used and kinetics were measured with positron emission tomography. Data were analyzed using a one-tissue compartment model. The following features supported the hypothesis that washout of radiolabel (k(2)) is because of (11)C-CO(2) and therefore related to oxygen consumption (CMRO(2)): (1) the onset of (11)C washout was delayed (2)k(2) was not affected by acetazolamide-induced blood flow increase
