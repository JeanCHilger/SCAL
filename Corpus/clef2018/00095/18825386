Endorectal magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5 Tesla to assess local recurrence following radical prostatectomy using T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced imaging. To evaluate diagnostic performance of endorectal magnetic resonance (eMR) for diagnosing local recurrence of prostate cancer (PC) in patients with previous radical prostatectomy (RP) and to assess whether contrast-enhanced (CE)-eMR improved diagnostic accuracy in comparison to unenhanced study. Unenhanced eMR data of 72 male patients (mean of total PSA: 1.23 +/- 1.3 ng/ml) with previous RP were interpreted retrospectively and classified either as normal or suspicious for local recurrence. All eMR examinations were re-evaluated also on CE-eMR 4 months after the first reading. Images were acquired on a 1.5-T system. These data were compared to the standard of reference for local recurrence: prostatectomy bed biopsy results choline positron emission tomography results
