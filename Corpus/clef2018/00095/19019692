Synthesis of S-[13N]nitrosoglutathione (13N-GSNO) as a new potential PET imaging agent. In the present paper, a fast and reproducible method for the synthesis of S-[(13)N]nitrosoglutathione is reported for the first time. The labeling strategy is based on the production of [(13)N]NO(3)(-) via the (16)O(p,alpha)(13)N nuclear reaction in water, as opposed to the standardized production of [(13)N]NH(4)(+) in 2mM aqueous ethanol. Following the reduction of [(13)N]NO(3)(-) to [(13)N]NO(2)(-), the reaction with glutathione in the presence of hydrochloric acid led to the desired radiotracer with a good radiochemical yield (24.2+/-2.0% end of synthesis, n=5) in a short production time (3min from the end of bombardment).
