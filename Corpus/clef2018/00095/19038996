Comparison of myocardial perfusion 82Rb PET performed with CT- and transmission CT-based attenuation correction. CT-based attenuation correction (AC) for myocardial perfusion PET studies is challenging because of respiratory motion. Our study aimed to compare the transmission CT (TCT)-based and CT-based AC for myocardial perfusion PET/CT images with a direct semiquantitative approach comparing differences in segmental count distribution.Stress and rest (82)Rb PET scans from 54 consecutive patients acquired on a PET/CT scanner with dual CT-based and TCT-based AC were considered. TCT- and CT-based AC images were automatically registered to each other, and direct voxel-based and American Heart Association segment-based estimation of positive and negative changes between these scans was performed. Additionally, visual quality control (QC) of CT map alignment with PET emission data was performed by 2 expert observers, and studies with significant (>/=5 mm) misalignment were reprocessed with corrected CT alignment.We used the 17-segment American Heart Association model for TCT-to-CT regional change analysis in all patients and found that 4 segments on rest and 4 segments on stress scans differed more than 3% between CT- and TCT-corrected images for studies without significant misalignments (<5 mm) only 1 differed by more than 5%. In cases with significant misalignment of greater than or equal to 3% TCT-CT AC, changes were observed on 14 rest and 10 stress segmentsThere are significant differences between TCT and CT AC applied to cardiac PET/CT studies, which remain after alignment of CT maps to emission data.
