Investigations of cerebral glucose utilization into the newborn brain: a [18F]-FDG positron emission tomography study using a high resolution multiwire proportional chamber detector device. An experimental approach is presented, where for the first time positron emission tomography (PET, the most important method for in vivo measuring the key functions of brain physiology and metabolism) was applied together with other techniques for quantitative-topological estimation of key parameters such as rCMRGlu in normal and disturbed brain function states in the newborn period.
