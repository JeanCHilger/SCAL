18F-FLT and 18F-FDG PET to measure response to radiotherapy combined with celecoxib in two colorectal xenograft models. To determine the dependence of celecoxib on the tumour micro-environment in vitro and in vivo and to compare the use of (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) and (18)F- 3'-deoxy-3-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) to measure tumour response.In vitro, colony assays were performed on a cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) negative (HCT116) and a COX-2 positive cell line (HCA7). Xenograft models of these cell lines were treated with celecoxib and/or radiotherapy. Micro Positron Emission Tomography (microPET) scans with (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT were performed at different time-points.In vitro, no radiosensitising effect was seen in either of the cell lines. In vivo results showed a significant effect of celecoxib in the COX-2 negative tumours (HCT116) (enhancement ratio 1.5, p = 0.02) while no significant effect was observed in the COX-2 positive model (HCA7). A good correlation between (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT uptake was seen in both tumour models (r = 0.48, p = 0.002 r = 0.41, p = 0.005). After irradiation, a decrease in the uptake of both tracers was observed in both tumour models, which was more pronounced in the combination group, confirming the growth delay data.The contradicting in vitro and in vivo results suggest a major role of the tumour micro-environment. (18)F-FLT seems a good alternative for (18)F-FDG to follow tumour growth after radiation treatment.
