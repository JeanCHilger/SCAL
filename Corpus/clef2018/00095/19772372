Emerging apoptosis agonists for bladder cancer. Bladder cancer is a very common and aggressive tumor entity. Unfortunately, common chemotherapy is not able to cure advanced bladder cancer. Therefore, several attempts have been made to improve the response to chemotherapy. Because changes in apoptotic pathways are frequent events in the development of chemoresistance of malignancies, pro-apoptotic treatment seems promising for the improvement of bladder cancer prognosis. Preclinical data show potential ways for a successful combination of apoptosis agonists with conventional chemotherapy. None of these principles has so far successfully been translated into clinical trials for bladder cancer. This review describes actual studies and future perspectives for apoptotic agonists in bladder cancer.
