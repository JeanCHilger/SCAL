Radiosynthesis and micro-SPECT imaging of 99mTc-dendrimer poly(amido)-amine folic acid conjugate. Acetylated (Ac) dendrimer poly(amido)-amine (PAMAM) generation 5 (G5) reacted with folic acid (FA), followed by reacting with 2-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-6-methyl-diethylenetria minepentaacetic acid (1B4M DTPA) to form the conjugate of Ac-G5-FA-1B4M DTPA which was further radiolabeled with (99m)Tc. The radiochemical yield is up to 98.9% with excellent in vitro/in vivo stability, rapid blood clearance and certain tumor accumulation which was further confirmed by micro-SPECT imaging study.
