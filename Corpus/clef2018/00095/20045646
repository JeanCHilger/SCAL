New iodinated quinoline-2-carboxamides for SPECT imaging of the translocator protein. With the aim of developing new SPECT imaging agents for the translocator protein (TSPO), a small library of iodinated quinoline-2-carboxamides have been prepared and tested for binding affinity with TSPO. N,N-Diethyl-3-iodomethyl-4-phenylquinoline-2-carboxamide was found to have excellent affinity (K(i) 12.0 nM), comparable to that of the widely used TSPO imaging agent PK11195.
