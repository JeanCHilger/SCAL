Computer aided diagnosis system for the Alzheimer's disease based on partial least squares and random forest SPECT image classification. This letter shows a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) technique for the early detection of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) by means of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) image classification. The proposed method is based on partial least squares (PLS) regression model and a random forest (RF) predictor. The challenge of the curse of dimensionality is addressed by reducing the large dimensionality of the input data by downscaling the SPECT images and extracting score features using PLS. A RF predictor then forms an ensemble of classification and regression tree (CART)-like classifiers being its output determined by a majority vote of the trees in the forest. A baseline principal component analysis (PCA) system is also developed for reference. The experimental results show that the combined PLS-RF system yields a generalization error that converges to a limit when increasing the number of trees in the forest. Thus, the generalization error is reduced when using PLS and depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Moreover, PLS feature extraction is found to be more effective for extracting discriminative information from the data than PCA yielding peak sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values of 100%, 92.7%, and 96.9%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed CAD system outperformed several other recently developed AD CAD systems.
