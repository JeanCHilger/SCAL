Additive Value of B-Type Natriuretic Peptide on Rest Tl-Dipyridamole Stress Tc-Sestamibi Gated Myocardial SPECT in Patients with Normal Left Ventricular Systolic Function. We evaluated whether BNP has additive value to SPECT in patients with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function. Data from 224 consecutive patients who underwent rest (201)Tl-dipyridamole stress (99m)Tc-sestamibi gated SPECT and coronary angiography due to chest pain were analyzed. Patients with true positive SPECT showed significant higher BNP level than those with false positive defect (38.5 (19.0-79.8) versus 19.0 (9.3-35.8), P = .01). Patients with true negative SPECT also showed significantly lower BNP level than those with false negative SPECT (39.0 (23.0-77.0) versus 22.0 (15.0-43.0), P = .002). In multivariate analyses, elevated BNP level (using a cut-off value of 23.0 pg/mL) was the strongest and independent predictor of CAD in overall patients (OR 2.75, 95% CI: 1.50-5.023, P = .001) and patients with positive SPECT (OR 3.34, 95% CI: 1.51-7.37, P = .003). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for CAD in overall patients and patients with positive SPECT was 0.673 (95% CI: 0.603-0.743, P < .001) and 0.694 (95% CI: 0.602-0.786, P < .001), respectively. This study suggests that BNP level has additive diagnostic value to SPECT findings in predicting CAD in patients with normal LV systolic function.
