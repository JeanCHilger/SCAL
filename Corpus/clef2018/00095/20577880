PET/CT in primary musculoskeletal tumours: a step forward. Hybrid imaging with combined positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) plays an important role in the staging and management of a wide variety of solid tumours. However, its use in the evaluation of musculoskeletal malignancy has not yet entered routine clinical practice. Cross-sectional imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MR) and computed tomography have well-established roles but there is increasing evidence for the selective use of PET/CT in the management of these patients. The aims of this article are to review the current evidence and clinical applications of PET/CT in primary musculoskeletal tumours and discuss potential future developments using novel PET tracers and integrated PET/MR.
