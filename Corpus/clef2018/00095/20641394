 Ferritin is an iron storage protein with a molecular mass of 440 kDa and is overexpressed in some tumors such as breast cancer (1, 2), Hodgkin's lymphoma (3), and pancreatic cancer (4, 5). Iron has the ability to promote neoplastic cell growth (6). Radiolabeled polyclonal anti-ferritin antibodies have been shown to have anti-tumor effects in patients with Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma. However, the response rate was dependent on the batches of polyclonal antibody used. Therefore, AMB8LK, a murine IgG
