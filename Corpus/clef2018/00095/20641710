2-[ Endothelial cells are important cells in angiogenesis (1). Tumor growth requires the formation of new blood vessels. Potent angiogenic factors (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor) induce proliferation, sprouting, migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells (2). 2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME), an endogenous metabolite of 17Î²-estradiol, inhibits proliferating tumor cells and angiogenesis
