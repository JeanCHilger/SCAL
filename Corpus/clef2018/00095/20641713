. The primary function of the liver is to remove toxins from the body through metabolism and excretion, and to synthesize complex biologically active substances such as clotting factors and albumin. Impairment of liver function as a result of hepatitis, infections, jaundice, cirrhosis, or cancer can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal disorders. The evaluation of hepatic function is an important parameter in the determination of the physiological state of the liver, particularly for patients who have been diagnosed with liver disease for which a hepatectomy or liver transplantation is the treatment of choice (1). Therefore, determination of the hepatic function is now considered important before and after a hepatectomy or liver transplantation to predict patient outcome (2). The asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGP-R) exist specifically on hepatic cell membranes and are believed to be necessary for intracellular trafficking and endocytic activity in the liver. The number of ASGP-R on the hepatocytes of individuals with liver disease is altered and is thus considered a good indicator for the evaluation of liver function (3, 4). Technetium [
