Role of FDG-PET in the definition of involved-field radiation therapy and management for pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma. To evaluate positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) influences in involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT) field design in pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL).From June 2003 to February 2008, 30 pediatric HL patients were treated at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) and Emory University Department of Radiation Oncology with both chemotherapy and IFRT. Diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT and PET-CT were coregistered using image fusion software. Both were reviewed for all potential sites of involvement and correlated to determine concordance and discordance. They were used in IFRT planning to determine the influence of PET-CT on target volumes and field design.There were 546 regions analyzed by both PET and CT modalities. Image sets were concordant in 468 regions and discordant in 78, yielding 86% concordance overall. Analysis by weighted Îº statistic showed "intermediate to good" fit overall and for nodal sites, but "poor" agreement for extranodal sites. If discordant, a site was most likely PET+/CT-. Integration of PET information caused a change in staging in 15 (50%) patients, 7 upstaged and 8 downstaged. The IFRT volumes were adjusted on the basis of initial PET-CT finding in 21 (70%) patients, with 32 sites added and 15 excluded. There were four relapses, only one outside IFRT fields, but all were successfully salvaged.PET-CT represents an important tool in the management of pediatric patients with HL and has a substantial influence on both initial staging and radiation treatment target definition and field design.
