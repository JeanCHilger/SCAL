Early detection of response to experimental chemotherapeutic Top216 with [18F]FLT and [18F]FDG PET in human ovary cancer xenografts in mice. 3'-Deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) is a tracer used to assess cell proliferation in vivo. The aim of the study was to use (18)F-FLT positron emission tomography (PET) to study treatment responses to a new anti-cancer compound. To do so, we studied early anti-proliferative effects of the experimental chemotherapy Top216 non-invasively by PET.In vivo uptake of (18)F-FLT in human ovary cancer xenografts in mice (A2780) was studied at various time points after Top216 treatment (50 mg/kg i.v. at 0 and 48 hours) was initiated. Baseline (18)F-FLT scans were made before either Top216 (n = 7-10) or vehicle (n = 5-7) was injected and repeated after 2 and 6 hours and 1 and 5 days of treatment. A parallel study was made with 2'-deoxy-2'-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) (n = 8). Tracer uptake was quantified using small animal PET/CT. Imaging results were validated by tumor volume changes and gene-expression of Ki67 and TK1. Top216 (50 mg/kg 0 and 48 hours) inhibited the growth of the A2780 tumor compared to the control group (P<0.001). (18)F-FLT uptake decreased significantly at 2 hours (-52% P<0.001), 6 hours (-49%One injection with Top216 initiated a fast and significant decrease in cell-proliferation assessable by (18)F-FLT after 2 hours. The early reductions in tumor cell proliferation preceded changes in tumor size. Our data indicate that (18)F-FLT PET is promising for the early non-invasive assessment of chemotherapy effects in both drug development and for tailoring therapy in patients.
