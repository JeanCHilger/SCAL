Evaluation of the olfactory nerve transport function by SPECT-MRI fusion image with nasal thallium-201 administration. The aim of this study was to visualize the human olfactory transport pathway to the brain by performing imaging after nasal thallium-201 ((201)Tl) administration.Healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study after giving informed consent (five males, 35-51 years old). The subjects were nasally administered (201)TlCl into either the olfactory cleft. Twenty-four hours later, uptake of (201)Tl was detected by a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/X-ray computed tomography hybrid system. For each subject, an MRI image was obtained and merged with the SPECT image.The peak of the (201)Tl uptake entered into the olfactory bulb in the anterior skull base through the cribriform lamina 24 h after nasal administration of (201)Tl. No participant had olfactory disturbance after treatment.Nasal (201)Tl administration was safely used to assess the direct pathway to the brain via the nose in healthy volunteers with normal olfactory threshold.
