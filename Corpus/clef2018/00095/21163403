PET-CT in thoracic disease. PET-CT imaging merges metabolic data obtained after injection of a tracer labelled with a positron emitter, with CT anatomical data. This whole-body technique provides (i) an improved spatial resolution and (ii) when the tracer is ¹⁸FDG, quantification of tissue glucose metabolism. In thoracic oncology, ¹⁸FDG PET-CT imaging allows diagnosis, staging, follow-up of treatment efficiency, and detection of recurrence. Furthermore, its potential usefulness in inflammatory and infectious diseases should be emphasized. Its main contra-indication is pregnancy, and a good knowledge of its technical procedure is mandatory. The most currently used quantification index is the standardized uptake value (SUV), whose interpretation requires caution.
