. Estrogens and progesterones are endogenous hormones that produce many physiological effects (1). Estrogens act primarily by regulating gene expression. Estrogen receptors (ERs) are found in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells in the female reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, bone, liver, and other tissues, as well as in various tissues in men. Estrogens are lipophilic in that they enter the cell passively by diffusion through the cellular membrane. They bind to ERs in the cytoplasm and are transported to the nucleus. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Approximately 33% of women who have this disease will die of disseminated breast cancer. The growth of breast epithelial cells is dependent on estrogen stimulation to induce progesterone receptor (PR) expression. Two-thirds of breast carcinomas express ERs. It has also been established that the ER status of the tumor is an important prognostic indicator in breast cancer (2). Women with ER-positive breast tumors have a better prognosis than women with ER-negative tumors in terms of responsiveness to anti-estrogen treatment. ER content in breast cancer was assessed
