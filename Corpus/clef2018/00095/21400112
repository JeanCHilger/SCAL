First experience with clinical-grade ([18F]FPP(RGD₂): an automated multi-step radiosynthesis for clinical PET studies. A reliable and routine process to introduce a new ¹⁸F-labeled dimeric RGD-peptide tracer ([¹⁸F]FPP(RGD₂) for noninvasive imaging of α(v)β₃ expression in tumors needed to be developed so the tracer could be evaluated for the first time in man. Clinical-grade [¹⁸F]FPP(RGD)₂ was screened in mouse prior to our first pilot study in human.[¹⁸F]FPP(RGD)₂ was synthesized by coupling 4-nitrophenyl-2-[¹⁸F]fluoropropionate ([¹⁸F]NPE) with the dimeric RGD-peptide (PEG₃-c(RGDyK)₂). Imaging studies with [¹⁸F]FPP(RGD)₂ in normal mice and a healthy human volunteer were carried out using small animal and clinical PET scanners, respectively.Through optimization of each radiosynthetic step, [¹⁸F]FPP(RGD)₂ was obtained with RCYs of 16.9 ± 2.7% (n = 8, EOB) and specific radioactivity of 114 ± 72 GBq/μmol (3.08 ± 1.95 Ci/μmol n = 8, EOB) after 170 min of radiosynthesis. In our mouse studies, high radioactivity uptake was only observed in the kidneys and bladder with the clinical-grade tracer. Favorable [¹⁸F]FPP(RGD)₂ biodistribution in human studies, with low background signal in the head, neck, and thorax, showed the potential applications of this RGD-peptide tracer for detecting and monitoring tumor growth and metastasis.A reliable, routine, and automated radiosynthesis of clinical-grade [¹⁸F]FPP(RGD)₂ was established. PET imaging in a healthy human volunteer illustrates that [¹⁸F]FPP(RGD)₂ possesses desirable pharmacokinetic properties for clinical noninvasive imaging of α(v)β₃ expression. Further imaging studies using [¹⁸F]FPP(RGD)₂ in patient volunteers are now under active investigation.
