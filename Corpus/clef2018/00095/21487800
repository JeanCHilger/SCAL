Identification and quantification of fat compartments with CT and MRI and their importance. In addition to being overweight, as defined by the BMI, the distribution, composition and biological activity of adipose tissue are key elements in the cardiovascular risk stratification of patients. Several non-invasive techniques have been developed to quantify local fat depots, whereby computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the most important. In general adipose tissue is subdivided into subcutaneous and visceral compartments and although both are associated with cardiovascular risk factors and disease, visceral fat has on average a stronger association and a clearly higher biological activity independent of traditional risk factors. This maybe explained by the higher endocrine activity and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by visceral fat. Especially pericardial adipose tissue, a local visceral fat depot surrounding the coronary arteries, is associated with the presence, extent and severity of coronary artery disease. However, several other local fat depots have been identified and associations with various diseases have been established. This article gives an overview over the current methods for the identification and quantification of local fat depots and summarizes the hypothesized and known associations. Furthermore, it gives an overview of the potential significance of individual local fat depots for cardiovascular risk stratification.
