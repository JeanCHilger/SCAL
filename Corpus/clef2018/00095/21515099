Characteristics of autoimmune pancreatitis based on serum IgG4 level. Autoimmune pancreatitis is categorized as an IgG4-related autoimmune disease, mostly associated with serological alterations, however characteristics of autoimmune pancreatitis based on serum markers have not been fully evaluated.We evaluated demographics, symptoms, imaging and therapeutic outcome in 27 cases of autoimmune pancreatitis stratified by serum IgG4 level.Twenty patients (74%) had elevated serum IgG4 and 7 (26%) had normal IgG4 levels. Compared to patients with normal serum IgG4 levels, patients with elevated IgG4 had higher incidence of jaundice at onset (14.3% vs. 80%, respectively P=0.002), more frequent diffuse pancreatic enlargement at imaging (14.3% vs. 60%, respectivelyClinical features of autoimmune pancreatitis are different based on level of serum IgG4. Further studies are needed to clarify if normal serum IgG4 cases are a precursor of active type 1 or type 2 autoimmune pancreatitis.
