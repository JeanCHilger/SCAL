Vertebral hemangioma: "Cold" vertebrae on bone scintigraphy and fluordeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Bone hemangiomas are benign and infrequent lesions. At Tc-99m bone scintigraphy they show variable degrees of radiotracer uptake and even absence of it. At fluordeoxy-glucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET/CT), hemangioma is one of the causes of "cold" vertebrae, apart from postexternal radiotherapy. We present a woman diagnosed of breast carcinoma, with a photopenic defect at a thoracic vertebrae at Tc-99m bone scan. In order to rule out bone lytic metastasis, a FDG PET/CT was performed showing a "cold" vertebrae too. Findings were highly suggestive of vertebral hemangioma, that was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging.
