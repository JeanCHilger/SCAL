A low-grade chondrosarcoma presenting as an unusual cervical mass in the hyoid bone: a case report. A chondrosarcoma originating from the hyoid bone is very rare. Here, we describe a case of low-grade chondrosarcoma of hyoid origin and discuss its preoperative imaging features, including those on positron emission tomography-computed tomography, and its recurrence rate.A 42-year-old Japanese man noticed a mass in the right submandibular region of his neck. A hard 3.0 Ã— 2.8 cm tumor was noted on the right side of his hyoid bone. The mass was immobile and moved with deglutition.Even though radiographic studies, including positron emission tomography-computed tomography, were inconclusive, the cartilaginous tumor was surgically removed en bloc, and the tumor was diagnosed based on the results of pathological investigations. Close follow-up is recommended in such cases due to the potential for recurrences, because local recurrence occurred in 50% of the reported cases of grade one chondrosarcomas.
