Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic phase I dose-escalation trial of PF-00562271, an inhibitor of focal adhesion kinase, in advanced solid tumors. PF-00562271 is a novel inhibitor of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The objectives of this study were to identify the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and assess safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and antitumor activity of PF-00562271.Part 1 was a dose escalation without and with food. Part 2 enrolled specific tumor types in an expansion at the RP2D and also assessed the effect of PF-00562271 on single-dose midazolam PK in a subgroup of patients.Ninety-nine patients (median age, 60 years 98% with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1) were treated in 12 fasting and three fed cohorts. The 125-mg twice-per-day fed dose was deemed the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and RP2D. Grade 3 dose-limiting toxicities included headache, nausea/vomiting, dehydration, and edema. Nausea was the most frequently observed toxicity (60% of patients, all grades 1 or 2 at RP2D). PF-00562271 exposure increased with increasing doseThe MTD and RP2D of PF-00562271 is 125 mg twice per day with food. PF-00562271 displayed time- and dose-dependent nonlinear PK and is likely a potent CYP 3A inhibitor. This first-in-class study supports further investigation of FAK as a promising therapeutic target.
