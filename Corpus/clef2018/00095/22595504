Predictive role of post-treatment [18F]FDG PET/CT in patients with uterine cervical cancer. To evaluate the efficacy of post-treatment positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) for identification of tumor recurrence, and to determine whether [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake measured as the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) has predictive role regarding survival in patients with uterine cervical cancer.Medical records from 276 women with uterine cervical cancer who had post-treatment [(18)F]FDG PET/CT performed were retrospectively reviewed. Results of PET/CT scans were compared with histological or clinical examination.Ninety-five (34.4%) of the 276 patients had documented recurrence by either surgical biopsy or clinical and imaging follow-up. Median duration from treatment to PET/CT scan was 24 months (range, 6-307). The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of post-treatment PET/CT were 94.7%, 87.8%, 80.4%, 97%, and 90.2%, respectively. The PET/CT scan modified both the diagnostic or treatment plan in 67 patients (24.3%). Patients were divided into two groups according to cut-off SUV(max) established on the basis of ROC analysis (<5.25 vs. â‰¥5.25), and there was a significant difference in OS between groups (p=0.001). In addition, the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and OS rates of patients with a negative PET/CT scan for recurrence were significantly better than those with a positive PET/CT (98.62% vs. 17.83%, p<0.0001 for PFS, 99.31% vs. 85.38%, p=0.0015 for OS).Post-treatment PET/CT scan is a sensitive and accurate surveillance modality, and provides prognostic information in uterine cervical cancer. Furthermore, it may allow individualization of patient care.
