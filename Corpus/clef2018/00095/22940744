Multimodal functional and structural imaging investigations in psychosis research. Substantial pathophysiological questions about the relationship of brain pathologies in psychosis can only be answered by multimodal neuroimaging approaches combining different imaging modalities such as structural MRI (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic-resonance spectroscopy. In particular, the multimodal imaging approach has the potential to shed light on the neuronal mechanisms underlying the major brain structural and functional pathophysiological features of schizophrenia and high-risk states such as prefronto-temporal gray matter reduction, altered higher-order cognitive processing, or disturbed dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission. In recent years, valuable new findings have been revealed in these fields by multimodal imaging studies mostly reflecting a direct and aligned correlation of brain pathologies in psychosis. However, the amount of multimodal studies is still limited, and further efforts have to be made to consolidate previous findings and to extend the scope to other pathophysiological parameters contributing to the pathogenesis of psychosis. Here, investigating the genetic foundations of brain pathology relationships is a major challenge for future multimodal imaging applications in psychosis research.
