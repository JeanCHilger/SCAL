Clinical studies of cancer radioimmunodetection with carcinoembryonic antigen monoclonal antibody fragments labeled with 123I or 99mTc. Seventy-three patients with diverse cancers containing carcinoembryonic antigen received 123I-labeled anti-carcinoembryonic antigen monoclonal antibody F(ab')2 fragment [38 patients], 99mTc-labeled anti-carcinoembryonic antigen monoclonal antibody Fab' fragment [23 patients], or both reagents at different times [6 patients] for evaluation of antibody targeting and imaging [radioimmunodetection (RAID)], using planar and single-photon emission computed tomography. The results indicated that antibody fragments are preferred for early tumor imaging (within 24 h). Rapid targeting and clearance from blood and normal organs of the antibody fragments (blood median t1/2 elimination of 26.5 and 13.2 h for the F(ab')2 and Fab' fragments respectively) permitted the use of short-lived radionuclides, such as 123I (13.3 h) and 99mTc (6 h), and confirmed that selective antibody accretion in tumors occurred very soon after administration, such as between 2 and 5 h. Scan interpretations at 24 h for the 123I-labeled F(ab')2 and at 2-5 h for the 99mTc-labeled Fab' revealed overall sensitivities, on a tumor site basis, of 95.9 and 94.9%, respectively. On a site basis, the overall accuracies were 94.2 and 93.8% for the 123I and 99mTc immunoconjugates, respectively. In the 6 patients studied with both radioimmunoconjugates, a high concordance in detection was found. Both imaging agents also revealed a high number of putatively new tumor sites not disclosed by other radiological methods at the time of the RAID studies, of which 40.0 and 20.5% were subsequently confirmed as tumor for the 123I and 99mTc agents, respectively, within an 11-month follow-up period. This represented 24 proven occult tumor sites in 19 patients given the 123I-immunoconjugate and 16 proven occult tumor sites in 9 patients receiving the 99mTc agent. The new lesions were found up to 17 and 7 months earlier for 123I-RAID and 99mTc-RAID, respectively, than with other detection methods. The smallest tumors identified were below 0.5 cm, especially with the 99mTc immunoconjugate and single-photon emission computed tomography imaging. The findings of this study confirm previous evidence that RAID is a safe and a potentially useful new method of cancer detection. Despite the excellent results with the 123I-F(ab')2 antibody fragment, its poor availability and high cost limit its clinical use. Therefore, the 99mTc agent, which is made by an instant, 1-step, 1-vial, direct labeling method, appears to be the method of choice for rapid and accurate detection of cancer by RAID.
