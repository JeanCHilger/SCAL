Preliminary validation of the opposing view method for quantitative gamma camera imaging. We perform gamma camera imaging to generate data for estimation of internal radiation dose in our radioimmunotherapy candidates. Because of the inability of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to account for patient attenuation variability without serious error, quantitative planar imaging was performed to estimate the radioactive content of normal organs. We undertook the following studies to further validate this method. A realistic fillable human phantom was used to determine the accuracy of I-131 filled organ estimation. A transmission scan of the unfilled phantom was produced with an I-131 filled flat flood source. Anterior and posterior planar images of the filled organs were acquired with region of interest determination of the activity in the organ. Correction by the attenuation factor and a camera calibration factor yielded the MBq in the organ. The procedure was also performed in a simple phantom. Three dogs were imaged and sacrificed to validate the technique in vivo. A high degree of accuracy in estimation of organ radioactive content was found to be present using the phantom and dog models. Use of this method requires further validation but provides a solid basis for estimation of internal radiation dosimetry in radioimmunotherapy planning.
