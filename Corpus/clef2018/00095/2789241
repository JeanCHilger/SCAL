A simple superimposition method for anatomical adjustments of CT and SPECT images. A technique for superimposition of CT and single photon emission CT (SPECT) images is described. Regions of interest can be placed on SPECT images and projected to CT images. In this way, anatomical registration of regions of increased or decreased activity is possible. The equipment is easy to handle and available at low cost.
