Single-photon emission computed tomography studies with 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime in dementia: effects of acute administration of L-acetylcarnitine. The acute effects of intravenously administered L-acetylcarnitine (LAC) were evaluated with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime in 30 demented patients (21 with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia and 9 with mixed-type dementia). Two SPECT scans were performed: in basal conditions, and 30 min after the administration of 500, 1,000, 1,500, or 2,000 mg LAC intravenously. Tracer activity ratios were determined in 10 pairs of cerebellar, cortical and subcortical regions. After administration of the lowest dose of LAC, no changes from the basal values were observed in any of the regions examined. The higher doses of the drug significantly elevated the tracer activity in cortical regions, particularly in the parietal lobe, which showed an impaired regional cerebral blood flow in the basal study. These effects of LAC and their relation with the cholinomimetic properties of the drug are discussed.
