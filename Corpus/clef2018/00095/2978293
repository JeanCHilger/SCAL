Comparative double-tracer whole-body autoradiography: uptake of 11C-, 18F- and 3H-labeled compounds in rat tumors. The uptake of various labeled compounds by tumors was studied by double-tracer whole-body autoradiography (DTWBA) in rats. Each animal carried two types of tumors: mammary carcinomas and the Walker 256 carcinosarcomas. The markers used were [18F]- and [3H]fluorodeoxyglucose (glucose utilization), [3H]thymidine (cell proliferation), [11C]methionine (amino acid metabolism) and [11C]- and [3H]toremifene (estrogen-receptor-avid agents). In each experiment, the distribution of a substance labeled with short-lived radionuclide (11C or 18F) was compared with that of another substance labeled with a long-lived nuclide (3H). Quantification was done by combining computerized image analysis of the autoradiograms with liquid scintillation counting of punched tissue pieces obtained from the cryosections. The relationships between the uptakes of the various radiopharmaceuticals were recorded in tumors and normal tissues. The dynamics of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose and [11C]methionine were determined in tumors and some selected tissues by positron emission tomography (PET). The uptake rate between fluorodeoxyglucose and thymidine in the mammary tumor was five times higher than the ratio in the Walker tumor. The corresponding figure for FDG/methionine was four times. Thymidine, compared with methionine, was twice as efficient. Thus, the mammary tumors were best imaged with FDG or thymidine. The non-steroid antiestrogen toremifene was taken up in very low amounts by these tumors. By DTWBA, experimental tumors may serve as their own control.
