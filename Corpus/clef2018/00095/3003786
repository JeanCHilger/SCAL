Preparatory clinical studies of Pi-mesons at TRIUMF. Eighty patients have been treated with Pi-mesons (pions) at TRIUMF between 1979-1984. The patients had tumors rarely curable by standard methods and had no prior radiotherapy. The distribution by site included skin, metastatic nodules (13), brain, glioblastoma multiforme (32), pelvis, rectosigmoid (15), prostate (12), bladder (7), and ovary (1). The studies involve serial escalations of pion dose until maximum tissue tolerance is reached, monitoring the response at each dose increment. Sites were chosen for study where lack of local control is a significant cause of treatment failure with conventional radiation therapy. The low dose rate and the available beam access at TRIUMF limit the number of patients treated and the volume treatable. A 3-D treatment planning program is in use, and a 3-D display of the dose distribution delivered in brain tumor treatments has been developed using the PET scanner. In practice, new methods introduced for measurement of tissue response include tumor growth delay curves, fine-needle biopsy mapping, and PET scanning of brain tumors. The use of endoscopic assessment of the rectosigmoid region is emphasized. Treatment results of glioblastoma multiforme show that the median survival for patients treated to 125 pion cGy/fx is in the range of 187-198 days for patients receiving 170 cGy per dose/fraction (fx) the range is 290-315 days, and for those receiving 200-220 cGy/fx the median survival is in excess of 290 days. For pelvic malignancies the local control obtained with doses of 2500 cGy or less was 50% in 12 assessable patients
