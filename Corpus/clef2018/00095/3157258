Riding and the handicapped. When we speak of riding for handicapped, it is evident that this term embodies a wide range of possibilities as far as the type of therapy used and the benefits gained. The needs of the student dictate which therapy is selected and implemented. The effects of therapeutic riding have not been subjected to scientific scrutiny. However, the benefits do have a physiologic basis that needs to be analyzed further. More empirical studies are required, using sound research methodology. Both the physical parameters (range of motion, balance, flexion, and so on) and the psychosocial parameters (risk, self-esteem, behavior, and so on) should be explored and documented. Until then, Robert Mayberry leaves us with this thought: "Is it the unique movement of the horse, the psychodynamics involved or a primal atavistic need for experiencing controlled risks? Perhaps it is all or none of these: suffice to say, the mystique of the horse is strong medicine."
