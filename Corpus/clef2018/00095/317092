Transverse-sectional imaging with Na18F in myocardial infarction. The potential utility of Na18F for acute infarct imaging was assessed in a canine model with a positron camera. Transverse-section imaging of radiofluoride in five dogs with acute myocardial infarction, using a multicrystal positron camera, clearly demonstrated the zones of damage as areas of increased activity. The F-18 uptake in the infarct zones was found to peak at 48 to 72 hr after coronary ligation, as does Tc-99m pyrophosphate. Preliminary in vitro studies indicate that the relative F-18 uptake, 48 after ligation, is an inverse linear function of regional blood flow.
