Carbon-11-labeled amino acids for the rectilinear and positron tomographic imaging of the human pancreas. Modification of the BÃ¼cherer-Strecker amino acid synthesis facilitated the production of DL-[11C]tryptophan and DL-[11C]valine for clinical trials in patients with proven or suspected pancreatic disease. Examples of rectilinear scans and tomographic images of the pancreas are presented in this initial paper. Positron computed tomography was done with the ORTEC ECAT system. Rapid localization of these C-11-labeled amino acids and fast clearance from the plasma permit almost immediate examination following i.v. injection. Illustrative images include the normal pancreas, pancreatitis, and pancreatic carcinoma. The use of positron tomobraphy with C-11-labeled DL-tryptophan and DL-valine appears to offer a new and promising diagnostic modality for the detection and study of pancreatic diseases.
