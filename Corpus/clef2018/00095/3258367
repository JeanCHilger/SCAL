Three-dimensional display of positron emission tomography of the heart. A method for producing images of 82Rb myocardial perfusion and 11C carbon monoxide gated blood pool images is described. In the case of 82Rb images, cylindrical projection displaying myocardial activity as viewed from the side is presented to complement the polar projection. Cubic display of the conventional short- and long-axis slices is described that permits interactive selection of any desired slices. A three-dimensional cine display of the left ventricle rotating about its long axis is produced that gives a very realistic presentation of myocardial activity. Very similar processing techniques are applied to gated carbon-11 blood-pool studies to yield beating images of the surface of the blood pool in multiple projections.
