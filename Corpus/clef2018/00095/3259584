Single photon emission computed tomography of the thyroid. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) entails imaging at multiple positions along an arc and computed-assisted reconstruction of transaxial, coronal, and sagittal images. To determine if SPECT imaging of the thyroid augments information provided by planar imaging, both SPECT and pinhole planar scans were performed in 52 patients with thyroid disease. After 123I (n = 45), Tc99m (n = 5), or thallium-201 (n = 2) administration, images were acquired at 30 intervals along a 180 degree arc. Nodules that were hypofunctioning on planar scans (n = 4) were equally well shown on SPECT images. SPECT analysis of 123I uptake by 5 palpable nodules with completely normal 123I planar scans demonstrated the nodular tracer uptake was increased (n = 1), equivalent (n = 3), or decreased (n = 1) in comparison with that of extranodular tissue. In 6 of 12 multinodular goiters, transaxial SPECT images showed tracheal compression, which was confirmed by neck x-ray, flow volume loops, or surgery. A neck phantom study was performed to assess the accuracy of SPECT-determined functional thyroid volume. SPECT-estimated volumes (30-173 mL n = 11) correlated well with true volumes (r = 0.996
