Nonoxidative glucose consumption during focal physiologic neural activity. Brain glucose uptake, oxygen metabolism, and blood flow in humans were measured with positron emission tomography, and a resting-state molar ratio of oxygen to glucose consumption of 4.1:1 was obtained. Physiological neural activity, however, increased glucose uptake and blood flow much more (51 and 50 percent, respectively) than oxygen consumption (5 percent) and produced a molar ratio for the increases of 0.4:1. Transient increases in neural activity cause a tissue uptake of glucose in excess of that consumed by oxidative metabolism, acutely consume much less energy than previously believed, and regulate local blood flow for purposes other than oxidative metabolism.
