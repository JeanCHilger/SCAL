Regional cerebral glucose metabolism in identical twins. The present study reports on the degree of similarity in regional cerebral glucose metabolism in seven sets of female identical twins. All scans were done with subjects at rest. Glucose metabolism was measured with positron emission tomography (PET). Significant intraclass correlations were found for the orbital and prefrontal cortex as well as the basal ganglia (caudate/putamen). It is suggested that these correlations reflect the functional aspects of these areas, namely attention and posturing movements.
