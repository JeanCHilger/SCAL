Area weighted convolutional interpolation for data reprojection in single photon emission computed tomography. A data reprojection algorithm has been developed for use in single photon emission computed tomography on an array processor equipped computer system. The algorithm makes use of an accurate representation of pixel activity (uniform square pixel model of intensity distribution), and is rapidly performed due to the efficient handling of an array-based algorithm and the fast Fourier transform on parallel processing hardware. The algorithm consists of using a pixel driven nearest-neighbor projection operation to an array of subdivided projection bins. The subdivided project bin array is then convolved with the angle-dependent projection of the area of a uniform square pixel and compressed to original bin size. The new algorithm has thus been named the area weighted convolution (AWC) method of interpolation. When compared to nearest-neighbor and linear interpolation algorithms, the new AWC algorithm was found to be more accurate, having an accuracy approaching that of the line length algorithm. It also yielded an easier and more efficient implementation on parallel hardware than line length or linear interpolation, with faster execution times than either.
