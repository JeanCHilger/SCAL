Two behavioral states studied in a single PET/FDG procedure: theory, method, and preliminary results. We have developed a method that allows two sets of regional cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (rCMRglc) to be obtained in a single extended procedure using positron emission tomography (PET) and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). This is an adaptation of the deoxyglucose method, with the addition of a second injection of FDG immediately after completion of the first scan, then followed 30 min later by a second scan. A model has been developed to allow for correction of measured tracer concentration in the second scan by subtracting the predicted remnant from the first scan. The possible applications of this method in studying behavior-metabolism relationships are demonstrated. The preliminary results show 6%-12% changes in rCMRglc values for appropriate brain regions when the behavioral state is altered, but show 0%-5% change in rCMRglc values when the behavioral state is unchanged. The method can contribute significantly to the understanding of behavior-metabolism relationships by allowing the noninvasive study of two behavioral states in a single PET procedure.
