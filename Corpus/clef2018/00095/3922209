Effect of intracoronary nitroglycerin on myocardial blood flow and distribution in pacing-induced angina pectoris. Quantitative assessment by single-photon emission tomography. Changes in regional coronary flow after administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin were assessed by measuring total coronary blood flow (using coronary sinus flow catheters) and its regional distribution (by quantitative single-photon emission tomography of injected radioactive microspheres). After pacing to angina, 10 patients with coronary artery disease received serial selective left coronary injections of technetium-99m microspheres, 40 micrograms of nitroglycerin, and indium-111 microspheres. Significant changes in coronary flow distribution were determined by subtracting prenitroglycerin from postnitroglycerin tomographic profiles. Perfusion of each myocardial segment was classified as normal mildly, moderately or severely compromised, based on upstream coronary anatomy. The overall increase in coronary flow was 23% in the normal territories and 33%, 44% and 15% (p less than 0.05), in the mildly, moderately and severely compromised territories, respectively, compared with control values. Thus, intracoronary nitroglycerin increased coronary blood flow to all perfusion territories. The increase in distribution of coronary flow was greatest in the mildly and moderately compromised regions and the least in the most severely compromised regions this is probably a reflection of the underlying coronary reserve.
