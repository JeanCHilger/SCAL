11C-Ro15-1788 and 11C-flunitrazepam, two coordinates for the study by positron emission tomography of benzodiazepine binding sites. In vivo binding of a benzodiazepine (flunitrazepam-C11) and a benzodiazepine antagonist (Ro 15-1788-C11) were studied with positron emission tomography. Advantages and disadvantages of each drug for studying specific in vivo binding sites are presented. The results obtained indicate that Ro 15-1788-C11 is a better in vivo radiocoordinat than flunitrazepam-C11.
