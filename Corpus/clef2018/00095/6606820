Single photon emission computed tomography and its application in the lung. SPECT systems should affect nuclear medicine because of their ability to eliminate overlying and underlying radionuclide activity, their capacity for total volume imaging, and the increased contrast for lesions, compared with conventional planar imaging and their quantitative potential. The authors offer a preview of the uses of this developing technology in the delineation of perfusion abnormalities.
