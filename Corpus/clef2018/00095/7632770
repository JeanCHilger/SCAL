Kinetics of a new iodolabeled MAO-B inhibitor in the rat brain and in cultured astrocytes. 3-Bromobenzyloxy phenyloxy hydroxymethyl propanol was labelled with iodine-125. Labeling yield was approximately 92%. Using HPLC and an RP18 column, Iodo*MD (MW = 412) was obtained at no-carrier-added conditions (specific activity 125 Ci/mmole). Biochemical experiments were carried out in vitro and showed a Ki for MAO-B of 5.4 nM and of 5000 for MAO-A (RA/B = 926). Using ex vivo kinetic inhibition in rat (dose: 5 mg/kg p.o.), the results demonstrated a strong similarity of action with BromoMD and IodoMD, with an inhibition percentage that decreased with time (91% at 1 hour, 48% at 8 hours, 2% at 24 hours). The rat brain Iodo*MD concentration was maximal after the first pass and inhibition decreased slowly with time (T1/2 = 1.8 hours). Uptake and wash-out of Iodo*MD was studied on two-day-old rat astrocytes in culture. Half-times of uptake and efflux were respectively 2.5 minutes and 7.5 minutes. The use of metabolic inhibitors (KCN and Digoxin) suggested the absence of any active transport. Binding studies with various concentration of cold MD 360194 showed that at 10(-8) M the uptake decreased significantly. Rats were dissected at different times post i.v. injection (0-2 hours), and the principal organs and brain were obtained (the brain was separated into 7 pieces). Radioactivity was concentrated mainly in the liver (24.6 +/- 4%), fat (12.4 +/- 3.4%) and muscles (18.4 +/- 3%). In the brain the concentration was approximately 1.2 +/- 0.3% within 30 minutes post i.v. injection and 0.84 +/- 0.15% thereafter. The hypothalamus and striatum were two-fold more active than the cortex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
