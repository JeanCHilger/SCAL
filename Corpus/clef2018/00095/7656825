Clinical value of renal radionuclide imaging for diagnosis of urinary tract tumor. Combined use of 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) radionuclide angiography, and 99mTc-gluconate renal venography plus single photo computed tomography (SPECT) were employed for clinical diagnosis of urinary tract tumor. This is what we call serial renal radionuclide imaging (SRI). From Aug, 1989 to May, 1993, 63 patients with urinary tract tumor accepted this examination, including 52 cases with renal space-occupying lesion, 5 cases with retroperitoneal mass outside of kidney, 4 cases with bladder cancer (all 61 cases were confirmed by surgery and pathology) and 2 cases suspected of anastomotic leakage after total cystectomy and Bricker's operation. The results show that 1. The renal space-occupying lesion could be accurately localized by SRI and benign lesions could be differentiated from malignancy. 2. SRI could asertain if a retroperitoneal mass was in or outside of the kidney. 3. Urinary fistula could be demonstrated by SRI, while IVU detection failed.
