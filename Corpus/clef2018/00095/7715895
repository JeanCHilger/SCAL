A prospective study comparing SPET with MRI and CT as prognostic indicators following severe closed head injury. Ten patients were studied prospectively afer severe closed head injury to determine the relationship between long-term clinical outcome and abnormalities detected by single photon emission tomography (99Tcm-HMPAO SPET), CT and MRI obtained within 60 days of injury. The ability of SPET to detect abnormalities not visualized by CT or MRI after cerebral trauma by the results of this study. Changes detected by SPET [global cerebral blood flow (gCBF) and number of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) deficits] soon after trauma were shown to be more closely correlated with long-term outcome than changes detected by MRI or CT. Templates were used to classify lesions by site and a multivariate analysis was undertaken to establish the importance of defect position in predicting clinical outcome. The results suggest that lesions in the temporal lobes, frontal lobes and basal ganglia are related to poor prognosis, and that SPET yields more useful prognostic data than the other methods.
