Value of SPECT-immunoscintigraphy in radiation treatment planning for patients with squamous cell carcinomas in the head and neck area. Introduction of monoclonal antibodies (immunoscintigraphy) has significantly extended the diagnostic spectrum of nuclear medicine in oncology. The detection rate of this new method in patients bearing squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck is better compared to computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. In a prospective study, we examined whether immunoscintigraphy in addition to other imaging procedures is able to provide additional diagnostic information for radiation treatment planning.
