Comparison of rest-redistribution thallium-201 imaging and reinjection after stress-redistribution for the assessment of myocardial viability in patients with left ventricular dysfunction secondary to coronary artery disease. Thallium (Tl)-201 reinjection after stress-redistribution (RI) imaging has been proven to accurately identify ischemic and viable myocardium. Quantitative Tl-201 analysis after stress has also shown viable myocardium in most mild to moderate (51% to 85% of normal uptake) irreversible Tl-201 defects. However, if the main clinical question is whether a region is viable, and not whether there is inducible ischemia, a resting protocol may be more appropriate. The aim of this study was to determine whether rest-redistribution (RD) quantitative Tl-201 single-photon emission tomographic imaging provides the same information on viable myocardium as Tl-201 RI. Thus, 15 patients (mean age 58 +/- 9 years) with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 35 +/- 8%) were studied by both RI and RD Tl-201 single-photon emission tomography. Regional Tl-201 uptake was assessed quantitatively using a 16-segment model. When Tl-201 images were classified as normal/reversible (viable) or irreversible (nonviable), RI showed viable myocardium in 145 of 240 myocardial regions (60%), whereas RD showed it in 103 of 240 myocardial regions (43%). The 2 imaging protocols provided concordant information in 176 of 240 myocardial regions (73%). Among the 64 (27%) discordant regions, 53 (22%) were viable by RI and nonviable by RD, whereas 11 (5%) were viable by RD and nonviable by RI (p < 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
