The dosimetry of iodine-123 labelled 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane. This report documents the radiation dosimetry of iodine-123 labelled 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane [123I]beta-CIT in humans. The mean absorbed doses for various organs and the effective dose equivalent were estimated from whole-body scans, blood samples and single-photon emission tomography scans acquired up to 22 h after the injection of a known amount of tracer. The basal ganglia, the liver and the lower large intestinal wall received the highest mean absorbed doses of 0.270 mGy/MBq, 0.038 mGy/MBq and 0.034 mGy/MBq, respectively. The effective dose equivalent for adults was estimated using 11 organs and the ICRP-87 radiation dose model and was 0.031 mSv/MBq. The radiation dose to the basal ganglia limits the maximum injected activity of [125I]beta-CIT to 185 MBq for a single study.
