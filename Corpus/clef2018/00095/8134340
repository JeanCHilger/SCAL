Neuroanatomical correlates of encoding in episodic memory: levels of processing effect. Cognitive studies of memory processes demonstrate that memory for stimuli is a function of how they are encoded stimuli processed semantically are better remembered than those processed in a perceptual or shallow fashion. This study investigates the neural correlates of this cognitive phenomenon. Twelve subjects performed two different cognitive tasks on a series of visually presented nouns. In one task, subjects detected the presence or absence of the letter a
