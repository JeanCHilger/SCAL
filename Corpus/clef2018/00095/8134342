Hemispheric encoding/retrieval asymmetry in episodic memory: positron emission tomography findings. Data are reviewed from positron emission tomography studies of encoding and retrieval processes in episodic memory. These data suggest a hemispheric encoding/retrieval asymmetry model of prefrontal involvement in encoding and retrieval of episodic memory. According to this model, the left and right prefrontal lobes are part of an extensive neuronal network that subserves episodic remembering, but the two prefrontal hemispheres play different roles. Left prefrontal cortical regions are differentially more involved in retrieval of information from semantic memory and in simultaneously encoding novel aspects of the retrieved information into episodic memory. Right prefrontal cortical regions, on the other hand, are differentially more involved in episodic memory retrieval.
