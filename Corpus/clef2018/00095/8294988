Technetium-99m-HMPAO SPECT, CT and MRI in the evaluation of patients with chronic traumatic brain injury: a correlation with neuropsychological performance. The purposes of this study were: (1) to compare 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime (HMPAO) SPECT with CT and MRI in chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and (2) to correlate both functional and structural neuroimaging measurements of brain damage with neuropsychological (NP) performance.Twenty-nine patients (minor TBI, n = 15 and major TBI, n = 14) and 17 normal controls (NC) underwent HMPAO SPECT, CT, MRI and NP testing. Imaging data were analyzed both visually and quantitatively.Nineteen (66%) patients showed 42 abnormalities on SPECT images, whereas 13 (45%) and 10 (34%) patients showed 29 abnormalities on MRI and 24 abnormalities on CT. SPECT detected relatively more abnormalities than CT or MRI in the minor TBI subgroup. The TBI group showed impairment on 11 tests for memory, attention and executive function. Of these, the anterior-posterior ratio (APR) correlated with six tests, whereas the ventricle-to-brain ratio (VBR), a known structural index of a poor NP outcome, correlated with only two tests.In evaluating chronic TBI patients, HMPAO SPECT, as a complement to CT or MRI, may play a useful role by demonstrating brain dysfunction in morphologically intact brain regions and providing objective evidence for some of the impaired NP performance.
