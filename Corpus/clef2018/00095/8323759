Three-dimensional OctreoScan111 SPECT of abdominal manifestation of neuroendocrine tumours. In the present study we have investigated the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of OctreoScan111 SPECT (single photon emission tomography) images in 20 patients with neuroendocrine tumours. All patients had at least 2 tumour lesions as assessed from computerized tomography (CT) and SPECT. The 3D rendering was performed using a software, which produces images by implementing direct rendering from voxels without an intermediate surface data structure. The software has options for a free choice of thresholding and possibilities of clipping in coronal, transversal and sagittal planes. The results obtained showed that 3D reconstruction with volume rendering (3Dvr) gave a superior topographical localization of tumour uptakes when compared with SPECT. The 3Dvr technique was also combined with transversal clipping in rendered volumes (3Dvr+c). The major advantage with the 3Dvr+c technique was found to be an improved visualization of anatomical references as well as improved diagnostic information in a particular, selected, transversal slice, thus facilitating the identification and comparison of individual tumour lesions.
