Beta-oxidation of 1-[14C]-17-[131I]-iodo-heptadecanoic acid following intracoronary injection in humans results in similar release of both tracers. Radioiodine labelled 17-iodo-heptadecanoic acid (IHA) is used for non-invasive study of myocardial metabolism in coronary heart disease and cardiomyopathy. Yet in the interpretation of in vivo myocardial tracer kinetics, it is controversial whether the intracellular degradation of IHA or the removal of iodide across cellular membranes is the rate-limiting step in iodide release from the myocardium. In five patients undergoing coronary sinus catheterization, a mixture of about 40 kBq of [123I] NaI was injected into the left coronary artery. During the following 15-min period, frequent blood samples were taken from the aorta and the coronary sinus. In the aqueous phase of the venous blood, 14CO2 and inorganic 131I appeared nearly in parallel, with a peak time of 4-5 min. Moreover, as shown by the AV difference, there was no significant back diffusion of IHA and no significant non-specific deiodination detectable over the period of observation. There was myocardial retention of inorganic iodide (123I) injected into the left coronary artery. The data strongly support the premise that lipid turnover through beta-oxidation is the rate-limiting step in the externally measured release of iodide after IHA injection, provided that recirculating inorganic radioactive iodide is corrected for. In addition, 15 volunteers were studied using [11C]palmitic acid and [123I]IHA using PET and dynamic planar camera scintigraphy with iodide correction. There was no significant difference between the mean values of the elimination half-times, and also no significant correlation between half-times of both fatty acids for single individuals.
