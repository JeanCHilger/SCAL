6-[18F]fluorodopa metabolism in patients with hemiparkinsonism studied by positron emission tomography. A group of 10 healthy control subjects and 10 patients with hemiparkinsonism (HD) were studied by positron emission tomography (PET) using 6-[18F]fluorodopa (FDOPA). FDOPA metabolism in the caudate nucleus and the putamen was separately estimated by measuring target-to-background ratios (TBRs) using composite images added between 30 and 60 min after FDOPA injection and by TBR-versus-time slopes during PET study. TBRs in the caudate nucleus and the putamen were 1.81 +/- 0.23 (mean +/- SD) and 1.92 +/- 0.28 in the 10 controls, respectively. In HD patients, on the dominantly affected hemisphere related to main clinical symptoms, TBRs were significantly decreased in the caudate nucleus (P < 0.01) and the putamen (P < 0.05) compared with those in the corresponding areas on the contralateral hemisphere, though those TBRs on both hemispheres were significantly decreased compared with the TBRs of normal subjects (P < 0.01). TBRs and TBR slopes in both the caudate nucleus and the putamen were correlated with disease severity according to Hoehn and Yahr. On the dominantly affected hemisphere, TBR and TBR slopes in the putamen were well correlated with individual clinical measures for bradykinesia and rigidity, and those in the caudate nucleus were also correlated with the severity of tremor. Our data suggest that in HD patients, PET study using FDOPA may provide unique and efficient information on the dysfunction of the dominantly affected caudate nucleus and the putamen which are correlated with diseased severity and individual clinical symptoms.
