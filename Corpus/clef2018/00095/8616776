Metastatic neuroblastoma in children older than one year: prognostic significance of the initial metaiodobenzylguanidine scan and proposal for a scoring system. Metaiodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) is a guanethidine analog that has demonstrated a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting bone metastases in about 90% of metastatic neuroblastomas. However, the predictive value of initial mIBG scan in neuroblastoma patients older than 1 year of age regarding response to initial chemotherapy has yet to be ascertained. Therefore, a scoring system for grading the positivity of mIBG scans was devised and applied in a retrospective study in an attempt to determine whether this score had a prognostic value in neuroblastoma patients older than 1 year of age at diagnosis.Eighty-six children, older than 1 year of age, with metastatic neuroblastomas were homogeneously treated and had a mIBG scan performed at diagnosis and following the induction regimen to assess bone metastases. Each mIBG scan was assigned a reproducible score and the predictive value of the initial mIBG score was assessed in order to evaluate response to induction regimen.The relative risk of failing to achieve complete remission after four courses of induction therapy was 6.9 times higher in patients who had more than four mIBG spots at diagnosis. A multivariate analysis including the established prognostic factors revealed that the initial mIBG score was the only significant factor (P < 0.001).The initial mIBG scan is of prognostic significance to predict response to chemotherapy for metastatic neuroblastoma in children older than 1 year of age. A prospective study comparing this initial mIBG score with other recently established prognostic factors is warranted.
