99m-Tc-HMPAO-SPECT in diagnosis of early cerebral vasculitis. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether mild neurological symptoms suggestive of neuropsychiatric involvement may be associated with cerebral perfusion defects as detected by functional brain imaging with 99m-Tc-HMPAO-SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography). SPECT analysis for the early detection of central nervous system (CNS) involvement was evaluated in 40 consecutive patients with systemic vasculitis or with Sneddon's syndrome. Of these, 18 patients showed overt neuropsychiatric symptoms, so-called major symptoms (e.g. motoric or sensible defects) 6 had mild symptoms like headache or cognitive disorders, so-called minor symptoms: 16 patients did not present with any of these symptoms. SPECT abnormalities were detected in 16 of the 18 patients with overt neuropsychiatric symptoms (89%). Five of the 6 patients with minor symptoms (83%) and 5 of the 16 patients without neurological symptoms (31%) also had SPECT abnormalities. There was no relation to disease activity or duration. We concluded that the high sensitivity of SPECT (87.5%) in detecting perfusion abnormalities among the evaluated group of patients indicates its suitability for early diagnosis of vasculitic CNS involvement.
