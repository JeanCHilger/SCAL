Tc-99m-labeled tropanes as dopamine transporter imaging agents. The development of novel Tc-9m-labeled tropane derivatives as dopamine transporter imaging agents is reported. A series of neutral and lipophilic conjugated complexes, containing N-(alkylthiolato)-tropane, aminobis(ethylthiolato), and a [99mTc]TcO3+ center core, were prepared and evaluated as central nervous system (CNS) dopamine transporter imaging agents in rats. One of the compounds, [99mTC]technetium, [methyl 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-(2-mercaptoethyl-8-azabicyclo [3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylato-S][[2,2'-(methylimino)bis[eth anethiolato]] (2-)-N,S,S']oxo (25), displayed low initial uptake in rat brain (0.1% at 2 min post i.v. injection) the striatal/cerebellar (ST/CB) ratio reached 3.50 at 60 min after an i.v. injection. The specific uptake can be blocked by pretreating rats with a competing dopamine transporter binding agent, beta-CIT (RTI-55, N-methyl-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane
