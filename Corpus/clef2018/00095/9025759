Implementation and evaluation of patient-specific three-dimensional internal dosimetry. Current methods for calculating the absorbed dose in a target region from a source region rely on a standard "reference man" geometry and assume an uniform distribution of radiolabel. While this approach is acceptable at the low levels of radioisotope administered for most diagnostic purposes, the generality of the calculations is not adequate for doses at the higher levels required for therapy and is not easily extendible to tumor dosimetry.We have developed an integrated system which utilizes patient anatomy and radionuclide distribution in the calculation of absorbed dose rate or total dose to any user-defined target region. Images of radionuclide distribution (PET/SPECT) are registered to anatomic images (CT/ MRI) and then entered into a three-dimensional internal dosimetry software system (3D-ID) where regions of interest are defined. Dose calculations are performed by the mathematical convolution between a user-specified, dose-point kernel with the activity in the source volume over the target volume. The resulting dose rate distribution may be scaled by cumulated activity to yield absorbed dose. In addition to calculating the mean dose, dose-volume histograms may be generated which plot absorbed dose with respect to percent of volume. The method was evaluated using selected standard man phantom organs.Dose estimates for two patient studies are included to illustrate differences between patient-specific and MIRD-based calculations. The package provides an alternative approach to image display and three-dimensional internal dose calculations.The dose-volume histogram representation of absorbed dose to a target volume provides valuable information in assessing tumor control probability and normal tissue toxicity.
