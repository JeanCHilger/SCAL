The ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere is overactive during hand movements in akinetic parkinsonian patients. We compared the rCBF changes induced by the execution of a finger-to-thumb opposition motor task in the cerebellar hemispheres of 12 normal subjects, 12 parkinsonian patients whose medication had been withheld for at least 18 h and 16 parkinsonian patients on medication using single photon emission tomography and i.v. 133Xe. The normal subjects and parkinsonian patients on medication exhibited the same pattern of response, with a significant increase in rCBF in the contralateral primary motor cortex and in the supplementary motor areas. No significant rCBF change was detected in the cerebellum of these two groups this finding was expected since our technique cannot detect cerebellar activation when the motor task is executed at a relatively low rate and small amplitude as it was in this study. The parkinsonian patients off medication exhibited a markedly different pattern of activation characterized by a significant overactivation in the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere and a significant underactivation in the supplementary motor areas. These results suggest that parkinsonian patients off medication may try to compensate for their basal ganglia-cortical loop's dysfunction using other motor pathways involving cerebellar relays.
