Cerebral SPECT in adult epileptics with neuronal migration disorders. The neuronal migration disorders are a rare group of congenital malformations of the brain that may present with epilepsy resistant to medical treatment. We studied with brain interictal SPECT 8 epileptic adult patients (3 man and 5 women) who wore affected by different neuronal migration disorders (pachygyria, megaloencephaly, squizencephaly and neuronal heterotopias), diagnosed by cranial MRI. SPECT was pathologic in six patients (75%), showing more sensibility than CT in the diagnosis of heterotopias.
