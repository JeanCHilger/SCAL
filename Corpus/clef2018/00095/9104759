Benzodiazepine receptor distribution and diazepam binding in schizophrenia: an exploratory study. Clinical studies indicate that patients with acute schizophrenia may benefit from benzodiazepine treatment. Therefore we investigated the benzodiazepine receptor distribution and diazepam binding in 20 patients with DSM-III schizophrenia using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with iomazenil as the ligand. In each patient, two SPECT images were obtained: SPECT 1 was obtained 2 h after intravenous injection of 200 MBq I-123-iomazenil. Following SPECT 1, patients received 10 mg diazepam intravenously. Twenty min later, SPECT 2 was started. The highest iomazenil uptake was found in the occipital cortex followed by the frontal and temporal cortices. Baseline iomazenil uptake in the medial frontal cortex was significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with the BPRS total score (r = 0.46). Diazepam injection led to a significant activity decrease in iomazenil binding which was greatest in the frontal regions of interest. With respect to the medial frontal cortex, this effect was significantly (P < 0.05) more pronounced in patients with a remitting than a chronic course of the disorder. These findings suggest that changes of the benzodiazepine receptor system in the frontal cortex may be associated with severity and chronicity of schizophrenia.
