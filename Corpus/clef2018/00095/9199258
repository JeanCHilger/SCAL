Comparison of arbutamine stress 99mTc-labeled sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging and echocardiography for detection of the extent and severity of coronary artery disease and inducible ischemia. Arbutamine is a new synthetic catecholamine developed specifically for pharmacologic stress testing.We investigated 39 patients undergoing coronary arteriography to compare arbutamine stress (99m)Tc-labeled sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging and echocardiography for detection of the extent and severity of coronary artery disease and inducible ischemia. Rest and stress studies were analyzed blindly according to a 12-segment left ventricular model for both techniques. Each segment was graded according to severity of wall thickening abnormality and perfusion defect (1 = normal to 4 = severe). Total perfusion defect and wall thickening scores were calculated at peak stress and the difference in scores between stress and rest (delta perfusion defect delta wall thickening) were used as indexes of inducible ischemia. Twenty-one patients had multivessel disease, nine had single-vessel disease, and nine had normal coronary arteries. Diagnostic accuracies for the detection of coronary artery disease for single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging and echocardiography were 95% and 92%, respectively. Extent and severity of coronary artery disease indicated by a peak stress perfusion defect score of 26 +/- 6.4 and wall thickening score of 25.1 +/- 8.4 were similar, and there was no significant difference in the delta perfusion defect and delta wall thickening scores of 8.7 +/- 5.5 and 10.4 +/- 7.1, respectively. Segmental concordance rates for the detection of coronary artery disease and inducible ischemia were 74% (K = 0.47Arbutamine stress single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging and echocardiography provide largely equivalent and accurate pathophysiologic information for the evaluation of coronary artery disease and inducible ischemia.
