Foods and techniques for managing obesity in companion animals. Management of obesity should initially involve assessment of the pet to rule out other possible medical problems and provide an accurate dietary history. It is essential to obtain a good estimate of the existing caloric intake, including calories from table scraps, pet treats, or other sources. Assessing the owner's willingness to make a commitment to a major lifestyle change for their pet is also an important part of any successful weight-reduction program. In some instances, this motivation can be linked to a recent, expensive bill for orthopedic or other procedures performed on their pet. Once a candidate has entered a program, calculated restriction of energy while maintaining protein, vitamin, and mineral intake should be recommended. It may be surprising to find out that the calculated amounts of food may be more than the amount a pet is currently being fed. In these animals, it is imperative to use a high-protein, obesity-management diet and not a low-protein, "light," or senior type of diet containing high fiber. If possible, treats should be restricted altogether and begging actively discouraged. Any snacks should be placed in the pet's feeding bowl so that an association between eating and the bowel become established. Of equal importance is use of a realistic exercise program that owners will encourage their pet to follow. Various products for weight reduction are available. Use of these specially formulated products to restrict caloric intake, while maintaining essential nutrient intake and increasing energy expenditure by playing and other activities, are the hallmarks of successful weight loss programs.
