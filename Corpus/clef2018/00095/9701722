Correlation of qEEG with PET in schizophrenia. PET relative metabolism was correlated with quantitative EEG in 9 schizophrenic patients. The PET metabolic regions of interest were the frontal lobes, thalamus and basal ganglia, and right and left temporal lobes. Significant positive correlations were seen for the frontal lobes and delta EEG power, and alpha power with subcortical metabolism. The physiologic plausibility of those correlations is discussed with reference to the possible effect of neuroleptic medication.
