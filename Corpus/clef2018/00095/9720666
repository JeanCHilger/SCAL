Proliferation is associated with 2-deoxy-D-[1-3H]glucose uptake by T47D breast tumour and SW480 and SW620 colonic tumour cells. The interpretation of therapy-induced changes in the uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose by tumours, detected using PET, is dependent on which tumour characteristics are associated with its uptake. In this study the relationship between proliferation (S-phase fraction) and the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-[1-3H]glucose by T47D breast tumour and SW480 and SW620 colonic tumour cells was measured between 2 and 12 days after seeding. Strong correlations (p < 0.001) were observed between viable cell number and the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-[1-3H]glucose/flask by each of the cell lines. Uptake of this compound was also found to correlate with S phase fraction in the T47D line (p < 0.05) and the SW480 (p < 0.01) and the SW620 (p < 0.001) colonic tumour lines. The findings of the present study suggest that therapy-induced changes in the uptake of this compound may at least partially reflect changes in proliferative fraction.
