Trimetazidine-induced enhancement of myocardial glucose utilization in normal and ischemic myocardial tissue: an evaluation by positron emission tomography. Trimetazidine has an anti-ischemic effect in angina pectoris. This agent has no hemodynamic effects, and its benefit is presumed to be based on a metabolic mechanism of action. A group of 33 dogs undergoing openchest left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) ligation causing prolonged ischemia were imaged with quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) using 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG) to measure regional glucose metabolic utilization (rGMU) and [11C]acetate to measure regional monoexponential washout rate constant (Kmono) for oxidative metabolism in nonrisk and ischemic-risk myocardium. A total of 20 dogs were pretreated with trimetazidine at low dose (n = 10, 1 mg/kg) and high dose (n = 10, 5 mg/kg) and compared with 13 control dogs. Microsphere-measured myocardial blood flow (mL/min/g) was measured preocclusion and repeated hourly after occlusion and expressed as a ratio of preocclusion myocardial blood flow to verify a stable level of ischemia during PET. No differences were seen in postocclusion ischemic risk/nonrisk myocardial blood flow between treatment groups (p = not significant [NS]). Preocclusion and hourly measurements of heart rate and blood pressure corrected for baseline revealed no difference in control dogs versus trimetazidine (low-dose and high-dose) groups (p = NS). 18FDG-derived rGMU (micromol/min/g) was increased in high-dose trimetazidine versus control dogs in nonrisk and ischemic risk groups, respectively (1.16+/-0.57 vs 0.51+/-0.38 and 0.43+/-0.29 vs 0.20+/-0.14 p <0.05). rGMU was increased proportionately in nonrisk and ischemic risk in all groups without significant differences when corrected for nonrisk rGMU (ischemic risk/nonrisk was 0.92+/-1.3 vs 0.64+/-0.66 vs 0.40+/-0.22 for control dogs, all trimetazidine and high-dose trimetazidine groups). Kmono (min(-1) was not altered in any group (nonrisk = 0.13+/-0.03 vs 0.13+/-0.03 vs 0.14+/-0.02 and ischemic risk = 0.18+/-0.05 vs 0.17+/-0.06 vs 0.16+/-0.06 for control dogs, all trimetazidine and high-dose trimetazidine groups, respectively
