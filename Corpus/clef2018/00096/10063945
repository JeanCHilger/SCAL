Lupus carditis: evaluation with technetium-99m MIBI myocardial SPECT and heart rate variability. The objective of this paper was to investigate the incidence of myocardial perfusion defects in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) associated with dysautonomic alterations. Twenty patients without any sign or symptoms of heart disease, selected from a larger population of patients with SLE, underwent technetium-99m sestamibi (Tc-99m MIBI) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), at rest and after dipyridamole infusion they also underwent heart rate variability (HRV) examination by a 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiography, analyzing in the time domain the standard deviation of the R-R intervals average (SDNN) and the percentage of R-R adjacent intervals differing from each other more than 50 msec (pNN50)
