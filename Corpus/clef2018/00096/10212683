Factors contributing to the decision for euthanasia of dogs with congestive heart failure. To determine the prevalence of clinical signs that affect quality of life in dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF), and to characterize the role of these clinical signs in the decision for euthanasia.Prospective study.38 dogs with CHF that had been euthanatized within the preceding 22 months.Clinical information and factors affecting the decision for euthanasia were reviewed and recorded from medical records of dogs with CHF. Each owner was then interviewed via telephone to determine whether their dog had anorexia or other clinical signs of disease prior to euthanasia, their perception of their dogs' quality of life, and the most important factor and contributing factors that influenced the decision to euthanatize their dog.Of the 38 dogs with CHF, > 70% had weakness (35 dogs), coughing (33), anorexia (32), weight loss (32), dyspnea (30), or exercise intolerance (28) reported by their owners. Factors often named by owners as most important in the decision for euthanasia were poor prognosis given by the attending veterinarian, recurrent clinical signs of CHF (ie, coughing, dyspnea, or ascites), and poor quality of life. Weakness, anorexia, and recurrent clinical signs of CHF were the most common contributing factors in the decision for euthanasia.Anorexia, weight loss, and exercise intolerance are common in dogs euthanatized because of CHF. The importance of quality of life and poor prognosis in making a decision for euthanasia suggests that addressing these factors may improve patient management.
