Sensitivity and specificity of quantitative difference SPECT analysis in seizure localization. True ictal SPECT can accurately demonstrate perfusion increases in the epileptogenic area but often requires dedicated personnel waiting at the bedside to accomplish the injection. We investigated the value of perfusion changes as measured by ictal or immediate postictal SPECT in localizing the epileptogenic region in refractory partial epilepsy.Quantitative perfusion difference images were calculated by registering, normalizing and subtracting ictal (or immediate postictal) from interictal SPECT for 53 patients with refractory epilepsy. Perfusion difference SPECT results were compared with visually interpreted SPECT, scalp electroencephalography (EEG), MRI, PET and intracranial EEG.In 43 patients (81%), discrete areas of increased perfusion (with ictal injections) or decreased perfusion (with postictal injections) were noted. Interictal scalp EEG was localizing in 28 patients (53%), ictal scalp EEG was localizing in 35 patients (66%) and intracranial EEG was localizing in 22 patients (85%) (of 26 patients who underwent invasive study). MRI was localizing in 34 patients (64%), PET was localizing in 32 of 45 patients (71%), interictal SPECT was localizing in 26 patients (49%) and peri-ictal SPECT (visual interpretation) was localizing in 30 patients (57%). By comparison with an intracranial EEG standard of localization, SPECT subtraction analysis had 86% sensitivity and 75% specificity.Our data provide evidence that SPECT perfusion difference analysis has higher sensitivity and specificity than any other noninvasive localizing criterion and can localize epileptogenic regions with accuracy comparable with that of intracranial EEG. To obtain these results, one must apply knowledge of the timing of the ictal injection relative to seizure occurrence.
