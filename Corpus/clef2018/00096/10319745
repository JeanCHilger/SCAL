Regional cerebral perfusion and amytal distribution during the Wada test. The distribution of sodium amytal and its effect on regional cerebral perfusion during the intracarotid amytal (Wada) test were investigated using high-resolution hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) SPECT coregistered with the patient's MRI dataset.Twenty patients underwent SPECT after intravenous HMPAO injection, and 5 patients had both intravenous and intracarotid injections in a double injection-acquisition protocol.All patients had hypoperfusion in the territories of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Basal ganglia perfusion was preserved in 20 of 25 patients. Hypoperfusion of the entire mesial temporal cortex was seen in 9 of 25 patients. Partial hypoperfusion of the whole mesial cortex or hypoperfusion of part of the mesial cortex was seen in 14 of 25 patients. In 2 of 25 patients, mesial temporal perfusion was unaffected. In 5 patients, the double acquisition showed a distribution of HMPAO delivery matching that of hypoperfusion, except for the following: (a) HMPAO was delivered to the basal ganglia and insula, where there was no hypoperfusion (b) HMPAO was not delivered to the contralateral cerebellum, which did show hypoperfusionSome degree of hypoperfusion of medial temporal structures occurs in the great majority of patients during the Wada test. Partial inactivation of memory structures is therefore a credible mechanism of action of the test. The double acquisition protocol provided no evidence that mesial temporal structures are inactivated remotely by diaschisis. Perfusion in the basal ganglia and insular cortex is not affected by amytal.
