201Tl and 99mTc-MIBI gated SPECT in patients with large perfusion defects and left ventricular dysfunction: comparison with equilibrium radionuclide angiography. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a major prognostic factor in coronary artery disease and may be computed by 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) gated SPECT. However, 201Tl remains widely used for assessing myocardial perfusion and viability. Therefore, we evaluated the feasibility and accuracy of both 99mTc-MIBI and 201Tl gated SPECT in assessing LVEF in patients with myocardial infarction, large perfusion defects and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.Fifty consecutive patients (43 men, 7 women mean age 61 +/- 17 y) with a history of myocardial infarction (anterior, 26Gated SPECT image quality was considered suitable for LVEF measurement in all patients. Mean perfusion defects were 36% +/- 18% (group 1), 33% +/- 17% (group 2), 34% +/- 17% (group 1 + group 2). LVEF was underestimated using gated SPECT compared with ERNA (34% +/- 12% and 39% +/- 12%, respectively P = 0.0001). Correlations were high (group 1, r= 0.88LVEF measurement is feasible using myocardial gated SPECT with the QGS method in patients with large perfusion defects and LV dysfunction. However, both 201Tl and 99mTc-MIBI gated SPECT similarly and significantly underestimated LVEF in patients with LV dysfunction and large perfusion defects.
