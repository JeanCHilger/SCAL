Assessment of glioma viability by estimating 201Tl SPET tumour uptake volume. The aim of this study was to develop a quantitative method to assess viable tumour based on post-operative 201Tl single photon emission tomography (SPET). We studied 15 patients with histologically defined highly malignant gliomas in the post-operative phase before initiation of adjuvant treatment. A 201Tl index was calculated in two ways: maximal counts versus mean counts within a region of interest (ROI). The tumour uptake volume (TUV) within the lesion was calculated from the number of voxels that had 201Tl uptake above a threshold calculated from the uptake on the contralateral side. The threshold was set at three levels: A = 1.4 times the mean 201Tl uptake in a three-dimensional reference ROI + 96.7% confidence interval (the TUV was corrected by subtraction of the volume in the reference ROI that had uptake above the threshold with compensation for unequal ROI sizes) B = 1.4 times the mean reference ROI + 99% confidence interval
