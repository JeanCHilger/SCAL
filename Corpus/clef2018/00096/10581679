Synthesis of new hypoxia markers EF1 and [18F]-EF1. We report on the preparation of a hypoxia marker 2-(2-nitroimidazol-1[H]-yl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)acetamide (EF1) and its 18F analog, 2-(2-nitroimidazol-1[H]-yl)-N- (3-[18F]fluoropropyl)acetamide ([18F]-EF1). Two methods for the preparation of 3-fluoropropylamine, the EF1 side chain, are described. [18F]-EF1 was prepared with a radiochemical yield of 2% by nucleophilic substitution of bromine in 2-(2-nitroimidazol-1[H]-yl)-N-(3-bromopropyl)acetamide (EBr1) by carrier-added 18F in DMSO at 120 degrees C. Our results demonstrate the preparation of clinically relevant amounts of [18F]-EF1 for use as a non-invasive hypoxia marker with detection using positron emission tomography (PET).
