Transfer of the feline erythropoietin gene to cats using a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector. Chronic renal failure and the associated erythropoietin-responsive anemia afflicts over 2 million domestic cats in the United States, resulting in morbidity that can affect the owner-pet relationship. Although treatment of cats with recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo) protein can be effective, response to the drug often dissipates over time, probably due to the development of antibodies reactive with the human protein. As an alternate approach to the treatment of this disease, we have developed a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector containing the feline erythropoietin gene (rAAV/feEpo). This vector, when administered intramuscularly to normal healthy cats, caused a dose-related increase in hematocrit over a 7-week period after injection. Thus, the rAAV/feEpo vector holds promise as a simple, safe and effective therapy for the anemia of chronic renal failure in domestic cats.
