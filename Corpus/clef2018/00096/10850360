Low-dose, fractionated radioimmunotherapy for B-cell malignancies using 131I-Lym-1 antibody. This trial was conducted to assess the toxicity and efficacy of 131I-Lym-1 in patients with either malignant B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) using low-dose, fractionated radioimmunotherapy (RIT).Thirty adult patients who had advanced B-cell malignancies (25 NHL and 5 CLL) had progressed despite standard therapy 12 patients entered the trial with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of equal to or greater than 60. Patients were treated with a series of intravenous doses of 131I-Lym-1 with a goal of reaching a cumulative dose in each patient of at least 300 mCi. All patients were Lym-1 reactive. Clinical responses and immediate toxicity were evaluable in all 30 patients and delayed toxicity in 26.Toxicity to Lym-1 antibody occurred with 28% of the 176 doses and was transient. Human antimouse antibodies (HAMA) were generated in 30% after a mean of 4 doses, but interrupted therapy in only 10% of the patients. Thrombocytopenia was dose-limiting there were no deaths due to toxicity. Tumor regression occurred in 25 (83%) of the patients and was great enough, and durable enough, in 17 (57%) to qualify them as respondersAlthough advanced disease often interrupted therapy prematurely, the results from 131I-Lym-1 therapy are clearly promising and warrant additional trials.
