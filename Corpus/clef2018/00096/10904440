Correlation of myocardial fractional flow reserve with thallium-201 SPECT imaging in intermediate-severity coronary artery lesions. The purpose of this study was to compare the measurements of fractional flow reserve of the myocardium (FFRmyo) with results of quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and stress single-photon emission computed tomography thallium-201 (SPECT 201Tl) imaging in patients with intermediate-severity coronary artery disease (ISCAD).We prospectively evaluated 40 lesions of QCA-determined ISCAD in 30 patients (age, 53.3 +/- 10.2 years 67% male) using a 0. 014 inch pressure wire during elective coronary angiography and compared the results with those of SPECT 201Tl performed within a week of angiography.There was a moderate negative correlation between percent diameter stenosis (%DS) and FFRmyo (53.1 +/- 13.4% and 0.75 +/- 0.09, respectively r = -0.40While FFRmyo seems to accurately predict the presence of ischemia on SPECT 201Tl in patients with ISCAD, QCA does not reliably assess the physiologic impact of the same lesions.
