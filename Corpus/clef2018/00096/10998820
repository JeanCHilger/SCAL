Emergency approach to intoxications. Many compounds, when absorbed or ingested, can cause harm to animals and people. Veterinarians are commonly faced with companion animals that have been exposed to these harmful compounds. Most poisonings are the result of curious exploration by the pet and a quest to taste everything in their path. Some poisonings are the result of malice, and many simply result from owner ignorance when pets are given medications without regard to dose or compatibility. It is the responsibility of the emergency clinician encountering these cases to prevent further exposure to the poison, enhance its elimination, and provide supportive and antidotal care. Antidotes when available are of little value if the animal has lost any vital functions. It is the purpose of this article to focus on the emergency management of intoxications by reviewing the general principles of triage and emergency care, and to discuss available procedures to stop the exposure, prevent further absorption, and hasten elimination of poisons from the patients body.
