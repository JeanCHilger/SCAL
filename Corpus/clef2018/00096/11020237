SPECT tracer [(123)I]IBZM has similar affinity to dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. Emission tomography investigations of the pathophysiological involvement of the cerebral dopaminergic transmitter system in the living human brain relies heavily on a careful selection of the most suitable radioligand. In recent years, many clinical studies have employed [(123)I]IBZM in SPECT studies. The aim of the present study was to characterize the binding of IBZM to dopaminergic receptor subtypes as a means of elucidating which receptor subtypes are visualized and examined by [(123)I]IBZM. The affinity of IBZM for each of the major human dopamine receptors (D1, D2(short), D3, D4(4. 2), and D5 receptor) was determined by competitive radioligand binding assay using membranes prepared from clonal cell lines expressing the different subtypes. Radioligands with high affinity for the D1(A) and D5 receptors ([(3)H]SCH-23390), dopamine D2(short) and D4(4.2) receptors ([(3)H]Spiroperidol), and dopamine D3 receptor ([(3)H]7-OH-DPAT) were used to measure specific binding. Corresponding unlabeled displacing ligands for determination of nonspecific binding were employed. Assays were performed at 25 degrees C. These experiments show that for IBZM K(i) values were 1.6 nM for dopamine D2(s) receptors and 2.2 nM for dopamine D3 receptors. There was no binding of IBZM to D1(A), D5, or D4(4.2) receptors. In conclusion, when [(123)I]IBZM is used as SPECT tracer, the studies reflect dopaminergic D2 as well as D3 receptor binding.
