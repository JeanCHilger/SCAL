9:30-9:45. First Pass FDG Measured Blood Flow in Tumors: A Comparison with O-15 Labeled Water Measured Blood Flow. The purpose of this study was to determine if the first-pass of FDG can be used to measure regional blood flow in tumors in the absence of perfusion imaging with a known blood flow tracer.PET scans were obtained in patients being evaluated for tumor perfusion and metabolism in a Phase I dose escalating protocol for Endostatin, a novel antiangiogenic agent. A two minutes perfusion scan was done with a bolus injection of 60 mCi of O-15 labeled water followed by a 10 mCi dose of FDG and four sequential scans consisting of a first pass two minutes scan and three 15 minutes scans. Regions of interest were drawn on two tumor sites for each scan. Blood flow was computed using a one-compartment model previously published by the authors. Linear regression analysis was carried out between the first pass FDG measured blood flow and O-15 measured blood flow (Figure 1).Blood flow estimated from the first pass of FDG was linearly correlated with O-15 measured blood flow with an intercept of 0.01, slope of 0.86, and r squared regression coefficient of 0.74 (R = 0.86) for blood flow values of up to 0.6 ml/min/gm of tissue. These results suggests that in the absence of a perfusion tracer, the first pass of FDG provides an estimate of perfusion in a tumor within the limitations of incomplete extraction of FDG compared to O-15 water.
