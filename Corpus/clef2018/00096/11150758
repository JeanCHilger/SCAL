1. Positron Emission Tomography of Thoracic Malignancies. Reduction of Myocardial Fluorodeoxyglucose Uptake Artifacts With a Carbohydrate Restricted Diet. Purpose: To reduce the artifact caused by cardiac uptake of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) we investigated the change in myocardial FDG uptake after placing a group of patients on a carbohydrate-restricted diet.Methods: Case control study involving 130 whole body FDG PET scans. 73 scans were of patients on carbohydrate-restriction
