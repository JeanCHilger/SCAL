Continuous transcranial magnetic stimulation during positron emission tomography: a suitable tool for imaging regional excitability of the human cortex. In six healthy volunteers, H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) was employed to evaluate rate-dependent functional activation of the left primary sensorimotor hand area (SM1(HAND)) during subthreshold repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Using an eight-shaped coil, continuous trains of rTMS were delivered during nine 50-s H(2)(15)O PET scans. Nine different stimulation frequencies were used, ranging from 1 to 5 Hz. Stimulus intensity was set at 10% below active motor threshold. During three additional PET scans, an ineffective rTMS was applied via another eight-shaped coil, which was held 10 cm above the vertex. Statistical parametric mapping was employed to assess relative differences in normalized regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) across conditions. Compared with ineffective rTMS, subthreshold rTMS increased normalized rCBF in the stimulated SM1(HAND). Moreover, the increase in rCBF in the left SM1(HAND) showed a linear positive relationship with the rate of rTMS, indicating a rate-dependent functional activation of the stimulated SM1(HAND). These data demonstrate that, by varying the variables of rTMS across scans, continuous rTMS during H(2)(15)O PET provides a noninvasive tool to study the regional excitability profile of a distinct cortical area.
