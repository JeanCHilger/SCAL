Myocardial perfusion correlates with improvement of systolic function of the left ventricle after CABG. Dobutamine echocardiography and Tc-99m-MIBI SPECT study. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of surgical revascularization [coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)] on systolic function and perfusion of the left ventricle using dobutamine echocardiography (DE) and Tc-99m-MIBI SPECT (SPECT).There were 32 patients mean age 52.2+/-7.2 years in whom DE and SPECT were performed before and 3-4 months after CABG using standard protocols. Wall motion score index (WMSI) and perfusion index (PI) were calculated.Significant improvement of WMSI at rest (1.44+/-0.46 vs 1.33+/-0.41 P=0.03) as well as after maximal dose of dobutamine (1.49+/-0.42 vs 1.39+/-0.44Surgical revascularization significantly improves both perfusion and contractility. Increased perfusion after CABG correlates with improvement of systolic function of the left ventricle.
