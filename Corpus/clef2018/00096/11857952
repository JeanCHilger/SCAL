Visionary choice of Japanese radiologists and radiological technologists in 21st century. Since X-ray CT appeared in radiology practice in the 1970s, there has been rapid progress in imaging modalities such as US, MRI, PET, and PACS. With these new modalities, radiology has strengthened its advantage in medical practice. In earlier times, it was said "ohne Roentgen, keine Medizin". This is still true today, and undoubtedly will be true even in the future. Medical practice can no longer be carried out in the absence of the new imaging technologies. On the other hand, sophisticated computer technology has engendered a new fight for turf among the medical specialties. To win this battle, I consider improved mutual understanding, close cooperation, and esprit de corps between radiologists and radiological technologists to be of utmost importance. This article describes the following: (1) what a medical team should be, (2) how a good medical team should be organized, (3) how important a four-year course in medical technology is, (4) how our survival can be ensured in the new turf battle with advanced medical technology, (5) how JMCP should be run in the future, (6) how important it is for Japanese radiology to show a strong presence in the Asian-Oceanian Society of Radiology, (7) how we can survive in a digital world, and (8) how we should relate to the recent social environment surrounding us.
