Optimum compensation method and filter cutoff frequency in myocardial SPECT: a human observer study. Attenuation, photon scatter, and distance-dependent collimator-detector response are major degrading factors in myocardial SPECT images. The current study investigated whether compensation for these factors improves perfusion defect detectability, and compared the results for human observers with a previous study using a mathematical observer.Four methods were investigated: attenuation compensation (AC) attenuation and detector response compensationReconstruction methods that incorporated scatter and detector response compensation had higher indices of detectability than AC alone. Over the range studied, a filter cutoff frequency of 0.14 pixel(-1) was optimal. A comparison of human observer results with an earlier channelized Hotelling observer study performed with the same images showed excellent agreement in trend and ranking of defect detectability.Compensation for detector response and scatter improves defect detectability compared with AC alone, although detectability may depend on phantom population choice and noise level. An optimal filter cutoff was found that is lower than what is typically used in a clinical setting. The channelized Hotelling observer is a good predictor of human observer performance and may reduce the need for tedious, time-consuming studies with human observers.
