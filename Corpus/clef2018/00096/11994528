Lung ventilation/perfusion SPECT in the artificially embolized pig. Planar lung scintigraphy is a standard method used for the diagnosis of lung embolism, but it is hampered by the high incidence of nondiagnostic tests. Ventilation/perfusion SPECT may possibly improve this situation. The objective of this study was to compare planar lung scintigraphy with ventilation/perfusion SPECT using pigs with artificially engendered lung emboli labeled with (201)Tl.Sixteen anesthetized pigs were each injected with zero to 4 latex emboli. Cylindric emboli were used in the first 7 pigs and flat 3-tailed emboli were used in the remaining 9 pigs. The pigs spontaneously inhaled 30 MBq (99m)Tc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid aerosol for ventilation scintigraphy. Planar scintigraphy and SPECT were performed using a double-head gamma camera in (99m)Tc and (201)Tl windows. Immediately thereafter, 100 MBq (99m)Tc-labeled macroaggregated albumin were injected intravenously followed by SPECT and, finally, planar scintigraphy. The ventilation background was subtracted from the perfusion tomograms for calculation of a normalized ventilation/perfusion (V/P) quotient image set.The cylindric emboli caused artifacts in the ventilation images therefore, these were excluded from the final analysis. However, for the planar perfusion images of these pigs, sensitivity and specificity were 71% and 91%, respectively, whereas SPECT yielded 100% for both. For the 3-tailed emboli and ventilation/perfusion images, the sensitivity and specificity were 64% and 79%, respectively, for the planar modality, whereas SPECT yielded values of 91% and 87%, respectively.V/P SPECT may improve the diagnostic power of lung scintigraphy.
