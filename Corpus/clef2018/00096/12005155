Effect of flow and vascular heterogeneity on glucose metabolism in isolated dog hearts. In non-ischaemic myocardium glucose uptake is assumed to be proportional to blood flow. We investigated the effect of regional vascular heterogeneity on glucose metabolism at various flow rates in the isolated blood-perfused dog hearts. Aortic bolus injections contained an intravascular reference tracer (albumin) and two of three glucoses: L-glucose (an extracellular tracer), D-glucose and 2-deoxy-D-glucose. Flow ranged from 0.5 to 2 4 ml min(-1) g(-1). Vascular heterogeneity was calculated from the albumin outflow dilution curve. A three-region convection-diffusion from the abumin outflow dilution curve. A three-region, convection-diffusion model was fitted to outflow dilution curves to estimate glucose metabolic rate (consumption). The results of 2-deoxy-D-glucose experiments showed that the lumped constant was dependent on flow, glucose metabolic rate was proportional to flow and dependent on the heterogeneity of the myocardial vasculature. The results support the views that without accounting the regional flow heterogeneity, glucose metabolic rate will be underestimated.
