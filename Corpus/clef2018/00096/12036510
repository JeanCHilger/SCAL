Brain perfusion in Alzheimer's disease with and without apathy: a SPECT study with statistical parametric mapping analysis. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized by cognitive symptoms that, in combination with behavioral disturbances, significantly interfere with activities of daily living. These behavioral disorders contribute to the clinical heterogeneity of the disease and probably express different pathophysiological processes. Apathy is one of the most frequent behavioral disorders in AD. The aim of this study was to evaluate brain perfusion of AD patients with and without apathy (as determined by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory) compared with that in healthy elderly subjects. A total of 15 AD patients without apathy (AD/NA mean age 76.6) and 15 AD patients with apathy (AD/A
