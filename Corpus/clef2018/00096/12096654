New imaging techniques in the assessment of patients with aortic stenosis. Currently, conventional Doppler echocardiography is the noninvasive diagnostic technique to be used in the evaluation of the vast majority of patients with aortic stenosis. However, several more recent imaging techniques are being progressively introduced in the cardiologist's diagnostic armamentarium. Some of these techniques may offer additional information that could be of help in some patients with aortic stenosis.Electron beam computed tomography may evaluate and monitor the degree of aortic valve calcification. Three-dimensional echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging may be of help in the measurement of the aortic valve area in cases with suboptimal acoustic window. The degree of left ventricular involvement may be accurately assessed and monitored by magnetic resonance imaging, electron beam computed tomography, tissue Doppler and automated segmental motion analysis. Finally, abnormalities in left ventricular metabolism may be evaluated by positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.Some of these techniques could be applicable in the future in the evaluation of patients with aortic stenosis.
