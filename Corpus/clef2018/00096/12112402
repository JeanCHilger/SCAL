Pharmacological evaluation of a Br-76 analog of epibatidine: a potent ligand for studying brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. [(76)Br]-Norchlorobromoepibatidine ([(76)Br]BrPH) is a specific and high affinity radioligand for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In vitro, on rat thalamus membranes [(76)Br]BrPH bound to two sites with apparent affinities of 8 pM and 3 nM. The density of binding sites were 1.9 and 70 fmol/mg protein, respectively. In vivo, in biodistribution and autoradiographic studies in rats the regional distribution of [(76)Br]BrPH paralleled the neuroanatomical localization of nAChRs. Two hours postinjection, the highest concentration in the brain was found in thalamus and colliculi (4% ID/g). Competition experiments with specific nicotinic, muscarinic, dopaminergic, and serotoninergic drugs confirmed that the in vivo binding of [(76)Br]BrPH was consistent with neuronal nicotinic receptors. PET imaging of [(76)Br]BrPH in baboon demonstrated a rapid and high uptake in the brain. Peak uptake occurred at 30-40 min for the thalamus. Due to the constant washout in the cerebellum, the thalamus to cerebellum ratio was 5 at 2 h postinjection. Subcutaneous injection of cytisine (1 mg/kg), 3 h postinjection of [(76)Br]BrPH reduced the radioactivity concentration in thalamus and cortex by 58 and 50%, respectively, as observed 1 h later. Cytisine pretreatment (5 mg/kg s.c.) inhibited completely the radioligand accumulation in the thalamus. Chronic MPTP pretreatment resulted in reduction of [(76)Br]BrPH uptake in all brain regions except in cerebellum. These preliminary results suggest that [(76)Br]BrPH has the potential to be a useful radioligand for studying the pharmacology of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in preclinical experiments.
