Scintigraphic assessment of patients with electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T changes without apparent cause. Some patients who show electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T changes (ECG-LVH) are difficult to evaluate using routine examinations. To clarify the pathologic process in these patients, the authors performed several scintigraphic examinations.Twenty-nine patients with ECG-LVH, without apparent cause, such as left ventricular (LV) systolic overloading or increased LV mass, were examined by myocardial I-123 MIBG imaging, I-123 BMIPP imaging, and exercise-induced stress perfusion imaging. In addition to the visual assessment of each image, we calculated global and regional myocardial washout of I-123 MIBG (%washout). The LV was assessed using conventional echocardiography.Visually observed abnormalities were located exclusively at the LV apex with all imaging methods and were detected in 76%, 52%, and 17% of patients by I-123 MIBG, I-123 BMIPP, and perfusion imaging, respectively. A follow-up study revealed that the apical defects of I-123 MIBG were subsequently followed by defects of I-123 BMIPP and then perfusion abnormalities. In patients with an apical defect revealed by I-123 MIBG imaging, apical %washout was high. In nine patients who underwent myocardial biopsy, myocardial disarray was observed at the apical regions.In many patients with ECG-LVH without apparent cause, sympathetic abnormalities are observed at the apex, similar to pathologic changes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. These abnormalities may lead to changes in fatty acid metabolism and perfusion.
