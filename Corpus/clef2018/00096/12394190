18-FDG PET scan in the staging of recurrent melanoma: additional value and therapeutic impact. Staging of melanoma patients by means of whole body functional imaging in a single evaluation session using positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18- labelled deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) as a metabolic tracer has created much interest over the last decade. After enthusiastic pilot studies, more attention has been paid to the false-negative and false-positive results of this technique than to its true therapeutic impact. This study aimed to evaluate (1) the sensitivity and specificity of this technique at a single lesion level compared with conventional screening procedures (CSP) - both of these accompanied by careful clinical examination and (2) the additional value of the PET scan at the level of the individual patient and its therapeutic impact for different types of melanoma recurrence. A consecutive series of 100 PET scans performed on 84 melanoma patients with regional or distant recurrence according to CSP (89 PET scans) or suspicion of recurrence, i.e. inconclusive CSP (11 PET scans), were retrospectively analysed and compared with the CSP results. At the single lesion level, PET scan and CSP showed a sensitivity of 85 and 81%, a specificity of 90 and 87% and an accuracy of 88 and 84%, respectively. PET provided false-negative results for small skin metastases and brain involvement
