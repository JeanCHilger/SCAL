Cerebral regional hypometabolism caused by propofol-induced sedation in children with severe myoclonic epilepsy: a study using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and statistical parametric mapping. Cerebral positron emission tomography (PET) in children often requires sedation. This study evaluated sedation-associated effects on cerebral glucose metabolism in 30 children with severe myoclonic epilepsy as investigated by cerebral (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET. Prior to the PET acquisition, 24 children underwent propofol sedation. Pixel-based t-statistics were calculated using statistical parametric mapping (SPM99) for comparisons of the patients' PET scans with both a healthy adult control group and an age-matched child intra-group control. In both analyses, statistically significant hypometabolic areas were found in the medial parieto-occipital cortex bilaterally, including the lingual gyrus, cuneus, posterior cingulate and middle occipital gyrus in all sedated children. All these localizations correlated in a covariate analysis with the injected dose of propofol (P<0.01, corrected). The bilateral parieto-occipital hypometabolism is likely to be a sedation-specific effect and should be taken into account when evaluating cerebral FDG-PET scans in sedated children.
