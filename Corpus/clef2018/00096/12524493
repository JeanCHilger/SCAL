Does the presence of a pet at home influence the prevalence of asthma and rhinitis?. Recent epidemiological studies have shown an increase in the prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases. Among aetiological factors, the domestic environment and, in particular, pet ownership may be a part of it. The relationship between severity of asthma and pets is still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of asthma and rhinitis prevalence in teenagers with pet ownership.ISAAC I studied 3,303 teenagers (13-14 years old) in Bordeaux in 1994. They completed a written questionnaire about asthma, rhinitis, eczema and their domestic environment. Four groups (asthmatics, asthmatics with rhinitis, teenagers with only rhinitis and a control group without asthma and rhinitis) were studied.4.6% had only asthma. 43.2% had only rhinitis. 10.3% had asthma and rhinitis, 41.7% had no allergic disease. 34.9% kept a cat and 79.4% allowed the cat to go inside. No difference was found between the four groups with regard cat, dog, bird or other pet ownership irrespective if the pet was kept in-doors or out doors. The prevalence of previous asthma was 45.8% and 50.3% for current asthma. No difference was found between the severity of asthma and pet ownership.This is an epidemiological study based on a written questionnaire. Furthermore there is no data on the presence of pets during the first year of life. However, our results suggest that pet ownership amongst asthma and rhinitis sufferers is not different to that in the group without allergic disease.
