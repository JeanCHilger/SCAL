Autonomous thyroid nodules visualized by positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose: a case report and review of the literature. A 41-year-old white female underwent a positron emission tomography with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) scan as part of staging follow-up for breast cancer. Focal FDG uptake was noted in the right neck. Further evaluation revealed only thyroid nodules and subclinical hyperthyroidism. A sodium pertechnetate thyroid scan showed two "hot" nodules in the right thyroid lobe corresponding to the focal uptake visualized on FDG-PET scan. Technetium-99m uptake was suppressed in the remaining thyroid gland. The patient underwent a subtotal thyroidectomy. Histopathologic evaluation revealed two hyperplastic nodules in each thyroid lobe. We review the literature with regard to FDG-PET imaging of normal and diseased thyroid tissue.
