A 3-D model-based registration approach for the PET, MR and MCG cardiac data fusion. In this paper, a new approach is presented for the assessment of a 3-D anatomical and functional model of the heart including structural information from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional information from positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetocardiography (MCG). The method uses model-based co-registration of MR and PET images and marker-based registration for MRI and MCG. Model-based segmentation of MR anatomical images results in an individualized 3-D biventricular model of the heart including functional parameters from PET and MCG in an easily interpretable 3-D form.
