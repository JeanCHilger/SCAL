Gastric uptake of gallium-67 in AIDS. We describe gastric localization of 67Ga in 13 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among 148 referred primarily to rule out Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Endoscopic biopsies in five of the patients indicated cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in one, gastritis in two, and normal tissue in two. Other associated, but nongastric, infections in these 13 patients included esophageal candidiasis, PCP, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI) complex, coccidioidomycosis, toxoplasmosis and Isospora belli. Only six of the patients exhibited gastric symptoms, and even fewer proved to have gastric pathology. Although gastric 67Ga uptake in a patient with AIDS may not require specific treatment, opportunistic infections as a possible cause of gastritis should be considered.
