Neural abnormalities during cognitive generation of affect in treatment-resistant depression. Dysfunctions in brain regions known to be involved in affect and mood states are thought to be implicated in depression and may have a role in determining the type and symptoms of this illness.Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to elucidate neural correlates of cognitive generation of affect, using a previously published paradigm of evoking affect with picture-caption pairs, in patients with unipolar, treatment-resistant depression.Compared with control participants, patients showed relatively decreased response in the anterior cingulate (rostral right) with both negative and positive picture-caption pairs and in the medial frontal gyrus and hippocampus (all left) with positive picture-caption pairs. They demonstrated increased response in the inferior (right) and middle temporal gyri (left) with negative picture-caption pairs, and in the parahippocampal gyrus (right), inferior frontal gyrus (left), subgenual cingulate (right), striatum (right), and brain stem (left) with positive picture-caption pairs.Reduced medial/middle prefrontal and hippocampal activity may account for positive affect disturbances and temporal lobe hyperactivity for negative affect disturbances in treatment-resistant depression. The results also corroborate previous observations from resting positron emission tomography studies and further elucidate the association between hypoactive rostral cingulate and nonresponsiveness to treatment in depression.
