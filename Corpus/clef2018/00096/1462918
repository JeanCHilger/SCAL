The treadmill exercise score revisited: coronary arteriographic and thallium perfusion correlates. The treadmill exercise score has been used to stratify patients into low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups. This score is derived from ST segment depression, angina, and exercise duration. To determine the coronary arteriographic and exercise thallium perfusion correlates of the score, we examined the extent of coronary artery disease and exercise single photon emission computed thallium-201 results in 834 patients for whom cardiac catheterization data were available. Of those, 174 had no coronary artery disease, 195 had one-vessel, 246 had two-vessel, and 219 had three-vessel disease. Based on the treadmill exercise score, 369 were in the low-risk, 384 in the moderate-risk, and 81 in the high-risk group. The extent of coronary artery disease was 2.1 +/- 1 diseased vessels in the high-risk, 1.7 +/- 1 in the moderate, and 1.4 +/- 1.1 in the low-risk group (p < 0.01). The extent of the thallium abnormality (maximum number of abnormal segments 120/patient) was 10 +/- 6 in the high-risk, 7 +/- 6 in the moderate, and 6 +/- 5 in the low-risk group (p < 0.05). Based on the extent of coronary artery disease and results of thallium imaging, patients were reclassified into three groups: group 1 had three-vessel disease and/or > or = 10 abnormal segments (n = 387), group 3 had no coronary artery disease or one-vessel disease and less than five abnormal segments (n = 212), and the remaining patients were in group 2 (n = 235).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
