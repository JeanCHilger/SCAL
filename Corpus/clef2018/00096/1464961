Autoradiographic demonstration of 18F-FDG distribution within mouse FM3A tumor tissue in vivo. To demonstrate the distribution of 2-deoxy-2-18F-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) within the tumor in vivo, C3H/He mice transplanted with FM3A tumors were studied one hour after intravenous injection of FDG using whole-body, macro- and micro-autoradiography. The whole-body autoradiograph showed that the tumor mass as well as the brain, heart, bone marrows, and the diaphragm and crus diaphragm were clearly visualized. The macro-autoradiograph showed the heterogeneous distribution of FDG in the tumor mass. Markedly dense areas surrounding the tumor and the necrotic area were observed. Micro-autoradiograph showed the high grain densities in the macrophages between the necrosis and viable tumor cells, and in the young granulation tissues demarcating between the tumor and surrounding intact host tissues. Our results showed that the FDG uptake in the tumors may reflect not only the uptake by the tumor cells but also that by the inflammatory reaction elements.
