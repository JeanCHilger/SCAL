Dobutamine Tc-99m furifosmin SPECT in detection of coronary artery disease: evaluation of same day, rest-stress protocol. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of same day rest-stress myocardial perfusion SPECT (MP SPECT) protocol by using technetium-99m (Tc-99m) furifosmin in conjunction with dobutamine stress test in subjects in whom coronary artery disease (CAD) had been proven or excluded at coronary angiography (CA). The study group consisted of 25 patients (8 female and 17 male with a mean age of 53.04 +/- 8.56 yrs) unable to perform treadmill exercise or unsuitable for pharmacologic vasodilator stress testing. Ten mCi (370 MBq) of Tc-99m furifosmin was injected intravenously at rest. Sixty min after injection, planar and SPECT images were acquired. One hour later all patients underwent dobutamine stress test. At the peak stress, 20 mCi (740 MBq) of Tc-99m furifosmin was injected. Sixty min after stress dose injection, planar and SPECT images were acquired. Rest-stress planar and SPECT data were evaluated by using visual and quantitative analysis.
