The role of 18F-FDG in hypopharyngeal cancer. To evaluate the function of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in the diagnose of hypopharyngeal cancer.Twenty patients with hypopharyngeal cancer were entered in the research. Every clinical information was collected carefully, including 18F-FDG, CT scanner and panendoscopy (pharyngo-laryngo-broncho-oesophagien), compared and analysed with each other.The study showed 18 positive 18F-FDG reactions among these 20 patients, including 5 ectopia reactions. Compared with the clinical and pathology exam, we found that 18F-FDG exam had a good correspondance, with such good sensitivity and specificity.18F-FDG reaction is useful in the diagnose of hypopharyngeal cancer, especially for the detection of the secondary secret cancer also useful for the follow-up exam.
