A new versatile and robust mite trap for detection and monitoring of storage mites in the cereal and allied industries. Storage mites are important primary pests but present methods for trapping them are either rudimentary or have several limitations. These prevent effective early detection or reliable monitoring of mites in the food, animal feed and associated industries. The BT Trap is the first trap designed specifically for the detection and monitoring of mite infestation. This trap is made up of a mixed food base lure held in a robust adjustable housing. It is user friendly, requires an exposure period of only 4 days and can be used in a dusty environment. The performance of the BT Trap was evaluated in the laboratory and the mean minimal capture rate of mites was 62%. In a comparative field trial, this trap detected significantly more mites than the bait bag or the fishmeal trap. The trap's performance was also assessed in four different types of premises. These were premises engaged in the production of cereal based dry pet food, specialist animal feed, traditional cheese, and in the finished cereal section of a large transit storage warehouse. A total of 17 genera or species of storage and predatory mites was detected in these four premises, with at least seven species detected in each of these premises. This study confirms that the BT Trap was able to function under the rigours of use in the field. It has demonstrated its potential as a useful tool for early detection and monitoring of mites in production premises. It also provided information that was vital for improving existing mite control measures and in implementing effective management strategies.
