Skin test hypersensitivity for childhood asthma in Istanbul during a period of 16 years. For diagnosis of allergic disorders, besides history and physical examination, many in vivo and in vitro laboratory tests are used. Skin prick test (SPT) is an easily performed and valuable test in children. Our aim was to evaluate the SPT results of asthmatic children according to age and gender, in Istanbul and its neighborhood, followed for a period of 16 years.Consecutive 5080 asthmatic children, aged 1 to 18 years, admitted to Pediatric Allergy Policlinics of Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Medicine Faculty from 1987 to 2003, were screened retrospectively for 10 frequently exposed allergens.3086 cases (61 %) had SPT reactivity for one and/or for multiple allergens the SPT reactivity percentages of the exposed allergens was 50 % (2554 cases) for house dust mites DP, 49 % (2462 cases) for house dust mites DF, 15 % (784 cases) for cat dander, 10 % (525 cases) for dog dander, 4 % (228 cases) for lamb wool, 10 % (504 cases) for wheat, 3 % (162 cases) for egg white, 6 % (345 cases) for hazelnut pollen, 6 % (318 cases) for Candida Albicans, 6 % (326 cases) for Aspergillus Fumigatus.While house dust mites were determined as the predominant allergen for each age groups in this study, allergy against cat dander was the third important allergen in sequence, as cat is a domestic pet which is frequently kept at home in Turkey.
