Brain SPECT and migraine in childhood. The recent development of SPECT has introduced a new procedure to evaluate neurological diseases. By mean of Tc99mHM-PAO we studied a group of 19 pediatric subjects (7 males and 12 females) with different form of migraine, within five days after the last headache attack. Postictally SPECT shows regionally decreased CBF in 3/4 of HM, in 5/6 of BAM, in 5/5 of CM and in 2/4 of M.
