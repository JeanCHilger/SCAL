Malignant complications of coeliac disease. Patients with coeliac disease (CD), particularly those who are undiagnosed or do not adhere to a strict gluten free diet (GFD), are prone to develop complications. Malignant complications are the most serious and should be suspected when expected responses to GFD are not achieved or sustained. Lymphomas, mostly T-cell type, and other malignant tumours, particularly carcinoma of the small bowel, less frequently of stomach and oesophagus, are associated with CD. Loss of response to a gluten free diet (refractory coeliac disease) and ulcerative jejunitis are two recently described complications of CD that may progress to an Enteropathy-Associated T-cell Lymphoma (EATL). Coeliac disease-related lymphoma most often appears at extra-nodal sites, essentially the small bowel, although one have to realise that T-cell lymphomas arising in sites outside the small bowel could be related to coeliac disease. Workup of an EATL must include immunehistology and if necessary T-cell flow cytometry and T-cell rearrangement. Adequate imaging with CT and PET-scanning is mandatory.
