Experimental study of pharmaceutic stress myocardial perfusion imaging with higenamine. To evaluate the applicative value of higenamine used as a new agent for pharmaceutical stress test in detection of coronary artery disease by radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging.Thirteen pigs with chronic coronary artery stenosis by placement of the Ameroid constrictor in the middle section of left anterior descending artery were included in this study. Rest, higenamine and dobutamine stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging was performed with Tc-99m-sestamibi.The sensitivity for detection of coronary artery disease by radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging was 85% in both higenamine and dobutamine stress imaging. Imaging scores (9.9 +/- 8.5 vs. 9.4 +/- 8.6, P = NS) and defect severity (68% +/- 12% vs. 68% +/- 15%, P = NS) showed no significant difference between higenamine and dobutamine stress test. Agreement of imaging scores between higenamine and dobutamine stress imaging was good (kappa = 0.849, P < 0.0001).Our study demonstrates that detection of coronary artery stenosis and ischemic myocardium by myocardial perfusion imaging with higenamine is highly sensitive.
