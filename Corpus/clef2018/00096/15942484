Interpretation of 99mTc sestamibi parathyroid SPECT scan is improved when read by the surgeon and nuclear medicine physician together. Parathyroid gland localization and lateralization are important before surgery, particularly for minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) and recurrent hyperparathyroidism. We hypothesized that readings of Tc sestamibi scans with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) by a surgeon and nuclear medicine physician together (NMP+S) compared to a nuclear medicine physician alone (NMP alone) might affect scan interpretation accuracy.Between May 1999 and December 2002, 127 hyperparathyroid patients had preoperative localization with sestamibi SPECT. Scans were prospectively interpreted by an endocrine surgeon and nuclear medicine physician attending together (NMP+S) and a nuclear medicine physician attending alone (NMP alone). These readings were compared to intra-operative findings, which served as the 'gold standard'.There were 120 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (55 underwent MIP) and seven with secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism seven patients had recurrent hyperparathyroidism. Of 127 patients, 83 had single adenomasParathyroid sestamibi SPECT scan interpretation by an endocrine surgeon reading with a nuclear medicine attending resulted in improved accuracy of gland localization and lateralization compared to a nuclear medicine attending reading alone. This improvement may be due to increased awareness of clinical factors and head-and-neck anatomy.
