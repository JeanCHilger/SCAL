Assessment of left ventricular function and volumes for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy using gated myocardial perfusion SPECT and comparison with echocardiography. Left ventricular function, volumes and regional wall motion provide valuable diagnostic information and are of long-term prognostic importance in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of two-dimensional echocardiography and gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to evaluate these parameters in patients with DCM.Gated SPECT and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed in 45 patients with DCM, and in 10 normal subjects as the control group. Patients were divided into two groups according to the aetiology of DCM: group I, ischaemic DCM (n=30) group II, non-ischaemic DCM (n=15). All patients and the control group underwent resting myocardial gated SPECT, 45 min after injection of 555 MBq of Tc-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile (Tc-MIBI). Gated SPECT data, including left ventricular volumes and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), were processed using an automated algorithm. Simpson's method was used to evaluate these parameters. Regional wall motion was evaluated using both modalities and scored using a 16-segment model with a five-point scoring system. Perfusion defects were expressed as a percentage of the whole myocardium planimetered by a bull's-eye polar map of composite non-gated SPECT. Myocardial perfusion was scored using a 16-segment model with a four-point scoring system.Mean perfusion defects and perfusion defect scores were 25+/-13% and 1.12+/-0.36 in group I and 4+/-8% and 0.76+/-0.26 in group II (P<0.01). The overall agreement between the two imaging modalities for the assessment of regional wall motion was 57% (403/720 segments: 269/480 segments in group I and 134/240 segments in group II). With gated SPECT, LVEF was 27+/-9%, the end-diastolic volume (EDV) was 212+/-71 ml and the end-systolic volume (ESV) was 160+/-67 ml. With echocardiography, these values were 29+/-8%, 197+/-56 ml and 139+/-47 ml, respectively. The correlation between gated SPECT and two-dimensional echocardiography was good (r=0.72, P<0.01) for the assessment of LVEF. The correlation was also good for EDV and ESV, but with wider limits of agreement (r= 0.71, P<0.01 and r=0.71, P<0.01, respectively) and with significantly higher values with gated SPECT (P<0.01). For patients with a perfusion defect of <20% or low myocardial perfusion scores, a higher correlation was found between the two methods for the assessment of LVEF, EDV and ESV. On the other hand, the correlation was lower for the assessment of wall motion.Gated SPECT and two-dimensional echocardiography correlate well for the assessment of left ventricular function and volumes. Gated SPECT has the advantage of providing information about left ventricular function, dimensions and perfusion.
