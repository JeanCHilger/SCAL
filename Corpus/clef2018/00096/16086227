Cost-effectiveness of positron emission tomography in breast cancer. In this study, we used quantitative decision tree modeling to assess the cost-effectiveness of a positron emission tomography (PET)-based management scenario for breast cancer in Canada.Two patient management scenarios were compared (with and without PET). A metaanalysis of studies for the accuracy of PET in staging breast cancer was conducted. Life expectancies were calculated. Management costs were determined from previous cost-effective analyses, management costs from our institutions, and recently published Canadian cost estimates of various procedures.A cost savings of $695 per person is expected for the PET strategy, with an increase in life expectancy (7.4 days), when compared with the non-PET strategy. This cost savings remained in favor of the PET strategy when subjected to a sensitivity analysis.The use of a PET management strategy for the staging of breast cancer is expected to remain economically viable in Canada under various economic conditions.
