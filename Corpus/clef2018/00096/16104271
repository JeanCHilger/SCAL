A conjecture about Jingluo and suggestions on its research. The Jingluo is a great hypothesis and theory of Chinese traditional medicine. The physical existence of Jingluo phenomena has been proved by many medical practices, but its real mechanism is still unknown. Here is a conjecture about Jingluo: "The essence of Jingluo is in CNS, the lines of Jingluo on soma is only actually a mapping of some strong connection networks in cortex or white matter of brain". Many new modalities of medical imaging like fMRI, PET, SPECT and Mapping MEG can do a good job on functional brain imaging. If we improve their spatial resolution and develop new methods to indicate brain activities, maybe we can unveil the secret of Jingluo.
