18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography: useful technique for predicting malignant potential of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The malignant potential of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) is difficult to diagnose before surgery because the diagnoses are based on tumor diameter and mitotic index. The progression of small GISTs is always observed because they do not seem to have malignant potential. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) is a useful technique for assessing tumor activity. The objective of this study was to determine if FDG-PET is useful for predicting the malignant potential of gastric GISTs. Ten patients diagnosed with gastric GISTs participated. FDG-PET was performed on all of them before tumor resection. A whole-body image was initiated 40 minutes after the injection of 275 to 370 MBq FDG. FDG uptake was assessed by a standardized uptake value. All tumors had FDG uptake. There was a significant correlation between the FDG uptake and both the Ki67 index and the mitotic index but not the tumor diameter. The FDG uptake and malignant potential of gastric GISTs had a significant correlation. FDG-PET may be of considerable value for predicting the malignant potential of gastric GISTs before surgery. A gastric GIST with a high FDG uptake should be regarded as having malignant potential.
