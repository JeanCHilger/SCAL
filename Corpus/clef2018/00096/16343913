In-line (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with carcinoma of the sinus/nasal area and orbit. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the standard imaging techniques to evaluate patients with carcinoma in the sinus/nasal area and orbit. The use of positron emission tomography (PET) with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in such patients is as yet less well established.The aim of this study was to assess the clinical impact of PET co-registered with CT (PET/CT).Evaluation of 21 consecutive patients.A retrospective analysis of the whole body PET/CT studies was done. Images were assessed visually without knowing the results of the other imaging technique. Histology and clinical follow-up served to verify lesions. The clinical impact on therapy was assessed together with the physician in charge.All patients underwent PET/CT and CT or MRI for staging (n=9 scans) and restaging (n=17 scans) without treatment between the examinations. PET/CT changed the treatment protocol in 2 patients at staging and in 7 at re-staging. Distant metastases were found in 5 and a secondary tumour in 1 patient.Whole body PET/CT adds clinically important information to CT or MRI, thus, influencing treatment.
