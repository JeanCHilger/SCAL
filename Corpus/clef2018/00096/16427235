Republication of SEMPET trial data? Becherer and colleagues' report in the European Journal of Radiology of their interesting data on the use of FDG PET in the evaluation of residual masses in seminoma patients is extremely similar to the data that the same authors published in 2004 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. It would be very helpful to know whether these are the same patients being presented again or a new multicenter study of the same size asking the same question. Oddly, the authors do not acknowledge their prior report even though it was published the same month that the report to the European Journal of Radiology was submitted for review. It would be helpful if the authors explained what the 2005 report adds to the 2004 report for those of us trying to assess the role of FDG PET in this patient population. At this point in time, it appears that there are two studies that have been completed, including a negative trial from the United States and a positive trial (now published three times) from Europe.
