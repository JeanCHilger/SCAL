Initial infarct size predicts subsequent cardiac remodeling in the rat infarct model: an in vivo serial pinhole gated SPECT study. The rat infarct model is widely used to study left ventricular (LV) remodeling, a main cause of heart failure characterized by progressive LV dilatation. Using pinhole collimators and advances in data processing, gated SPECT was recently adapted to image the rat heart. The aim of this study was to assess this new imaging technique for predicting and quantifying variable LV remodeling from the rat infarct model.Pinhole 99mTc-sestamibi gated SPECT was validated for determining LV volume and identifying the necrotic and nonviable LV segments (<50% of 99mTc-sestamibi uptake) in rats, and it was applied to monitor rat LV function from 48 h to 12 wk after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) (n = 20) or sham operation (n = 9).In LAD-occluded rats, 48-h SPECT necrosis was large (> or =30% LV) in 6, limited (<30% LV) in 6, and undetectable in 8. End-diastolic volume of LAD-occluded rats was equivalent to that of sham-operated rats at 48 h (320 +/- 84 microL vs. 293 +/- 48 microL not significant) but became higher at 12 wk (501 +/- 191 microL vs. 343 +/- 46 microLThe variable LV remodeling documented after coronary occlusion in rats closely relates to the variable extent of necrosis provided by this model. Pinhole gated SPECT allows this remodeling to be predicted and quantified and, hence, constitutes an original tool for the experiments scheduled on the rat infarct model.
