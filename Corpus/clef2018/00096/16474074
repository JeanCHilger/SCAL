Antibodies to Bartonella vinsonii subsp. Berkhoffii in Moroccan dogs. Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii is a fastidious microorganism that has been recognized as an emerging human and canine pathogen. We report for the first time on the prevalence of antibodies to B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii in domestic dogs from Morocco. The overall seroprevalence was 38% (56 of 147 dogs tested). Most of the seropositive dogs were stray dogs from Rabat (36%, 8 of 22) and Khenifra (47%, 47 of 101). Antibodies against B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii were found infrequently among pet dogs from Rabat (4%, 1 of 24).
