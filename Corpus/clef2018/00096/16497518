Lateralized and frequency-dependent effects of prefrontal rTMS on regional cerebral blood flow. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a means to study the function and connectivity of brain areas. The present study addressed the question of hemispheric asymmetry of frontal regions and aimed to further understand the acute effects of high- and low-frequency rTMS on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Sixteen healthy right-handed men were imaged using H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) immediately after stimulation. High (10 Hz)- and low (1 Hz)-frequency suprathreshold short-duration rTMS was applied over either the left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Slow and fast rTMS applied over the left DLPFC significantly increased CBF in the stimulated area. Compared to baseline, slow rTMS induced a significant increase in CBF contralateral to the stimulation site, in the right caudate body and in the anterior cingulum. Furthermore, slow rTMS decreased CBF in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, ipsilateral to stimulation side). Fast rTMS applied over the right DLPFC was associated with increased activity at the stimulation site, in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex and in the left medial thalamus compared to 1-Hz rTMS. These results show that rCBF changes induced by prefrontal rTMS differ upon hemisphere stimulated and vary with stimulation frequency. These differential neurophysiological effects of short-train rTMS with respect to side and frequency suggest hemisphere-dependent functional circuits of frontal cortico-subcortical areas.
