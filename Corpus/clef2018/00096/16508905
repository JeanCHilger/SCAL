Zoonotic importance of selected species of Gram-positive bacteria.. Zoonoses continue to play a signicant role in both human and veterinary medicine. Their eradication is difficult and some authors are convinced of their growing importance. Among the pathogens of infectious diseases transmissible from animals to man are several gram-positive bacteria. The authors focus on three agents that present a risk in three different areas-alimentary infections (Listeria monocytogenes), professional infections (Streptococcus suis) and infections of breeders of so-called pet animals (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus intermedius). The paper analyses the risk of human infections from animal sources and briefly informs on the present incidence of pathogens in animals and/or raw materials of animal origin in the catchment area of the State Veterinary Institute in Olomouc, Moravia.
