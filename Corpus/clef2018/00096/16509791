Effect of percutaneous nephrolithotripsy on renal function: assessment with quantitative SPECT of (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy. To measure the effect of PCNL on global and regional renal function using quantitative single-photon emission CT (SPECT) measurement of Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake by the kidneys (QDMSA).A series of 47 male and 41 female patients with a mean age of 47 +/- 16 years were studied by sequential QDMSA examinations before and 1.5 to 24 months after PCNL. Among the 67 patients (76%) in whom PCNL was performed using upper- or lower-pole access, the function of the affected and nonaffected poles of the treated kidney was calculated separately.There was no statistically significant difference in the uptake by the treated kidneys before versus after PCNL (11.9% +/- 5% v 11.6% +/- 5% t = 0.9Despite the statistically significant decrease in the functional volume of the surgically treated region, neither total percent uptake nor percent of injected dose were reduced significantly. Further studies with long-term follow-up of treated kidneys are required.
