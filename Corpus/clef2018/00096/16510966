Fast reconstruction of 3D time-of-flight PET data by axial rebinning and transverse mashing. Faster scintillators like LaBr(3) and LSO have sparked renewed interest in PET scanners with time-of-flight (TOF) information. The TOF information adds another dimension to the data set compared to conventional three-dimensional (3D) PET with the size of the projection data being multiplied by the number of TOF bins. Here we show by simulations and analytical reconstruction that angular sampling for two-dimensional (2D) TOF PET can be reduced significantly compared to what is required for conventional 2D PET. Fully 3D TOF PET data, however, have a wide range of oblique and transverse angles. To make use of the smaller necessary angular sampling we reduce the 3D data to a set of 2D histoprojections. This is done by rebinning the 3D data to 2D data and by mashing these 2D data into a limited number of angles. Both methods are based on the most likely point given by the TOF measurement. It is shown that the axial resolution loss associated with rebinning reduces with improved timing resolution and becomes less than 1 mm for a TOF resolution below 300 ps. The amount of angular mashing that can be applied without tangential resolution loss increases with improved TOF resolution. Even quite coarse angular mashing (18 angles out of 324 measured angles for 424 ps) does not significantly reduce image quality in terms of the contrast or noise. The advantages of the proposed methods are threefold. Data storage is reduced to a limited number of 2D histoprojections with TOF information. Compared to listmode format we have the advantage of a predetermined storage space and faster reconstruction. The method does not require the normalization of projections prior to rebinning and can be applied directly to measured listmode data.
