Analysis of 18F-FET PET for grading of recurrent gliomas: is evaluation of uptake kinetics superior to standard methods? The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether extended analyses of O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) uptake kinetics provide results superior to those of standard tumor-to-background ratios in predicting tumor grade in patients with pretreated gliomas.Dynamic 18F-FET PET studies (0-40 min after injection of 180 MBq of 18F-FET) were performed on 45 glioma patients with suspected tumor recurrence after multimodal treatment. For the standard method, tumoral maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and the ratio to the background were derived from a summed image 20-40 min after injection. Dynamic data evaluation comprised several approaches: first, SUV within a 90% isocontour threshold (SUV90) and the respective ratio to the background calculated for each time frame between 5 and 40 min after injection second, the time to peak analysisThe parameters taking into account the individual time course of 18F-FET uptake were able to differentiate low-grade from high-grade recurrent astrocytomas with high diagnostic accuracy, reaching the best differentiation with a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.94. For the other parameters, the respective values were considerably lower (time to peak: 85% sensitivity and 88% specificity SUV90-to-background ratio for single-frame evaluation of the early-uptake phase: 100% sensitivity, 62% specificity, and 0.81 AUC). The lowest performance was provided by the standard method (SUVmax: 73% sensitivity, 54% specificity, and 0.60 AUCThis study has shown differences in the dynamics of 18F-FET uptake between recurrent low- and high-grade gliomas. Therefore, parameters addressing the different kinetic behaviors allow discrimination with high diagnostic power between these 2 prognostically different groups. Thus, the techniques introduced here are clearly superior to the yet most widely used standard method.
