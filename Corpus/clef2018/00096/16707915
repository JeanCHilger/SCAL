Positron emission tomography imaging of risperidone augmentation in serotonin reuptake inhibitor-refractory patients. We studied 15 nondepressed patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who were nonresponders to serotonin reuptake inhibitors with an additive trial of risperidone. Positron emission tomography with (18)F-deoxyglucose and magnetic resonance imaging was obtained at baseline and following 8 weeks of either risperidone or placebo in a double-blind parallel group design. Risperidone treatment was associated with significant increases in relative metabolic rate in the striatum, cingulate gyrus, the prefrontal cortex, especially in the orbital region, and the thalamus. Four of 9 patients who received risperidone showed clinical improvement (CGI score of 1 or 2 at 8 weeks) while none of the 6 patients who received placebo showed improvement. Patients with low relative metabolic rates in the striatum and high relative metabolic rates in the anterior cingulate gyrus were more likely to show a clinical response. These metabolic predictors of clinical response are consistent with earlier PET studies showing similar prediction when either neuroleptics or serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatments are administered individually. Our results are consistent with a frontostriatal circuit change related to both dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and with the presence of psychopharmacological subtypes within OCD.
