Dopamine D2 receptor imaging with SPECT: studies in different neuropsychiatric disorders. The purpose of the present study is to visualize and quantify dopamine D2 receptors in the living human brain using an 123I-labeled ligand and the single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) technique. S-(-)-Iodobenzamide [S-(-)-IBZM] has been shown to be a highly selective ligand with high affinity for D2 receptors in experimental studies. Five millicuries (185 MBq) of 123I-labeled S-(-)-IBZM was administered intravenously to 12 control subjects, 22 parkinsonian patients under L-Dopa therapy, 12 parkinsonian patients without L-Dopa, 10 unmedicated patients with Huntington's disease, and 12 patients under different neuroleptics. Data collection with a rotating double-head scintillation camera started 1 h after injection and lasted for 50 min. In a semiquantitative approach, a ratio was calculated between mean counts per pixel in the striatum and a region in the lateral frontal cortex, which was 1.74 +/- 0.10 in the control group. A marked reduction of this ratio was found in patients with Huntington's disease (1.38 +/- 0.12 p = 0.0001), no significant changes in untreated parkinsonian patients (1.67 +/- 0.14), but a reduction in L-Dopa-treated cases (1.59 +/- 0.13
