Non-specific binding of [18F]FDG to calcifications in atherosclerotic plaques: experimental study of mouse and human arteries. [(18)F]FDG has been used as an inflammation marker and shown to accumulate in inflammatory atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of this study was to investigate the uptake and location of [(18)F]FDG in atherosclerotic plaque compartments.The biodistribution of intravenously administered [(18)F]FDG was analysed in atherosclerotic LDLR/ApoB48 mice (n=11) and control mice (n=9). Digital autoradiography was used to detect the ex vivo distribution in frozen aortic sections. In vitro binding of [(18)F]FDG in human atherosclerotic arteries was also examined.The uptake of [(18)F]FDG was significantly higher in the aorta of atherosclerotic mice as compared with the control mice. Autoradiography of excised arteries showed higher [(18)F]FDG uptake in the plaques than in the healthy vessel wall (mean ratio +/-SD 2.7+/-1.1). The uptake of [(18)F]FDG in the necrotic, calcified sites of the advanced atherosclerotic lesions was 6.2+/-3.2 times higher than that in the healthy vessel wall. The in vitro studies of human arterial sections showed marked binding of [(18)F]FDG to the calcifications but not to other structures of the artery wall.In agreement with previous studies, we observed [(18)F]FDG uptake in atherosclerotic plaques. However, prominent non-specific binding to calcified structures was found. This finding warrants further studies to clarify the significance of this non-specific binding in human plaques in vivo.
