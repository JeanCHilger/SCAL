Dopamine agonist therapy of clinically non-functioning pituitary macroadenomas. Is there a role for 123I-epidepride dopamine D2 receptor imaging? Clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs) can express functional dopamine D2 receptors. Therapy with dopamine (DA) agonists may result in a NFPA size reduction. However, DA agonist-sensitive and -resistant NFPAs are clinically indistinguishable. We have studied the correlation between in vivo imaging of D2 receptors using (123)I-epidepride and the radiological response of NFPA to DA in 18 patients.Patients were treated with either cabergoline (1-2 mg/week) or quinagolide (150-300 mug/day) for a mean period of 89.7 months (range, 34-187 months).Pituitary uptake of (123)I-epidepride varied from slight uptake classified as grade 0 to very high classified as grade 3. Grade 0 uptake was found in four patients grade 1 in threeIn conclusion, there is limited clinical usefulness of dopamine D2 receptor imaging for predicting the clinical efficacy of DA agonist in selected patients with NFPAs. DA agonist therapy in NFPAs can result in tumor stabilization and shrinkage.
