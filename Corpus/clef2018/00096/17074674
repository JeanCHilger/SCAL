Thallium-201SPECT assessment in the detection of recurrences of treated gliomas and ependymomas. The aim of this study was to establish the value of thalium-(201) single-photon emission computed tomography ((201)Tl-SPECT) in the detection of recurrences in the follow-up of patients with treated primary neuroepithelial tumours.Sixty-three (201)Tl-SPECT were performed in 36 patients with glioma (12 males, mean age of 46 +/- 13 years). All patients underwent surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy (and some of them received chemotherapy). All patients were submitted to morphological neuroimaging techniques as well (and (201) Tl-SPECT). Mean follow-up was 18.3 +/- 14.6 months. Gold standard was based on clinical follow-up, therapeutical decisions (at least 4 months after (201)Tl-SPECT) and imaging features.Sensitivity and specificity of (201)Tl-SPECT to detect glioma recurrences were 90% and 100% respectively and 93% accuracy. Sensitivity and specificity for high grade tumours, were 100% respectively. Due to 4 false negatives, sensitivity and specificity for low grade gliomas were 78% and 100%. In the positive (201)Tl-SPECT group of patients overall survival was 13.64% at the end of the study. The negative (201)Tl-SPECT group had 84.62% overall survival at the end of the study (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS. (201)Tl-SPECT is a valuable and noninvasive diagnostic procedure to detect recurrence or progression disease for treated gliomas and ependymomas. (201)Tl-SPECT has a good correlation with short term prognosis with excellent diagnostic accuracy.
