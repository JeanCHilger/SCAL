Relationship between language lateralization and handedness in left-hemispheric partial epilepsy. To investigate the relationship between language lateralization and handedness in patients with epilepsy and a left-sided seizure focus and in healthy control subjects.We recruited a consecutive series of 74 patients and 70 control subjects. Functional MRI, using a noun-verb generation task, was performed to establish the language laterality index (LI). Handedness was quantified using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory.Patients showed a shift toward atypical language lateralization (0.43 +/- 0.47 controls 0.57 +/- 034In epilepsy patients with a left-sided seizure focus, language lateralization is correlated to handedness. The increased frequency of left-handedness and associated atypical language lateralization is most likely related to the left-hemispheric seizure focus, influencing hemispheric specialization for both domains.
