Molecular imaging with PET--open questions? Molecular imaging has become a very popular term in medicine and can be interpreted in many different ways. It is argued that a correct definition should be 'in vivo imaging of biological processes with appropriate molecular probes'. The real challenge in molecular imaging therefore is the search for the 'optimal' molecular imaging probes. It is discussed that nuclear, optical and magnetic probes can be used. However, only PET probes have the high sensitivity to be applied generally. To develop PET probes efficiently, methods for the in vitro and in vivo characterization are discussed and alternatives compared. Some open questions with respect to the reliability of animal imaging and evaluation of the imaging data will be elucidated.
