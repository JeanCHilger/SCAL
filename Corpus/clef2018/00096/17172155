Production of non-standard PET radionuclides and the application of radiopharmaceuticals labeled with these nuclides. The field of positron emission tomography (PET) has expanded dramatically over recent years. In spite of this expansion the large majority of clinical studies are carried out utilizing one radiopharmaceutical-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose. Many research groups are developing novel radiopharmaceuticals. A major emphasis is on other agents labeled with 18F. Several other positron emitting radionuclides can be prepared in high yields in small biomedical cyclotrons. Some of these have half-lives that make delivery significantly easier than the delivery of 18F compounds. These radionuclides include: 64Cu (half life 12.7 h), 76Br (half life 16.2 h), 86Y (half life 14.74 h) and 124I (half life 4.2 days). The method of production of these and other 'non-standard' PET radionuclides will be discussed and the method of labeling radiopharmaceuticals with these radionuclides described. Several of these radiopharmaceuticals have been studied in animal models as well and a limited number translated to the human situation.
