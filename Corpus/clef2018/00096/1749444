Comparison of iodine scintigraphy and computerized tomography in the localization of pheochromocytoma. A comparison is made of the results of CT scanning and MIBG scintigraphy in the localization of phaeochromocytoma. In 21 out of 24 patients with clinically diagnosed phaeochromocytoma in the University Medical Hospital, Groningen in 1983-1990, MIBG scintigraphy provided accurate localization, while in 16 out of 18 patients with phaeochromocytoma who underwent CT scanning a correct localization was obtained. False negative results were mainly present when lesions were smaller than 2 cm. There were no false positive results. It is concluded that the sensitivity of the two methods in the localization of phaeochromocytoma is about equal. The use of one of the methods rather than of both is advised.
