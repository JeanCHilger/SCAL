Prognostic significance of 99mTc Hynic-rh-annexin V scintigraphy during platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced lung cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if sequential 99mTc Hynic-rh- annexin V scintigraphy (TAS) can predict outcome in patients with advanced lung cancer, shortly after the start of platinum-based chemotherapy.In 16 consecutive chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced stage non-small-cell lung cancer scheduled for platinum-based chemotherapy, TAS was performed before and within 48 hours after the start of therapy. Chemotherapy-induced changes in tumor annexin V uptake, calculated as maximum count per pixel and expressed as percentage to baseline value, were compared with treatment response determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.A significant correlation (r2 = 0.86 P = .0001) was found between annexin V metabolic changes and treatment outcome. All patients with notably increased annexin V tumor uptake showed complete or partial response. Less prominently increased or decreased uptake correlated with stable or progressive disease.TAS is a promising test to predict tumor response in patients with advanced lung cancer early in the course of platinum-based chemotherapy.
