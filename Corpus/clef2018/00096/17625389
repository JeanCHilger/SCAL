Nuclear medicine scans in Beijing: insights from the Beijing Quality Control Centre Survey 2005-2006. To survey nuclear medicine scans carried out in Beijing during 2005.Forty-two nuclear medicine departments were surveyed by using mailed questionnaires sent during September 2006.By the end of January 2007, 30 out of 42 hospitals had replied to our survey. The estimated annual number of SPECT procedures was 6.72 per 1000 population during 2005. Among SPECT applications, whole-body bone scans (n=23,090) were performed with the highest frequency, followed by myocardial perfusion imaging (n=19,092), and renal function imaging (n=10,287). The estimated number of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy scans was 1530 procedures per million population. The annual number of PET procedures was 0.25 per 1000 population. Most of these PET and SPECT examinations used relative monotonous radiotracers and most patients were in the age group of 40-70 years. However, for each cancer and each type of application, age distributions slightly varied. In addition, the analysis of gender distribution revealed that the number of male patients was higher than for female patients.The number of nuclear medicine scans carried out in Beijing during 2005 was considerable, with unbalanced clinical applications. Excluded myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, the frequencies of some applications were still lower than in western countries. Furthermore, most procedures used relatively monotonous radiotracers. Most patients were in the age group of 40-70 years and were male.
