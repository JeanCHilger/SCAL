Stereotactic body radiotherapy for unresectable pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with few effective treatment modalities. Recent technological advances have made possible the delivery of single-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to patients with locally advanced pancreatic tumors. This paper presents experience at Stanford University with SBRT for patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic tumors of up to 100 cm3 could be treated. Patients achieved greater than 90% local control for the remainder of their lives. Currently, the standard dose for pancreatic tumors treated at this institution is 25 Gy given in a single fraction. Four-dimensional CT and PET scans have been essential for optimal treatment planning. PET-CT scanning may be a more effective method for evaluating tumor response than conventional CT scanning. Adjuvant systemic therapies could be administered in coordination with SBRT. SBRT is an effective method of treating patients resulting in excellent local control. Current research is aimed at defining the optimal method of combining this treatment with other cancer therapies.
