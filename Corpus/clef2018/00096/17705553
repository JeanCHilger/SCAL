3-Amino-4-(2-((4-[18F]fluorobenzyl)methylamino)methylphenylsulfanyl)benzonitrile, an F-18 fluorobenzyl analogue of DASB: synthesis, in vitro binding, and in vivo biodistribution studies. 3-amino-4-(2[11C]methylaminomethylphenylsulfanyl)benzonitrile (C-11 DASB) exhibits excellent in vitro and in vivo properties toward the serotonin transporter. If labeled with a longer physical half-life radioisotope, this ligand could be more attractive to research groups lacking an on-site cyclotron or lacking C-11 synthesis capabilities. We produce p-[18F]fluorobenzyl iodide on a routine basis to synthesize several neuroimaging agents. Therefore, it was straightforward for us to substitute the DASB precursor with this prosthetic group and assess its biological properties. We designed a different synthesis strategy to obtain the DASB precursor (desmethyl DASB). Herein we report an efficient and facile synthetic route that provides higher chemical yields of 3-amino-4-(2-aminomethylphenylsulfanyl)benzonitrile and related analogues. In addition, we report our results from incorporating p-[18F]fluorobenzyl iodide in DASB precursor and its affect on the in vitro and in vivo biological properties of the DASB.
