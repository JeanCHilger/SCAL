Cutaneous neoplasms in pet rabbits: a retrospective study. Over a 16-year period, 190 tumors and tumorlike lesions from 179 pet rabbits were submitted for histopathologic examination. A total of 23 different tumor types and 1 tumorlike lesion were diagnosed. The most common diagnoses were trichoblastoma, collagenous hamartoma, and Shope fibroma. Viral-induced tumors were Shope fibroma (19) and Shope papilloma (2). Common nonviral epithelial tumors included trichoblastoma (59), squamous cell carcinoma (5), squamous papilloma (4), trichoepithelioma (3), and apocrine carcinoma (3). Common mesenchymal tumors were lipoma (10), liposarcoma (3), myxosarcoma (9), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (8), fibrosarcoma (7), and leiomyosarcoma (4). Malignant melanoma was diagnosed in 8 rabbits. Collagenous hamartomas were diagnosed in 26 rabbits. Mesenchymal proliferations occurred significantly more often in male rabbits than in females. Collagenous hamartomas and myxosarcomas occurred exclusively in male animals, and 3 rabbits had multiple collagenous hamartomas. Immunohistochemistry was applied in cases in which a definite diagnosis could not be reached on hematoxylin and eosin slides. Follow-up information was received in 19 cases. Carcinomas recurred (2 of 3) or metastasized (1 of 3), whereas sarcomas frequently recurred (7 of 12). One malignant melanoma (1 of 3) and one poorly differentiated round cell neoplasm recurred (1 of 1). This is the first comprehensive retrospective analysis on skin neoplasia in pet rabbits.
