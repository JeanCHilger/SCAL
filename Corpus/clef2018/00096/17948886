Cortical glucose metabolism correlates negatively with delta-slowing and spike-frequency in epilepsy associated with tuberous sclerosis. The mechanism of altered glucose metabolism seen on positron emission tomography (PET) in focal epilepsy is not fully understood. We determined the association between interictal glucose metabolism and interictal neuronal activity, using PET and electrocorticography (ECoG) measures derived from 865 intracranial electrode sites in 11 children with focal epilepsy associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (age: 0.5-16 years) undergoing epilepsy surgery. A multiple linear regression analysis was applied to each patient, to determine whether the glucose uptake at each electrode site on interictal PET was predicted by ECoG amplitude powers and interictal spike-frequency measured in the given electrode site. The regression slopes as well as R-square values (an indicator of fitness of the regression models) were finally averaged across the 11 patients. The mean regression slope for delta amplitude power was -0.0025 (95% CI: -0.0045 to -0.0004 P = 0.02 based on one-sample t-test) and that for spike frequency was -0.023 (95% CI: -0.042 to -0.0038
