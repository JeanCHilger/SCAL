F-18 fluoride positron emission tomography of the hip for osteonecrosis. Osteonecrosis (ON) of the femoral head continues to be a devastating disorder for young patients. We evaluated the F-18 fluoride positron emission tomography (PET) imaging modality for use in detection of the bone involved in ON of the hip. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 60 consecutive patients diagnosed with ON and interviewed all by phone. Eleven patients (17 hips) of those interviewed agreed to participate in the study. We classified the ON using the University of Pennsylvania classification system and compared each patient's plain AP bone scan, single photon emission 3-D computed tomography, and MRI. ON was associated with HIV, alcohol, steroid use, and polycythemia vera in this group. Nine of 17 hips (8 patients) had acetabular increased uptake when using the F-18 fluoride PET scans that were not seen on MRI, single photon emission computed tomography, or bone scans. These data suggest earlier acetabular changes in osteonecrosis may exist that traditional imaging modalities do not reveal.
