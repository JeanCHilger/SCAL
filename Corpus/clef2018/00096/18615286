Lipoxygenase inhibition by novel fatty acid ester from Annona squamosa seeds. Studies on the seeds of Annona squamosa yielded a novel lipoxygenase inhibitor fatty acid ester, (+) - annonlipoxy (1). Compound 1 was screened for its enzyme inhibitory activity against lipoxygenase (E.C.1.14.18.1), exhibiting activity with IC(50) 69.05 +/- 5.06 microm. Baicalein (IC(50) 22.6 +/- 0.5 microm) was used as a positive control. Crude extracts of Annona squamosa fruit pulp and seeds were screened for its enzyme inhibitory activity against lipoxygenase and acetylcholinesterase. The crude ethanolic extract of fruit pulp and seeds of Annona squamosa also exhibited lipoxygenase activity with 22.2 and 26.7% inhibition, while the pet.ether extract of seeds of A. squamosa exhibited 52.7% inhibition at a concentration of 40 microg/200 ml. The crude ethanolic extract of seeds of Annona squamosa was also bioassayed for acetylcholinesterase inhibition and it was found inactive.
