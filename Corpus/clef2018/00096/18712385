The additional value of CT images interpretation in the differential diagnosis of benign vs. malignant primary bone lesions with 18F-FDG-PET/CT. To evaluate the value of a dedicated interpretation of the CT images in the differential diagnosis of benign vs. malignant primary bone lesions with 18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT).In 50 consecutive patients (21 women, 29 men, mean age 36.9, age range 11-72) with suspected primary bone neoplasm conventional radiographs and 18F-FDG-PET/CT were performed. Differentiation of benign and malignant lesions was separately performed on conventional radiographs, PET alone (PET), and PET/CT with specific evaluation of the CT part. Histology served as the standard of reference in 46 cases, clinical, and imaging follow-up in four cases.According to the standard of reference, conventional 17 lesions were benign and 33 malignant. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in assessment of malignancy was 85%, 65% and 78% for conventional radiographs, 85%, 35% and 68% for PET alone and 91%, 77% and 86% for combined PET/CT. Median SUV(max) was 3.5 for benign lesions (range 1.6-8.0) and 5.7 (range 0.8-41.7) for malignant lesions. In eight patients with bone lesions with high FDG-uptake (SUV(max) >or= 2.5) dedicated CT interpretation led to the correct diagnosis of a benign lesion (three fibrous dysplasias, two osteomyelitis, one aneurysmatic bone cyst, one fibrous cortical defect, 1 phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor). In four patients with lesions with low FDG-uptake (SUV(max) < 2.5) dedicated CT interpretation led to the correct diagnosis of a malignant lesion (three chondrosarcomas and one leiomyosarcoma). Combined PET/CT was significantly more accurate in the differentiation of benign and malignant lesions than PET alone (p = .039). There was no significant difference between PET/CT and conventional radiographs (p = .625).Dedicated interpretation of the CT part significantly improved the performance of FDG-PET/CT in differentiation of benign and malignant primary bone lesions compared to PET alone. PET/CT more commonly differentiated benign from malignant primary bone lesions compared with conventional radiographs, but this difference was not significant.
