Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. Exact and cost-effective coronary disease imaging--secondary publication. Mortality rates due to coronary arterial disease (CAD) have declined as result of improved prevention, diagnosis and management, but CAD remains the leading cause of death. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) provides a cost-effective tool for early detection of CAD in symptomatic individuals and can stratify patients according to risk of cardiac events. MPS also provides valuable information to assist clinical decision-making. A large body of evidence supports the current applications of MPS, which has become integral to several guidelines for clinical practice.
