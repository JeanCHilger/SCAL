The value of the acetazolamide stimulation test with 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT in reversible cerebrovascular insufficiency. Regional cerebral blood flow reduction was measured in 84 patients with CVI using 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT. 53 patients received 1 g acetazolamide to evaluate cerebrovascular reserve capacity. Differentiating between hemispheric (87%) and vertebrobasilar ischaemia (64%) revealed markedly increased sensitivity for the provocative test with acetazolamide. In 62% of high grade but asymptomatic carotid stenoses a haemodynamic effect was demonstrated with acetazolamide and thereby the indication for surgery was supported.
