Positron emission tomography/computed tomography introduction in the clinical management of patients with suspected recurrence of ovarian cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis. Aim of this study was to evaluate the economic impact of the introduction of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in the early detection of recurrent ovarian cancer through a cost-effectiveness analysis of different diagnostic strategies. Thirty-two consecutive patients with suspected ovarian cancer recurrence, studied by both contrast enhanced abdominal CT and PET/CT, were retrospectively included in the study. Three different diagnostic strategies were evaluated and compared: (1) CT only or baseline strategy (2) PET/CT for negative CT or strategy A
