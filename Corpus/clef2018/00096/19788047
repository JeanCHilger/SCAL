Localization of disease-related PrP in Danish patients with different subtypes of prion disease. The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are characterized by vacuolization, neuronal loss, gliosis and deposition of a misfolded and Proteinase K resistant isoform of the prion protein (PrP(Sc)) in the central nervous system. METHODS MATERIALS AND PATIENTS: Paraffin-embedded tissue blot (PET-blot), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting (WB) were combined to study the morphology and localization of disease related PrP in Danish patients with different subtypes of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, familiar Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Gerstmann-Str√§ussler-Scheinker disease.There was a good morphological and anatomical concordance between what was found with PET-blot and IHC in all patients. In some specific cases, the PET-blot was superior to IHC in sensitivity. To our knowledge, this is the first report where PET-blot analysis is applied to hereditary forms of human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and compared with sporadic cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
