How imaging will guide rehabilitation. Human ischemic stroke is a multistage disorder with different options for recovery. Imaging has opened a window to explore the pathophysiology and recovery mechanisms of ischemic stroke in vivo.It was shown that in the acute phase, arterial recanalization and reperfusion are the most important determinants for recovery. This is followed by functional and structural changes in the perilesional tissue and in large-scale bihemispheric networks that continue with different dynamics for weeks to months. Evidence is presented that the behavioral gains induced by repetitive and mental training are paralleled by changes in functional representations.This review emphasizes that neuroimaging has a great potential for monitoring the hemodynamic, functional and structural factors determining recovery from stroke. It is shown that combining neuroimaging with electrophysiological methods will be instrumental for developing neuroscience-based strategies in rehabilitation.
