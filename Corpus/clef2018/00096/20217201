Human (13)N-ammonia PET studies: the importance of measuring (13)N-ammonia metabolites in blood. Dynamic (13)N-ammonia PET is used to assess ammonia metabolism in brain, liver and muscle based on kinetic modeling of metabolic pathways, using arterial blood (13)N-ammonia as input function. Rosenspire et al. (1990) introduced a solid phase extraction procedure for fractionation of (13)N-content in blood into (13)N-ammonia, (13)N-urea, (13)N-glutamine and (13)N-glutamate. Due to a radioactive half-life for (13)N of 10 min, the procedure is not suitable for blood samples taken beyond 5-7 min after tracer injection. By modifying Rosenspire's method, we established a method enabling analysis of up to 10 blood samples in the course of 30 min. The modified procedure was validated by HPLC and by 30-min reproducibility studies in humans examined by duplicate (13)N-ammonia injections with a 60-min interval. Blood data from a (13)N-ammonia brain PET study (from Keiding et al. 2006) showed: (1) time courses of (13)N-ammonia fractions could be described adequately by double exponential functions (2) metabolic conversion of (13)N-ammonia to (13)N-metabolites were in the order: healthy subjects > cirrhotic patients without HE > cirrhotic patients with HE
