Primary immunodeficiencies of dogs and cats. Primary immunodeficiencies are congenital defects that affect formation or function of the immune system. Congenital immunodeficiency should be considered as a differential diagnosis for repeated infections in a young animal. Defects in the immune system may lead to complete or partial loss of immunity. Some animals with mild immunodeficiency can be managed with long-term antibiotic therapy.
