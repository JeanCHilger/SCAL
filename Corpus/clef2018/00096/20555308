Impaired myocardium regeneration with skeletal cell sheets--a preclinical trial for tissue-engineered regeneration therapy. We hypothesized that autologous skeletal cell (SC) sheets regenerate the infract myocardium in porcine heart as a preclinical trial.The impaired heart was created by implantation of ameroid constrictor on left anterior descending for 4 weeks. SCs isolated from leg muscle were cultured and detached from the temperature-responsive domain-coated dishes as single monolayer cell sheet at 20 degrees C. The following therapies were conducted: SC sheets (SC group, n=5) sham (C group n=5). Echocardiography demonstrated that cardiac performance was significantly improved in the SC group 3 and 6 months after operation (fractional area shortening, 3 monthsSC sheet implantation improved cardiac function by attenuating the cardiac remodeling in the porcine ischemic myocardium, suggesting a promising strategy for myocardial regeneration therapy in the impaired myocardium.
