PET for radiation treatment planning of brain tumours. AA-PET (MET-PET and FET-PET) can be used for gross tumour volume (GTV) delineation in brain gliomas and for the differentiation between treatment-related changes (pseudo-progression, pseudo-regression) and residual/recurrent tumour. There are some data showing that MET-PET and (DOTATOC)-PET can be used for GTV delineation in meningiomas and glomus tumours. The role of PET in the visualization of the biological characteristics of the tumours: proliferation (FLT-PET), hypoxia (FMISO-PET) and angiogenesis/peptide expression (RGD-PET) should be investigated in future studies.
