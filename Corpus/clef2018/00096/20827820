. A common feature of most solid cancerous tumor types is the presence of hypoxic conditions (1) and the overexpression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), a transmembrane cell-surface enzyme that is known to regulate the pH and adhesion of tumor cells (2). Hypoxic tumors are often resistant to radio- and chemotherapy, have a high metastatic potential, and usually predict a poor outcome for the cancer patient (3). Although several methods (invasive and noninvasive) are available for the detection of hypoxia in tumors, including the use of radiolabeled small molecules, these methods are not completely reliable because they either yield variable diagnoses or have functional limitations due to incomplete penetration of tumors and fail to detect hypoxia in all tumor types (3, 4). Because CA IX is overexpressed in most solid tumors, it is considered to be a hypoxia biomarker, and targeting the CA IX for the detection of hypoxic tumors is of great interest to investigators (1, 3-5).
