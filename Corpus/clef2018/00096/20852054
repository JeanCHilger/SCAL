Myocardial insulin resistance induced by high fat feeding in heart failure is associated with preserved contractile function. Previous studies have reported that high fat feeding in mild to moderate heart failure (HF) results in the preservation of contractile function. Recent evidence has suggested that preventing the switch from fatty acid to glucose metabolism in HF may ameliorate dysfunction, and insulin resistance is one potential mechanism for regulating substrate utilization. This study was designed to determine whether peripheral and myocardial insulin resistance exists with HF and/or a high-fat diet and whether myocardial insulin signaling was altered accordingly. Rats underwent coronary artery ligation (HF) or sham surgery and were randomized to normal chow (NC 14% kcal from fat) or a high-fat diet (SAT
