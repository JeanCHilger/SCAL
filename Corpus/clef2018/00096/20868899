Dedicated breast computed tomography: the optimal cross-sectional imaging solution? Dedicated breast computed tomography (DBCT) is a burgeoning technology that has many advantages over current breast-imaging systems. Three-dimensional visualization of the breast mitigates the limiting effects of superimposition noted with mammography. Postprocessing capabilities will allow application of advanced technologies, such as creation of maximum-intensity projection and subtraction images, and the use of both computer-aided detection and possible computer-aided diagnosis algorithms. Excellent morphologic detail and soft tissue contrast can be achieved, due in part to the isotropic image data that DBCT produces. The expected cost should be more reasonable than magnetic resonance imaging. At present, because the breast is not compressed, patients find it more comfortable than mammography. Physiologic information can be obtained when intravenous contrast material is used and/or when DBCT is combined with single photon emission-computed tomography or positron emission tomography. DBCT provides an excellent platform for multimodality systems including integration with interventional and therapeutic procedures. With a slightly altered design, the DBCT platform may also be useful for external-beam radiation with image guidance.
