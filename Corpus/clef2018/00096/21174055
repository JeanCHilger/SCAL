Facial paresis after stroke and its impact on patients' facial movement and mental status. The aims of this study were: (i) to monitor changes in central facial paresis in patients with stroke after orofacial therapy, using functional scales and video analysis of the face and (ii) to investigate correlations between changes in facial movement and mental function of patients after stroke.A prospective blind randomized study of patients after stroke with facial paresis. The functional status of the experimental group of 50 cases treated with regulation orofacial therapy was compared with 49 control cases after 4 weeks of rehabilitation.There were changes in facial movement, evaluated with the House-Brackmann Grading System (HBDS), clinical range and two-dimensional video analysis of the distance between the paretic corner of the mouth and earlobe at rest and during smiling, were measured. Facial movement was found to be significantly better in the experimental group after orofacial therapy compared with the control group. Changes in mental status (depression observed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) were significantly greater in the experimental group. There was a close correlation between the changes in facial movement and mental status according to Spearman's correlation coefficient.Orofacial therapy has a significant effect after 4 weeks of treatment on facial movement and mental state in patients with stroke. Based on the results in our study we can say that the improvements are a significantly better in the experimental group (Difference value) in the parameters HBGS, distance between the corner of the mouth and earlobe and BDI-II.
