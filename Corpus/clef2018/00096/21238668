The predictive value of preoperative fluorine-18-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans in children with congenital hyperinsulinism of infancy. In congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) of infancy, the use of preoperative fluorine-18-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine-positron emission tomography-computed tomography ((18)F-DOPA-PET-CT) scan has recently been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of this technique in discriminating between diffuse and focal CHI and the anatomical localization of focal lesions.Between 2006 and 2010, (18)F-DOPA-PET scan was performed in 19 children with CHI (median age, 2 months range, 1-12 months) who were not responding to medical therapy and underwent laparoscopic or open surgery. The findings of (18)F-DOPA-PET scan were correlated with histology.In 5 children, (18)F-DOPA-PET scan showed diffuse pancreatic uptake, confirmed at histology and supporting the genetic suspicion of diffuse disease. In 14 children, (18)F-DOPA-PET scan indicated focal pancreatic uptake, which corresponded to histology. However, in 5 patients (36%), (18)F-DOPA-PET scan was inaccurate in defining the location of the lesion (n = 3), size of the lesion (n = 1), or both location and size (n = 1), leading to an inaccurate pancreatic resection.Fluorine-18-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine-positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan discriminates between diffuse and focal forms of CHI. In focal forms, (18)F-DOPA-PET scan is useful in 2/3 of patients in defining the site and dimension of the focal lesion. Intraoperative histologic confirmation of complete focal lesion resection is needed.
