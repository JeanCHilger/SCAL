Differences in myocardial sympathetic degeneration and the clinical features of the subtypes of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease (PD) can be divided into the akinetic-rigid (ART), mixed (MT), and tremor-dominant (TDT) subtypes according to the clinically dominant symptoms. We analyzed the correlations between (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake and the clinical features of patients with various PD subtypes. In addition, we evaluated the relationship between MIBG uptake and the severity of the cardinal motor symptoms among patients with PD subtypes. The mean Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores differed significantly among patients with different PD subtypes (± standard deviation [SD]) (ART, 34.6 ± 18.28 MT, 24.63 ± 7.78
