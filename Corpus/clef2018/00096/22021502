Ultrasound evaluation of gallbladder dyskinesia: comparison of scintigraphy and dynamic 3D and 4D ultrasound techniques. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of 3D and 4D ultrasound in correlation with hepatoiminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scanning for calculating gallbladder ejection fraction (EF).A prospective study was conducted with 40 adult patients with suspected gallbladder dyskinesia. Cholecystokinin-provoked (99m)Tc-HIDA scintigraphy was performed, and concurrent 3D and 4D ultrasound images of the gallbladder were obtained before cholecystokinin infusion and 20, 30, and 40 minutes after infusion. The EF values calculated from the ultrasound images and HIDA scan were compared.The gallbladder EF values (mean ± standard error of the mean) calculated 20 minutes after cholecystokinin infusion from HIDA scans and 3D and 4D ultrasound images were 54.1% ± 5.0%, 58.9% ± 6.3%, and 62.8% ± 5.5%. Thirty minutes after infusion the EF values were 56.3% ± 4.7%, 56.9% ± 5.7%, and 59.1% ± 4.6%. The numbers of patients with an EF less than 50% were 14, 12, and 13, and the numbers with an EF less than 35% were 10, seven, and eight. For the patients with an EF less than 50%, the kappa agreement between HIDA scanning and 3D ultrasound was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.73-1.00), between HIDA scanning and 4D ultrasound was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.65-1.00), and between 3D and 4D ultrasound was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.64-1.00).Both 3D and 4D ultrasound techniques correlate well with HIDA scanning for calculating gallbladder EF in patients with suspected biliary dyskinesia.
