Lymph node assessment with (18)F-FDG-PET and MRI in uterine cervical cancer. To assess pelvic (P) and/or paraaortic (PA) lymph node (LN) involvement in patients with primary stage IA-IVA cervical cancer, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, and MRI were compared with histological results.Forty patients were prospectively evaluated. Twenty-eight patients underwent radio-chemotherapy (RT-CT) after initial staging and lymph node dissection (LND).PLN metastases were present in 6/31 patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) and accuracy in detecting PLN metastases were 67%, 84%, 50%, 91% and 81%, with MRI, and 33%, 92%, 50%, 85% and 81%, with FDG-PET. PALN metastases were present in 5/27 patients. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy were 60%, 73%, 33%, 89% and 70% with MRI and 100%, 77%, 50%, 100% and 81% with FDG-PET in detecting PALN metastasis.FDG-PET is less accurate than MRI for PLN, but more accurate for PALN FDG-PET cannot replace PA surgical procedures, but could guide them.
