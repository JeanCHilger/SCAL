Developing red-emissive ruthenium(II) complex-based luminescent probes for cellular imaging. Ruthenium(II) complexes have rich photophysical attributes, which enable novel design of responsive luminescence probes to selectively quantify biochemical analytes. In this work, we developed a systematic series of Ru(II)-bipyrindine complex derivatives, [Ru(bpy)(3-n)(DNP-bpy)(n)](PF(6))(2) (n = 1, 2, 3 bpy, 2,2'-bipyridine
