Are there long-term effects of production-based rearing on pet bird behavior? The pet industry has long been attuned to keeping a ready supply of animals for public purchase. In the years prior to 1970, the majority of larger psittacine birds available for sale to the public were imported animals that were caught as young adults or nestlings from nests. As concern for the effect of this type of trade on native populations became publicized, many collected these imported species and set up pairs to breed parrots to fill this need domestically. Ultimately, this may result in a poor experience that results in unhappiness and one less pet owner as a client for the entire industry.
