Reproducibility of static and dynamic (18)F-FDG, (18)F-FLT, and (18)F-FMISO MicroPET studies in a murine model of HER2+ breast cancer. The objective of this study is to determine the reproducibility of static 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG), 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT), and [(18)F]-fluoromisonidazole ((18)F-FMISO) microPET measurements, as well as kinetic parameters returned from analyses of dynamic (18)F-FLT and (18)F-FMISO data.HER2+ xenografts were established in nude mice. Dynamic data were acquired for 60 min, followed by a repeat injection and second scan 6 h later. Reproducibility was assessed for the percent-injected dose per gram (%ID/g) for each radiotracer, and with kinetic parameters (K                   (1)                   -k                   (4)                   , K                   (                     i                   )) for (18)F-FLT and (18)F-FMISO.The value needed to reflect a change in tumor physiology is given by the 95 % confidence interval (CI), which is ±14, ±5, and ±6 % for (18)F-FDG (n = 12), (18)F-FLT (n = 11), and (18)F-FMISO (n = 11) %ID/g, respectively. V                   (                     d                   ) (=K                   (1)                   /k                   (2)), k                   (3), and K                   (FLT) are the most reproducible (18)F-FLT (n = 9) kinetic parameters, with 95 % CIs of ±18, ±10, and ±18 %, respectively. V                   (                     d                   ) and K                   (FMISO) are the most reproducible (18)F-FMISO kinetic parameters (n = 7) with 95 % CIs of ±16 and ±14 %, respectively.Percent-injected dose per gram measurements are reproducible and appropriate for detecting treatment-induced changes. Kinetic parameters have larger threshold values, but are potentially sufficiently reproducible to detect treatment response.
