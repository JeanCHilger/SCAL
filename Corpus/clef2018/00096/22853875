A nomogram associated with high probability of malignant nodes in the surgical specimen after trimodality therapy of patients with oesophageal cancer. The presence of malignant lymph nodes (+ypNodes) in the surgical specimen after preoperative chemoradiation (trimodality) in patients with oesophageal cancer (EC) portends a poor prognosis for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Currently, none of the clinical variables highly correlates with +ypNodes. We hypothesised that a combination of clinical variables could generate a model that associates with high likelihood of +ypNodes after trimodality in EC patients.We report on 293 consecutive EC patients who received trimodality therapy. A multivariate logistic regression analysis that included pretreatment and post-chemoradiation variables identified independent variables that were used to construct a nomogram for +ypNodes after trimodality in EC patients.Of 293 patients, 91 (31.1%) had +ypNodes. OS (p=0.0002) and DFS (p<0.0001) were shorter in patients with +ypNodes compared to those with -ypNodes. In multivariable analysis, the significant variables for +ypNodes were: baseline T-stage (odds ratio [OR], 7.145 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.381-36.969Our nomogram highly correlates with the presence of +ypNodes after chemoradiation, however, considerably more refinement is needed before it can be implemented in the clinic.
