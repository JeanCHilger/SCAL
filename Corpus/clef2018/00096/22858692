Effects of dimethylolpropionic acid modification on the characteristics             of polyethylene terephthalate fibers. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers are widely used in the preparation             of artificial ligaments. However, due to their lack of hydrophilicity, PET fibers             have low biocompatibility, which usually results in the poor biological activity             of the products. In the present study, in order to improve the hydrophilicity             and biocompatibility of PET fibers, we modified their surface using dimethylolpropionic             acid (DMPA). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy             (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), tensile             testing and cell culture were employed to observe the effects of DMPA modification             on the characteristics of the DMPA-PET fibers. In contrast to the original PET             fibers, the surface of the DMPA-PET fibers became rough as demonstrated by SEM.             The FTIR spectrum further confirmed that a number of hydrophilic groups were formed             on the surface of DMPA-PET. However, there were no significant changes in crystallinity             and tensile strength between the PET and the DMPA-PET fibers as revealed by DSC             and XRD (P>0.05). Finally, the cell co-culture test revealed that the adhesion             and proliferation of bone marrowâ€‘derived stromal cells increased greatly on the             DMPA-PET fibers compared to those on the original PET fibers (P<0.05). These             results demonstrate that DMPA-PET fibers have significant potential as a material             for the development of artificial ligaments.
