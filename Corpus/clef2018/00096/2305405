Cerebral blood flow and metabolism in normotensive and hypertensive patients with transient neurologic deficits. We used positron emission tomography to examine retrospectively the effects of blood pressure on regional cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in seven normotensive and eight hypertensive patients with a history of transient neurologic deficits. In the hypertensive patients, a decrease in regional cerebral blood flow was closely related to blood pressure these changes were most pronounced in the supratentorial structures, especially the striatum and thalamus. In contrast, the regional cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen was less related to blood pressure. Consequently, the regional oxygen extraction fraction was increased in the hypertensive patients, while regional cerebral blood volume and the regional cerebral blood flow volume ratio were unchanged. Multivariate regression analysis confirmed that hypertension was an independent factor affecting regional cerebral blood flow. The analysis also disclosed that age, sex, hematocrit, smoking, and PaCO2 affected regional cerebral blood flow. These findings suggest that the hemodynamic reserve in hypertensive individuals is reduced, which may predispose them to cerebral ischemia and perhaps stroke, even during small decreases in cerebral perfusion pressure.
