Selective enhancement of intratumoral blood flow in malignant gliomas using intra-arterial adenosine triphosphate. The effect of intravenous and intracarotid administration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) on the regional blood flow of glioma patients has been examined by means of positron emission tomography. Intracarotid administration of ATP at a dose of 0.52 to 1.3 micrograms/kg/min selectively increased the blood flow in the tumor by 26.2% +/- 10.5% (mean +/- standard deviation). The side effects observed were tolerable. In contrast, intravenous administration of ATP failed to increase tumor blood flow. It is suggested that intracarotid administration of ATP may serve to selectively enhance the delivery of anticancer agents to malignant brain tumors.
