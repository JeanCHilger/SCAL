A 3-D anthropomorphic brain phantom for ECT applications. A three-dimensional (3-D) anthropomorphic brain phantom was developed for ECT (emission computed tomography) applications. This phantom is made up of a stack of interlaced plates as an insert in a water tank containing radioactive solution. The thickness of the plates in the stack is chosen to create the desired spatial frequency content and object contrast between simulated grey and white matter regions for tracers commonly used to study regional blood flow or metabolism. The transverse, sagittal, and coronal SPECT images acquired with a rotating camera system show a realistic simulation of the grey matter distribution in a human brain.
