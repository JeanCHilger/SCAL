An improved HPLC system for the analysis and purification of organic amine radiopharmaceuticals. This paper describes the separation of lipophilic amine radiopharmaceuticals on normal phase silica using a reversed phase type eluant. This class of compound usually gives very poor peak symmetry on reversed phase columns. However, excellent separation of a number of amines of interest to Positron Emission Tomography, such as spiperone and its derivatives, has been achieved on this system.
