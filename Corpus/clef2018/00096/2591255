Value of stress TL-201 myocardial single photon emission computed tomography in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Fifteen patients with angina pectoris, seventeen with postmyocardial infarction angina and ten with normal coronary arteries were studied with stress TL-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The sensitivity and specificity of SPECT for diagnosis of coronary heart disease were 91% and 90% respectively. SPECT showed better sensitivity (84%) for detecting diseased vessels. The sensitivity of SPECT for identifying one-vessel, two-vessel and three-vessel disease were 80%, 86% and 60%. The sensitivity and specificity of demonstrating involved coronary arteries by identifying the locations of myocardial perfusion defects were 79% and 92% for left anterior descending artery, 90% and 95% for left circumflex artery and 86% and 96% for right coronary artery. For localization of myocardial infarction in the posterior wall, posterior lateral wall, and posterior septum, SPECT is more accurate then ECG. The sensitivity of SPECT in detecting individual vessel is related to the severity of coronary stenosis. The more severe the coronary stenosis, the higher the sensitivity of SPECT. In conclusion, stress SPECT is a noninvasive, highly sensitive and accurate method for detecting and localizing coronary heart disease.
