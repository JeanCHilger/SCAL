Semiquantitative analyses of dynamic single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the primary auditory cortex. To date it has not been possible to work out a standard quantification for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Only one mathematical model has received general recognition, but the theoretical preconditions for this model are not fulfilled by iodine-amphetamine kinetics. A practical solution is offered by semiquantitative analysis. We have developed three computer programs for this analysis for perfusion and cerebral function studies of the symmetrically arranged brain.
