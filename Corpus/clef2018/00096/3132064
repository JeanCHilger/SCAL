Noninvasive testing of cerebral perfusion reserve prior to coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Cerebral perfusion reserve testing using fluorine-18-fluoromethane and positron emission tomographic brain scanning to define cerebral blood flow abnormalities was performed in 5 patients being considered for combined coronary and carotid reconstructive surgery. Blood flow testing during normocapnia and following hypercapnia was utilized in these patients to determine the hemodynamic significance of known extracranial carotid artery occlusive lesions. Reserve diminution in 2 of these patients prompted combined surgery, whereas normal reserve values in the other 3 prompted coronary surgery alone. Results obtained in this preliminary series show how preoperative noninvasive testing of cerebral perfusion reserve adds to the diagnostic evaluation of patients with widespread vascular disease.
