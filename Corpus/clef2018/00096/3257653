Low frontal glucose utilization in chronic schizophrenia: a replication study. Frontal/posterior ratios of cerebral glucose metabolism as determined by positron emission tomography were significantly lower in 13 chronic schizophrenic patients than in eight normal control subjects, as were absolute metabolic rates in both the frontal and posterior regions. The differences were not accounted for by cerebral atrophy.
