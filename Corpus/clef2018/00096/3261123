Relation of left ventricular perfusion and wall motion with metabolic activity in persistent defects on thallium-201 tomography in healed myocardial infarction. Myocardial viability in persistent thallium (TI)-201 defect is a controversial subject. To assess metabolic activity in segments with persistent defect, stress TI-201 tomography and positron emission tomography using nitrogen-13 ammonia and fluorine-18 2-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) were performed in 28 patients with healed myocardial infarction. The segments with TI-201 perfusion defect in electrocardiogram-determined infarcted areas were selected for assessment. Stress perfusion defect was detected in 61 segments by TI-201 tomography. Twenty-two patients (36%) showed transient defects with redistribution (group 1) and 39 showed persistent defects (group 2). Increase in FDG uptake was observed in 95% in group 1. Among group 2 patients, 15 segments (38%) showed an increase in FDG uptake (group 2A) while the remaining 24 (62%) did not have an increased uptake (group 2B). The decrease in nitrogen-13 ammonia perfusion was more severe in group 2B (-23 +/- 7%) than in group 2A (-13 +/- 9%) (p less than 0.005) and group 1 (-10 +/- 4%) (p less than 0.001). In addition, wall motion scores tended to be lower in group 2B (0.21 +/- 0.71), compared with group 2A (0.67 +/- 0.70) (p = 0.05) and group 1 (0.77 +/- 0.60) (p less than 0.01). These data indicate that metabolic viability was observed in approximately 40% of the segments with persistent TI-201 defect. Preservation of regional perfusion and wall motion in these areas was similar to that in areas with transient TI-201 defect.
