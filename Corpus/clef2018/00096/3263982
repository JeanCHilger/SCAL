A relationship between metabolism in frontal lobes and cerebellum in normal subjects studied with PET. Lesions of one cerebral hemisphere are associated with decreased glucose metabolism, oxygen metabolism, and blood flow in the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. We used positron emission tomography to look for a functional relationship in cerebral metabolism between the cerebral cortex and the contralateral cerebellum in normal human subjects. Twenty-four normal subjects were scanned with [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose while in a resting state. Asymmetry in local CMRglu (LCMRglu) in the frontal cortex was strongly correlated with asymmetry in LCMRglu in the opposite direction in the cerebellar hemispheres (r = -0.60, p less than 0.001). Widespread subregions of the frontal cortex were found to contribute to this relationship. Considering these results together with previous studies demonstrating that frontal lesions are associated with decreased metabolism in the contralateral cerebellum, we conclude that the frontal cortex exerts a strong modulating influence on metabolism in the contralateral cerebellum in normal subjects, and that this influence may be asymmetrical.
