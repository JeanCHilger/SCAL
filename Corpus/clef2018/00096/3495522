Myocardial imaging using 11C-CoQ10 with positron emission tomography. The potential of 11C-labeled coenzyme Q10(CoQ10) as a myocardial imaging tracer was explored with positron emission tomography (PET). Serial myocardial imaging studies were performed using 11C-CoQ10, 45Ti-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (45Ti-DTPA), and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-mannose (18FDM) in the same dog. Cross sectional images of the heart with 11C-CoQ10 showed relatively high radioactivity in the blood pool, when compared with images taken with 18FDM. However, when the blood spillover of radioactivity is adequately corrected with 45Ti-DTPA data, it was found that 11C-CoQ10 accumulated in the myocardium with time.
