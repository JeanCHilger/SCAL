Rethinking the morality of animal research. A review is provided of major ethical positions concerning the moral status of animals and the use of animals in research.  These positions are characterized as ethical skepticism and relativism, absolute dominionism, anthropocentric consequentialism, reverence for life, utilitarianism, and abolitionism.  The authors contend that any acceptable ethical discussion of the use of research animals must take into account suffering and well-being, pleasure, thought and reason, purposiveness, and self awareness.  Other issues to be addressed are the nature of different animals and the principle of social interaction with humans.  Justifications for animal research may be based on claims of benefits to humans, benefits to other animals, or the value of research to science and knowledge.
