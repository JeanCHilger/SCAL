Multiple imaging modalities for the study of pancreatic disease. Gray scale ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) have enhanced the role of various imaging modalities in the evaluation of patients with suspected pancreatic disease. When these anatomical studies are normal or equivocal, a functional, radionuclide pancreas scan may be useful. Pancreatic imaging can be achieved using ultrasound, transmission CT, single photon radionuclide imaging, and positron emission CT. A diagnostic imaging decision chart for the evaluation of patients with possible pancreatic disease is useful in choosing the correct imaging modality in a specific situation. Such a chart and its theoretic basis are described in this review. The need to optimize the pancreatic work-up with respect to cost-benefit decisions and diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are of particular concern to the physician. Of all the potential areas for disease, the pancreas has been and remains a particularly difficult diagnostic problem.
