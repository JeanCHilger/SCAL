Positron emission tomography of the brain: new possibilities for the investigation of human cerebral pathophysiology. In the foregoing an overview of positron emission tomography has been presented. Its theoretical, technical, and methodological implications, as well as its clinical applications have been outlined. The emphasis has been on the quantitative aspects of the method and its usefulness is investigating normal and pathological functions of brain tissue. Although the potential of this new research technique is obvious, many theoretical and practical difficulties still need to be solved. Nevertheless it provides an opportunity to bridge the gap between basic experimental research and clinical medicine.
