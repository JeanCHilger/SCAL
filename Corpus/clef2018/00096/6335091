Relationship between local and total bone mineral in normal pubertal boys. The bone mineral content of the distal forearm (BMC) using single-photon absorptiometry and total body bone mineral (TBBM) using dual-photon absorptiometry were determined in 19 normal boys at different pubertal stages. A highly significant correlation between BMC and TBBM was seen (r = 0.78, P less than 0.001) with a standard error of estimate (SEE) of 13%. Subgroups of early and late pubertal stages did not show any significant differences in the regression lines indicating an identical relationship between BMC and TBBM at various stages of pubertal development although great changes in bone mineral content take place. Due to high accuracy and reproducibility of both methods, which are non-invasive and harmless, measurement of BMC is suitable to estimate changes in total mineral content of the body. This may be of importance in various diseases with disturbance in growth and bone metabolism.
