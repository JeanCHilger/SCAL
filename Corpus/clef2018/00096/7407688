Biochemical and immunological investigations on hypothyroidism in dogs. Circulating antibody titers (1:20 to 1:2560) against thyroglobulin were demonstrated in 48% of pet dogs with hypothyroidism by the chromic chloride passive hemagglutination test. Four of six dogs with acanthosis nigricans (1:20) and one of six male dogs with hyperestrogenism (1:40) had low titers of antibody against thyroglobulin whereas clinically normal pet dogs and dogs with other selected endocrinopathies (hypoadrenocorticism, cortisol-excess, diabetes mellitus) or obesity were consistently negative. Circulating immune complexes evaluated by the mastocytoma cell-assay were present in the sera of 20% of pet dogs with hypothyroidism but were absent in clinically normal dogs. Although variations in dose significantly altered the quantitative response of the thyroid gland to thyrotropin the qualitative pattern of response was similar for T3 but not T4 in clinically normal laboratory beagles. The peak increases for serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine were observed either at eight (0.1 and 0.2 I.U bTSH/5 lbs) or 12 (1.0 I.U. bTYSH/5 lbs) hours postthyrotropin. Dogs with naturally occurring hypothyroidism had a decreased serum T3 and T4 at baseline and eight hours postthyrotropin (1.0 I.U. bTSH/5 lbs) compared to clinically normal pet dogs, laboratory beagles and dogs with other clinical endocrinopathies. The consistent lack of a significant increase of serum T3 and T4 in response to thyrotropin was necessary for the separation of certain hypothyroid from euthyroid pet dogs in which the baseline level of thyroid hormones were equivocal.
