Cardiac single-photon emission tomography with a 90 degrees dual-head system. Dual-head single-photon emission tomography (SPET) systems which permit a 90 degrees orientation of the heads provide a twofold increase in sensitivity for 180 degrees SPET compared with single-head systems. Since such systems have additional mechanical and electrical alignment and stability requirements, clinical equivalency for myocardial perfusion SPET must be demonstrated. Accordingly, we studied 26 subjects who underwent exercise thallium scintigraphy consecutively with both single-head and dual-head systems. Image acquisition was similar, except that the dual-head study took one-half the time. Image reconstruction was identical. Images were interpreted in a blinded fashion, and rated for technical quality. All 26 studies were equivalently interpreted for the presence or absence of perfusion defects. Fourteen of the studies were judged to be technically equivalent seven were judged to be slightly better with the single-head system
