Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for preoperative parathyroid imaging in primary hyperparathyroidism. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was performed in seven consecutive patients with primary hyperparathyroidism to preoperatively locate parathyroid adenomas. Foci of FDG accumulation corresponding to abnormal parathyroid tissue were observed in two out of nine surgically excised parathyroid adenomas. It was concluded that FDG PET imaging demonstrated a too low sensitivity for systematic preoperative detection and localization of parathyroid glands causing primary hyperparathyroidism.
