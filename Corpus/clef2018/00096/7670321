Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in pediatric epilepsy. Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) is a valuable tool in the assessment of epileptic patients. Radiotracers that distribute according to regional cerebral blood flow permit the identification of altered perfusion to an epileptogenic zone both ictally and interictally. This technique has proven especially useful in temporal lobe epilepsy.
