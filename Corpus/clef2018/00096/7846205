An open clinical and biochemical study of ritanserin in acute patients with schizophrenia. The effect of the selective serotonin-2 antagonist ritanserin was investigated in an open study of patients with schizophrenia. The patients were in an acute psychotic state considered to require neuroleptic medication. No neuroleptic drug was allowed during the study or during the last month preceeding the study. Oxazepam or nitrazepam were allowed for sedation or sleep inducement. Safety, tolerability, potential antipsychotic effect, and drug effects on monoamine metabolites in serum and CSF and prolactin in serum were evaluated. Central D2-dopamine receptor occupancy was determined by positron emission tomography. Ten male patients (mean age 32.4) fulfilling DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia were included in the study. Nine of these patients completed 4 weeks' treatment with ritanserin 10 mg b.i.d. The clinical effect was evaluated by means of CPRS and SANS and significant improvement was seen after 4 weeks' treatment both in positive and negative symptoms. Ritanserin was well tolerated and no extrapyramidal symptoms or akathisia were seen. Concentrations of monoamine metabolites and prolactin did not change during treatment. Ritanserin did not occupy D2-dopamine receptors. Thus, no indications of any D2-dopamine-antagonistic activity were obtained. All patients had expected ritanserin levels in plasma during the whole study. This first study of a selective serotonin-2 antagonist in the treatment of acute schizophrenic patients demonstrated significant clinical effects. However, the open design of the study does not allow us to conclude with any certainty that the patients' improvement was due to a specific blockade of serotonin-2 receptors or unspecific factors, although a direct D2-dopamine blockade could be ruled out.
