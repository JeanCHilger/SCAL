Individual metabolic anatomy of repeating words demonstrated by MRI-guided positron emission tomography. The anatomical localization of brain areas involved in repeating words was examined in six right-handed non-aphasic subjects. Their individual metabolic activation was studied with positron emission tomography (PET) and [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) using a new data processing technique that includes three-dimensional coregistration with magnetic resonance images. Left superior temporal gyrus (cortical convexity surface, Brodmann area 22), right superior temporal lobe (superior temporal sulcus and bottom of transverse sulcus), sensorimotor cortex (vocalization area) bilaterally, and supplementary motor cortex were consistently activated in each individual. Cerebellar activation was more variable. In contrast to previous blood flow activation studies with averaging across subjects, this new technique permits the anatomical localization and quantitation of activated areas in each individual. It can therefore also be applied to patients with brain lesions.
