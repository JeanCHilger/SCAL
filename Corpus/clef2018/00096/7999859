Reproducibility of peritoneal equilibration test (PET) in rats. The aim of the study was to investigate the reproducibility of the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) for evaluating changes in peritoneal function in a rat model of peritoneal dialysis. A PET with 4.25% Dianeal was performed twice within 48 hours under similar conditions after a catheter insertion (n = 10). No significant differences were found between the D/P ratios of PET 1 and PET 2 for urea nitrogen, creatinine, total protein, and D/D0 ratio for glucose. The results for PET 1 and PET 2 showed highly significant correlations. This study indicates, when carried out under similar conditions, that the PET is a highly reproducible test and can be used to evaluate the function of the peritoneum during peritoneal dialysis in rats.
