Usefulness of 201T1C1-SPECT in the evaluation of radiation and chemotherapy for brain tumors. We investigated the usefulness of Thallium-201 chloride single photon emission computed tomography (T1-SPECT) in the evaluation of radiation and chemotherapy for brain tumors. The subjects were 9 cases (10 tumors) of malignant astrocytomas. T1-SPECT was performed before and immediately after irradiation and/or intraarterial infusion of ACNU. In 5 of 10 tumors, T1-index already changed 1 or 2 months before tumor size changed on the CT. Our results suggested that T1-SPECT was useful for evaluating the viability of tumor.
