Iodine-123-iodo-lisuride SPECT in Parkinson's disease. Recently, [123I]iodo-lisuride was synthesized for possible applications in SPECT studies. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the striatal binding and kinetics of this radioligand in patients with Parkinson's disease and normal controls.Six patients with Parkinson's disease and three normal controls were examined. After intravenous injection of 111 MBq [123I]iodo-lisuride, sequential SPECT examinations at 20, 40, 80 and 120 min were performed. For each SPECT series the basal ganglia-to-cerebellum ratio of tracer accumulation was calculated. In one patient a repeat SPECT examination was undertaken under identical conditions to test the reproducibility of the procedure. In two other patients a second SPECT examination was performed after injection of cold lisuride as a receptor saturation study. In addition, the time course of the radioactivity was measured in the plasma and red blood cells in each individual.In both patients and controls, the highest tracer accumulation was found within the striatum. The basal ganglia-to-cerebellum ratio was 1.182 and 1.303 at 20 min, 1.353 and 1.450 at 40 min, 1.490 and 1.533 at 80 min, 1.550 and 1.583 at 120 min for patients and controls, respectively, which was not statistically different. In the saturation study, 50 micrograms and 100 micrograms cold lisuride led to a 28% and 33% reduction, respectively, of the basal ganglia-to-cerebellum ratio at 120 min. The ligand showed a rapid decline in plasma and red blood cells. The percent injected dose per liter was calculated to be 1.6 and 0.9, respectively, for plasma and red blood cells at 20 min.Iodine-123-iodo-lisuride SPECT seems useful for imaging intact striatal dopamine D2 receptors in patients with Parkinson's disease and may provide clinically relevant information for quantitative assessment of the availability and integrity of dopamine D2 receptors.
