The (S)-(+)-enantiomer of dimethindene: a novel M2-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist. The present study was designed to determine to determine the in vitro affinity profile of (R)-(-)-dimethindene and (S)-(+)-dimethindene at muscarinic receptor subtypes using both functional and binding assays. In addition, the racemate was investigated in functional studies. The functional muscarinic receptors studied were putative M1 receptors in rabbit vas deferens and rat duodenum, M2 receptors in guinea-pig left atria and rabbit vas deferens, as well as M3 receptors in guinea-pig ileum and trachea. Furthermore, the histamine H1 antagonism by (R)-(-)- and (S)-(+)-dimethindene has been examined in guinea-pig ileum. Muscarinic binding selectivity was assessed in homogenates from human neuroblastoma NB-OF 1 cells (M1), rat heart (M2), pancreas (3) and striatum (M4). The results demonstrate that (S)-(+)-dimethindene is a potent M2-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist (pA2 = 7.86/7.74 pKi = 7.78) with lower affinities for the muscarinic M1 (pA2 = 6.83/6.36
