Autoradiographic approaches to studying hallucinogens or other drugs. Autoradiography provides a powerful tool whereby an investigator can study different aspects of hallucinogens in the laboratory and the clinic. Receptor autoradiography can be performed in vitro to map binding sites of hallucinogens or to assess potential neurotoxic sequelae of hallucinogen treatments. Similarly, such studies can be performed in vivo to the same end. Receptor autoradiography can be performed in a clinical setting using PET to study acute dynamic binding properties of hallucinogens in humans or for long-term followup studies. In vivo autoradiography of metabolic markers appears useful in the laboratory and potentially in the clinic to help researchers understand not only where, but also the manner in which, the brain responds functionally to hallucinogens.
