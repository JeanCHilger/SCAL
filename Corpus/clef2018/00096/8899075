Review article: pathogenesis and treatment of chronic hepatic encephalopathy. The various treatment strategies for hepatic encephalopathy are compared in the light of the available body of scientific work on the pathogenesis of the syndrome. Data on animal models of hepatic encephalopathy and in vitro studies on brain slices are discussed. Difficulties in extrapolating the results obtained to the human situation are highlighted, while results of human positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies are outlined on the background of the potential weaknesses of these non-invasive techniques.
