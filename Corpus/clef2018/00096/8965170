Cerebral SPECT imaging: effect on clinical management. This study, performed in 94 consecutive patients referred for evaluation, demonstrates the clinical utility of cerebral SPECT imaging. In a significant percentage of patients (47%), the additional information provided by SPECT resulted in an alteration in clinical management. Long-term follow-up will be necessary to determine the effect of these management decisions on patient outcome.
