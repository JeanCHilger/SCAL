Iodine-123-iodobenzamide binding in parkinsonism: reduction by dopamine agonists but not L-Dopa. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of treatment with L-Dopa or a dopamine agonist, or both, on specific striatal 123I-iodobenzamide (IBZM) binding using an intraindividual longitudinal design.We prospectively studied the effect of dopaminomimetic treatment on specific [123I]IBZM binding measured by SPECT in 29 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, none of whom had previously received dopaminomimetic drugs. The patients had been selected on the basis of normal subsequent specific [123I]IBZM binding, semiquantitatively calculated as the basal ganglia/frontal cortex ratio, and a positive response to the dopamine agonist apomorphine before initiation of dopaminomimetic therapy. A second 123I-IBZM SPECT investigation was performed after 3-6 mo of treatment with L-Dopa or a dopamine agonist, or both.Specific [123I]IBZM binding was unchanged in 10 patients treated with L-Dopa alone. However, after treatment with a dopamine agonist there was a significant decline in specific [123I]IBZM binding (p < 0.05). After treatment with a combination of L-Dopa and a dopamine agonist, specific [123I]IBZM binding was reduced without reaching a level of significance (p = 0.08).Short-term treatment with a dopamine agonist but not with L-Dopa reduces specific [123I]IBZM binding. Therefore, before performing an [123I]IBZM SPECT scan in patients previously treated with dopaminomimetic drugs, dopamine agonists should be discontinued.
