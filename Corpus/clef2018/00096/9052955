Neuroimaging and epilepsy. The objective of magnetic resonance neuroimaging is to define the structural changes responsible for epileptogenic lesions and to rule out the presence of dual pathology when partial epileptic seizures are being studied. To this end, the individualization and optimization of protocols and sequences is indispensable. Structural images must be complemented by clinical evidence and function studies (EEG, SPECT, PET) in order to determine whether the structural lesion is responsible for the seizure and might eventually be excised. Spectroscopy provides biochemical information that is somewhat comparable to that obtained by biopsy of the epileptogenic zone. Spectroscopic images in the near future will provide clear "blind" views of these zones. Functional magnetic resonance images will presumably be of great help in the management of these patients.
