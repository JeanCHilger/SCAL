SPECT imaging of normal subjects with technetium-99m-HMPAO and technetium-99m-ECD. Technetium-99m-HMPAO and 99mTc-ECD have been used for regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) studies using SPECT. However, details of the normal perfusion patterns of these agents still remain to be clarified. HMPAO-SPECT and ECD-SPECT images of normal individuals were investigated using an anatomical standardization technique.Twenty healthy subjects participated in this study. In 10 of these, regional cerebral perfusion was measured with HMPAO, and in the other 10, ECD was used. All SPECT images were globally normalized to 50 counts/voxel, and then, each SPECT image was transformed into a standard brain anatomy format with the aid of x-ray CT of each subject and a computerized human brain atlas system (HBA). Mean and s.d. images for each tracer were calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis. For comparison of these SPECT images with blood flow, rCBF images were generated using PET in a separate group of 10 healthy male subjects during an eyes-closed resting state. The PET images were globally normalized to 50 ml/100 g/min and anatomically standardized using each subject's MRI and the HBA for the SPECT images.In the HMPAO-SPECT images, relatively high radioactivities Were observed in the basal ganglia and cerebellum. In the ECD-SPECT images, high levels were observed in the medial aspect of the occipital lobe. These regions with high radioactivity were not apparent in the rCBF-PET images.While both HMPAO and ECD have been used to investigate rCBF, their perfusion patterns differ from rCBF-PET images. This presumably reflects differences in the mechanism of accumulation of each agent in the brain. For clinical diagnoses, these patterns must be taken into consideration.
