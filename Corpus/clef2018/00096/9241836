Determination of ethoxyquin in feeds by liquid chromatography: collaborative study. Ethoxyquin is a chemical antioxidant used in feeds, ingredients, fats, and oils. A liquid chromatographic (LC) method for determination of ethoxyquin was developed. The method involves acetonitrile extraction of the sample and isocratic C18 reversed-phase chromatography with ammonium acetate buffer-acetonitrile as mobile phase and fluorescence detection. A collaborative study of the determination of ethoxyquin in various meals and extruded pet foods was conducted by The Iams Company Research Laboratory. Eleven laboratories analyzed 16 samples (including 2 blind duplicates) consisting of 7 meat meals and 9 extruded pet foods. Sample means ranged from 0.25 to 289 ppm. Repeatability standard deviations ranged from 0.08 to 3.2 ppm, and repeatability relative standard deviations ranged from 4.5 to 32%. Reproducibility standard deviations ranged from 0.12 to 13 ppm, and reproducibility relative standard deviations ranged from 4.5 to 55%. The LC method for determination of ethoxyquin in feeds has been adopted first action by AOAC INTERNATIONAL.
