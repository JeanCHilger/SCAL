A serologic survey for Brucella canis in dogs on a military base. A survey for Brucella canis antibodies in dogs was conducted at an Air Force Base in Missippi in 1976. The rapid slide agglutination test was used as a screening test prior to determination of titers by the standard tube agglutination test. Of 6 sera reacting positively by the slide technique, only 1 was confirmed positive by the tube agglutination technique. The seropositive rate among stray dogs apprehended on the base was 7.6%, whereas the seropositive rate among pet dogs was 0%.
