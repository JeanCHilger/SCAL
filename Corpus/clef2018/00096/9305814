Neural control of fast-regular saccades and antisaccades: an investigation using positron emission tomography. Regional cerebral blood flow changes related to the performance of two oculomotor tasks and a central fixation task were compared in ten healthy human subjects. The tasks were: (a) performance of fast-regular saccades (b) performance of voluntary antisaccades away from a peripheral cue
