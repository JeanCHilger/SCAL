Isolation and identification of Salmonella species from chelonians using combined selective media, serotyping and ribotyping. Thirty-two faecal samples from various pet chelonians were bacteriologically examined using various combinations of selective media for Salmonella detection. Strains identified as Salmonella were clustered by rRNA gene restriction pattern (ribotyping) analysis prior to serological typing. The combination of selenite broth and Rambach or Salmonella-Shigella agars gave the maximum rate of Salmonella recovery. Of the 32 samples examined, 13 (40%), were positive for Salmonella. Five serovars were identified, Muenchen, Rubislaw, Newport, Ferruch and a non-motile O:4,5,12, with Salmonella Muenchen the most common. This result indicates that biochemical characterization combined with ribotyping prior to serotyping can contribute to Salmonella detection on a large scale.
