Lesion-to-background ratio in nonattenuation-corrected whole-body FDG PET images. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic efficacy of attenuation-corrected and nonattenuation-corrected whole-body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images to determine an adequate method that can semiquantitatively evaluate nonattenuation-corrected images.Whole-body PET studies were performed in 24 fasting patients with various tumors (lung cancers, n = 18 mediastinal tumors, n = 4Attenuation-corrected and uncorrected images were found to be equally sensitive for detecting lesions. There was a strong linear correlation between lesion-to-background (L/B) ratios calculated on attenuation-corrected and uncorrected images (r = 0.98 p < 0.001). Significant differences in L/B ratios between attenuation-corrected and uncorrected images were present in only 6 of 55 lesions (11%). Standardized uptake ratios (SURs) in attenuation-uncorrected images did not correlate with SURs in attenuation-corrected images nor with L/B ratios in uncorrected images.The efficacy of attenuation-uncorrected FDG PET images in evaluating tumors is similar to that using attenuation-corrected images. Uncorrected images provide not only clinically useful but also quantitative information equivalent to that provided by attenuation-corrected images. However the L/B ratio is the only available index that can be used for quantification of uncorrected images.
