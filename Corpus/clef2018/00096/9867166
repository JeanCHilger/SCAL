Multiple line source array for SPECT transmission scans: simulation, phantom and patient studies. Accurate attenuation and scatter corrections in quantitative SPECT studies require attenuation maps of the density distribution in the scanned object. These can be obtained from simultaneous emission/transmission scans.A new method has been developed using a multiple line source array (MLA) for transmission scans, and its performance has been investigated using computer simulations and experimental data. The activity in the central lines of the MLA was higher than at the edges of the system, so that more transmission photons would be directed toward the thicker parts of the human body. A series of transmission-only and simultaneous emission/transmission studies were performed for different phantom configurations and human subjects. Attenuation maps were generated and used in reconstruction of attenuation-corrected emission images.The mu coefficients for attenuation maps obtained using the MLA system and simulated and experimental data display no artifacts and are qualitatively and quantitatively correct. For phantoms, the agreement between the measured and the true value of mu for water was found to be better than 4%. The attenuation-corrected emission images for the phantom studies demonstrate that the activity in the heart can be accurately reconstructed. A significant qualitative improvement was also obtained when the attenuation correction was used on patient data.Our results indicate that the MLA transmission source can be used in simultaneous transmission/emission imaging to generate accurate attenuation maps. These maps allow for performing an object-specific, attenuation correction of the emission images.
