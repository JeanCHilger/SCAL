Clinical application of myocardial perfusion imaging with 99mTc-MIBI SPECT in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Myocardial perfusion imaging with 99mTc-MIBI was studied in 80 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), 29 cases of normal controls and 37 cases of noncoronary heart diseases. The perfusion imaging was analysed both by qualitative and quantitative methods. The results revealed that the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for CAD were 91.5%, 83.8%, and 88.5% respectively by qualitativ method, and were 88.1%, 94.6% and 90.6% respectively by quantitative method. The diagnostic sensitivity of electrocardiogram (ECG) was 69.5%. Fourteen cases with the narrowing of coronary artery > 50% shown by coronary angiography also had abnormal myocardial perfusion imaging. It suggests that analysis of perfusion imaging by quantitative method in detecting CAD is superior than qualitative method and ECG.
