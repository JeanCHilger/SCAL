Using single photon emission tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) to trace the distribution of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (MACHR) binding radioligands. Two [18F] labeled ligands for the mAChR were prepared and evaluated in rodents and nonhuman primates. The properties of both compounds, one an agonist and the other an antagonist, were consistent with M2 subtype specificity.
