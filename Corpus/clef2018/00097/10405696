Detection of preclinical Parkinson disease in at-risk family members with use of [123I]beta-CIT and SPECT: an exploratory study. To explore whether the radioligand 2 beta-carboxymethoxy-3 beta-(4-[123I] iodophenyl) tropane ([123I]beta-CIT) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can detect decreased striatal uptake in at-risk relatives of patients with Parkinson disease (PD).Ten PD patients, 10 at-risk first-degree relatives of PD patients, and 10 controls underwent [123I]beta-CIT and SPECT brain imaging. Their striatal uptake ratios were compared.Age-adjusted specific to nonspecific striatal uptake ratios were lower in patients compared with controls and with relatives however, ratios were similar in relatives and controls. Among relatives, ratios were consistently lower in subgroups postulated to be at higher risk for preclinical PD.Our findings provide preliminary support that [123I]beta-CIT and SPECT may detect decreased striatal uptake in relatives of PD patients postulated to be at higher risk for PD.
