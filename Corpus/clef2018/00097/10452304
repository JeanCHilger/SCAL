Kinetics of 123I-MIBG after acute myocardial infarction and reperfusion therapy. Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) washout from the myocardium has been thought to reflect sympathetic nerve tone. After acute myocardial infarction, however, little is known about this parameter. The aim of this study was to determine the significance of cardiac washout after myocardial infarction and early reperfusion by investigating MIBG kinetics and correlating those kinetics to clinical parameters.Sixty patients with acute myocardial infarction underwent planar MIBG and thallium imaging within 14 d of early reperfusion therapy. Global uptake and washout in myocardium, lungs and liver were calculated from early and delayed images. A regional analysis of myocardial kinetics in normal and infarcted myocardium and in an infarct border zone was also performed. Scintigraphic data were correlated with heart-rate variability as an electrophysiologic marker for autonomic tone and prevalence of arrhythmia in 52 patients. Heart-rate variability was described by time-domain indices from long-term electrocardiogram recordings. An age-matched normal control group for MIBG consisted of 10 individuals without heart disease.The infarct patients had preserved left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (56% +/- 17%). Although late myocardial uptake was expectedly lower in infarct patients compared with healthy volunteers (2.36 +/- 0.66 versus 2.80 +/- 0.55 P = 0.04), global myocardial MIBG washout was faster (11.6% +/- 7.9% versus 0.2% +/- 10.2%, respectivelyAfter myocardial infarction, changes in MIBG kinetics occur specifically in the myocardium, whereas kinetics in lung and liver remain unchanged. Even in patients with left-ventricular function preserved by reperfusion therapy, MIBG washout is abnormal and globally increased. Enhanced washout may reflect increased sympathetic nerve tone and represent increased catecholamine turnover or impaired reuptake in the subacute phase of myocardial infarction.
