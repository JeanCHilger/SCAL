BMIPP in angina pectoris. Radionuclide imaging with BMIPP for assessment of myocardial metabolism can assist in clinical decision making in certain subsets of patients with coronary artery disease. In stable angina, abnormal BMIPP imaging and less BMIPP uptake than Tl-201 are more likely to be seen in the distribution of vessels with severe stenoses and related to regional wall abnormalities. BMIPP SPECT imaging is a promising approach in the evaluation of patients with suspected unstable angina during the pain-free period even after stabilization. Fatty acid metabolism is easily suppressed due to the abrupt onset of ischaemia. In addition, combined imaging with BMIPP and Tl-201 can provide insights into the understanding of abnormal metabolism in myocardium in stable and unstable angina. This review addressed the clinical applications of BMIPP imaging for evaluation of stable and unstable angina.
