Myocardial imaging with 123I-BMIPP in patients with congestive heart failure. First, we studied the diagnostic utility of myocardial imaging with 123I-BMIPP (BMIPP), a 3-methyl-branched fatty acid analog, in patients with various types of cardiomyopathy and left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction below 40%) by comparing with myocardial flow tracer imaging. The incidence of a dissociation between myocardial BMIPP and 201Tl distributions (BMIPP < 201Tl) as a marker of metabolic abnormality in viable tissue varied considerably among various heart diseases. Patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and the dilated form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had a higher incidence while those with idiopathic dilated, alcoholic and hypertensive cardiomyopathy had a lower incidence. These results suggest that the marked difference between ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathies may contribute to the differential diagnosis between these two diseases which are main basic abnormalities in congestive heart failure. Second, we investigated the relationship between myocardial BMIPP uptake and ventricular stress in patients with right ventricular pressure overload due to pulmonary hypertension. Myocardial BMIPP uptake in the right ventricle estimated by referring to uptake in the left ventricle showed a significant correlation with mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) and no significant difference with myocardial 99mTc-sestamibi uptake in the 15-81 mmHg mPAP range. These results suggest that myocardial utilization of free fatty acid may be preserved in the presence of higher ventricular wall stress.
