A FAIR study of motor cortex activation under normo- and hypercapnia induced by breath challenge. In this study an arterial spin-tagging technique based on flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) with single-shot spiral data acquisition was used to study how the basal cerebral blood flow (CBF) elevated by breath holding affects the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) response to focal brain activation in the motor cortex. Six subjects were examined using three types of activation studies. These were (a) bilateral finger tapping paced at 4 Hz under normal breathing, (b) repeated expiration breath holding of 30 s, and (c) simultaneous breath holding and finger tapping. It was found that in five of six subjects the prevailing CBF level adjusted by breath challenge and the increase in rCBF in motor cortex associated with bilateral finger tapping were completely additive. This finding from FAIR-based functional magnetic resonance imaging is in accordance with that reported from published positron emission tomography studies. The results indicate that in the majority of the subjects examined the regulatory mechanisms for vasodilatory reaction to CO(2) and rCBF response to neural activation in motor cortex region are independent.
