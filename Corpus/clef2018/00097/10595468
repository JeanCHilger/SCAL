Gated Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT versus stress-rest SPECT in detecting coronary artery disease: correlation with coronary angiography in patients without myocardial infarction. It is possible to simultaneously evaluate wall thickening and perfusion abnormalities with radionuclide techniques that use tracers such as Tc-99m MIBI. We presumed that detection of wall thickening by gated MIBI SPECT imaging in the presence of a stress-induced perfusion defect correlates with reversibility of that defect on resting images. Therefore, the aim of our study was to analyze, in patients without myocardial infarction, resting wall thickening and stress perfusion imaging as an alternative to conventional stress-rest imaging.The patients (n = 44) underwent an exercise (n = 37) or pharmacologic (n = 7) stress protocol. All patients had previous coronary angiography within 3 months. Stress-rest MIBI SPECT and gated MIBI SPECT studies were analyzed by visual scoring. The sensitivity and specificity of segmental analysis of both stress-rest MIBI SPECT perfusion and gated MIBI SPECT studies for the overall detection of coronary artery disease were, respectively, 71% and 96%. For patient evaluation for detection of coronary artery disease, stress-rest MIBI SPECT perfusion and gated MIBI SPECT studies showed a sensitivity rate of 96% for both and specificity rates of 84% and 79%, respectively.Our data revealed close agreement between reversible perfusion defects on stress-rest MIBI SPECT scans and significant wall thickening on gated MIBI SPECT stress images in patients without previous myocardial infarction (95%). Gated MIBI SPECT stress, without resting studies, which provide an assessment of wall motion and wall thickening, potentially allows stress defect reversibility to be evaluated in patients without previous myocardial infarction.
