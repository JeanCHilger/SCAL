Role of functional brain imaging in the evaluation of vascular dementia. There are various types of underlying damage to tissue and vessels in vascular dementia, including (1) single or multiple infarcts that involve association and limbic cortices, (2) small subcortical infarcts disrupting cortico-subcortical circuits, and (3) white matter lesions. The clinical picture of vascular dementia varies, and the role of functional brain imaging of cerebral blood flow and metabolism would be expected to be different among subtypes of vascular dementia. The role and value of functional brain imaging is limited for cortical infarcts it is very valuable in assessing the impact on cortical function for small subcortical infarcts
