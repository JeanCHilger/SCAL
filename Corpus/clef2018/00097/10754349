Myocardial perfusion and angiographic findings in patients with paradoxical sinus deceleration during dobutamine technetium-99m sestamibi-gated SPECT imaging. Dobutamine-gated SPECT imaging allows simultaneous perfusion and function assessment and is an alternative stress method for evaluating coronary artery disease in patients unable to perform treadmill exercise. In some patients, a paradoxical decrease in heart rate has been observed during high dose dobutamine infusion. The purpose of this study was to describe the paradoxical decrease in heart rate observed during dobutamine perfusion scintigraphy and determine its relation to inducible ischemia and angiographic coronary artery disease.We studied 52 patients who underwent dobutamine-gated (99m)Tc sestamibi SPECT imaging and coronary angiography within 30 days. Paradoxical deceleration was defined as a decrease in heart rate >/=5 beats/min lasting at least 3 min during dobutamine infusion. Perfusion was graded on a five-point scale (0 = normal 4 = absent uptake) and wall motion on a four-point scale (0 = akinesia/dyskinesiaParadoxical deceleration observed during dobutamine perfusion scintigraphy is associated with inducible ischemia and angiographic coronary artery disease and the underlying mechanism for this phenomenon may be the activation of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex.
