The Natural Progression of Atherosclerosis in an Untreated Patient With Hyperlipidemia: Assessment via Cardiac PET. Recent studies have demonstrated successful reversibility of atherosclerosis in 1/3 of the cases, stabilization in 1/3, and continued progression in the remaining 1/3 of individuals treated for hypercholesterolemia and stress reduction. However, no reported data exist about the natural progression of untreated coronary artery disease in the clinical setting with which these results can be compared. In this case report, we will review the natural progression of atherosclerosis as documented by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging during a 104-day period.
