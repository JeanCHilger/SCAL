Relative contributions of technetium Tc 99m sestamibi scintigraphy, intraoperative gamma probe detection, and the rapid parathyroid hormone assay to the surgical management of hyperparathyroidism. Technetium Tc 99m sestamibi scintigraphy, intraoperative gamma probe detection, and the rapid parathyroid hormone assay have been used to permit a directed operation in patients with hyperparathyroidism. We hypothesized that the coordinated use of these techniques might be particularly useful in patients who require a second operation for hyperparathyroidism.Retrospective analysis was performed to determine the specific contribution of these technologies to the surgical management of patients with hyperparathyroidism who underwent evaluation by at least 2 of these techniques between April 1996 and October 1999.Patients were evaluated and treated by an endocrine tumor surgery group within a tertiary care referral center.Coordinated application of 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy, intraoperative gamma probe detection, and/or the rapid parathyroid hormone assay was performed in 32 patients.Twenty-eight of 32 patients had primary hyperparathyroidism, 3 had multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, and 1 had secondary hyperparathyroidism. The surgical procedure was an initial cervical exploration in 19 and a second operative procedure in 13. Parathyroidectomy was successful in all patients. A directed anatomic operation was performed in 24 patients, including 11 patients who underwent second operative procedures and 9 patients who underwent minimally invasive procedures under local anesthesia. A directed operation was facilitated by sestamibi scan in 22 of 24 patients, intraoperative gamma probe detection in 5 of 23 patients, and the rapid parathyroid hormone assay in 15 of 15 patients.Coordinated application of 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy, intraoperative gamma probe detection, and the rapid parathyroid hormone assay allows for successful directed reoperative parathyroidectomy a minimally invasive procedure may be performed in selected patients.
