Combined thallium-201 and dynamic iodine-123 iodophenylpentadecanoic acid single-photon emission computed tomography in patients after acute myocardial infarction with effective reperfusion. Considerable derangements of energy metabolism are to be expected during ischemia and reperfusion. In ischemic myocardium, the oxidative degradation of carbohydrates is shifted toward the anaerobic production of lactate and the oxidation of fatty acids is suppressed.The aim of this study was to examine the uptake and metabolism of iodine-123 (123I) iodophenylpentadecanoic acid (IPPA) in stunned myocardium.In 15 patients, SPECT with 201Tl and 123I IPPA as well as echocardiography with low-dose dobutamine stimulation were performed 12 +/- 5 days after myocardial infarction with reperfusion. Follow-up echocardiography was carried out 24 +/- 8 days later for documentation of functional improvement. Uptake of 201Tl and 123I IPPA were obtained in five left ventricular segments, and dynamic SPECT imaging was used for calculation of the fast and the slow components of the biexponential myocardial 123I IPPA clearance.Wall motion improved in 14 of 26 dysfunctional segments (54%). Stunned segments were characterized by a reduced 123I IPPA extraction, a shorter half-life of the fast, and a longer half-life of the slow clearance component. All parameters of the combined 201Tl/123I IPPA study predicted functional recovery with similar accuracies (area under the receiver operator characteristic curves between 0.68 and 0.76 p = NS). Analysis of 201Tl uptake alone could not predict functional recovery in this study.Stunned myocardium is characterized by a disturbance of fatty acid metabolism. For prediction of functional improvement, 123I IPPA imaging added significant diagnostic information.
