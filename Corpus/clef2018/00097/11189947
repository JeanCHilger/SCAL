FDG-PET of autoimmune-related pancreatitis: preliminary results. The purpose of this retrospective study was to elucidate the fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) findings in autoimmune-related pancreatitis (AIP), which is a reversible chronic pancreatitis with an autoimmune cause. The study group comprised six patients with clinically diagnosed AIP. After 370 MBq (10 mCi) of FDG had been injected intravenously, the abdomen and/or the whole body was scanned at 1 h post injection in all patients, and scanning was repeated at 2 h in four patients. PET findings were evaluated visually and/or semiquantitatively using the standardized uptake value (SUV). In four of the six patients, PET demonstrated intense uptake in the whole pancreas, which appeared swollen on computed tomography, and the accumulation increased with time in three patients. In one patient, intense focal uptake in the pancreatic head was observed, and the accumulation decreased over time. In the remaining patient, no abnormal accumulation in the pancreas was observed. Follow-up PET scanning after steroid therapy was performed in three patients, and intense FDG uptake was no longer observed. Our preliminary data show that AIP can cause intense FDG uptake in the pancreas. This fact, and the benign status of the condition, should be kept in mind when making a diagnosis with FDG-PET in patients with pancreatic disorders.
