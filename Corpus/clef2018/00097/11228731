Clinical examination of fish in private collections. The rapid advancement of fish medicine over the past 10 years has led to a drastically improved ability to manage the individual pet fish successfully. Principle physiologic differences between fish and higher vertebrates include the lack of ability to regulate body temperature (this has a profound effect on the immune system), the use of gills for respiration, and the importance of osmoregulation in the aquatic environment. Components of the clinical history for a fish patient should include information on the environment, tank mates, recent medical history, and specific information on the affected individual. Fish can be manually restrained or safely anesthetized with methane tricaine sulfonate, depending on their size, condition, and circumstances. Diagnostic techniques useful for fish patients include gill, skin, and fin biopsy hematology
