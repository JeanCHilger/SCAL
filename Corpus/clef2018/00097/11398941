Functional imaging in the work-up of childhood epilepsy. In children with medically intractable lesional epilepsy, surgery is deemed successful if the epileptogenic focus can be removed while major neurological functions are spared. Current techniques rely on invasive intracranial recordings. The new developments in functional imaging offer the possibility of localizing the epileptogenic focus noninvasively (PET/SPECT) and mapping cognitive functions (fMRI). Ictal SPECT shows hyperperfusion in the focus and has proved to have better localizing value than interictal PET or SPECT, which show focal hypometabolism or hypoperfusion. Ictal SPECT is useful for deciding on the placement of intracranial electrodes in extratemporal epilepsies, particularly in young children. Functional MRI has proved highly accurate for localizing motor and language networks, thus offering the possibilities of replacing the Wada test (language hemispheric lateralization) and studying postlesional brain plasticity. Despite the difficulties of functional imaging in children owing to the limited cooperation that can be expected, ethical constraints, and poor normative data, SPECT/PET and fMRI provide clinically useful information for presurgical work-up of childhood epilepsies.
