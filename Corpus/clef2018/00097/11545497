A proof of principle for targetry to produce ultra high quantities of 18F-fluoride. The production of 18F-fluoride from a gas target which utilizes the (18)O(p,n)18F reaction is described. Proof-of-principle experiments demonstrate that it is possible to design and build such a target that can be used routinely to produce terabecquerel (curie) quantities of 18F when operated at 100 microA.
