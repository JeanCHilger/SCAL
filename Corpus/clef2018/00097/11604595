Osteoporosis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Osteoporosis is characterized by loss of both bone mass and microarchitectural integrity, resulting in an increased risk of fractures with associated morbidity and mortality. Awareness of this condition is increasing in pediatrics, including pediatric rheumatology. Reduced bone mineral density is now well recognized in children and young adults with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and is multifactorial in origin. The problems of interpretation of bone analysis techniques during childhood and adolescence are highlighted. Recent studies have reported on the use of newer methods of imaging, including quantitative ultrasound and bone single photon emission computed tomography techniques. Attempting to disentangle the relative effects of disease activity, corticosteroids, nutrition, and physical activity in the development of osteoporosis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis is the focus of several studies. Finally, early optimistic reports of the use of bisphosphonates in juvenile idiopathic arthritis are welcome additions to the growing body of literature in this area.
