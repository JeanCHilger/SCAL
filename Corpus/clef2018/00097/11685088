Thoracic imaging of pediatric lymphomas. Lymphoma (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin types) is the most common intra-thoracic neoplasm in the pediatric age group. Diagnostic strategies and treatment approaches for these tumors are largely determined by protocols established by one of the large, multi-institutional cooperative groups. In this paper, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma is discussed in the context of these cooperative group protocols. The basic biology, patterns of primary and metastatic disease distribution, treatment approaches, imaging follow-up, and areas of active research are discussed.
