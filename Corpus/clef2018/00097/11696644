Correlation of tumor and whole-body dosimetry with tumor response and toxicity in refractory neuroblastoma treated with (131)I-MIBG. The purpose of our study was to determine the effect of tumor-targeted radiation in neuroblastoma by correlating administered (131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) activity to tumor and whole-body dosimetry, tumor volume change, overall response, and hematologic toxicity.Eligible patients had MIBG-positive lesions and tumor-free, cryopreserved hematopoietic stem cells. Activity was administered according to body weight and protocol as part of a phase I and phase II study. The whole-body radiation dose was derived from daily 1-m exposure measurements, the tumor self-absorbed radiation dose (TSARD) was determined from scintillation-camera conjugate views, and the tumor volume was measured using CT or MRI.Forty-two patients with refractory neuroblastoma (16 with prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant) received a median activity of 555 MBq/kg (15 mCi/kg) (range, 93-770 MBq/kg) and a median total activity of 11,470 MBq (310 mCi) (range, 3,330-30,969 MBq). The median whole-body radiation dose was 228 cGy (range, 57-650 cGy) and the median TSARD was 3,300 cGy (range, 312-30,500 cGy). Responses among evaluable patients included 16 partial response, 3 mixed response, 14 stable disease, and 9 progressive disease. Higher TSARD values predicted better overall disease response (P < 0.01). The median decrease in tumor volume was 19% 18 tumors decreased, 4 remained stable, and 5 increased in size. Correlation was seen between administered activity per kilogram and whole-body dose as well as hematologic toxicity (assessed by blood platelet and neutrophil count nadir) (P < 0.05). The median whole-body dose was higher in the 11 patients who required hematopoietic stem cell infusion for prolonged neutropenia versus the 31 patients who did not (323 vs. 217 cGyDespite inaccuracies inherent in dosimetry methods, (131)I-MIBG activity per kilogram correlated with whole-body radiation dose and hematologic toxicity. The TSARD by conjugate planar imaging predicted tumor volume decrease and also correlated with overall tumor response.
