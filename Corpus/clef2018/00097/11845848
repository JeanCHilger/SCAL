Can FDG-PET reduce the need for mediastinoscopy in potentially resectable nonsmall cell lung cancer? Few fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) trials have had sufficient patients to adequately evaluate PET for mediastinal staging. We question whether once PET is performed, is mediastinoscopy necessary?We performed a 5-year retrospective analysis of operable patients with known or suspicious NSCLC. Standard PET techniques were used. Inclusion criteria were (1) surgical mediastinal nodal sampling by mediastinoscopy within 31 days of the PET and (2) definitive diagnosis.There were 237 patients who met the evaluation criteria ninety-nine patients with NSCLC and 138 with suspicious lesions (137 men and 100 womenIn NSCLC PET may reduce the necessity for mediastinoscopy when the primary lesion standardized uptake value is less than 2.5 and the mediastinum is PET negative. Accepting this approach in our patient population, the need for mediastinoscopy would have been reduced by 12%.
