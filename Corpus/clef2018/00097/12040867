Nuclear medicine applications in the clinical setting. Imaging studies aid disease staging and management. Over the last decade, advances in instrumentation have improved the accuracy and quality of conventional nuclear medicine studies. In addition, the approval of many new radiopharmaceuticals has helped integrate cutting-edge imaging techniques into the clinical setting. In this article, Drs Middleton and Shell discuss the latest applications of positron emission tomography (PET), radiolabeled antibody imaging, radioisotope lymphatic mapping, and radiolabeled receptor imaging.
