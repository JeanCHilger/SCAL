The value of bone scintigraphy in the evaluation of osteoporotic patients with back pain. We evaluated the role of bone scintigraphy in 60 osteoporotic patients with back pain. Thirty-four had scintigraphic evidence of vertebral fracture and were found to have a significantly lower bone density compared to those without fractures (p = 0.01). In only 14 patients was vertebral fracture considered to be the sole cause of pain with 38 having alternative abnormalities, the most common of which was facet joint disease (n = 30). Results of bone scintigraphy influenced a direct change in management in 18 patients and were able to exclude vertebral fracture as a cause of symptoms in 30. In symptomatic osteoporotic patients the bone scan may be helpful in elucidating the etiology of back pain and can impact on patient management.
