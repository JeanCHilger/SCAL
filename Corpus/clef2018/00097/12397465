Early changes in [18F]FLT uptake after chemotherapy: an experimental study. This study evaluated the use of 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ([(18)F]FLT) for monitoring of the early effects of anticancer chemotherapy on tumour cell proliferation. Cells derived from human oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSC-1) were grown for 2 days and incubated with cisplatin (CDDP), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), methotrexate (MTX) or gemcitabine (GEM) for 4 h. Cultures were incubated with drug doses (CDDP: 0.67, 6.7, 67 micro M 5-FU 15.4, 154, 1,540 micro M
