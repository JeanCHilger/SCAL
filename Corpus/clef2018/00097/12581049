Pancreatic cancer: preliminary experience with sodium iodide fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in Australia. Previous studies of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in pancreatic cancer have used Bismuth Germinate detector systems. This preliminary Australian study aims to confirm the accuracy of FDG-PET in pancreatic cancer using a dedicated sodium iodide (NaI) PET system. Fifteen consecutive patients underwent FDG-PET using a GE QUEST dedicated NaI PET scanner. The indications were the characterization of a pancreatic mass seen on CT or ultrasonographic imaging (nine cases), diagnosis or exclusion of recurrent disease following surgery and adjuvant therapy (four cases) and presurgical staging of primary pancreatic cancer (two cases). The final diagnosis was determined from histology or, when no histology was available, by radiological and clinical follow up. The FDG-PET accurately characterized eight out of nine pancreatic masses (seven were true negative, one was true positive and one was false positive). Of the four cases performed to determine recurrent disease, three were accurately diagnosed (two true negatives and one true positive). In the fourth case, PET accurately detected a liver metastasis but did not detect the local recurrence. Results in the two cases where PET was performed for preoperative staging comprised one true positive and one false negative. Sodium iodide FDG-PET is useful in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, particularly in the presence of a previously detected mass.
