Mild cognitive impairment: Can FDG-PET predict who is to rapidly convert to Alzheimer's disease? Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were assessed, and a metabolic profile associated with conversion to AD at 18-month follow-up was sought. As compared with nonconverters (n = 10), converters (n = 7) had lower fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the right temporoparietal cortex (p = 0.02, corrected for cluster size), without individual overlap. Awaiting replication in an independent sample, these findings suggest that among patients with MCI, fluorodeoxyglucose PET may accurately identify rapid converters.
