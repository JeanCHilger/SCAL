Brain metabolism in the cerebellum and visual cortex correlates with neuropsychological testing in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This study was designed to measure glucose metabolic deficits in areas not typically recognized as abnormal on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to correlate such findings with subtle neuropsychological impairment. FDG-PET scans on 38 AD patients with no clinical evidence of visual, spatial or motor deficits were acquired on the PET HEAD scanner 40 min following the intravenous administration of 115 microCi.kg-1 of FDG. All FDG-PET scans were analysed blindly using a region of interest (ROI) template with regions for the primary visual cortex (PVC), secondary visual cortex (SVC) and cerebellum. Counts from the ROIs of these regions were normalized to whole brain activity and the results were compared with psychometric and neuropsychological measures. A number of significant correlations were found between these structures and various neuropsychological measures (P<0.05). Specifically, there were significant correlations between clock drawing and the cerebellum activity memory and activity in the PVC, SVC and cerebellum
