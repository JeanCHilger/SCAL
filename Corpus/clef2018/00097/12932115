Scatter correction by two-window method standardizes cardiac I-123 MIBG uptake in various gamma camera systems. Heart to mediastinum count ratio (H/M) has been commonly utilized as an indicator of myocardial I-123 MIBG uptake. However, normal ranges of H/M were markedly different among various gamma camera systems. The purpose of this study was to clarify whether scatter correction by two-window method standardizes H/M among various gamma camera systems.Scatter uncorrected and corrected MIBG imaging was acquired in phantom and human studies in combination with low energy high-resolution collimator (LEHR) and medium energy collimator (MEC). For scatter correction, energy window width of 159 keV +/- 10% was applied to main window imaging and 193 keV +/- 9.5% was applied to upper window imaging for scatter correction.In phantom study, a significant difference was observed in uncorrected H/M among three gamma camera systems using LEHR or MEC (2.09 +/- 0.06 vs. 2.58 +/- 0.03 in GCA7200 camera, 2.00 +/- 0.07 vs. 2.42 +/- 0.06 in DS7 camera and 2.16 +/- 0.04 vs. 2.67 +/- 0.07 in Vertex plus camera). However, there was no significant difference in corrected H/M among the three gamma camera systems, either with LEHR or MEC (2.70 +/- 0.07 vs. 2.69 +/- 0.07 in GCA7200 camera, 2.66 +/- 0.08 vs. 2.61 +/- 0.05 in DS7 camera and 2.66 +/- 0.05 vs. 2.61 +/- 0.05 in Vertex plus camera). In human study, uncorrected H/M in DS7 camera with LEHC was significantly lower than that in GCA7200 camera with MEC (1.60 +/- 0.37 vs. 1.85 +/- 0.54, N = 14). In contrast, the difference was insignificant in corrected H/M (2.12 +/- 0.59 vs. 2.16 +/- 0.68). There was a very excellent correlation in corrected H/M between DS7 and GCA7200 cameras (r = 0.991, p < 0.001).This study demonstrated that scatter correction by the two-window method standardizes the H/M in MIBG scintigraphy either with LEHR or MEC. Scatter corrected H/M can be applied to measure a standardized parameter of MIBG uptake in human clinical studies using various gamma camera systems.
