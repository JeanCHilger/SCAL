Computerised axial tomographic scanning in neuropsychiatric disorders. The invention of the computerised tomography scanner - a product of modern bio-medical technology has significantly enhanced the diagnostic capability of physicians in the management of brain disorders such as cerebral atrophy, subdural haematoma, tuberous sclerosis, small calcifications and small intravascular clots. It is also useful in radiotherapy planning. The advantages of the CT scanner over the older conventional techniques, namely pneumoencephalography and arteriography are accuracy, reliability, and simplicity of operation. The major limitation is its diminished ability relative to angiography to precisely detect vascular disease, e.g. aneurysm. Furthermore, it is expensive and not precise in the differentiation of benign from malignant lesions. Despite the development of newer neuro-radiological equipment such as position emission tomography (PET) and nuclear magnetic resonance, the CT scanner remains a most invaluable diagnostic tool and should be given priority consideration in health vote allocation.
