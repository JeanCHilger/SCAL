Assessment of myocardial viability with 201Tl SPET and reinjection technique: a quantitative approach. The definition of viable myocardium after an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is important as it will determine which therapeutic option will be best for the patient. In 201Tl scintigraphy it has been shown that late redistribution (8-24 h) or reinjection may help to identify viable myocardium which does not appear to reperfuse on the 4 h redistribution image. In a prospective study 20 patients with a persistent defect seen on both stress and redistribution images were imaged after reinjection of 201Tl. On visual analysis a total of 180 segments were studied, 85 were normal, 18 reperfused at redistribution and a further nine (in six patients) after reinjection. Bull's-eye analysis at stress demonstrated a mean defect size of 279 pixels, S.D. +/- 74. After redistribution, there was no significant change in mean defect size (227 +/- 96 pixels). At reinjection, there was a significant reduction in mean defect size (189 +/- 107 pixels) (P < 0.05, paired 't'-test). Quantification shows a significant reduction in defect size between stress and reinjection. The use of the 201Tl reinjection technique in patients with a fixed perfusion deficit on stress and redistribution images improves the detection of viable myocardium and is to be preferred to a method of redistribution analysis alone.
