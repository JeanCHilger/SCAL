Synthesis, structure, and dynamics of nickelacarboranes incorporating the [nido-7,9-C(2)B(9)H(11)](2)(-) ligand. The nickelacarboranes [NEt(4)][2-(eta(3)-C(3)H(4)R)-closo-2,1,7-NiC(2)B(9)H(11)] (R = H (1a), Ph (1b)) have been synthesized via reaction between [Na](2)[nido-7,9-C(2)B(9)H(11)] and [Ni(2)(micro-Br)(2)(eta(3)-C(3)H(4)R)(2)] in THF (THF = tetrahydrofuran), followed by addition of [NEt(4)]Cl. Protonation of 1a in the presence of a donor ligand L affords the complexes [2,2-L(2)-closo-2,1,7-NiC(2)B(9)H(11)] (L = CO (2), CNBu(t) (3)). Addition of PEt(3) (1 equiv) to 2 produces quantitative conversion to [2-CO-2-PEt(3)-closo-2,1,7-NiC(2)B(9)H(11)], 4. Species 2-4 exhibit in solution hindered rotation of the NiL(2) fragment with respect to the eta(5)-C(2)B(9) cage unit. Protonation of 1a in the presence of a diene affords the neutral complexes [2-(eta(2):eta(2)-diene)-closo-2,1,7-NiC(2)B(9)H(11)] (diene = C(5)Me(5)H (5), dcp (6), cod (7), nbd (8), chd (9), and cot (10a) dcp = dicyclopentadiene, cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene, nbd = norbornadiene, chd = 1,3-cyclohexadiene, and cot = cyclooctatetraene). Variable temperature (1)H NMR experiments show that the [Ni(diene)] fragments are freely rotating even at 193 K. A small quantity of the di-cage species [2,2'-micro-(1,2:5,6-eta-3,4:7,8-eta-cot)-(closo-2,1,7-NiC(2)B(9)H(11))(2)] (10b) is formed as a coproduct in the synthesis of 10a. This species can be rationally synthesized by protonation of 1a and subsequent addition of 10a.
