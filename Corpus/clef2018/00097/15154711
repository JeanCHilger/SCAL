Irbesartan has a masking effect on dipyridamole stress induced myocardial perfusion defects. The angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist irbesartan is used for the treatment of hypertension, but its anti-ischaemic effect is not yet known. Our aim was to assess the effect of irbesartan administration on the diagnostic yield of 99mTc sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) after dipyridamole stress.Our study group consisted of 13 patients (11 men and two women mean age, 53.3 +/- 10.6 yearsThe mean summed stress score was significantly higher during the STRESS-1 study than the STRESS-2 study (13.2 +/- 7.4 vs. 11 +/- 7.4, P=0.003). The mean size of perfusion defects at stress was significantly larger for the STRESS-1 group than the STRESS-2 group (17.8% +/- 2.85% vs. 15.3% +/- 2.95%, P=0.01).Our study showed that the AT1 receptor blocker irbesartan reduces the extent and severity of 99mTc sestamibi perfusion defects after dipyridamole stress in patients with CAD. Irbesartan may alter coronary blood flow reserve. The continued use of irbesartan before stress myocardial perfusion SPECT has a masking effect on stress induced myocardial perfusion defects. For this reason AT1 receptor blockers must be stopped before stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphic examinations.
