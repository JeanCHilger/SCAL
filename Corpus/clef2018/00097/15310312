Diagnostic role of 99mTc hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime brain single photon emission computed tomography in Sydenham's chorea. The objective of this study was to determine whether technetium-99m hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging is capable of detecting perfusional abnormalities in Sydenham's chorea (SC) patients and contributing to diagnosis of SC.In this study, 17 SC patients were evaluated. HMPAO SPECT was performed on all patients at the acute phase and six of them at the recovery phase. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed to 13 patients. SPECT images of basal ganglia and thalamus were evaluated both visually and by measuring the radioactivity uptakes. Ten subjects constituted the control group.HMPAO SPECT was visually evaluated as indicating hyperperfusion in the basal ganglia and thalamus in 16 patients, and evaluated as normal in one patient at the acute phase. The radioactivity uptakes of basal ganglia and thalamus of the patients at the acute phase were found statistically higher than those of the patients at the recovery phase, and also higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05). A significant difference between the radioactivity uptake of the patients at the recovery phase and those of the control group was not found (P > 0.05). Only one patient did not show any abnormality in both acute and recovery phases. MRI study did not show any abnormality in the basal ganglia and thalamus.It is suggested that brain SPECT can contribute to the diagnosis of SC as an objective tool. Resolving of the hyperperfusion at the recovery phase provides further support for the diagnosis of SC.
