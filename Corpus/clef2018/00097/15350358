The diagnostic accuracy of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT in patients with gynecological malignancies. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of integrated positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET/CT) in patients with gynecological cancer.Fifty-three consecutive patients with gynecologic malignancies were included. The patients were referred to our tertiary center to undergo a PET/CT scan. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of PET/CT were compared with the conventional imaging assessments [CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography (US)].All tested values were higher for PET/CT than those for the conventional modalities: sensitivity 0.97 vs. 0.40, specificity 0.94 vs. 0.65, PPV 0.97 vs. 0.70, and NPV 0.94 vs. 0.34, respectively.PET/CT is a reliable modality for assessing the extent of disease in patients with gynecologic malignancy.
