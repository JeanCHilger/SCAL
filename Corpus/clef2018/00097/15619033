Neutral-pH peritoneal dialysis solution improves peritoneal function and decreases matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Conventional lactate-buffered peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions have several bioincompatible characteristics, including acidic pH, lactate buffer, and the presence of glucose degradation products (GDPs), and these characteristics contribute to membrane dysfunction in PD patients. The formation of GDPs can be reduced by separating the glucose component of the solution from the lactate component during sterilization. This study was carried out to evaluate the clinical effect of dual-chambered neutral-pH PD solution in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).Thirteen CAPD patients using conventional PD solution were enrolled in this study. The fast peritoneal equilibration test (fast PET) was performed periodically before and after treatment with neutral PD solution. The concentration of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in dialysate effluent was measured using 4-h dwelling 2.5% glucose dialysis solution. The patients were categorized into two groups, according to the value of the initial dialysate/plasma (D/P) creatinine ratio: i.e., lower transporters (group L, D/PCr < 0.65) and higher transporters (group H, D/PCr >/= 0.65).The mean D/P creatinine ratio measured by fast PET, was significantly decreased (0.72 +/- 0.09 to 0.60 +/- 0.06 P < 0.03) after treatment with neutral PD solution in group H. The mean glucose level in 4-h dwelling dialysate effluent was elevated (824.6 +/- 195.9 mg/dl to 942.6 +/- 147.8 mg/dlNeutral-pH peritoneal dialysis solution decreased the MMP-2 level in dialysate and improved peritoneal function in high-transporter patients with CAPD treatment.
