(99m)Tc-labeled murine ior C5 monoclonal antibody in colorectal carcinoma patients: pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, absorbed radiation doses to normal organs and tissues and tumor localization. Monoclonal Antibody (mAb) ior C5 is a murine IgG(1) that recognizes the tumor associated antigen (TAA) ior C2, a cell surface O-linked glycoprotein carbohydrate chain not present in most normal tissues and homogeneously expressed in the cytoplasm of normal colon epithelium and heterogeneously expressed in more than 83% of primary colorectal carcinomas. This study was designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and the absorbed radiation doses of (99m)Tc-labeled mAb ior C5 antibody in colorectal tumor patients. Ten patients were administered 3 mg of anti-O-linked glycoprotein carbohydrate chain TAA ior C2 murine monoclonal antibody ior C5 radiolabeled with (99m)Tc activity of 1435.0 +/- 123 MBq by intravenous (i.v.) bolus infusion. Blood and urine samples were collected from 4 out of 10 patients at timed intervals from 10 min and up to 24 h after injection of the (99m)Tc-labeled mAb ior C5 for pharmacokinetic studies. Whole body images were taken in 5 out of 10 patients for quantitative normal organ biodistribution and dosimetry studies and planar anterior and posterior and SPECT images were taken in 5 out of 10 patients for tumor localization. Mean absorbed doses were estimated using the methods developed by the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) committee. The effective dose equivalent (EDE) and effective dose (ED) were calculated as prescribed in International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) publications 30 and 60. Plasma disappearance curves of (99m)Tc-labeled murine antibody ior C5 were best fit by a two-compartment model in all patients with (t(1/2alpha)) of 4.32 +/- 2.18 h and (t(1/2beta) of 32.6 +/- 3.82 h. Among the main target organs, accumulation of the radiolabeled antibody was found in liver (9.38 +/- 0.80%), heart (8.92 +/- 0.94%) and spleen (1.37 +/- 0.30%) at 5 min post-administration. These values were reduced at 24 h to (5.91 +/- 0.73%) and (0.62 +/- 0.22%), respectively, for the heart and spleen and increased to (9.78 +/- 1.99%) for liver. Estimates of radiation absorbed dose to normal organs in rad/mCi administered were: whole body, 0.0181 +/- 0.0017 heart wall, 0.0768 +/- 0.0090
