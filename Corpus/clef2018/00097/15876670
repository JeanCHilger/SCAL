An FDK-like cone-beam SPECT reconstruction algorithm for non-uniform attenuated projections acquired using a circular trajectory. In this paper, Novikov's inversion formula of the attenuated two-dimensional (2D) Radon transform is applied to the reconstruction of attenuated fan-beam projections acquired with equal detector spacing and of attenuated cone-beam projections acquired with a flat planar detector and circular trajectory. The derivation of the fan-beam algorithm is obtained by transformation from parallel-beam coordinates to fan-beam coordinates. The cone-beam reconstruction algorithm is an extension of the fan-beam reconstruction algorithm using Feldkamp-Davis-Kress's (FDK) method. Computer simulations indicate that the algorithm is efficient and is accurate in reconstructing slices close to the central slice of the cone-beam orbit plane. When the attenuation map is set to zero the implementation is equivalent to the FDK method. Reconstructed images are also shown for noise corrupted projections.
