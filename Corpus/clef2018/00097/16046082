Escherichia coli phosphoglucose isomerase can be substituted by members of the PGI family, the PGI/PMI family, and the cPGI family. The Escherichia coli strain Pgi-UdhA, a mutant of the strain MG1655, is deficient in both the pgi gene and the udhA gene and cannot grow on glucose as carbon and energy source. This strain was transformed with different pET-plasmids containing archaeal or bacterial pgi, cpgi or pgi/pmi genes from the three known PGI families (PGI, PGI/PMI, cPGI). Growth could be restored upon plasmid-based expression of pgi, pgi/pmi or cpgi genes indicating that these heterologous proteins can substitute for E. coli PGI. However, complete restoration of the growth rate could not be obtained by any of the PGIs, PGI/PMIs, or cPGIs used. The data indicate that the PGI function of the three PGI families is functionally exchangeable in glycolysis.
