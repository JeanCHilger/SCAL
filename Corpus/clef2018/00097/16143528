Synthesis of potent and selective serotonin 5-HT1B receptor ligands. A series of serotonin 5-HT1B ligands were synthesized and evaluated for their potency and selectivity against other 5-HT receptor subtypes. Many of these new compounds displayed high affinity and selectivity for the 5-HT1B receptor and compound 6c was found to have the in vitro binding profile necessary for development as a PET radioligand.
