Assessment of myocardial metabolism in diabetic rats using small-animal PET: a feasibility study. This feasibility study was undertaken to determine whether kinetic modeling in conjunction with small-animal PET could noninvasively quantify alterations in myocardial perfusion and substrate metabolism in rats.All small-animal PET was performed on either of 2 tomographs. Myocardial blood flow and substrate metabolism were measured in 10 male Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF, fa/fa) and 10 lean littermates (Lean, Fa/+) using (15)O-water, 1-(11)C-glucose, 1-(11)C-acetate, and 1-(11)C-palmitate. Animals were 12.0 +/- 1.4-wk old.Consistent with a type 2 diabetic phenotype, the ZDF animals showed higher plasma hemoglobin A(1c), insulin, glucose, and free fatty acid (FFA) levels than their lean controls. Myocardial glucose uptake (mL/g/min) was not significantly different between the 2 groups. However, higher glucose plasma levels in the ZDF rats resulted in higher myocardial glucose utilization (nmol/g/min) (Lean, 629 +/- 785, vs. ZDF, 1,737 +/- 1,406 P = 0.06). Similarly, myocardial FFA uptake (mL/g/min) was not significantly different between the 2 groups, (Lean, 0.51 +/- 28, vs. ZDF, 0.72 +/- 0.19Noninvasive measurements of myocardial substrate metabolism in ZDF rats using small-animal PET are consistent with the expected early metabolic abnormalities that occur in this well-characterized model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thus, small-animal PET demonstrates significant promise in providing a means to link the myocardial metabolic abnormalities that occur in rat of disease with the human condition.
