Common conditions leading to cattle carcass and offal condemnations at 3 abattoirs in the Western Province of Zambia and their zoonotic implications to consumers. From a total of 32 717 cattle slaughtered, 183 whole carcass condemnations were attributable to 9 diseases and conditions, namely, tuberculosis (TB), cysticercosis, emaciation, generalised lymphadenitis, jaundice, abscesses, moribund, sarcosporidiosis and odour. Bovine TB was the most important cause of condemnations (152/183, 83.1%). Bovine cysticercosis and sarcosporidiosis accounted for 5/183 (2.7%) and 8/183 (4.4%), respectively, while each of the remaining conditions contributed less. Among the many conditions responsible for offal/organ condemnations were fascioliasis, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, hydatidosis and TB. In terms of number and weight, Fasciola gigantica infections made livers and lungs the most condemned offals (20.1% and 0.7%, respectively). Hydatidosis was the cause of 0.9% lung and 0.1% liver losses. Cysticercus bovis contributed to only 0.05% of all inspected tongues, hearts, and heads. TB was very rare in heads (0.01%). The financial impact of whole carcasses and offals condemned during the study period was enormous and deprived livestock farmers of the much needed revenue and consumers of protein sources. Much or all of the condemned material that could have been useful was wasted by not being retrieved for conversion to processed meat, bone meal or pet food. Failure to detect lesions of potential zoonotic diseases at slaughter poses a health risk to consumers especially when meat is eaten undercooked.
