Preclinical evaluation of novel organometallic 99mTc-folate and 99mTc-pteroate radiotracers for folate receptor-positive tumour targeting. The folate receptor (FR) is a valuable tumour marker, since it is frequently overexpressed on various cancer types. The purpose of the present study was to pre-clinically evaluate novel site-specifically modified (99m)Tc(CO)(3) folate (gamma-derivative 4, alpha-derivative 5) and pteroate (6) conjugates for FR targeting.The (99m)Tc(CO)(3) radiotracers 4-6 were prepared by a kit-like procedure. In vitro characterisation (K (D) and B (max)) of the radiotracers was performed with FR-positive KB cells. Tissue distribution was studied in tumour-bearing mice. SPECT/CT experiments were performed with a dedicated small animal SPECT/CT scanner.The complexes 4-6 were formed in high yields (>92%). Binding constants of the radiotracers (K (D) in nM: 4: 2.09 5: 2.51Radiotracers 4-6 are the first (99m)Tc(CO)(3) tracers prepared via a kit formulation which exhibit full biological activity in vitro and in vivo. Folate derivatives 4 and 5 revealed significantly better pharmacokinetic properties than the pteroate derivative 6. Promising pre-clinical SPECT results warrant further assessment of (99m)Tc(CO)(3) radiofolates for detection of FR-positive tumours.
