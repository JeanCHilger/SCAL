Chemical restraint-reversal with medetomidine and atipamezole in veterinary small animal practice: a survey on the opinions of the dog owners and veterinarians. The opinions of animal owners and practising veterinarians concerning a new restraint-reversal medication (medetomidine-atipamezole) for dogs were obtained by two questionnaires in connection with a clinical study. Four alternative answers to each statement question scored as "completely agree", "somewhat agree", "somewhat disagree" and "completely disagree". The questionnaires were completed by 21 veterinarians and 245 dog owners. The overall response to the treatment was clearly positive. Both groups had a favourable attitude towards drug use with mean combined scores (from 1 to 4 4 = most favourable) of 48.1 (max 56) for the dog owners and 39.2 (max 52) for the veterinarians. Only a little information was gained about the background of negative sentiments. Some pet owners (19%) opposed to medication on a priori grounds, some (26%) reacted strongly to the dizziness of their animals and some owners (21%) complained because of general anxiety before, during and after their pets were treated.
