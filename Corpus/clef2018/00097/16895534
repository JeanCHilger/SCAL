Evaluation of Tc-99m-tetrofosmin single-photon emission computed tomography for detection of chronic exertional compartment syndrome of the leg. Chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) of the leg is a common, painful condition related to exercise and associated with increased muscle compartment pressure (CP). Invasive methods are currently the method of choice for diagnosing the condition. We investigated the use of Tc-99m-tetrofosmin perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as a diagnostic tool compared with the gold standard, muscle CP measurement. In 14 subjects perfusion SPECT and CP were measured before and immediately after exercise leading to pain in the lower legs. Six subjects had increased pressures indicating the presence of CECS. In three (50%) of these muscular hypoperfusion was observed by perfusion SPECT. In eight subjects with normal CPs SPECT suggested muscular hypoperfusion. Because of the low diagnostic rates, sensitivity 50% and specificity 63%, Tc-99m-tetrofosmin perfusion SPECT seems not to be a useful method for diagnosing CECS.
