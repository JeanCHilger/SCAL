No association between XRCC1 and XRCC3 gene polymorphisms and breast cancer risk: Iowa Women's Health Study. Genetic variation in DNA repair may contribute to differences in the susceptibility of several cancers. We evaluated two polymorphisms in the base excision repair pathway (BER) (XRCC1 Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln) and one polymorphism in the double strand DNA repair pathway (XRCC3The association was analyzed in a nested case control study of 460 breast cancer cases and 324 cancer-free controls within the Iowa Women's Health Cohort. DNA was obtained from blood samples or paraffin embedded tissues (PET) and all samples were genotyped by one of three genotyping platforms-PCR-RFLP, PCR-INVADER, or Sequenom.None of the three polymorphisms studied were significantly associated with breast cancer risk (XRCC1: Arg194Trp (OR=1.21, 95% CI: 0.78-1.88) Arg399Gln (OR=1.20, 95% CI: 0.80-1.79)These results suggest that independently these polymorphisms of XRCC1 and XRCC3 genes do not contribute significantly to the genetic susceptibility of breast cancer.
