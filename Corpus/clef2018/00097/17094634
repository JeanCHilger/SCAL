Construction of prokaryotic expression vector for Trichomonas vaginalis silent information regulator 2 and its expression. Total RNA was isolated from Trichomonas vaginalis and Tv-Sir2-like cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into pGEM-T Easy plasmid. A fragment of Tv-Sir2-like cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector pET-41b and expressed in E.coli BL21 with induction of IPTG. The full-length of Tv-Sir2-like cDNA was cloned and sequenced. The prokaryotic expression system of pET-41b/Tv-Sir2-like was constructed. The fusion protein of Tv-Sir2-like was expressed in E. coli BL21, occupying 30% of the total bacterial protein after being induced by IPTG for 5 h. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the fusion protein was about Mr 59000. The recombinant protein of Tv-Sir2-like is efficiently expressed in E. coli BL21.
