Assessment of 18F-FDG-leukocyte imaging to monitor rejection after pancreatic islet transplantation. We sought to investigate the feasibility of 18F-FDG-leukocyte imaging to detect islet rejection.Two thousand Sprague-Dawley (SD, syngeneic group) or Lewis (allogeneic group) islet equivalents were intraportally injected into SD rat recipients. Four and 7 days after transplantation, 10(8) 18F-FDG-labeled splenocytes were injected into the jugular vein. Splenocytes were harvested from na√Øve or sensitized (12 days after intraportal transplantation of 2000 Lewis IEQ) SD rats. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was started 5 minutes after splenocyte infusion and performed hourly for 4 hours.One hour after splenocyte injection, FDG was mainly detected in the heart and lungs. It was then further distributed to other organs, and from the second hour, the highest tracer concentration was located in the abdomen. Liver FDG uptake was similar between syngeneic, allogeneic, and sensitized allogeneic groups at 4 and 7 days after islet transplantation.No islet rejection was detected by 18F-FDG-leukocyte imaging. The amount of transplanted tissue was only few millilitres and the additional related inflammation in case of rejection is small and difficult to detect. The liver showed a relatively high spontaneous tracer uptake the related background prevented detection of a potential increase in tracer uptake in cases of islet rejection.
