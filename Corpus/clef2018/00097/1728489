Regional oxidative metabolism in patients after recovery from reperfused anterior myocardial infarction. Relation to regional blood flow and glucose uptake. Enhanced uptake of the glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in relation to flow has been proposed as an accurate method of identifying viable myocardium. The evaluation of myocardial oxidative metabolism could be an alternate way to identify reversible injury. The aim of the present study was to investigate in patients with reperfused anterior infarction whether differences in regional oxidative metabolism exist among regions with and without flow-metabolism mismatch.Fifteen patients with reperfused anterior myocardial infarction were studied between 2 weeks and 3 months after the acute event. Regional myocardial blood flow (13N-ammonia three-compartment model), oxidative metabolism (11C-acetateIn patients with reperfused myocardial infarction studied between 2 weeks and 3 months after the acute event, regional oxidative metabolism is reduced in proportion to residual myocardial blood flow and does not differ significantly among similarly hypoperfused segments with and without flow-metabolism mismatch.
