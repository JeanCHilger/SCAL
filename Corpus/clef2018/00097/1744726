Performance standards in positron emission tomography. A standard set of performance measurements is proposed for use with positron emission tomographs. This set of measurements has been developed jointly by the Computer and Instrumentation Council of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. The measurements include tests of spatial resolution, scatter fraction, sensitivity, count rate losses and randoms, uniformity, scatter correction, attenuation correction, and count rate linearity correction.
