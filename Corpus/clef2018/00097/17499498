Radiological staging of colorectal liver metastases. Rapid advances in imaging technology have improved the detection, characterization and staging of colorectal liver metastases. Multi-modality imaging approach is usually the more useful in staging colorectal liver metastases. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) remains the main imaging modality for preoperative planning, lesion detection and tumour surveillance. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast enhanced ultrasonography (US) are invaluable in problem solving for characterization indeterminate lesions, while contrast enhanced intra-operative ultrasound (CE-IOUS) may be the new gold standard staging tool prior to liver resection. Ultimately, the imaging strategy has to be tailored to the clinical situation to obtain the most relevant information for optimal use of available imaging resources.
