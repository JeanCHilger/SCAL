The short PET in pediatrics. The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) is a 4-hour procedure that is recommended to be performed in children receiving peritoneal dialysis to assist in prescription management. While a shortened version of the PET has been used in adults and reliably characterizes peritoneal membrane transport capacity, no similar experience with children has been reported.Retrospective evaluation of 2-hour and 4-hour PET data obtained from 20 children receiving chronic peritoneal dialysis in a single center. Characterization of membrane transport capacity was based on evaluation of serum and dialysate samples used to determine the dialysate-to-plasma ratio (D/P) of creatinine and the ratio of dialysate glucose to baseline dialysate glucose (D/D(0)). Patient values were compared to pediatric reference data.In all 20 patients, characterization of peritoneal membrane transport capacity using 2-hour D/P and D/D(0) results was identical to that determined using 4-hour data for the same solute. While the creatinine- and glucose-based characterization was discrepant in 14 of 20 patients, in only 1 case was the discrepancy of more than a single transport category.These results support the accuracy of a short PET in children, a procedure that should prove beneficial in terms of patient and staff time.
