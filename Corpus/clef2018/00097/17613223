Imaging of peripheral nerve tumors. Recent advancements in the field of imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging, have improved the way peripheral nerve tumors are diagnosed, monitored, and treated both medically and surgically. When combined with the all-important clinical evaluation and electrodiagnostic studies, imaging permits a clinician to accomplish the following: identify the size, shape, location, and distribution of mass lesions infer the risks in resecting a mass lesion by displaying its relationship to nearby nerve fascicles
