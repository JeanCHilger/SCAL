Active myocarditis in a patient with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection. Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (CAEBV) infection is characterized by chronic or recurrent infectious mononucleosis-like symptoms and the prognosis of CAEBV infection is quite poor. The incidence of myocarditis as a complication of EBV infection is not so high and it is unusual that heart failure appears as the initial symptom. However, it is very important to detect and treat chronic active myocarditis in the early phase of CAEBV infection because chronic active myocarditis disorganizes and decreases cardiomyocytes, resulting in the progression to heart failure. We report a case of a 45-year-old man with CAEBV infection for 5 years. Echocardiography revealed moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild pericardial effusion. Endomyocardial biopsies demonstrated massive lymphocytic infiltration with adjacent myocytolysis and necrosis of cardiomyocytes suggesting active myocarditis. Immunohistological analysis of biopsies revealed that the infiltrating cells were mainly T lymphocytes. And some of the infiltrating cells showed a positive signal for the EBV-encoded small nuclear RNA by in situ hybridization. Positron emission tomography using (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) performed revealed increased uptake of (18)F-FDG of whole left ventricular wall with mild heterogeneity.
