Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis due to a relapsing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed by positron emission tomography. Glomerulonephritis rarely appears associated with Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). We present a patient with a relapse of a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which first presented as nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). This case report discusses the unusual association of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, as well as the crucial role of positron emission tomography in detecting the relapsing lymphoma.
