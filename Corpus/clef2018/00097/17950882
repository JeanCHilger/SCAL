Advanced imaging for veterinary cancer patients. This article presents an update on the recent advances made in veterinary advanced imaging specifically with regard to cross-sectional modalities (CT and MRI) and nuclear medicine (positron emission tomography [PET] and PET/CT). A brief summary of technical improvements and a review of recent literature are included to provide an overview of the progress made in this important element of the practicing veterinary oncologist's repertoire. An in-depth summary of PET is also included to introduce the technical aspects and potential clinical and research applications of this novel imaging modality in veterinary medicine.
