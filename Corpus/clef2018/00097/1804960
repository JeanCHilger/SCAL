The influence of induced hypocapnia and sleep on the endogenous respiratory rhythm in humans. 1. Ventilation has been studied during hypocapnia produced by passive mechanical ventilation in ten normal human subjects. 2. During wakefulness, disconnection of the ventilator led to inconsistent apnoea of only brief duration. During sleep, at a similar degree of hypocapnia, disconnection of the ventilator led more consistently to apnoea which was also of much longer duration the deeper the sleep stage, the longer the apnoea. 3. The resumption of breathing during sleep could precede or follow arousal or be unaccompanied by arousal
