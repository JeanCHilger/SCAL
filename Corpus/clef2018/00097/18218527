Volume rendering of 3D medical ultrasound data using direct feature mapping. The authors explore the application of volume rendering in medical ultrasonic imaging. Several volume rendering methods have been developed for X-ray computed tomography (X-CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Limited research has been done on applications of volume rendering techniques in medical ultrasound imaging because of a general lack of adequate equipment for 3D acquisitions. Severe noise sources and other limitations in the imaging system make volume rendering of ultrasonic data a challenge compared to rendering of MRI and X-CT data. Rendering algorithms that rely on an initial classification of the data into different tissue categories have been developed for high quality X-CT and MR-data. So far, there is a lack of general and reliable methods for tissue classification in ultrasonic imaging. The authors focus on volume rendering methods which are not dependent on any classification into different tissue categories. Instead, features are extracted from the original 3D data-set, and projected onto the view plane. The authors found that some of these methods may give clinically useful information which is very difficult to get from ordinary 2D ultrasonic images, and in some cases renderings with very fine structural details. The authors have applied the methods to 3D ultrasound images from fetal examinations. The methods are now in use as clinical tools at the National Center of Fetal Medicine in Trondheim, Norway.
