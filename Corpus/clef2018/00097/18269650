Evaluation of clinical significance of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in superficial squamous cell carcinomas of the thoracic esophagus. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is used for pre-treatment staging and evaluation of response to pre-operative therapy in advanced thoracic esophageal cancers. To evaluate the clinical significance of PET diagnosis of superficial thoracic esophageal cancers, FDG-PET was conducted preoperatively in 41 patients with such cancers without pre-operative therapy. We compared the PET diagnosis with clinicopathological findings with respect to both the primary tumor and lymph node (LN) metastasis. Of the 41 superficial thoracic esophageal cancers, 21 (51.2%) were PET positive for primary tumors. Although tumor length and histological type did not correlate with FDG uptake by primary tumors, non-flat (elevated or depressed) tumors showed significantly stronger FDG uptake than flat ones. Of 28 tumors infiltrating the deep submucosal layer, 19 (67.9%) were PET positive, while only two (15.4%) of 13 tumors infiltrating only the mucosa or shallow submucosal layer were PET positive. Manova identified FDG uptake as the only independent risk factor for deep submucosal invasion (odds ratio, 7.407 P = 0.0279). In 13 patients with pathological LN metastasis, although no LN metastasis was detected by FDG-PET, FDG uptake by the primary tumors was the only risk factor for LN metastasis (P = 0.0318). PET-negative tumors tended to reflect longer disease-free survival than PET-positive tumors, although this was not significant. FDG-PET is useful for detecting tumors infiltrating the middle or deep submucosal layer (sm2/sm3), and for predicting LN metastasis in patients with superficial thoracic esophageal cancers. FDG-PET is helpful for decision-making regarding treatment of such patients.
