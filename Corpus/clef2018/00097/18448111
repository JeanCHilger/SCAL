Plasma treatments of PET meshes for fuel-water separation applications. Sulphur hexafluoride (SF(6)) plasma treatments and hexamethyl disiloxane (HMDSO) plasma polymerisation were performed on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) meshes and the resulting wettability against liquids having very different surface tensions were investigated at the light of a possible use of the materials in the fuel/water separation technology. Surface modification of the meshes owing to HMDSO plasma polymerisation followed by SF(6) plasma treatment was also investigated. Hydrophobic performances were characterised refining the conventional Wilhelmy dynamic contact angle (DCA) technique, using several reference solutions having the surface tension values between 20-72 mN/m. Measurements of the water intrusion pressure (WIP) of the treated samples were also performed. Surface modifications on the plasma treated meshes were investigated by means of Fourier-transform infrared absorption spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. SF(6) and HMDSO plasma treatments decrease the surface energy of the PET meshes, lowering the liquid surface tension at which the wettable/unwettable transition occurs and increasing the WIP. Moreover, an increase in hydrophobic performances was achieved with HMDSO plasma polymerisation followed by SF(6) plasma treatment.
