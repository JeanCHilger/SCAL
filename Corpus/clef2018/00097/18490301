Prognostic value of left atrial size in chronic kidney disease. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have high cardiovascular risk. Although stress imaging provides accurate risk estimation in this population, it is unknown if combinatorial cardiac imaging adds incremental value.We performed transthoracic echocardiography and stress single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to assess their value in predicting late cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in 200 patients with creatinine clearance <60 mL/min without a history of coronary heart disease. During a median follow-up duration of 3.7 (3.5-4.0) years, there were 25 deaths because of CVD. Older age, abnormal SPECT, and increased indexed left atrial (LA) diameter were associated with CVD mortality on univariate analysis with P = 0.007, 0.01, and 0.004, respectively. In multivariable analysis, indexed LA diameter >24 mm/m(2) was independently predictive of CVD mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 2.75, confidence interval (CI) 1.14-6.59], but abnormal SPECT was not. Each mm/m(2) increase in indexed atrial diameter was associated with an HR 1.20 (95% CI 1.06-1.37).In patients with CKD, the indexed LA diameter predicts CVD mortality independent of an abnormal SPECT result. Consideration should be given to this simple measurement as a prognostic tool in this population.
