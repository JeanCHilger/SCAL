Scintimammography with a high resolution dedicated breast camera in comparison with SPECT/CT in primary breast cancer detection. We evaluated the usefulness of planar scintimammography (SM) with a high resolution dedicated breast camera (DBC) in comparison with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) in primary breast cancer detection.A consecutive series of 157 patients with breast lesions suspicious for cancer at conventional diagnostic procedures were studied with both DBC planar SM and SPECT/CT using [99mTc]tetrofosmin as radiotracer. Scintigraphic data have been related with definitive histopathological findings in all cases.Breast cancer was ascertained in 127/157 patients and benign disease in the remaining 30 cases, with a total of 140 carcinomas and 33 benign lesions. DBC planar SM detected 95.7% of overall carcinomas, while SPECT/CT 90.7% (P<0.01). In =or<10 mm carcinomas, sensitivity was 89.1% for DBC planar SM and 78.3% for SPECT/CT (P<0.05) in carcinomas >10 mm the corresponding values were 98.9% and 96.8%, respectively. Specificity value was 87.9% for both proceduresDBC planar SM proved a useful diagnostic method in primary breast cancer detection, showing significantly higher sensitivity and accuracy values than SPECT/CT, especially in small size carcinomas. Thus, DBC planar SM should be preferred, although SPECT/CT, given its high performance, could represent a useful alternative when DBC is not available. Moreover, SPECT/CT, but not DBC, can contribute to providing information on axillary lymph node status.
