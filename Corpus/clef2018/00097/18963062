Laboratory data-acquisition capabilities of microcomputers. Some microcomputers have been evaluated in terms of their features and capabilities for basic laboratory data-acquisition tasks. The systems studied include the SDK-80 (8080), SDK-85 (8085), and KIM-1 (6502) single-board microcomputers, and the PET consumer/hobby-market microcomputer. Data-acquisition software benchmarks were tested on all the systems, and inexpensive analogue-to-digital and digital-to-analogue hardware subsystems were developed for the PET. The acquisition rates for 10-bit data under machine-language control range from 15 to 25 kHz, but under high-level (BASIC) language-control drop to about 100 Hz.
