What are the preoperative factors that can determine the presence of metastases in other axillary nodes in breast cancer when the sentinel node is positive? To determine whether preoperative factors, such as size of metastases in the sentinel lymph node (SLN), number of positive SLNs (1, >1), tumoral grade, lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and tumoral size can predict the presence of metastases in non-SLNs, when the SLN is positive.The study population was 1 146 breast cancer patients. Lymphadenectomy was performed in 150. Three groups of patients were established depending on the size of the metastases in SLNs: group A: <2 mm group B: 2 < or =GC < or =5 mmTen percent of group A, 28% of group B and 52% of group C presented non-SLN metastases. Patients with >1 positive-SLN presented significantly more non-SLN metastases than those with only one positive-SLN 56% of patients with LVI presented non-SLN metastases versus 26% of those without LVI. The tumoral grade and size did not seem to have any influence on the number of patients with non-SLN metastases. The number of positive-SLNs and size of metastases were statistically associated with the presence of metastases.In this study population, the probability of finding non-SLN metastases was statistically related to the size of the SLN metastases and the number of positive-SLNs.
