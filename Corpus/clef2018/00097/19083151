Functional magnetic resonance imaging in episodic cluster headache. We have investigated the cerebral activation centre in four patients with episodic cluster headache (CH) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (f-MRI). The patients underwent MRI scans for anatomical and functional data acquisition in the asymptomatic state, during a headache attack and after subcutaneous administration of sumatriptan. Anatomical images were acquired by means of 3D-MPRAGE sequences and f-MRI images were obtained by means of echo-planar imaging. Data was analysed using the BrainVoyager QX version 1.7.81 software package. In all patients, the data showed significant hypothalamic activation of the hypothalamus ipsilateral to the pain side, attributable to a headache attack. Overall, we have demonstrated the anatomical location of central nervous system activation by means the first f-MRI study in CH patients. f-MRI offers a good balance of spatial and temporal resolution, and this method of study appears appropriate for investigating the pathogenetic aspects of primary headaches. Positron emission tomography and f-MRI may be regarded as little or no importance in a clinical context, they do, however, offer great potential for the exploration of headache physiopathology and the effects of pharmacological treatment.
