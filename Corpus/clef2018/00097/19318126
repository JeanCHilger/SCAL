Developing new molecular imaging probes for PET. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a fully translational molecular imaging technique that requires specific probes radiolabelled with short-lived positron emitting radionuclides. This review discusses relevant methods which are applied throughout the different steps in the development of new PET probes for in vivo visualization of specific molecular targets related to diagnosis or important for drug development.
