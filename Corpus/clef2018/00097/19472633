Automated versus manual detection of left ventricular wall motion abnormalities by gated blood pool SPECT. The purpose of this investigation was to describe the rationale and implementation of new totally automated algorithms to compute global and regional left ventricular (LV) function measurements from blood pool (BP) gated SPECT data and to test the hypothesis that automated calculations are as accurate as manual calculations for detecting global and regional LV wall motion abnormalities when compared to independent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) measurements. From an Institutional Review Board approved retrospective review of data for 43 patients (age 58 +/- 13 years 82% males
