Gauche-trans transitions in amorphous polymers under annealing: lattice model and polarized light scattering. The driving force of density fluctuation of amorphous polymer films under annealing processes was evaluated synthetically in terms of thermodynamics on the basis of the logarithmic light intensity as a function of annealing time. The time dependence of ln(I) of polyethylene (terephthalate) (PET) as an example for characterizing an amorphous state was classified into three stages: the first stage (stage I), where ln(I) showed insignificant changes with time the second stage (stage II), where ln(I) increased linearly
