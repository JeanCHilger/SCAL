The characteristics, biodistribution and bioavailability of a chitosan-based nanoparticulate system for the oral delivery of heparin. Heparin is a potent anticoagulant however, it is poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we developed a nanoparticle (NP) system shelled with chitosan (CS) for oral delivery of heparin
