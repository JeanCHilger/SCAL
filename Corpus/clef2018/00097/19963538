Comparison of some reversible watermarking methods in application to medical images. Several reversible watermarking schemes have been proposed for images of sensitive content, like medical imaging, for which any modification may affect their interpretation. In this work, we distinguish these methods according to the way watermark insertion is conducted: additive and substitutive. Some of these approaches have been tested on different sets of medical images issued from three distinct modalities: Magnetic Resonance Images, Positron Emission Tomography and Ultrasound Imaging. Comparison analysis has been conducted with respect to several aspects including data hiding capacity and image quality preservation. Experimental results show different limitations which depend on the watermark approach but also on image modality specificities.
