Single photon emission computed tomography imaging of brain tumors. Five radiotracers may be used for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of brain tumors, namely technetium 99m pertechnetate, iodine-123 amphetamine derivatives, 99mTc-hexamethyl propylene amine oxime (HMPAO), thallium 201, and 123I alpha methyl tyrosine. Of these, pertechnetate may be considered as an "historical" procedure in brain tumors. However, there may be some equivocal cases in computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, where this procedure may still be used. In 1981, 123I isopropyl amphetamine was first used in brain tumors. Further studies showed, however, that IMP is not a useful tool for brain imaging in tumorous lesions. In 1986, 99mTc HMPAO appeared on the European market as a new tumor imaging agent. Some useful clinical results were obtained in patients before and after chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Thallium-201 was incidentally noted to accumulate in tumors. Using a threshold index, this agent can be used to distinguish low-versus high-grade lesions. The most promising agent for brain tumor SPECT is 123I-alpha methyl tyrosine, which shows potential to evaluate therapeutic procedures in brain tumors and may improve the differentiation between abscess and glioblastoma. The most promising aspect is the differentiation of tumor recurrences and scar tissue after brain surgery.
