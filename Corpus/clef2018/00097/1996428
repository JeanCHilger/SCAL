Studies of central nervous system disorders with single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography: evolution over the past 2 decades. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was introduced in the 1960s to detect breakdowns in the blood-brain barrier and was replaced by x-ray computed tomography in the mid-1970s. The development of the deoxyglucose (DG) technique to measure regional cerebral glucose metabolism by employing either autoradiography, using 14CDG, or positron emission tomography (PET), using 18FDG, added a major dimension to the investigation of brain function. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the FDG-PET technique was widely used to examine a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. It soon became apparent that functional imaging was more sensitive than anatomic imaging in detecting abnormalities of the brain related to aging, dementia, tumors, seizures, cerebral vascular accidents, and psychiatric problems. Because of its complexity and the cost involved, PET was used in a limited number of centers in the United States. However, the success of PET resulted in the resurgence of interest in SPECT as an alternative technology after almost a decade. This became possible because of the synthesis of iodine 123- and technetium 99m-labeled radiopharmaceuticals to determine regional cerebral blood flow. Since blood flow and metabolism are coupled in most pathological states, patterns of abnormality noted on SPECT were similar to those seen on PET in many disorders. Since the introduction of high resolution SPECT imaging instruments, the role of SPECT has been further enhanced. The successful synthesis of both positron and single emitting radioligands to image dopamine and other receptors has started a new era in neurosciences and will have a far-reaching impact on the day-to-day practice of neuropsychiatry.
