Computational studies on response and binding selectivity of fluorescence sensors. Using a computational strategy based on density functional theory calculations, we successfully designed a fluorescent sensor for detecting Zn(2+) [J. Phys. Chem. B 2006, 110, 22991-22994]. In this work, we report our further studies on the computational design protocol for developing Photoinduced Electron Transfer (PET) fluorescence sensors. This protocol was applied to design a PET fluorescence sensor for Zn(2+) ions, which consists of anthracene as the fluorophore connected to pyridine as the receptor through dimethylethanamine as the linker. B3LYP and time-dependent B3LYP calculations were performed with the basis set 6-31G(d,p), 6-31+G(d,p), 6-311G(d,p), and 6-311+G(d,p). The calculated HOMO and LUMO energies of the fluorophore and receptor using all four basis sets show that the relative energy levels remain unchanged. This indicates that any of these basis sets can be used in calculating the relative molecular orbital (MO) energy levels. Furthermore, the relative MO energies of the independent fluorophore and receptor are not altered when they are linked together, which suggests that one can calculate the MO energies of these components separately and use them as the MO energies of the free sensor. These are promising outcomes for the computational design of sensors, though more case studies are needed to further confirm these conclusions. The binding selectivity studies indicate that the predicted sensor can be used for Zn(2+) even in the presence of the divalent cation, Ca(2+).
