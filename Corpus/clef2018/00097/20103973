Fluvastatin attenuates diabetes-induced cardiac sympathetic neuropathy in association with a decrease in oxidative stress. Increased oxidative stress might contribute to diabetic (DM) neuropathy, so the effects of long-term treatment with fluvastatin (FL) on myocardial oxidative stress and cardiac sympathetic neural function were investigated in diabetic rats.FL (10 mg . kg(-1) . day(-1), DM-FL) or vehicle (DM-VE) was orally administered for 2 weeks to streptozotocin-induced DM rats. Cardiac oxidative stress was determined by myocardial 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)) and NADPH oxidase subunit p22(phox) mRNA expression. Sympathetic neural function was quantified by autoradiography using (131)I- and (125)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG). FL did not affect plasma glucose levels but remarkably decreased PGF(2alpha) levels compared with DM-VE rats (13.8+/-9.2 vs 175.0+/-93.9 ng/g tissue), although PGF(2alpha) levels were below the detection limit in non-DM rats. FL significantly reduced myocardial p22(phox) mRNA expression. Cardiac (131)I-MIBG uptake was lower in DM-VE rats than in non-DM rats, but the decrease was attenuated in DM-FL rats (1.31+/-0.08, 1.88+/-0.22, and 1.58+/-0.18 %kg dose/g, respectively, P<0.01). Cardiac MIBG clearance was not affected by the induction of DM or by FL, indicating that the reduced MIBG uptake in DM rats might result from impaired neural function.FL ameliorates cardiac sympathetic neural dysfunction in DM rats in association with attenuation of increased myocardial oxidative stress.
