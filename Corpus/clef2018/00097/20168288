Comparison of (68)Ga-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotide and (18)F-fluoro-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography in neuroendocrine tumor patients. (68)Ga-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotide positron emission tomography ((68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET) and (18)F-fluoro-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine PET ((18)F-DOPA PET) are emerging modalities for imaging of neuroendocrine tumors. This study reports our initial experiences with these two PET modalities on initial diagnosis, staging and restaging in NET patients.Fifteen patients with NET underwent both (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC and (18)F-DOPA PET as well as computed tomography (CT). Image findings were compared on a patient-basis (pathological uptake: yes/no) as well as on a lesion-basis. Contrast-enhanced CT and histological follow-up served as gold standard. Furthermore, imaging results were matched with tumor marker levels and quantitative tracer uptake by the tumor lesions.When comparing (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC and (18)F-DOPA PET, each modality showed a sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 100% on a patient-based analysis. (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET and (18)F-DOPA PET showed equal findings in 7 out of 15 patients and disagreement in 8 patients. (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC revealed more metastases than (18)F-DOPA PET in 6 patients, while (18)F-DOPA PET detected more metastases than (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC in 4 patients. By (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET, 208 malignant lesions were detected, while by (18)F-DOPA only 86 lesions were found, and in CT 124, respectively.(68)Ga-DOTA-TOC and (18)F-DOPA PET are useful tools in the detection and staging of NET lesions. Our initial results allow the conclusion that (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET may have a stronger clinical impact in NET patients, as it does not only offer diagnostic information, but is decisive for the further treatment management, i. e. PRRT, as well.
