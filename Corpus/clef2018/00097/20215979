FDG PET-CT in cervical cancer: relationship between primary tumor FDG uptake and metastatic potential. We retrospectively evaluated the relationships between primary tumor F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake measured as the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) and local extension, and nodal or distant metastasis in patients with cervical cancer on pretreatment FDG positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT).Forty-three patients (mean age, 55.14 years range, 34-90 years) with cervical cancer who underwent FDG PET-CT scans for staging before the initiation of treatment were included in the study. Primary tumor SUV(max) was calculatedThe average SUV(max) was 9.6+/-2.6 and 19.9+/-4.9 in the low and high SUV groups, respectively. In the low SUV group, six patients (29%) had a local extension, eight (38%) had pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph node metastasis, and one had distant organ metastasis (4.7%). In the high SUV group, 10 patients (45%) had a local extension, 16 (73%) had pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph node metastasis, and two (9%) had distant organ metastases. There was a significant difference in the lymph node metastasis rate between the two groups (P<0.05), but differences in local extension and distant organ metastasis were not statistically significant (P>0.05). In addition, there was a moderate correlation between SUV(max) and clinical tumor stages (r=0.40, P=0.0075).Higher primary tumor FDG uptake predicts higher nodal metastatic potential in cervical cancer patients. Patients with higher SUV(max) in cervical tumor may need a close follow-up because of their higher metastatic potential.
