Diagnostic imaging of lymphomas. Computed tomography (CT) is currently the most commonly tool used for staging malignant lymphoma at diagnosis and restaging the disease after treatment. However functional imaging and mainly the 18-F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) outperforms CT in 18-FDG avid lymphomas. PET is now included in the new international response criteria and allows a better assessment of remaining residual mass after treatment. Early TEP result is an independent prognosis factor in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. Ongoing clinical trials are now testing risk adapted strategies based on early TEP results in these two lymphoma subtypes.
