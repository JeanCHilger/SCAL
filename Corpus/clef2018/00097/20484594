Endogenous regulation of human Schlemm's canal cell volume by nitric oxide signaling. There is a time-course correlation between nitric oxide (NO)-induced decreases in trabecular meshwork (TM) cell volume and NO-induced increases in outflow facility. The Schlemm's canal (SC) cells may also provide resistance to aqueous humor outflow therefore, this study tests the involvement of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and NO signaling pathway and the BK(Ca)-channel in mediating SC cell volume decreases.Cell volume was measured in low-passage human SC cells using calcein AM fluorescent dye images were captured with a confocal microscope, and data were quantified using NIH ImageJ software.Inhibition of endogenous NOS resulted in a 7% increase in SC cell volume. Exposure of SC cells to DETA-NO resulted in a 12% to 16% decrease in cell volume that was abolished by the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) (5 μM), the protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor (RP)-8-Br-PET-cGMP-S (50 μM), and the high-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BK(Ca) channel) inhibitor iberiotoxin (50 nM). Hypertonic media significantly decreased SC cell volume by 14%, whereas hypotonic media significantly increased cell volume by 11.2%.These data suggest that endogenous NOS regulates steady state cell volume and the involvement of the NOS/NO/sGC/cGMP/PKG pathway and the BK(Ca)-channel in mediating NO-induced reductions in SC cell volume. These decreases in cell volume correlated with the time-course for NO-induced increases in outflow facility, suggesting that the NO-induced reduction in SC cell volume may also influence outflow facility.
