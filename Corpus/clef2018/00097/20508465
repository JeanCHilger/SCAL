Estimating the perceived exertion threshold using the OMNI scale. This study aimed to determine if the OMNI scale with cycle ergometer pictorial format can be used to estimate perceived exertion threshold (PETOMNI) and nonexhaustive PET (PETOMNI5-8) and to compare and to correlate these PET estimates with PETBorg, PETBorg14-17, and critical power (CP). During different days, 13 men performed 4 different high-intensity constant-loads work bouts until exhaustion on a cycle ergometer using the Borg scale, whereas the OMNI scale was used during the other 4 work bouts using previous constant loads. The PET for both scales was determined by plotting the increasing rates of perceived exertion against power outputs, PET being the intersection point of the regression line. In addition, a hyperbolic relationship between power and time to exhaustion was used to determine CP. The PETOMNI (183+/-36 W) was similar to PETBorg (178+/-46 W), and they were also significantly correlated (r=0.77). The PETOMNI5-8 (175+/-36 W) was similar to PETBorg14-17 (181+/-38 W) however, they were not significantly correlated (r=0.36). All the PET estimates were similar to CPOMNI (167+/-36 W) and CPBorg (169+/-40 W) and also significantly correlated (r=0.79-0.94), excepting PETOMNI5-8 (r=0.46). In conclusion, OMNI cycling scale can be used to estimate PET and CP with high accuracy. However, the nonexhaustive PET derived from the 5-8 range in the OMNI scale did not provide a valid estimate of maximal sustainable power output because of the absence of correlation with PETBorg14-17 and with CP. Therefore, professionals and practitioners can assess the subjects' aerobic fitness through the PET estimation using the OMNI scale during exhaustive tests.
