NR-LU-10/streptavidin-copper 64-(1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane- Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have shown very promising results for cancer imaging. Nevertheless, because of their slow blood clearance, they do not localize in solid tumors in sufficient quantities to provide high contrast for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. To overcome this problem, the innovative concept of antibody “pretargeting” can be used. This approach, first proposed by Goodwin et al. (1) 15 years ago, involves the administration of an unlabeled mAb construct that accumulates in tumors, followed by the administration of a radiolabeled molecule that binds rapidly with high affinity to the construct (2).
