Fully automated production of iodine-124 using a vertical beam. A fully automated system for the production of iodine-124, based on techniques of vertical-beam irradiation and dry distillation, was developed. The system, coupled with a capsulated target, was able to irradiate the (124)TeO(2) target up to 29 μA for 1-4h, which yielded iodine-124 with an almost constant yield of 6.9 MBq/μAh at the end of bombardment. All procedures were performed automatically and repeatedly. The newly developed system would be suitable for routine, large-scale productions of iodine-124.
