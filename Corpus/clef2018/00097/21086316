Testicular localization of extranodal multifocal non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Report of two cases, review of the literature and clinical considerations. The aim of our study is to describe two cases of testicular localization of non- Hodgkin Lymphoma associated with the involvement of other extranodal organs, and to investigate the possible causes of this association according to the evidences found in literature. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma is extranodal in 25% of cases. Most of the times the organs involved are stomach, bowel, skin, central nervous system. About urological localizations, the most common is testis. Very rare is to find lymphoma in kidney, prostate, urinary bladder, and ureter. Testicular lymphoma is about 5% of testis malignancies it is more frequent in the 7th and in the 8th decade. Metastases of testicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma are described also many years later, and also in distant organs. Primary forms are usually "diffuse large B cell", a high-grade histotype
