Nonpharmacologic means of preventing asthma. Cessation of smoking in the home is one of the most important nonpharmacologic actions to be recommended. There is a highly significant increase in wheezing, coughing, and respiratory infections in children with smoking mothers, and this increase is directly proportional to the number of cigarettes smoked. Cord blood IgE levels are increased in babies whose mothers smoke during pregnancy. Other agents, such as sulpur dioxide and chemical pollutants from industrial processes may play a role in the development or exacerbation, of asthma symptoms and should be avoided. One of the most interesting areas in food allergy is whether breast feeding causes sensitization or induces tolerance in infants to foods ingested by the mother. There is an increase in asthma in second-generation immigrant populations who are exposed, from birth, to the Western style of living which increases their exposure to house dust mite. Several studies have shown that month of birth is important in the development of specific allergies, for example, in the incidence of birch pollen allergy in Scandinavia. The presence of a pet in the home at birth is associated with a greater incidence of allergy to that animal. Our study in asthmatic children has shown a strong association (p less than 0.001) between the presence of allergens in the air in their homes (sampled retrospectively in the month of birth) with a positive skin test to those allergens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
