Evolution of the management of colorectal cancer using integrative medicine. Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the major causes of cancer death worldwide. In recent years, the development of new and effective management options, such as fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), total mesorectal excision (TME) and monoclonal antibody novel "targeted" therapies has led to a considerable improvement in the outcome of this disease. In China, studies on CRC using integrative medicine (IM) have made remarkable progress. We therefore review the recent developments in CRC treatment through IM and Western medicine, including research studies such as the exploitation of Chinese herbs for the disruption of the tumor cell cycle or inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, induction of tumor cell apoptosis, improvement of the immune system, and the curative effect of chemotherapy. We also examine clinical studies such as those on special prescriptions and medicines and IM in anti-cancer therapy. Particularly, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of management with IM, and propose a suggestion for the management of colorectal cancer with IM, such as screening for effective prescriptions. We also analyze Chinese medicine, studying the pharmacologic mechanism of its anti-cancer effect, further strengthening the study of IM on CRC.
