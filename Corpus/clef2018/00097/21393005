The status of Tsukuba BNCT trial: BPA-based boron neutron capture therapy combined with X-ray irradiation. The phase II trial has been prepared to assess the effectiveness of BPA (250 mg/kg)-based NCT combined with X-ray irradiation and temozolomide (75 mg/m(2)) for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM. BPA uptake is determined by (18)F-BPA-PET and/or (11)C-MET-PET, and a tumor with the lesion to normal ratio of 2 or more is indicated for BNCT. The maximum normal brain point dose prescribed was limited to 13.0 Gy or less. Primary end point is overall survival.
