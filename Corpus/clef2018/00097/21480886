The value of intraoperative electrocorticography in surgical decision making for temporal lobe epilepsy with normal MRI. We hypothesized that acute intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) might identify a subset of patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-negative temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who could proceed directly to standard anteromesial resection (SAMR), obviating the need for chronic electrode implantation to guide resection.Patients with TLE and a normal MRI who underwent acute ECoG prior to chronic electrode recording of ictal onsets were evaluated. Intraoperative interictal spikes were classified as mesial (M), lateral (L), or mesial/lateral (ML). Results of the acute ECoG were correlated with the ictal-onset zone following chronic ECoG. Onsets were also classified as "M,"L," or "ML." Positron emission tomography (PET), scalp-EEG (electroencephalography), and Wada were evaluated as adjuncts.Sixteen patients fit criteria for inclusion. Outcomes were Engel class I in nine patients, Engel II in two, Engel III in four, and Engel IV in one. Mean postoperative follow-up was 45.2 months. Scalp EEG and PET correlated with ictal onsets in 69% and 64% of patients, respectively. Wada correlated with onsets in 47% of patients. Acute intraoperative ECoG correlated with seizure onsets on chronic ECoG in all 16 patients. All eight patients with "M" pattern ECoG underwent SAMR, and six (75%) experienced Engel class I outcomes. Three of eight patients with "L" or "ML" onsets (38%) had Engel class I outcomes.Intraoperative ECoG may be useful in identifying a subset of patients with MRI-negative TLE who will benefit from SAMR without chronic implantation of electrodes. These patients have uniquely mesial interictal spikes and can go on to have improved postoperative seizure-free outcomes.
