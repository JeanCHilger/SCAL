Determining the extent and stage of disease in patients with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma using 18F-FDG-PET/CT. Positron emission tomography (PET) using 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) combined with computed tomography (CT) represents a three-dimensional imaging method suitable for staging in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). The aim of our prospective multicenter study was to assess the value of initial PET/CT as compared with CT and PET alone for determining the stage and extent of the disease. A total of 122 patients with newly diagnosed NHL were examined using PET/CT. Four patients with resected lymphoma lesion and negative PET/CT were therefore excluded from the study. Of the remaining 118 cases, a total of 117 (99%) were described as 18F-FDG-avid. When compared with PET/CT, CT and PET showed very good sensitivity of lymph node imaging (97% and 100%, respectively) the specificity, however, was significantly lower (66.7% and 94.4%, respectively
