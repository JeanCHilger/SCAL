No-carrier-added radiosynthesis of [123I]HIPDM: N,N,N'-trimethyl-N'-(2-hydroxy-3-methyl-5-[123I] iodobenzyl)-1,3-propanediamine. The multi-millicurie production of the SPECT radiopharmaceutical N,N,N'-trimethyl-N'-(2-hydroxy-3-methyl-5-[123I] iodobenzyl)-1,3-propanediamine [( 123I]HIPDM) in high specific activity is described. Using no-carrier-added electrophilic iododeprotonation reactions and HPLC purification, [123I]HIPDM can be isolated in 70-76% radiochemical yield and specific activity greater than 2000 Ci/mmol within an overal preparation time of 75 min. This methodology is readily adapted to the clinical setting, and eliminates the need for co-injection of macroscopic HIPDM in SPECT imaging procedures.
