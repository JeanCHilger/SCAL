Inhibition of C6 glioma in vivo by combination chemotherapy of implantation             of polymer wafer and intracarotid perfusion of transferrin-decorated nanoparticles. The objective of this study was to develop a combination chemotherapy of             implantation of a 3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU)-loaded wafer and intracarotid             perfusion of BCNU-loaded nanoparticles for glioma treatment in vivo. BCNU-loaded             poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PLA) nanoparticles coated with transferrin (Tf) were prepared             by a solvent evaporation/diffusion method using Tf as the emulsifier. X-ray photoelectron             spectroscopy, Bratton-Marshall colorimetric assay and zeta-potential analysis             confirmed the existence of Tf on the nanoparticles and their functional activities.             BCNU-loaded PLA wafers were made of BCNU-loaded PLA microspheres. In vitro drug             release behavior demonstrated that BCNU was released from the Tf-PLA nanoparticles             and wafers in two distinct phases. The biodistribution of Tf-coated nanoparticles             investigated by 99mTc-labeled single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)             showed that the surface-containing Tf-PLA nanoparticles were concentrated in the             brain. Inhibition of tumor growth in the C6 glioma-bearing animal model showed             that combinational chemotherapy of BCNU-loaded wafer and BCNU-loaded PLA nanoparticles             had a stronger inhibitory effect and prolonged the average survival time of rats             (164%) compared with that of the control group. Furthermore, the tumors of this             treatment group were not visible by examination at 4 weeks. The results of this             study demonstrate for the first time that combination therapy of implantation             of a BCNU-loaded wafer and intracarotid perfusion of BCNU-loaded nanoparticles             may be a new strategy for glioma gene therapy.
