Intestinal Tuberculosis with Hoarseness as a Chief Complaint due to Mediastinal Lymphadenitis. A 68-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of hoarseness. A chest X-ray detected an abnormal shadow on the upper right lung. Bronchoscopic examination revealed that the left vocal cord was fixed in the paramedian position, and therefore left recurrent nerve paralysis was suspected. Lymphadenopathy was found in the left supraclavicular area. Chest computed tomography showed that the pretracheal and subaortic lymph nodes were swollen. Gastroendoscopy showed a 2-cm protruding lesion with ulceration on the upper esophagus. Histological examination of the supraclavicular lymph nodes and biopsy specimens from the esophagus revealed non-specific inflammation. PET-CT showed abnormal accumulations not only on the upper right lung but also on the lower right of the abdomen. Colonoscopy was performed and multiple erosions on the terminal ileum were found. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of a specimen biopsied from the erosion of the terminal ileum was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and intestinal tuberculosis was diagnosed. The patient was then treated with anti-tuberculous therapy. After treatment, the erosions on the terminal ileum, the swelling of the mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and the esophageal ulcer were all improved. The hoarseness was subsequently relieved. This is the first report of intestinal tuberculosis with hoarseness as a chief complaint due to mediastinal lymphadenitis.
