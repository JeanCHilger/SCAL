Development and evaluation of a dual-modality (MRI/SPECT) molecular imaging bioprobe. Specific bioprobes for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have enormous potential for use in cancer imaging in near-future clinical settings. The authors describe the development of dual modality molecular imaging bioprobes, in the form of magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) conjugated to antibodies, for SPECT and MRI of mesothelin-expressing cancers. The bioprobes were developed by conjugating (111)In labeled antimesothelin antibody mAbMB to superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs. Our experimental findings provide evidence that such bioprobes retain their magnetic properties as well as the ability to specifically localize in mesothelin-expressing tumors. It is anticipated that combining SPECT with MR will help obtain both functional and anatomical imaging information with high signal sensitivity and contrast, thereby providing a powerful diagnostic tool for early diagnosis and treatment planning of mesothelin-expressing cancers.
