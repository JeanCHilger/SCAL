Direct nodal sampling by echoendoscopy in lung cancer: the clinician's expectations: Direct nodal sampling by echoendoscopy in lung cancer. BACKGROUND: Mediastinal lymph node staging for lung cancer remains one of the most important factors to determine patient outcome.  METHODS: Noninvasive imaging techniques such as CT, MRI, PET and PET-CT provide some answers but no tissue diagnosis.  RESULTS: The development of endo-oesophageal (EUS) and endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with fine-needle aspiration has provided the clinician with a tool to investigate the mediastinum and the adrenal gland with a safe, minimally invasive procedure that can be performed on an outpatient basis.  CONCLUSION: The aim of this article was to give radiologists an overview of the techniques of EUS and EBUS and their role in the staging of lung cancer patients.
