 Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1, 70 amino acids) is secreted by the liver and target tissues in response to growth hormone stimulation (1). IGF-1 plays an important role in cell growth and development. IGF-1 binds to IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) with ~1,000-fold higher affinity than to insulin receptor. IGF-1R is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that is highly expressed in many human cancers (2). IGF-1R plays an important role in tumor proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis (3, 4). Triple-negative breast tumors are negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). Patients with triple-negative breast tumors have a lower survival rate than patients with estrogen receptor- or HER2-positive breast tumors (5). IGF-1R is overexpressed in 36% of all triple-negative breast carcinomas (6).Therefore, monitoring of IGF-1R expression in breast tumor lesions with a noninvasive imaging modality is important for development of therapeutic treatments of these patients with anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies (7). The human anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody R1507 is directed against the extracellular domain of human IGF-1R (8). However, the pharmacokinetics of intact radiolabeled mAbs, with high liver uptake and slow blood elimination, are generally not ideal for imaging. Smaller antibody fragments, such as Fab or F(ab')
