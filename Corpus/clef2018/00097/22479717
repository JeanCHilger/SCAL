 The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) belongs to the tyrosine kinase receptor family, is activated by several different ligands such as amphiregulin, EGF, transforming growth factor Î±, etc., and is involved in the growth, proliferation, and differentiation of cells (1). Overexpression of the EGFR indicates a poor prognosis for patients who have solid cancerous tumors of the breast, ovaries, and colon, non-small cell cancers of the lung, and especially head-and-neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) (2). Radiolabeled antibodies (Ab) directed against specific receptors, including the EGFR, have been used for the detection (with noninvasive imaging) and therapy of the various cancers, but this approach is not entirely useful for several reasons. Due to their large size (~150 kDa), Abs show a slow uptake in the target area. In addition, the uptake is restricted to small tumors, and large lesions may not be visualized completely. Finally, Abs have a long circulating half-life and usually accumulate in the liver and the kidneys (3). Preclinical studies have shown that EGF, a natural, high-affinity ligand of the EGFR, can be labeled with radio-metals and used with positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) for the imaging of tumors that overexpress the EGFR, but these tracers may not yield optimal results because they tend to accumulate in organs located within the abdominal cavity and mask the visualization of tumors in this area of the animal body (4). Levashova et al. reported that when EGF was tagged with cysteine on the N-terminus (cEGF), radiolabeled with either
