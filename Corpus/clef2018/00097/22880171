Redo-Coronary Artery Bypass due to Progression of the Celiac Axis Stenosis. We report a redo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in a 55-year-old man. Angina recurred 7 years after the initial surgery. Coronary angiography showed all patent grafts except a faint visualization of the in situ right gastroepiploic artery (RGEA) graft, which was anastomosed to the posterior descending coronary artery, associated with celiac axis stenosis. Redo-CABG was performed at postoperative 10 years because of aggravated angina and decreased perfusion of the inferior wall in the myocardial single photon emission computed tomography. The saphenous vein graft was interposed between the 2 in situ grafts used previously the right internal thoracic artery and RGEA grafts. Angina was relieved and myocardial perfusion was improved.
