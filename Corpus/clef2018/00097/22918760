Early experience with (68)Ga-DOTATATE preparation. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a rare form of cancer. NETs frequently express cell membrane-specific peptide receptors, such as somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). Radiolabeled peptides bind to SSTR and provide in vivo histopathological information for diagnostic purposes. (68)Ga-DOTATATE has higher sensitivity for low-grade tumors and greater avidity to well-differentiated NETs than (18)F-FDG, being superior to (111)In-DTPA-octreotide and (18)F-DOPA in evaluation of well-differentiated metastatic NETs. The feasibility of (68)Ga-DOTATATE application in routine clinical practice for PET imaging of NETs was determined in a limited number of known cases (n = 6). (68)Ga-DOTATATE scan could detect all known sites of NETs and in one case previously unknown peritoneal metastasis. Early regulatory consideration is important for routine clinical use.
