Environmental and demographic risk factors for egg allergy in a population-based study of infants. Although egg allergy is the most common food allergy in infants and young children, risk factors for egg allergy remain largely unknown. This study examined the relationship between environmental and demographic factors and egg allergy in a population-based infant cohort.In a study of 5276 infants (HealthNuts), infants underwent skin prick testing (SPT) to egg white at 12 months of age. Questionnaire data on relevant exposures were obtained. 699/873 (80%) infants eligible for oral food challenge (detectable wheal on SPT) attended for formal assessment of egg allergy status 453 had confirmed egg allergy (positive challenge and SPT ≥ 2 mm). Associations between environmental and demographic factors and egg allergy were investigated using multivariable logistic regression.Children with older siblings and those with a pet dog at home were less likely to develop egg allergy by 1 year of age (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.72 95% CI, 0.62, 0.83 per siblingExposure in the first year of life to siblings and dogs may decrease the risk of subsequent egg allergy. Infants with a family history of allergy and those with parents born in East Asia are at increased risk of egg allergy.
