Paget's disease of bone and previous pet ownership in the United States: dogs exonerated. Paget's disease of bone is currently believed to be the result of a paramyxovirus infection of osteoclasts. Previously reported immunohistological data have suggested that a virus resembling either the measles virus or a respiratory syncytial virus is the probable causative agent, but no organism has been isolated or definitively identified to date. A recent study reporting an increased exposure to dogs during childhood and adolescence in a small series of cases from the North West of England proposed that a canine virus, possibly distemper, might be the primarily infectious agent. To study this hypothesis further, we examined prior dog and cat ownership from childhood through adulthood in 433 cases of Paget's disease and an equal number of matched controls living in the US. We found no differences related to prior pet ownership. We conclude that past dog (or cat) ownership is not a risk factor for the development of Paget's disease.
