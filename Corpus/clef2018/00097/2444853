Development and function of B cells in monolayer islet cells of 3-week-old rat. Monolayer cultures of pancreatic B cells of 3-week-old rats were kept for 7 days in medium with 5.5 mM glucose plus 1 mM 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose or for 4 days in medium with 5.5 mM glucose alone, following exposure for 3 days to a medium with 5.5 mM glucose plus 5 microM iodoacetic acid. Addition of the deoxyglucose or iodoacetic acid caused a selective deletion of fibroblasts, yielding large clusters that consisted mostly of islet cells. At the early stage of culture in medium with 16.7 mM glucose (day 4), the response of B cells to 16.7 mM glucose included only a small rise in insulin secreted during the first and second phases, and that to 10 mM of leucine and 2-ketoisocaproate was monophasic. After culturing for 7 days, these three secretagogues markedly stimulated insulin secretion by B cells cultured in both media, with a significant rise in secondary phase secretion. However, quantitative relationships differed. Thus, the response (total insulin secreted during a 30-min stimulation) of B cells in 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose to glucose was 155%, to leucine 185% and 2-ketoisocaproate 126% of that of cells exposed to iodoacetic acid. In conclusion, the present results suggest that B cells of 3-week-old rat may be immature, and that medium containing 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose is beneficial to continued maturation of the response in vitro.
