Sensitivity and specificity of positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies in Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia. Positron emission tomographic (PET) scans using [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were quantitatively analyzed for metabolic and structural abnormalities in normal subjects and patients classified as having Alzheimer's disease (AD), mixed dementia and multi-infarct dementia (MID) according to Hachinski ischemic scores. MRI-detected abnormalities in the periventricular white matter and in subcortical locations increased in incidence with age in normals and increased markedly in AD and especially in MID. Upper limits for the severity of these white matter lesions could be defined only for normal young and elderly subjects, but not for AD, mixed or MID patients. PET scan abnormalities occurred in about 90% of demented patients and in 54% of elderly and 34% of young normals. There was no characteristic pattern of abnormality that distinguished MID from AD patients. It is concluded that PET and MRI studies in demented patients are useful ancillary tests especially in evaluating the mild, questionably demented subject and for assessing the functional impact of structural disease.
