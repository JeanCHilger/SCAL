Characterization of MSM1, the structural gene for yeast mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA synthetase. Respiratory-deficient mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae assigned to pet complementation group G72 are impaired in mitochondrial protein synthesis. The loss of this activity has been correlated with the inability of the mutants to acylate the two methionyl-tRNAs of yeast mitochondria. A nuclear gene (MSM1) capable of complementing the respiratory deficiency has been cloned by transformation of the G72 mutant C122/U3 with a yeast genomic library. In situ disruption of the MSM1 gene in a wild-type haploid strain of yeast induces a respiratory-deficient phenotype but does not affect the ability of the mutant to grow on fermentable substrates indicating that the product of MSM1 functions only in mitochondrial protein synthesis. Mitochondrial extracts prepared from the mutant with the disrupted copy of MSM1 were found to be defective in acylation of the two mitochondrial methionyl-tRNAs thereby confirming the identity of MSM1 as the structural gene for the mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA synthetase. The sequence of the protein encoded by MSM1 is similar to the Escherichia coli and yeast cytoplasmic methionyl-tRNA synthetases. Based on the primary-sequence similarities of the three proteins, the mitochondrial enzyme appears to be more related to the bacterial than to the yeast cytoplasmic methionyl-tRNA synthetase.
