Fundamentals of positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography is a modern radionuclide method of measuring physiological quantities or metabolic parameters in vivo. The method is based on: (1) radioactive labelling with positron emitters (2) the coincidence technique for the measurement of the annihilation radiation following positron decay
