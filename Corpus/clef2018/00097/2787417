Body surface potential mapping in anterior myocardial infarction--a longitudinal study in acute, convalescent and chronic phases. Body surface potential mapping (BSPM) was performed to evaluate the infarct size and the viability of myocardium in the infarct area in 20 patients with anterior myocardial infarction (MI). BSPM was performed at the early acute phase, 1 week, 1 month and 2 months after onset of the symptoms. The departure areas were obtained according to the potential distribution below the mean normal range and were compared with the value for creatine phosphokinase (CPK), hemodynamic parameters, ejection fraction measured by radionuclide ventriculography, extent score (ES) and severity score (SS) of thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomogram. Two months after the infarction, the ergometer exercise was performed and departure areas before and after exercise were compared. With the departure map technique, the departure areas in all cases were found in the anterior region of the thorax From 1 week to 2 months after MI, the departure areas were significantly reduced. One week after MI, the departure areas had a positive significant relation with peak CPK and sigma CPK. One month after MI the departure areas also had a positive relation with ES or SS. One week and 1 month after MI, the departure areas had a negative relation with the left ventricular stroke work index or the left ventricular ejection fraction. After exercise test in the chronic phase, the departure areas were significantly enlarged. In conclusion, the departure map is useful in evaluating the location, sequential changes of size of anterior MI including the ischemic area around the infarct site and the left ventricular function. It is suggested that the enlarged departure areas after exercise might be the ischemic areas provoked by exercise.
