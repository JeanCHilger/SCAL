A brief study of the selectivity of norbinaltorphimine, (-)-cyclofoxy, and (+)-cyclofoxy among opioid receptor subtypes in vitro. Norbinaltorphimine (nor-BNI) is a bifunctional reagent developed as a selective antagonist of the kappa opioid receptor. In this paper we examined the in vitro selectivity of nor-BNI, 6-desoxy-6 beta-fluoronaltrexone (cycloFOXY), and the enantiomer of cycloFOXY, among opioid receptor subtypes. Nor BNI exhibited the highest affinity for kappa binding sites labeled by 3H-U69593 (Ki = 1.8nM), and was 27- to 29-fold less potent at mu and delta binding sites. In contrast, cycloFOXY had the highest affinity for mu binding sites (Ki = 2.62 nM), and bound to kappa and delta binding sites with Ki's of 9.3 nM and 89 nM, respectively. The enantiomer of cycloFOXY, did not inhibit binding even at concentrations greater than 10 microM, validating in part the use of 18F-labeled (+)-cycloFOXY to estimate "non-specific binding" in positron emission tomography. Additionally, we report that (S,S)-U50 488 and (R.R)-U50 488 bind to kappa binding sites labeled by 3H-U69 593 with Ki's of 0.89 nM and 299 nM, respectively.
