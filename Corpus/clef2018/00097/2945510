PET scan investigations of Huntington's disease: cerebral metabolic correlates of neurological features and functional decline. Fifteen drug-free patients with early to midstage Huntington's disease were evaluated with quantitative neurological examinations, scales for functional capacity, computed tomographic (CT) scans, and positron emission tomographic (PET) scans of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake. All patients had abnormal indices of caudate metabolism on PET scanning, whereas in patients with early disease indices of putamen metabolism and CT measures of caudate atrophy were normal. Indices of caudate metabolism correlated highly with the patients' overall functional capacity (r = 0.906 p less than 0.001) and bradykinesia/rigidity (r = -0.692
