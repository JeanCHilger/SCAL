Left ventricular volume determination from single-photon emission computed tomography. To compare the accuracy of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with that of contrast cineangiography in measuring left ventricular end-diastolic volume, 25 consecutive patients undergoing catheterization for coronary artery or valvular heart disease were first evaluated scintigraphically. A simple, count-corrected voxel counting technique was used to derive left ventricular end-diastolic volume from transaxial SPECT slices. SPECT volume values showed a high degree of correlation with those determined by angiography (r = 0.969), with a standard error of the estimate of 23 ml. SPECT offers a highly accurate and essentially noninvasive method for measuring chamber volumes that is independent of geometric assumptions about ventricular configuration and chest wall attenuation and does not require blood sample counting.
