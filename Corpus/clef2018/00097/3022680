Involvement of actin-containing microfilaments in HSV-induced cytopathology and the influence of inhibitors of glycosylation. Two and a half hours after infection with a high dose of different strains of HSV-1 which induce rounding of cells, breakdown of actin containing microfilaments can be observed. At the periphery of the cell, actin containing knob-like protuberances were visible. Later on, actin seems to be located exclusively on the surface of cells. Observations were done by immunofluorescence microscopy, scanning electron-microscopy and immunoperoxidase staining of ultrathin sections. The envelope of HSV appears to be stained by anti-actin. Strain IES produces rounding of cells at a high dose of infection before fusion proceeds at 37 degrees C. Similar alterations were not observed with the fusing strains MP and HFEM. Incubation of infected cells at 39 degrees C revealed strain dependent differences of the fusion activity. At 41 degrees C no "fusion from within" of cells but only rounding was detectable. Application of tunicamycin resulted in complete inhibition of fusion by all strains. The fusion activity of some strains of HSV-1 (ANG, HFEM, and MP) was not inhibited by addition of 2-deoxy-D-glucose and 2-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose. A variant from strain MP could be isolated, which is sensitive to the effects of 2-deoxy-D-glucose. Inhibitors of processing of glycoproteins did not affect fusion of cells.
