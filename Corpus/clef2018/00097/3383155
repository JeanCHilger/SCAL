Techniques for the rapid display and manipulation of 3-D biomedical data. The use of fully interactive 3-D workstations with true real-time performance will become increasingly common as technology matures and economical commercial systems become available. This paper provides a comprehensive introduction to high speed approaches to the display and manipulation of 3-D medical objects obtained from tomographic data acquisition systems such as CT, MR, and PET. A variety of techniques are outlined including the use of software on conventional minicomputers, hardware assist devices such as array processors and programmable frame buffers, and special purpose computer architecture for dedicated high performance systems. While both algorithms and architectures are addressed, the major theme centers around the utilization of hardware-based approaches including parallel processors for the implementation of true real-time systems.
