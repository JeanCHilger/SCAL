Comparative methods for quantifying myocardial infarct size by thallium-201 SPECT. Maximum-count circumferential profile analysis of 201TI single photon emission computed tomograms (SPECT) was employed to quantify infarct size (15) in ten dogs with acute closed chest coronary occlusion (seven left anterior descending coronary artery and three left circumflex coronary artery) who underwent rest-redistribution 201TI SPECT. The extent of hypoperfused myocardium was calculated as a percentage of slice mass on rest-redistribution 201TI SPECT. Pathologic IS was determined by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. On each tomogram, SPECT IS was defined as the % of the maximum-count circumferential profile points falling below normal. To calculate total LV infarct size, slice ISs were added to one another after each was multiplied by a coefficient K that reflected the contribution of that slice to the total left ventricular mass. K was derived from an observed relationship in normal dogs between slice fractional distance from the apex and either its actual weight, its geometric SPECT area, or its count-based SPECT area, the assessment of which was independent of edge detection. Using any of these algorithms, there was a high linear correlation between the tomographic and TTC IS. A similar algorithm was also developed from tomograms of eight normal patients. These data offer promise for the clinical noninvasive assessment of the extent of hypoperfused myocardium.
