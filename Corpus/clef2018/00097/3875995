The utility of SPECT for 99mTc-MAA hepatic arterial perfusion scintigraphy. The utility of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for hepatic arterial perfusion scintigraphy was evaluated in 86 patients (91 studies). Previous reports have shown planar studies to be valuable for the clinical management of patients receiving intraarterial chemotherapy and more reliable than angiography in determining blood flow distribution. However, overlying areas of intra- and extrahepatic perfusion can sometimes make interpretation of these two-dimensional images difficult. Since SPECT has the potential to depict the three-dimensional distribution of perfusion, separate out overlying activity, and improve contrast resolution, SPECT Tc-MAA perfusion studies were compared to planar studies. Planar and SPECT studies both demonstrated the extent of hepatic and tumor perfusion, although occasionally SPECT added additional information. SPECT was most useful in confirming or excluding extrahepatic perfusion that was suspected but not definite on planar studies. Extrahepatic abdominal perfusion was found to be present in 11 (12%) of 91 studies. All patients with confirmed extrahepatic perfusion who received intraarterial chemotherapy had symptoms of drug toxicity compared to only a 23% incidence in those without evidence of extrahepatic perfusion (p less than 0.001). This report demonstrates that SPECT can improve the qualitative interpretation of hepatic arterial perfusion studies.
