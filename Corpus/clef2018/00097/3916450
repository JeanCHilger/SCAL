Positron emission tomography in the lung. Positron emission tomography using the ECAT II scanner to image and measure regional lung function is outlined. The combined use of transmission and emission imaging provides quantitative information about regional lung structure (density, extravascular density, and vascular volume) and function (ventilation, perfusion, ventilation-perfusion ratios, glucose metabolic rate). Clinical applications in asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, pulmonary vascular disease, interstitial lung disease, and squamous cell carcinoma are presented. Future prospects for PET are discussed.
