201Thallium single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) in the functional evaluation of coronary stenosis changes. Results of a comparison of stress scintigraphic and coronary angiographic findings. 201TI-Single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) was employed in 57 patients immediately after exercise, followed by a redistribution analysis 3 hours later. 44 patients had coronary artery disease as documented by angiography (of these, 27 patients had an earlier myocardial infarction confirmed). 13 patients produced normal angiograms. 201TI-SPECT revealed a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 84%. Referring to a subdivision of the left ventricle into anterior and posterior walls, sensitivity in infarcted segments (96%) was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher than in non-infarcted segments (71%). No difference in sensitivities was found comparing anterior and posterior walls. Specificity of segmental analysis was 92%. Evaluation of segmental pattern (positive or negative redistribution) in old infarctions revealed persisting 201TI defects as frequent as the combination of persisting defects with surrounding redistribution. Non-infarcted segments showed sole redistribution in 89% of the cases. Left ventricular 201TI-SPECT improves the anatomical definition of defects in 201TI uptake. It enhances the functional evaluation of changes in regional perfusion subsequent to pathological coronary morphology.
