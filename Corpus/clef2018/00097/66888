Analysis of serum proteins in clinically normal pet and colony cats, using agarose electrophoresis. The relative and absolute values of the electrophoretic fractions of serum proteins of 50 clinically normal cats were determined, using agarose as the supporting matrix. Six protein fractions were clearly and consistently resolved: albumin and alpha1-, alpha2-, beta1-, beta2-, and gamma-globulins. In many cats, the alpha1-, alpha2-, and beta2-fractions were each divided into 2 subfractions. Cats which lived in a research colony environment were found to have significantly increased levels of gamma-globulins as compared with the values in cats kept as house pets. The results of serum protein fractionation using this technique have been compared with the normal feline values reported in the literature.
