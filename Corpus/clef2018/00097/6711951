Study of the feline and canine populations in the greater Las Vegas area. Analysis of household dogs and cats, based on age-distribution data and on age-specific birth and survival rates, as well as on pet source, indicated that the dog and cat populations are stable and not increasing in size (lambda congruent to 1). Roaming dogs and cats euthanatized at the pound represented about 5.7% and 8.1% of the estimated dog and cat populations, respectively. The death at the pound seems to be effective in checking pet population growth. Among pets acquired, 84% were less than 1 year of age for dogs as compared with 88% for cats. Breeders and pet shops supplied about 7% of cats and 17% of dogs. About 10% of cats and 10% of dogs were acquired at the pound, while 6.4% of dogs and 14% of cats were acquired as stray. About 45% of dogs and 41% of cats were acquired from pet owners. Some dogs (12.46%) and cats (12%) were imported from outside the Las Vegas area. Of dogs and cats below 2 months of age, 33% and 19.5%, respectively, came from breeders or pet shops or were imported from outside the area. Seventeen percent of unspayed female dogs and 16% of unspayed female cats reproduced. The percentages of spayed females were 77 for dogs and 86 for cats. Forty-five percent of the dogs and 48% of the cats were males. Among dogs at the shelter, 2% were neutered and 26% spayed. At the pound, 24% of dogs were small breeds, 24% medium size breeds, and 52% large breeds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
