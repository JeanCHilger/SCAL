Histologic and ultrastructural evaluation of thyroid lesions associated with hypothyroidism in dogs. Thyroid lesions in 16 pet dogs with hypothyroidism were evaluated by light and electron microscopy. Lymphocytic thyroiditis, found in seven dogs, was characterized by diffuse infiltration of the thyroid gland by lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages with formation of some lymphoid nodules and destruction of follicles, progressing to replacement of most of the thyroid by fibrous connective tissue. The basement membrane around follicles was thick and had electron-dense deposits. The morphology of the thyroid lesions and the presence of circulating thyroglobulin autoantibodies suggested that lymphocytic thyroiditis was immune-mediated. Idiopathic follicular atrophy, found in nine dogs, was characterized by loss of thyroid parenchyma and replacement by adipose connective tissue. Degeneration of individual follicular cells was present in the early stage, with exfoliation into the colloid and interfollicular area. Most of the thyroid gland consisted of adipose connective tissue with either interspersed small follicles or individual follicular cells that had dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum, large Golgi apparatus, and intracytoplasmic microfollicles in the advanced stage. Follicular atrophy was a degenerative lesion of follicular cells of unknown cause, not associated with inflammatory destruction in the thyroid gland.
