Labelling of polysaccharides using [11C]cyanogen bromide. In vivo and in vitro evaluation of 11C-hyaluronan uptake kinetics. A method for the 11C-labelling of polysaccharides in high specific radioactivity is described. Dextran and hyaluronan were treated with [11C]cyanogen bromide in aqueous solution at pH 11.5 to give 30-47% radiochemical yields with higher than 98% radiochemical purity in synthesis times of 24-26 min counted from the end of bombardment. Specific radioactivities at the end of synthesis ranged from 0.12 to 3.1 Ci/mumol. The biodistribution kinetics of [11C]hyaluronan injected intravenously was studied in rats by means of positron emission tomography, showing a rapid and displaceable uptake in liver. Uptake and displacement of [11C]hyaluronan was also demonstrated in cultured rat liver endothelial cells.
