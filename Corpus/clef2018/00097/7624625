PET in stereotactic conditions increases the diagnostic yield of brain biopsy. We have recently described a technique allowing routine integration of PET scan data in the planning of stereotactic brain biopsy [Levivier et al:, Neurosurgery, 1992 31:792-797]. We now report our results in a consecutive series of 38 patients that underwent combined FDG-PET and CT-guided stereotactic biopsy between June 1991 and January 1993. Stereotactic procedures were performed according to a standard protocol in which two biopsy trajectories were used whenever possible. This yielded to a total of 78 trajectories. In 31 patients, at least 1 trajectory was defined using an abnormality visualized on PET. The histological diagnosis was obtained in all cases. The diagnostic yield of each trajectory according to the FDG uptake of PET and contrast enhancement on CT showed that most low-grade tumors were found in hypometabolic/hypodense areas, glioblastomas were all diagnosed in areas with increased FDG uptake and contrast enhancement on CT while data for anaplastic astrocytomas were heterogeneously distributed. In the present series, 6 targets defined on CT were nondiagnostic
