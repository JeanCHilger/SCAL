Functional anatomy of the mental representation of upper extremity movements in healthy subjects. 1. Differences in the distribution of relative regional cerebral blood flow during motor imagery and execution of a joy-stick movement were investigated in six healthy volunteers with the use of positron emission tomography (PET). Both tasks were compared with a common baseline condition, motor preparation, and with each other. Data were analyzed for individual subjects and for the group, and areas of significant flow differences were related to anatomy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 2. Imagining movements activated a number of frontal and parietal regions: medial and lateral premotor areas, anterior cingulate areas, ventral opercular premotor areas, and parts of superior and inferior parietal areas were all activated bilaterally when compared with preparation to move. 3. Execution of movements compared with imagining movements led to additional activations of the left primary sensorimotor cortex and adjacent areas: dorsal parts of the medial and lateral premotor cortex adjacent cingulate areas
