Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor: report of three cases. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT) is one of the mixed neuronal-glial tumors that should be differentiated from low-grade gliomas. The recognition and correct diagnosis of DNT is important because this tumor is curable by excision.We report three cases of histologically proven DNTs with various image studies performed preoperatively and describe characteristic findings of them, as well as those of previous reports.In our three cases, computed tomography (CT) showed a well-defined, nonenhancing hypodense area. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a cortical mass of hypointensity on T1- and of marked hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. I-123-IMP or Tc-99m-HMPAO single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images showed marked hypoperfusion of the lesion. Thallium-SPECT showed no uptake.I-123-IMP, Tc-99m-HMPAO, and Thallium-SPECT images, as well as CT and MRI, may be helpful in distinguishing DNT from low-grade gliomas.
