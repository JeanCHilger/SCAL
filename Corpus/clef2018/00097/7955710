Cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in patients with pure akinesia and progressive supranuclear palsy. We studied cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in 6 patients with pure akinesia (PA), 8 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 16 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 10 normal control subjects using positron emission tomography (PET). Regions of interest were studied in the cerebral cortex (the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe), thalamus, cerebellar hemispheres, cerebellar vermis, and brainstem. In patients with PA, regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was significantly decreased in the frontal cortex, thalamus, and brainstem compared with normal control subjects. PSP patients showed significantly decreased CBF in the entire cerebral cortex, thalamus, cerebellar hemispheres, and brainstem and regional cerebral oxygen metabolic rate (CMRO2) in the frontal cortex, thalamus, and brainstem, whereas patients with PD were revealed to be normal in both CBF and CMRO2 values. In conclusion, a part of patients with PA may be in the early stage of PSP or may be atypical presentations of PSP whose symptom is only akinesia judging from the followings. 1) PET findings demonstrated a close similarity between PA and PSP a pattern of CBF and CMRO2 decrement especially in the frontal cortex, thalamus and brainstem. 2) Patients with PA were shown to have similar pathological changes to PSP in recent studies. 3) Several authors reported that some PSP cases could show only akinesia initially, later developing dementia, supranuclear ophthalmoplegia, pseundobulbar palsy, and nuchal rigidity during their illnesses.
