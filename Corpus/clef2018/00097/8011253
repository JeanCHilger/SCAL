Altered cortical blood flow in HIV-seropositive individuals with and without dementia: a single photon emission computed tomography study. To quantitatively demonstrate the pattern of cerebral perfusion abnormalities in HIV-1-infected individuals described as 'patchiness' or inhomogeneity in previous qualitative emission tomographic imaging studies.We aimed to create a quantitative measure of inhomogeneity in HIV-infected individuals. High-frequency variance in cortical profiles is an indication of inhomogeneity in the distribution of radiotracer in the cerebral cortex. Therefore, the study analysis was designed to enable the estimation of variance frequencies in cortical profiles.Regional cerebral blood flow was examined in nine mildly demented and 10 cognitively normal HIV-1-seropositive individuals and eight seronegative normal controls using single photon emission computed tomography with the radiotracer [I-123]-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine. Quantitative analysis was performed using circumferential profiles of cerebral cortical perfusion. Fourier transform power spectra of the profiles were examined as an index of patchiness in tracer distribution.Normal controls were characterized by strong middle frequency and weak high-frequency power. Both HIV-1-infected groups showed a significant power shift from middle to high frequencies.Increased high-frequency variations in both HIV-1-infected groups indicates diffuse cortical perfusion changes compared with normal controls. This study suggests that there are cerebral bloodflow abnormalities in HIV-1-infected individuals both with and without clinically severe dementia.
