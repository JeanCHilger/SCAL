123I-MIBG scintigraphy in patients with neuroblastoma. 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) scintigraphy was performed in 9 patients who were suspected to have a neuroblastoma. Positive images were obtained in 4 patients who had a neuroblastoma. Negative images were obtained in 5 patients who did not have a neuroblastoma. 123I-MIBG scan revealed an active tumor in a patient who had received intensive chemotherapy for the recurrence of neuroblastoma with returning of all tumor markers including neuron specific enolase to normal range. This indicated that 123I-MIBG scan can be used to assess the effect of therapy.
