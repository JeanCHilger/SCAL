Planar imaging with single-head large-field-of-view cameras: are they still the workhorse? The large-field-of-view (LFOV) scintillation camera was developed in 1975 with a field of view 50% larger than the conventional camera used at that time. Not only was the new model more adaptable to large-area imaging needs, such as lungs, bone, liver, and spleen, but it could be used for small-organ imaging with a converging collimator that yielded both high resolution and high efficiency. LFOV cameras still offer the most flexibility for all of the common procedures encountered in the nuclear medicine clinic. For those installations performing up to approximately 13 procedures a day, two LFOV cameras can handle the patient load, and little advantage would be gained by the use of the multihead cameras. For the busy laboratories, however, the increased patient throughput would be the primary advantage of the multihead systems. Dual LFOV systems offer an advantage in time for whole-body imaging procedures, and three-head systems in many installations have been devoted to myocardial perfusion and brain SPECT. Although the LFOV camera is still the dominant imaging device in nuclear medicine, it is expected that in the future more procedures will gravitate to the dedicated two and three multihead system, particularly with the increasing applications of both SPECT and quantification to conventional nuclear medicine procedures.
