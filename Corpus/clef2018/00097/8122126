Application of convergent-beam collimation and simultaneous transmission emission tomography to cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is the most commonly performed imaging technique for perfusion studies of the heart and brain. However, these organs are much smaller than the crystal surface of gamma cameras. SPECT sensitivity and resolution can be improved by using fan- and cone-beam collimators to magnify the image of these organs over a larger portion of the crystal face. Special orbits and reconstruction algorithms must be used with convergent-beam acquisitions to prevent image distortion. Differential attenuation of source activity in the chest is one of the most vexing problems in cardiac SPECT, especially with Thallium-201. Multi-headed cameras equipped with convergent-beam collimators allow a transmission image to be obtained at the same time as emission images. Applying a transmission map of the chest attenuation values to the emission images produces a truer picture of source distribution in the heart. This article reviews the technical problems associated with convergent-beam geometry and simultaneous transmission emission tomography SPECT imaging of the heart.
