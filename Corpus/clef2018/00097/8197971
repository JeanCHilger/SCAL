Comparison of the distribution of myocardial blood flow between exercise-induced and hyperventilation-induced attacks of coronary spasm: a study with thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy. Exercise and hyperventilation tests are often used as the provocative tests for coronary artery spasm. To examine the distribution of myocardial blood flow during exercise-induced and hyperventilation-induced attacks of coronary spasm, thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy was performed in 47 patients with variant angina. The extent and severity scores and severity index (severity score/extent score) of scintigraphic perfusion defect were calculated. In 32 patients, anginal attack associated with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram was induced by exercise in 23 patients, the attack was induced by hyperventilation. In patients with either anterior or inferior wall ischemia, both the extent and severity scores and severity index in the scintigram were significantly greater in exercise-induced anginal attack than those in hyperventilation-induced attack. In patients with simultaneous anterior and inferior wall ischemia, they tended to be greater in exercise-induced attack. In eight patients in whom anginal attack was induced by both exercise and hyperventilation, these scores and index were significantly greater in exercise-induced attack than those in hyperventilation-induced attack. These data suggest that myocardial ischemia during exercise-induced attack is enhanced as compared with that during hyperventilation-induced attack. Thallium-201 scintigraphy combined with exercise testing seems to be more sensitive for detecting myocardial ischemia induced by coronary spasm.
