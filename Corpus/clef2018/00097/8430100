Dissociation of human mid-dorsolateral from posterior dorsolateral frontal cortex in memory processing. Work with non-human primates had previously demonstrated that the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex, which comprises cytoarchitectonic areas 46 and 9, plays a critical role in the performance of non-spatial self-ordered working memory tasks, whereas the immediately adjacent posterior dorsolateral frontal cortex (area 8) is critical for the learning and performance of visual conditional associative tasks. The present study used positron emission tomography with magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate the existence, within the human brain, of these two functionally distinct subdivisions of the lateral frontal cortex. These findings provide direct evidence that, just as the monkey brain, the human lateral frontal cortex is functionally heterogeneous and that comparable anatomical areas underlie similar functions in the two species.
