Comparison of technetium-99m-ECD to Xenon-133 SPECT in normal controls and in patients with mild to moderate regional cerebral blood flow abnormalities. Technetium-99m-1,1-ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) has been proposed as a "chemical microsphere" for SPECT measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). However, its distribution has not yet been compared in humans to an established rCBF measure. Therefore, we compared the uptake and distribution of ECD with rCBF measured by 133Xe SPECT in subjects with mild to moderate flow abnormalities and in normal volunteers. Blood and urine chemistries and vital signs were unchanged from pre-ECD values up to seven days postinjection. Profile plots demonstrated pattern agreement between rCBF ratios (133Xe) and ECD count density ratios. A significant correlation of rCBF ratios to ECD count density ratios was observed (r = 0.77), with a slope of 0.64 and intercept of 0.36. To explore whether or not the relationship between rCBF and ECD was dependent on absolute flow, ECD region of interest data were expressed in units of ml/min/100 g by equating global CBF (133Xe) and ECD global count density. A closer correlation (r = 0.88) was found for these data than for the count ratio data. The slope was closer to one (m = 0.83) and the intercept was closer to zero (b = 8.2). Also, a significant correlation was observed between ECD-derived rCBF and 133Xe rCBF in the lesion area (r = 0.92) for patients with well-demarcated rCBF lesions. The slope (0.80) suggested a slight underestimation of lesion flow by ECD. Finally, ECD clearance from cortical gray matter ROIs derived from high-resolution scans from 1 to 4 hr postinjection was slow (2.4%/hr). In summary, ECD is a safe and effective marker of regional cerebral perfusion. The distribution of ECD is linearly related to rCBF measured by 133Xe SPECT, although our data suggest a mild underestimation of flow at the high end of the normal range.
