Serum dehydroepiandrosterone and cortisol measurements in Huntington's chorea. Serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), known to antagonize metabolic effects of glucocorticoids in animals, and cortisol (CRT), already shown to be related to cognitive dysfunction in man and animals, were measured in 11 drug-free male subjects with definite Huntington's chorea (HC) and in 25 age-matched male normal controls. Statistical difference was found between DHEAS serum levels (p < 0.05), CRT levels (p < 0.05) and the DHEAS/CRT ratio (p < 0.01) of HC subjects and normal individuals. These findings may indicate a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and possibly suggest a role of DHEAS as an antiglucocorticoid in HC.
