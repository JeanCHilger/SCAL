Effects of bicarbonate dialysis solution on peritoneal transport in rats. We studied the effects of bicarbonate dialysis solution (TB 1.36) on the peritoneum in our rat model of dialysis. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups (n = 12 each). One group was dialyzed with standard 1.36% Dianeal PD-2 (L-group) the other group was dialyzed with TB 1.36 (B-group). After break-in dialysis after catheter insertion, the animals were dialyzed twice daily with 30 mL of the designated dialysis solution for four weeks. White blood cell count with differentials and microbiological culture of the dialysate were examined once a week to detect peritonitis. A peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was performed on the eighth and thirty-sixth days. The dialysate was obtained at 0, 2, and 4 hours
