Vasoreactive effect of acetazolamide as a function of time with sequential PET 15O-water measurement. The accurate assessment of vascular flow reserve is crucial for the evaluation of risk among patients with cerebrovascular disease. In six patients with unilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery and one patient with unilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (mean +/- S.D. age = 68 +/- 3 years), we measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) after the administration of 940 MBq 15O-water using a remotely controlled power injector. Studies were performed at rest, after 10 min, and then 10, 20 and 30 min after the administration of 1 mg acetazolamide to evaluate the vasoreactive effect, as reflected by an increase in CBF. Sixteen regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn over the CBF images. These ROIs were as follows in each hemisphere: Area I, four areas in the cortical middle cerebral arterial territory (superior frontal, frontal, temporal and parietal areas) Area II, four areas of the deep middle cerebral and vertebral arterial territory (occipital area, basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebellum). Taking normalized resting CBF to be 100%, the mean CBF measured 10, 20 and 30 min post-injection using sequential positron emission tomography was as follows: Area I, 141.4 +/- 16.3, 127.7 +/- 15.3 and 128.2 +/- 17.4% for non-occluded sites and 116.3 +/- 22.8, 112.7 +/- 16.4 and 114.9 +/- 17.1% for occluded sites
