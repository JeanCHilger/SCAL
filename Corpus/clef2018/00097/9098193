3-[123I]iodo-alpha-methyltyrosine and [methyl-11C]-L-methionine uptake in cerebral gliomas: a comparative study using SPECT and PET. This study compares the uptake of the nonmetabolizable amino acid analog 3-[123I]iodo-alpha-methyltyrosine (IMT) and of [methyl-11C]-L-methionine (MET) in cerebral gliomas.In 14 patients with cerebral gliomas, IMT uptake was measured using SPECT (10 dynamic, 4 static SPECT acquisitions) and, on the same day, MET uptake by dynamic PET. The IMT and MET data were compared with respect to tracer kinetics, tumor to brain ratios (T/B) and tumor size after converting the resolution of the PET scans to that of the SPECT scans (14 mm FWHM).All gliomas showed increased uptake of both tracers in relation to normal brain tissue. Visual comparison of the scans yielded no differences in tumor size and shape with both methods. IMT showed a maximal tracer uptake in brain and in tumors at about 15 min postinjection which was followed by a washout of 45.0% +/- 13.5% in gliomas (mean +/- s.d., p < 0.001, n = 10) and 35.3% +/- 5.4% in normal brain (p < 0.001, n = 10) at 60 min postinjection. MET concentration in tumor tissue or brain tissue between 15 and 60 min remained constant. T/B ratios of IMT SPECT and MET PET showed a significant correlation at 15 min postinjection (r = 0.69, n = 10, p = 0.03), a low correlation for the mean values of the scans from 15-60 min postinjection (r = 0.54, n = 14, p = 0.05) and no correlation at 60 min postinjection (r = 0.09, n = 10, n.s.).IMT and MET uptake in gliomas is similar in the early, transport dominated phase. There are some differences in tumor to brain ratios between both tracers within the first hour postinjection that are mainly caused by variable washout of IMT. Imaging of tumor extent with IMT SPECT is comparable to MET PET. Thus, amino acid SPECT using IMT is a promising tool to evaluate the biological activity and intracerebral infiltration of gliomas.
