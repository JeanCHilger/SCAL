A comparative study of the quality of SPECT images obtained by 123I-IMP, 99mTc-HMPAO and 99mTc-ECD. The purpose of this study was to comparatively evaluate the quality of SPECT images for the mapping of rCBF using three tracers, 123I-IMP, 99mTc-HMPAO and 99mTc-ECD. We performed three SPECT studies on seven patients with various cerebral diseases under the same conditions. An effect of Lassen's correction on SPECT images obtained by HMPAO was also evaluated. The same irregular regions of interest were placed on the four transaxial SPECT images. To quantitatively evaluate the pattern of tracer uptake and image contrast, the uptake ratio, regional count/mean count of the cerebrum, and its coefficient variations (CV) were defined, respectively. The order of the value of CV was HMPAO with correction > IMP > ECD > HMPAO without correction. HMPAO with correction showed the best image contrast, but HMPAO without correction was the worst. Uptake ratios of ECD and HMPAO with correction were decreased in the brain stem and thalamus in comparison with those of IMP. Both uptake ratios of ECD and HMPAO without correction were increased in the occipital cortex. IMP provides high quality SPECT images. Images obtained by HMPAO should be modified by Lassen's correction to increase image contrast. ECD or HMPAO should not be used to evaluate patients with spinocerebellar degeneration.
