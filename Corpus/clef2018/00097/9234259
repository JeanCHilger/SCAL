Clinical comparison of radiolocalization of two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the TAG-72 antigen. Ten patients with colorectal cancer metastases received 125I-B72.3 and 131I-CC49 prior to laparotomy (five patients received 1 mg, and five 20 mg of each mAb). Tumor:serum ratios of 131I-CC49 were better than those of 125I-B72.3 (P < 0.01 at 1 mg P = 0.05 at 20 mg
