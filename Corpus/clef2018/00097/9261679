Reduced protein adsorption on plastics via direct plasma deposition of triethylene glycol monoallyl ether. The direct plasma-induced deposition of tri(ethylene glycol) monoallyl ether is reported. RF plasma polymerization of this monomer was carried out under both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed plasma operation. The major focus of this work was optimization of the degree of retention of the C-O-C bonds of the starting monomer during the deposition process. This successfully was accomplished using low RF power during the CW runs and low RF duty cycles during the pulsed plasma experiments. Spectroscopic analysis of the plasma films revealed a strong dependence of film composition on the RF power and duty cycles employed. In particular, an unusually high level of film chemistry compositional control was demonstrated for the pulsed plasma studies, with film composition varying in a steady, progressive fashion with sequential changes in the ratios of plasma on to plasma off times. This film chemistry controllability is demonstrated despite the relatively low volatility of the starting monomer. The utility of this plasma deposition approach in introducing polyethylene oxide (PEO) structures on solid substrates was evaluated via protein adsorption studies. Radiolabeled bovine albumin adsorption was studied on plasma-modified poly(ethylene teraphthalate) (PET) substrates. Dramatic reductions in both initial adsorption and retention of this protein were observed on PET samples having maximal PEO content relative to its adsorption on untreated PET surfaces. Good stability and adhesion of the plasma films to the underlying PET substrates were observed, as evidenced from prolonged immersion of plasma-treated surfaces in aqueous solution. Overall, the results obtained from the present work provide additional support for the utility of one-step plasma process to reduce biological fouling of surfaces via deposition of PEO surface units.
