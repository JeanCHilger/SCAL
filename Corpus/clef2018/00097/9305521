Tonotopic organization of human auditory cortex analyzed by SPET. Single photon emission tomography (SPET) was used to map blood flow increases in the temporal and parietal cortex of 16 normally-hearing subjects after auditory stimulation. Eight subjects were stimulated with a multifrequency 40 dB HL pure tone at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz, each frequency varying every 30 s. Single 500 Hz pure tones at 40 dB HL were delivered to the remainder of the subjects. Five bilaterally deaf subjects were used as controls. Marked cerebral flow increase following acoustic stimulation with a significantly prevalent activation of the contralateral temporal cortex was achieved (p < 0.001). According to the tonotopic organization of the human auditory cortex, low monofrequency stimulation activated the most lateral sagittal tomograms (from 48.75 to 56.25 mm laterally to the brain midline) only, while multifrequency stimuli activated all sagittal tomograms (from 18.75 to 56.25 mm). On the basis of these results, it is likely that SPET is able to give real information on the cortical distribution of the auditory frequency range, taking into account the number and position of the activated slices. Further clinical investigations in order to define the relationships among blood flow cortical increases, stimulus intensity and auditory threshold, are in progress.
