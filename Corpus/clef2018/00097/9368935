Right medial temporal-lobe contribution to object-location memory. An important aspect of normal human memory, and one humans share with many other species, is the ability to remember the location of objects in their environment. There is by now strong evidence from the study of epileptic patients undergoing brain surgery that right temporal-lobe lesions that encroach extensively upon the hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus impair the delayed, but not the immediate, recall of the location of objects within a random array. These findings have now been extended to a multiple-trial, spatial-array learning task by including not only patients tested after unilateral anterior temporal lobectomy but also those with a selective left or right amygdalohippocampectomy, it has been shown that the deficits associated with right hippocampal lesions are not dependent upon conjoint damage to the lateral temporal neocortex. Furthermore, the fact that on the learning task no group differences were seen on Trial 1, at zero delay, strengthened the view that the impairment was in the maintenance and subsequent retrieval of information rather than in its initial encoding. These results left unresolved the question of whether the deficit was in the mediation of object-place associations or whether it could be reduced to a more general impairment in memory for location as such. Also left unanswered was the neuroanatomical question as to the relative contributions of the hippocampus and the parahippocampal gyrus to the performance of the experimental tasks. These questions were addressed in two blood-flow activation studies that made use of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and incorporated computerized versions of object-location and simple-location memory tasks. Taken together, the results point to a special contribution from the anterior part of the right parahippocampal gyrus, probably corresponding to the entorhinal cortex, to the retrieval of object-place associations, a result consonant with neurophysiological findings in non-human primates.
