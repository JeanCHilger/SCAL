Multislice imaging of quantitative cerebral perfusion with pulsed arterial spin labeling. A method is presented for multislice measurements of quantitative cerebral perfusion based on magnetic labeling of arterial spins. The method combines a pulsed arterial inversion, known as the FAIR (Flow-sensitive Alternating Inversion Recovery) experiment, with a fast spiral scan image acquisition. The short duration (22 ms) of the spiral data collection allows simultaneous measurement of up to 10 slices per labeling period, thus dramatically increasing efficiency compared to current single slice acquisition protocols. Investigation of labeling efficiency, suppression of unwanted signals from stationary as well as intraarterial spins, and the FAIR signal change as a function of inversion delay are presented. The assessment of quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) with the new technique is demonstrated and shown to require measurement of arterial transit time as well as suppression of intraarterial spin signals. CBF values measured on normal volunteers are consistent with results obtained from H2O15 positron emission tomography (PET) studies and other radioactive tracer approaches. In addition, the new method allows detection of activation-related perfusion changes in a finger-tapping experiment, with locations of activation corresponding well to those observed with blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI.
