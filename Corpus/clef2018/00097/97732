Radionuclide emission computed tomography of the body of laboratory animals. Selective studies in the monkey and baboon demonstrate the normal physiologic distribution of 99mTc radiopharmaceuticals using single-photon emission computed tomography. The cases demonstrated the ability of the Cleon Transverse Section Brain Imager TM to do emission computed tomography of various organs. This experience shows what can be expected when equipment for emission computed tomography of the body becomes available for patient studies.
