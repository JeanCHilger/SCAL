Use of 123I-BMIPP single-photon emission tomography to estimate areas at risk following successful revascularization in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Previous studies have indicated that iodine-123 labelled beta-methyliodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP), an iodinated fatty acid analogue, can identify persistent alteration of fatty acid metabolism after restoration of blood flow. To assess whether fatty acid imaging can delineate areas at risk following successful revascularization in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), BMIPP findings at 1 week post AMI were compared with perfusion imaging before and after revascularization therapy. Sixty-five patients with AMI underwent technetium-99m tetrofosmin single-photon emission tomography (SPET) before m (TF0) and 1 week (TF1) after successful revascularization therapy. BMIPP SPET was also performed under a fasting state at 1 week (BM1) post AMI. The extent scores were calculated from the defect scores in 20 segments. The BM1 score (7.7 +/- 3.9) was similar to the TF0 score (8.8 +/- 4.2) (r = 0.86, P < 0.0001), but significantly higher than the TF1 score (5.8 +/- 3.9) (P < 0.0001). A significant correlation was observed between the BM1 score and TF0 score (r = 0.86, P < 0.0001). Among a total of 1300 segments, the BM1 score was identical to the TF0 score in 1156 (88.9%). These data indicate that the ability of BMIPP imaging at 1 week post AMI to identify areas at risk is similar to that of tetrofosmin perfusion imaging in the acute phase. This may be due to the impairment of fatty acid uptake and metabolism reflecting prior severe ischaemic insult which persists at least 1 week after recovery of perfusion in the acute phase of AMI.
