Delay in revascularization is associated with increased mortality rate in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and viable myocardium on fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging. The identification of high-risk patients who require early revascularization has become increasingly important with the present emphasis on reducing health care resources. This is particularly relevant to health care systems with prolonged waiting times for interventions. Myocardial viability imaging with the use of fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET may help to identify high-risk patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the consequences of prolonged waiting time on cardiac outcomes in patients with left ventricular dysfunction directed to revascularization based on FDG PET imaging.Forty-six patients with coronary disease and an ejection fraction of < or = 35% were considered candidates for revascularization based on FDG PET viability imaging. Thirty-five of 46 patients were subsequently accepted for revascularization. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the median waiting time after PET: an early group (< 35 days n = 18) and a late group (> or = 35 daysPreoperative FDG PET can be used to identify a high-risk group of patients who may benefit from early revascularization. A long waiting time for revascularization is associated with a high mortality rate and suggests that early revascularization is desirable after the identification of hibernating viable myocardium.
