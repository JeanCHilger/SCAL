Two-dimensional manipulation of confluently cultured vascular endothelial cells using temperature-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-grafted surfaces. Temperature-responsive hydration/dehydration changes in surface-grafted poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PIPAAm) were utilized for hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface property alterations in cell culture. In this report, we utilized PIPAAm-grafted surfaces to recover confluently-cultured vascular endothelial cells as coherent monolayers from this cell culture substrate and to transfer to new cell culture substrates. For this purpose, we used two different methods to recover and transfer cell monolayer cultures: (1) chitin membranes used as an apical side cell support during cultured cell transfer, allowing cell basal side reattachment to new culture substrates after transfer and (2) a cell culture insert (porous PET) used as both a support as well as new substrate, allowing basal surfaces of cultured cells to be exposed to the medium after transfer. In both cases, all cells grown on PIPAAm-grafted surfaces detach completely with maintenance of basement membrane-like structure. Recovered cells attach to the second culture surfaces, covering more than 60% of the new substrate, and retain approximately 90% viability and their original function as judged from tissue-type plasminogen activator secretion. This technique could be utilized to prepare novel bioartificial organs as well as cell co-culture systems by multi-layering different cell types to mimic tissue structures for tissue engineering.
