In vivo radiolabel quantification in small-animal models. Current developments in emission tomography especially designed for small-animal imaging are presented. Adaptations of the human tomography principles take advantage of the smaller field of view to achieve about 2-mm usable resolution. Some evaluations in rat tomography are presented, and the problems of limiting resolution of PET and SPECT systems are discussed. Finally, a new approach that more specifically takes into account the parameters induced by in vivo quantification in rodents is presented.
