Glucose tolerance and myocardial F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in normal regions in coronary heart disease patients. To elucidate the relation between glucose tolerance and myocardial uptake of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), FDG-PET with 75 g oral glucose loading was performed on 43 coronary artery disease patients (twice in 2 patients). The patients were divided into 4 groups based on the blood glucose level (BS) and the insulinogenic index (II): group 1, normal (n = 9) group 2, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, n = 12)
