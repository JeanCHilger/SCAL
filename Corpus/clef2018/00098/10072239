Predictors of outcome of medically treated patients with left main/three-vessel coronary artery disease by coronary angiography. This study examined the prognostic value of single-photon emission computed tomography in angiographically high-risk patients with left main and/or 3-vessel coronary artery disease who were treated medically. Multivariable Cox survival analysis revealed the single-photon emission computed tomography score (based on size of perfusion abnormality, multivessel abnormality, left ventricular dilation, and lung uptake) as the only independent predictor of outcome.
