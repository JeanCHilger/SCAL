Uptake of positron emission tomography tracers in experimental bacterial infections: a comparative biodistribution study of radiolabeled FDG, thymidine, L-methionine, 67Ga-citrate, and 125I-HSA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the localization of positron emission tomography (PET) tracers [2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG), thymidine, and L-methionine] in sites of bacterial infection, and to contrast this with that of other tracers. The left calf muscles of rats were infected with a suspension of Escherichia coli and the biodistribution of 18F- or 3H-FDG, 3H-thymidine, L-11C- or 3H-methionine, gallium-67 citrate (67Ga-citrate) and iodine-125 human serum albumin (125I-HSA) was determined in these animals. 3H-FDG uptake in the infectious foci was evaluated by autoradiography of histological sections. Although 18F-FDG, 67Ga-citrate, and 125I-HSA showed comparatively high uptake in the infected muscle [the percentage activity of injected dose (ID) per gram of tissue normalized for rat weight in kilogram (%ID/g)xkg at 2 h postinjection was as follows: 18F-FDG, 0.184+/-0.026 to 0.218+/-0.046 67Ga-citrate, 0.221+/-0.016
