Neurotoxicity in single photon emission computed tomography brain scans of patients reporting chemical sensitivities. The subset of patients reporting chemical sensitivity with neurocognitive complaints usually exhibits specific abnormalities of brain metabolism consistent with neurotoxicity, on imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). These recurrent neurotoxic patterns are characterized by a mismatch in tracer uptake between early- and late-phase imaging, multiple hot and cold foci throughout the cortex, temporal asymmetry and increased tracer uptake into the soft tissues and, sometimes, the basal ganglia. Previous studies confirm these neurotoxic findings in patients with neurotoxic chemical exposures and breast implants. Affective processes such as depression do not, alone, show this pattern. These abnormalities in SPECT images correlate with documented neurocognitive impairment. Controlled challenges to ambient chemicals can induce profound neurotoxic changes seen on SPECT imaging in chemically sensitive patients. Detoxification treatment techniques frequently produce significant improvement on brain SPECT brain imaging in these patients. Neurotoxicity appears to be characteristic in many cases of chemical sensitivity.
