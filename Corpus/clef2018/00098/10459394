Regional brain activity during transient self-induced anxiety and anger in healthy adults. Several studies have demonstrated that transient self-induced sadness activates anterior paralimbic structures. To further examine the specificity of these findings and the neural substrates involved in anger and anxiety, we studied the neural correlates of the induction of anxiety and anger in healthy adults.We used H2(15)O and positron emission tomography (PET) to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 16 healthy adults during the induction of transient anxiety, anger, and neutral emotions. Subjects achieved differential emotions by recalling prior life events while viewing affect-appropriate faces.Both the anxiety and anger conditions were associated with increased normalized rCBF in left inferior frontal and left temporal pole regions and decreased rCBF in right posterior temporal/parietal and right superior frontal cortex, compared to the neutral induction. Additionally, compared to neutral induction, anxiety was associated with increased rCBF in the left anterior cingulate and cuneus and decreased rCBF in right medial frontal cortex, while the anger induction was uniquely associated with increased rCBF in right temporal pole and thalamus.Self-generated transient states of anxiety and anger are associated with both overlapping and distinct regional brain activity patterns and provide a template for further dissection of specific components of normal and pathologic emotions.
