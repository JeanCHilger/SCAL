A novel, simple method of functional spleen volume calculation by liver-spleen scan. Spleen enlargement is commonly associated with portal hypertension from cirrhosis and may cause thrombocytopenia. Thus, accurate assessment of spleen size may be helpful in the clinical evaluation. Spleen length is not a precise estimate of spleen size because of the variation in spleen configuration, and spleen volumes measured by edging techniques can be tedious. We present a new method of measuring the functional spleen volume by liver-spleen scan (LSSs), validation experiments and some clinical data.The method involves measurement of the total spleen counts by SPECT and dividing by a representative voxel concentration on a single frame to obtain the organ volume. Validation included phantom studies and clinical evaluation in 443 consecutive patients, including 216 with histologic assessments of chronic liver disease (CLD) and 11 healthy volunteers.A calibration factor determined from phantoms was used to convert the calculated volume (CV) to the "true" volume (V): V = CV (0.956) - 66.5 (r = 0.9991 P < 0.001). The volume calculations were validated in a second group of phantoms (r= 0.981This novel spleen volume measurement detects serious liver disease and correlates with splenic hyperfunction.
