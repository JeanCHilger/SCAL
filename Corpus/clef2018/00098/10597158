Effect on canine oral health of adding chlorhexidine to a dental hygiene chew. A study to compare the effect of a dental hygiene chew with or without 0.2% chlorhexidine on the development of gingivitis and the accumulation of dental deposits was performed using 11 small dogs. Confirming previous data, the daily addition of a standard chew to a dry diet resulted in significantly less gingivitis and calculus after 3 weeks compared with feeding the dry diet alone. Addition of chlorhexidine to the chew made no difference to the degree of gingivitis or the amount of calculus that accumulated, but did result in significantly less plaque accumulation after 3 weeks. The abrasiveness of the chew, rather than the antibacterial activity of chlorhexidine, is likely to have contributed the most to the maintenance of oral health in dogs with mild gingivitis.
