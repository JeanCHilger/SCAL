Benefits of a 'dental hygiene chew' on the periodontal health of cats. A study was undertaken to determine the clinical efficacy of a chew designed to improve dental hygiene in the cat. The accumulation of dental deposits (plaque and calculus) and the effect on gingival inflammation were assessed in 15 client-owned cats while on two different regimens. In the first leg of the study, the cats were fed a nutritionally complete dry diet supplemented with one dental hygiene chew. In the second leg of the study, the same cats were fed only the nutritionally complete diet. This study demonstrated that the daily addition of the chew to the dry diet resulted in significantly less plaque and calculus accumulation on tooth surfaces. It was our experience that daily feeding of the chew helped maintain dental hygiene in cats however, regular professional therapy is still indicated.
