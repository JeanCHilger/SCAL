Dobutamine-stress electrocardiographically gated positron emission tomography for detection of viable but dysfunctional myocardium. This study was performed to determine whether low-dose dobutamine stress electrocardiography (ECG)-gated fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) can assess wall motion and identify myocardium without contractile reserve despite preserved FDG uptake.Fifty-three patients with myocardial infarction and normal sinus rhythm underwent ECG-gated FDG-PET and transthoracic echocardiography. Wall motion of 10 segments of the left ventricle was graded as normal, hypokinetic, or akinetic/dyskinetic.In 365 (76%) of 480 segments, assessment of wall motion was concordant between the 2 modalities. In 30 patients dobutamine-stress ECG-gated FDG-PET was performed. In 13 (50%) of 26 dysfunctional segments with normal FDG uptake, 16 (36%) of 44 dysfunctional segments with mildly reduced FDG uptake and 12 (25%) of 48 dysfunctional segments with moderately reduced FDG uptake, wall motion was improved by dobutamine infusion.Assessment of left ventricular wall motion with ECG-gated FDG-PET is feasible, and dobutamine stress ECG-gated FDG-PET can simultaneously identify metabolic viability and contractile reserve.
