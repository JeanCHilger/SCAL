Prognostic factors in anterior temporal lobe resections for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy: multivariate analysis. Even though there have been several studies on the prognostic factors of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) after lobectomy, no studies have been performed for homogeneous mesial TLE. Furthermore, most studies on the predictors of outcome of epileptic surgery were based on univariate analyses and did not consider modern epileptic surgery investigation modalities such as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). We attempted to identify the prognostic factors in anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) for mesial TLE with multivariate analysis.Ninety-three patients with mesial TLE (54 men and 39 women, mean age at surgery, 28.3 +/- 8.2 years) were included in the study. The primary outcome variable was the status of patients in the second postoperative year, classified as either seizure free (except aura), or not seizure free. Clinical, electroencephalographic, MRI, PET, Wada test, and pathological data were considered.Seventy-eight (84.0%) patients had remission of seizures. With univariate analysis, age at surgery (p < 0.001), epilepsy duration before surgery (p = 0.04), and ipsilateral hippocampal sclerosis on MRI (p = 0.02) were found to be significant. By using multivariate analysis, age at surgery (p = 0.001) and ipsilateral hippocampal sclerosis on MRI (p = 0.03) were found to be the most significant prognostic factors.Age at surgery and hippocampal sclerosis are independent prognostic factors for ATL in mesial TLE. These findings suggest that mesial TLE may be a progressive disorder, and surgical outcome is better when early ATL is performed.
