Comparison of two fluorine-18 labeled benzamide derivatives that bind reversibly to dopamine D2 receptors: in vitro binding studies and positron emission tomography. The purpose of the present set of studies was to characterize, in vitro and in vivo, two benzamide analogues, 2,3-dimethoxy-N-[1-(4-fluorobenzyl)piperidin4yl]benzamide (MBP) and 4'-fluoroclebopride (FCP), for studying dopamine D2 receptors with Positron Emission Tomography (PET). In vitro binding studies were conducted to determine the affinities of MBP and FCP to the three subtypes of dopamine D2 receptors: D2(long), D3, and D4 receptors. MBP was found to have a high affinity (Ki = 1-8 nM) for all three subtypes of the D2 receptor, whereas FCP had nanomolar affinity (Ki approximately 5.5 nM) for D2(long) and D3 receptors, and a lower affinity for D4 receptors (Ki = 144 nM). In vitro binding studies also revealed that MBP had a relatively high affinity for rho1 receptors (Ki = 11 nM) compared to FCP (Ki = 340 nM). PET imaging studies were conducted in rhesus monkeys with the fluorine-18 labeled analogues of each compound. Both [18F]MBP and [18F]FCP displayed reversible binding kinetics during the 3 h time course of PET. [18F]FCP was found to have a higher basal ganglia:cerebellum ratio and lower variability in the rate of washout from D2 receptors in vivo relative to [18F]MBP. Neither radiotracer was found to produce radiolabeled metabolites capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. The high rho1 binding affinity and low basal ganglia:cerebellum ratio of [18F]MBP indicate that this ligand may not be suitable for quantitative studies of D2 receptors. The results from the in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that [18F]FCP is a promising ligand for studying D2 receptors with PET.
