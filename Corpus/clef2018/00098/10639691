Dopamine transporter and D2-receptor density in late-onset alcoholism. Late onset type 1 alcoholism has been suggested to be associated with an underlying dopaminergic defect. Therefore, it is relevant to study both postsynaptic D2-receptor and presynaptic dopamine transporter (DAT) densities among alcoholics.We investigated DAT densities, along with striatal and extrastriatal dopamine D2-receptor densities, in nine nonviolent late-onset male alcoholics, who had no major mental disorder nor antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), and nine healthy controls.[123I]PE2I and [123I]epidepride were used in SPECT imaging.DAT occupancy ratios (striatum/cerebellum) were significantly lower among alcoholics than in controls. Extrastriatal D2-receptor occupancy ratios (temporal pole/cerebellum) were not significantly different between the groups.Striatal presynaptic DAT densities are decreased among type 1 alcoholics, and this finding is not associated with recent alcohol abuse.
