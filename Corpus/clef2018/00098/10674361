Neo-striatal rCBF correlates of psychomotor slowing in patients with major depression. Psychomotor slowing is a fundamental clinical feature of severe depression and is thought to reflect dysfunction within prefrontal-subcortical circuits. This study utilised a split-dose single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) scanning technique in association with a two-stage test of psychomotor speed. Twenty-five patients with primary depressive disorders were injected with technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) whilst performing each component of a two-stage psychomotor task. The first stage, 'simple reaction time' (RT) and the second stage, 'choice reaction time' (CRT), were each followed by 30-min SPECT scans. Regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to the left and right neo-striatum (caudate-putamen) were drawn, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) values were calculated. Importantly, the change in rCBF measure in the left neo-striatum was inversely correlated with RT (r = -0.48, P < 0.05). That is, the patients with the greatest psychomotor slowing initially showed the least increase in rCBF during the CRT condition. This effect was independent of age. The study demonstrates that a simple two-stage motor paradigm can be used to elicit rCBF correlates of psychomotor slowing in patients with primary depression. Such rCBF findings may implicate the neo-striatum in the neurobiology of major depression.
