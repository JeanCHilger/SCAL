Estimation of myocardial perfusion and viability using simultaneous 99mTc-tetrofosmin--FDG collimated SPECT. This study was designed to elucidate the usefulness of crosstalk correction for dual-isotope simultaneous acquisition (DISA) with 99mTc-tetrofosmin and FDG in estimating myocardial perfusion and viability.Eighteen patients with coronary artery disease were studied. First, SPECT was performed with a low-energy high-resolution collimator after a single injection of 99mTc-tetrofosmin (single 99mTc-tetrofosmin). Second, PET and DISA with an ultra-high-energy collimator were performed after glucose loading and an injection of FDG. DISA was designed to operate with simultaneous 3-channel acquisition, and weighted scatter correction of crosstalk from the 18F photopeak to the 99mTc photopeak was performed by modification of an existing dual-window technique. The FDG SPECT images were compared with the images obtained by PET. Both crosstalk-corrected and uncorrected 99mTc-tetrofosmin images were generated and compared with the single 99mTc-tetrofosmin images.Regional percentage uptake of FDG agreed well between DISA and PET. However, regional percentage uptake of 99mTc-tetrofosmin was generally higher on the uncorrected 99mTc-tetrofosmin images than on the single 99mTc-tetrofosmin images, especially in areas of low flow (percentage count of 99mTc-tetrofosmin > or = 50%). The crosstalk correction contributed to improving the agreement between regional percentage uptakes and significantly improved the detectability of myocardial perfusion-metabolism mismatching.With 3-channel acquisition and weighted-scatter correction of crosstalk from the 18F photopeak to the 99mTc photopeak, DISA with 99mTc-tetrofosmin and FDG is feasible for assessing regional myocardial perfusion and viability.
