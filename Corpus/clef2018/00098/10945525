Test-retest reproducibility of extrastriatal dopamine D2 receptor imaging with [123I]epidepride SPECT in humans. This study evaluated the test-retest reproducibility of D2 receptor quantification in the thalamus and temporal cortex using [123I]epidepride SPECT.Ten healthy volunteers (4 men, 6 women age range, 19-46 y) underwent 2 SPECT studies (interval, 2-26 d) using a bolus-plus-constant-infusion paradigm (bolus-to-infusion ratio = 6 hTest-retest variability and reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient) were 10.8% and 0.88, respectively, for plasma clearance and 15.3% and 0.77, respectively, for f1. The test-retest variability of brain-specific (target minus nondisplaceable) radioactivity was higher in the thalamus and temporal cortex than in the striatum, although reliability was comparable. Among the outcome measures, V3' showed better test-retest variability and reliability in the thalamus (13.3% and 0.75, respectively) and temporal cortex (13.4% and 0.86, respectively).Brain radioactivity was the main source of variability for quantification of extrastriatal D2 receptors with [123I]epidepride. The reproducibility of outcome measures in extrastriatal regions was good. However, because receptor density was lower in extrastriatal regions than in the striatum, the counting statistics in these regions were low and reproducibility was affected by the higher test-retest variability of brain-specific radioactivity. Compared with V3 and V3', RT showed less test-retest variability in the thalamus and temporal cortex but lower reliability. Moreover, measurement of RT may be affected by the presence of potential lipophilic metabolites entering the brain.
