PET studies of the effects of aerobic exercise on human striatal dopamine release. In vivo microdialysis studies have shown that exercise increases the concentration of dopamine (DA) in the striatum of the rat brain. It has also been shown that PET with [11C]raclopride can be used to assess changes in brain DA induced by drugs and by performance tasks such as playing a video game. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of exercise (treadmill running) on striatal DA release in the human brain.Twelve healthy volunteers (5 women, 7 men mean age, 32 +/- 5 yThe subjects ran at an average speed of 8.7 +/- 0.5 km/h (5.4 +/- 0.3 mph) and at an inclination of 3.3degrees +/- 2degrees. The maximum effort of running was maintained for 10-15 min. The heart rates of the subjects were increased by 143% +/- 47%. DA D2 receptor availability in the putamen after treadmill running (4.22 +/- 0.34) was no different from that of baseline (4.17 +/- 0.29 P < 0.6).No significant changes in synaptic DA concentration were detected, although the subjects exercised vigorously for 30 min.
