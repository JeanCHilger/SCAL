Accuracy of the automated assessment of left ventricular function with gated perfusion SPECT in the presence of perfusion defects and left ventricular dysfunction: correlation with equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography and echocardiography. Gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with automated methods allows the quantitative assessment of left ventricular function and perfusion however, its accuracy must be defined for patients with large earlier infarctions and severe rest perfusion defects, in whom the estimation of endocardial and epicardial borders might be more difficult, even with automated edge-detection techniques.We prospectively compared the automated measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and volumes from rest-injected gated Technetium 99m (Tc99m) perfusion SPECT with equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography (ERNA) in 62 patients and the assessment of regional function with echocardiography in 22 patients. Forty-six patients had an earlier myocardial infarction (mean defect size, 34% of left ventricle SD, 12.7%Automated gated SPECT provides an accurate assessment of ejection fraction and regional function, even in the presence of an earlier myocardial infarction with large perfusion defects and significant left ventricular dysfunction.
