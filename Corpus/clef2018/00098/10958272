Comparison of two three-dimensional gated SPECT methods with thallium in patients with large myocardial infarction. Two different commercially available gated single photon emission computed tomography (GSPECT) methods were compared in a population of patients with a major myocardial infarction.Rest thallium GSPECT was performed with a 90-degree dual-detector camera, 4 hours after injection of thallium-201 (Tl-201 185 MBq) in 43 patients (mean age, 62+/-12 years) with a large myocardial infarction (mean defect size, 33%+/-16%). End-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were calculated by using QGS (Cedars Sinai) and MultiDim (Sopha Medical Vision International, Buc, France). Images were reconstructed by using a 2.5 zoom and a Butterworth filter (order, 5Compared with LVG, QGS underestimated LVEF by means of an underestimation of mean EDV. MultiDim overestimated EDV and ESV. GSPECT EDV and ESV overestimation was demonstrated by means of Bland-Altman analysis to increase with left ventricular volume size (P<.05). The difference between LVG and GSPECT volumes was demonstrated by means of regression analysis to be correlated with infarction size. This effect was particularly important with MultiDim (P<.0001).In Tl-201 GSPECT, LVEF and volume measurements will vary according to the type of software used.
