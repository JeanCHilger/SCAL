Laboratory-scale mass production of a multi-micropatterned grafted surface with different polymer regions. In this article, we demonstrate laboratory-scale mass production of a regionally precise multi-micropatterned surface photo-graft-copolymerized with three water-soluble monomers based on the photochemistry of an iniferter, which means that it acts as an initiator, a transfer agent and a terminator, benzyl N, N-diethyldithiocarbamate. The surface was semi-automatically prepared using a combination of a custom-designed irradiation apparatus installed with a motor-controlled stage for a substrate and three photomasks with different line-patterned slits (number of slits 20, width 500 microm, length 10 mm), and carbon dioxide laser cutting apparatus. A particular region of poly(styrene-co-vinylbenzyl N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate) coated on a PET film was irradiated in a particular aqueous monomer solution while moving the irradiated portion stepwise after irradiation through each line of the photomask. Photo-graft-copolymerization was carried out sequentially with acrylic acid sodium salt (AANa), N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]acrylamide methiodide (DMAPAAm), and acrylamide (AAm) using differently patterned photomasks. Characterization of surface elemental distribution by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and light microscopic visualization by dye staining revealed a microprocessed surface with 20 sets of micropatterns, each of which had three line regions grafted with three different polymers. The irradiation of a carbon dioxide laser manipulated via computer-aided design (CAD) software onto the microprocessed surface resulted in automatic circular cutting for each set of micropatterns to mass-produce multi-micropatterned substrates for the study of substrate-dependent endothelial cell responses.
