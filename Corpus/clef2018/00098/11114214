Ratio-images calculated from interictal positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography for quantification of the uncoupling of brain metabolism and perfusion in epilepsy. Image processing techniques were applied to interictal positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain images to aid in the localization of epileptogenic foci by calculating a functional image that represents the degree of coupling between perfusion and metabolism. Uncoupling of these two functions has been demonstrated to be a characteristic of epileptogenic tissue in temporal lobe epilepsy and has the potential to serve as a diagnostic measure for localization in other areas as well.Interictal PET ((18)F-FDG) and interictal SPECT ((99m)Tc-HMPAO) scans were acquired from 11 epilepsy patients. The metabolism and perfusion images were three-dimensionally spatially registered, and a functional ratio-image was computed. These functional maps are overlaid onto a three-dimensional rendering of the same patient's magnetic resonance imaging anatomy.In all patients, an average uniform perfusion-to-metabolism ratio showed approximately constant values throughout most of the whole brain. However, the epileptogenic area (confirmed on surgery) demonstrated an area of elevated perfusion/metabolism in the grey matter.Although hypometabolism in the PET image was observed in most of these patients, the calculation of a functional ratio-image demonstrated localized foci that in some cases could not be observed on the PET image alone. The ratio-image also yields a quantitative measure of the uncoupling phenomenon.
