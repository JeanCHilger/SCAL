Surgeon's perspective in intractable childhood epilepsy. There is increased interest in the surgical management of epilepsy in children in the last decade or two. The plasticity of the developing brain and realization of the deleterious effects of uncontrolled seizures on the brain have prompted earlier surgery where indicated. All patients with uncontrolled partial seizures are potential candidates for surgery and merit a detailed presurgical evaluation. This consists of a detailed neurological evaluation, EEG, video EEG, a high resolution MRI, SPECT, and a neuropsychological evaluation. The outcome of properly selected cases for surgery is excellent and it offers the possibility of a cure. However, close coordination of a multidisciplinary team is essential for the successful implementation of any epilepsy surgery program.
