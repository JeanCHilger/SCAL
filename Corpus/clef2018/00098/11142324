SPECT in the year 2000: basic principles. SPECT has become a routine procedure in most nuclear medicine departments. SPECT provides significant technical challenges for the nuclear medicine technologist, as compared with planar imaging, in the areas of SPECT acquisition, image reconstruction, and data processing. Many new advances in SPECT methodology are becoming available, such as iterative reconstruction, multimodality fusion, and advanced gated cardiac SPECT. SPECT imaging is demanding and requires careful attention to proper acquisition protocols, whether circular or noncircular orbits, and postprocessing is becoming more complex with the addition of iterative reconstruction and attenuation correction algorithms, among others. Understanding the principles of SPECT is essential not only to produce the highest quality scans but also to identify image artifacts. After reading this article, the nuclear medicine technologist should be able to: (a) describe the historical development and benefits of SPECT imaging (b) state the impact of image matrix size, number of projections, and arc of rotation on final SPECT image quality
