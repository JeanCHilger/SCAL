Evaluation of prostate cancer using FDG-PET. The clinical usefulness of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was examined in 54 patients with prostate cancer. FDG accumulation was positive in 38 of 54 the prostates (70%), 3 of 8 the lymph node metastases (38%) and 10 of 16 the bone metastases (63%), which suggested that FDG-PET is not superior to other conventional imaging methods as a tool for tumor detection. On the other hand, a quantitative value for FDG uptake in the prostate, expressed as a standardized uptake value (SUV), significantly correlated to the histological grade, clinical stage and serum PSA of the patients. A decrease of SUV was observed in all the patients who responded to endocrine treatment, and the patients with high pre-treatment SUV were shown to be at the risk for disease progression after initial treatment. The present results indicated that FDG-PET could provide us with useful prognostic information for the patients with prostate cancer by evaluating the malignant potential of the tumor.
