Intrauterine growth restriction induces up-regulation of cerebral aromatic amino acid decarboxylase activity in newborn piglets: [18F]fluorodopa positron emission tomographis study. There is evidence that intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with altered dopaminergic function in the immature brain. However, the relevant enzyme activities have not been measured in the living neonatal brain together with brain oxidative metabolism. Therefore, fluorine-18-labeled 6-fluoro-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (FDOPA) was used together with positron emission tomography to estimate the activity of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase in the brain of 10 newborn IUGR piglets (2 to 5 d old body weight, 908 +/- 109 g) and in 10 normal-weight (3 to 5 d old
