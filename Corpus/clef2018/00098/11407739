Effects of exercise training on myocardial fatty acid metabolism in rats with depressed cardiac function induced by transient ischemia. The effects of exercise training on metabolic and functional recovery after myocardial transient ischemia were investigated in a rat model. Male Wistar Kyoto rats were subjected either to a 30-min left coronary artery occlusion followed by reperfusion or to a sham operation. At 4 weeks after operation, the rats were randomly assigned either to sedentary conditions or to exercise training for 6 weeks. In the ischemic rats, pinhole SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) imaging with thallium-201 (201Tl) and 123I-(rho-iodophenyl)-3-R,S-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) showed a reduction of both myocardial perfusion and fatty acid metabolism in the risk zone of the left ventricle (LV). The LV was dilated and the ejection fraction was decreased after ischemic injury. The severity score showed a significant decrease on both 201Tl and BMIPP (201Tl, from 19.9+/-2.7 to 17.0+/-2.2, p<0.05 BMIPP, from 21.5+/-2.4 to 18.6+/-1.9, p<0.05) after exercise training in the ischemic trained rats, but did not change significantly in their sedentary counterparts. Plasma levels of free fatty acids normalized in the ischemic trained rats, but elevated in the ischemic sedentary rats (0.53+/-0.05 vs 0.73+/-0.06 mmol/L, p<0.05). Furthermore, the trained rats had a significant increase in LV stroke volume (0.25+/-0.02 vs 0.21+/-0.01 ml/beat, p<0.05) and adaptive cardiac hypertrophy. These findings demonstrate that adaptive improvements in myocardial perfusion, fatty-acid metabolism and LV function were induced by exercise training after transient ischemia.
