Quantitative comparison of the bolus and steady-state methods for measurement of cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism: positron emission tomography study using 15O-gas and water. To evaluate a new simplified bolus method for measurement of cerebral perfusion and metabolism, the parametric images with that method were compared with those obtained from the conventional steady-state method with 15O-gas. The new method also provided images of arterial blood volume (V0), which is a different parameter from cerebral blood volume (CBV) obtained using a C15O technique. Seven healthy volunteers and 10 patients with occlusive cerebrovascular diseases underwent positron emission tomography (PET) scans with both methods. Three-weighted integration was applied to calculate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2) in the bolus method. Global and regional CBF and CMRO2 in volunteers were compared between the two methods and used as control data. Regional values in patients also were evaluated to observe differences between the bilateral hemispheres. Both rCBF and rCMRO2 were linearly well correlated between the two methods, although global difference in CMRO2 was significant. The difference in each parametric image except for V0 was significant between the bilateral hemispheres in patients. The bolus method can simplify oxygen metabolism studies and yield parametric images comparable with those with the steady-state method, and can allow for evaluation of V0 simultaneously. Increase in CBV without a change in V0 suggested the increase might mainly be caused by venous dilatation in the ischemic regions.
