The long-term effects of single peritonitis episodes on peritoneal equilibration test results in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients. The present study evaluates the long-term effects of single peritonitis episodes on peritoneal equilibration test (PET) results in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Twenty-five patients (10 men, 15 women) with a mean age of 37.4 +/- 18.7 years were enrolled in this study because all had uneventful peritoneal dialysis periods for more than one year after a first peritonitis episode. Data from a total of 69 PETs were available [25 from before the first peritonitis episode (initial PET), 23 within 1 year after the episode (1-year PET), and 21 within 1-2 years after the episode (2-year PET)]. The changes in the PET results were evaluated using the dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creatinine (D/PCr) and the dialysate-to-instilled glucose ratio (D4/D0) after a 4-hour dwell. The mean values of D/PCr and D4/D0 showed no statistically significant changes between the initial PETs, 1-year PETs, and 2-year PETs. However, analysis of the results for patients with culture-positive peritonitis (n = 17) revealed significant changes in the mean values of D/PCr and D4/D0 between the initial PET and the 2-year PET (0.63 +/- 0.06 vs 0.70 +/- 0.09, p = 0.01 and 0.41 +/- 0.05 vs 0.37 +/- 0.06, p = 0.04, respectively). The long-term effect of a definite bacterial peritonitis episode seems to be an increase in small-molecule transport. In patients with culture-negative peritonitis, the episode had less impact on peritoneal transport.
