Renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of water transport in the peritoneum. The present study was carried out to investigate changes in the expression of aquaporins (AQPs) in the peritoneum. The effects of the renin-angiotensin system on the expression of AQPs with and without angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II type 1a receptor blocker (ARB) were then examined. We divided 20 male Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats into four groups, dialyzed with these solutions: saline 10% glucose (TZ)
