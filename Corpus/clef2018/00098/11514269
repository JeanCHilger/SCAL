PET(CO(2)) inversely affects MSNA response to orthostatic stress. Arterial hypocapnia has been associated with orthostatic intolerance. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that hypocapnia may be detrimental to increases in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) during head-up tilt (HUT). Ventilation was increased approximately 1.5 times above baseline for each of three conditions, whereas end-tidal PCO(2) (PET(CO(2))) was clamped at normocapnic (Normo), hypercapnic (Hyper +5 mmHg relative to Normo), and hypocapnic (Hypo
