Scintigraphic imaging of the adrenal glands. This article presents the well established scintigraphic imaging techniques of the adrenal glands. Both adrenocortical scintigraphy with [131]6beta-iodomethylnorcholesterol (NP-59) and adrenomedullary imaging with 131I or 123I-labelled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) as function-dependant imaging techniques provide functional metabolic information for lesion characterization. They enable the distinction between unilateral and bilateral adrenal lesions. Furthermore, they have the advantage of giving the possibility of a whole body evaluation with a single administration of the tracer without additional radiation dose. On the other hand, radiological imaging modalities provide excellent anatomical details which is essential for planning therapy. Both radiological and scintigraphic imaging methods of the adrenal glands are necessary and should, therefore, be considered complementary.
