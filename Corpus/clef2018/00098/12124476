Biodistribution and dosimetry of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose labelled leukocytes in normal human subjects. This study was performed in order to assess [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose white blood cell ((18)F-FDG WBC) dosimetry in normal human subjects. Using previously reported methods, mixed cell suspensions of autologous leukocytes were prepared from four normal volunteers. Leukocytes were labelled in heparin-saline by incubation with (18)F-FDG at 37 degrees C for 20 min. After washing and resuspension, (18)F-FDG WBCs (225-315 MBq) were administered by intravenous injection. Whole-body imaging was performed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h using a GE Varicam with 511 keV collimation. Blood samples were obtained at corresponding times as well as fractionated urinary collection. Whole-body anterior and posterior images were used for calculation of organ dosimetry. Uptake of (18)F-FDG WBCs occurred predominantly within the reticulo-endothelial system. Plasma activity, urinary excretion (9.9+/-2.3% at 6 h), and brain uptake (1.7+/-0.4%) were consistent with partial elution of (18)F-FDG. Positron emission tomography imaging performed at 5-6 h after injection yielded good quality images of reticulo-endothelial uptake. Whole-body and organ dosimetry for (18)F-FDG WBCs in doses of 225-250 MBq are comparable with reported results for conventional doses of (111)In oxine labelled leukocytes. Further studies of (18)F-FDG WBC as an agent for positron emission tomography imaging of inflammatory disease appear warranted.
