Quantitative assessment of right ventricular structural abnormalities by right ventricular polar mapping of single photon emission computed tomogram. The identification of right ventricular (RV) abnormalities is clinically important in the evaluation of arrhythmogenic substrates in right ventricular-originated ventricular tachycardia (RVT). The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic benefit of quantitative analysis in RV single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging with (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin/sestamibi in patients with RVT. Thirty patients with RVT (15 with idiopathic RVT and 15 with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)) were compared with 27 control subjects (including 11 with right bundle branch block) with regard to the semiquantitative RV uptake score in each of six segments and the quantitative RV extent score in polar coordinate map displays by SPECT imaging. The RV total score and RV extent score were compared with the RV global function. Perfusion abnormalities were more frequently detected (P = 0.0001) in the ARVC group (59/90, 65.6%) than in the idiopathic RVT group (4/90, 4.4%) or controls (1/162, 0.6%). The RV extent score in the ARVC group (53.0 +/- 24.8) was significantly higher than that in the idiopathic RVT group (8.4 +/- 10.1) or controls (1.2 +/- 4.9). The RV extent score correlated well with the regional RV perfusion score (P < 0.0001) and with the RV ejection fraction (P < 0.0001). Non-invasive RV perfusion mapping using a (99m)Tc-labelled tracer is useful for the quantitative evaluation of RV substrates in patients with ARVC.
