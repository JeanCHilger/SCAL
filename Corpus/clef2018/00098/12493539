Imaging [18F]FAU [1-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl) uracil] in dogs. We have studied the biodistribution of [(18)F]FAU [(1-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)uracil], which previous work has shown is incorporated into DNA and functions as an inhibitor of DNA synthesis. It is being tested as a potential antineoplastic agent and imaging agent for PET. We have produced [(18)F]FAU and injected the tracer into 3 normal dogs and imaged them for up to 4 hours and removed tissues along with blood and urine samples for HPLC and activity analysis. The results showed that [(18)F]FAU evenly distributed to most of organs. In sharp contrast to our prior experience with thymidine and its analogs, marrow had less retention of [(18)F]FAU than the non-proliferating tissues.
