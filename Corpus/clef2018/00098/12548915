The method and development of computer-assisted surgery. The methodology and the state of the art of Computer-Assisted Surgery (CAS) are introduced in this paper. Computer-assisted surgery is a new high technology which uses computer science, biomedical engineering, mechanism, mathematics, surgery, and so on. Its objective is to help surgeons use multimodal data, such as CT, MRI, DSA, PET, et al. in a rational and quantitative way in order to plan and perform medical intervention. Stereotactic localization method and registration are two cruxes in computer-assisted surgery. There are several methods for localization and registration. In recent ten years, computer-assisted surgery has been a cynosure of scientists. Some computer-assisted surgery systems have been used in clinical practice.
