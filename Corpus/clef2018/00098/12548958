Molecular cloning of enhancin gene from Helicoverpa armigera granulosis virus and its expression in E. coli. In order to provide recombinant enhancin for studying its mechanism of increasing the mortality of larvae infected by HaNPV and creating new insecticide, enhancin gene from Helicoverpa armigera granulosis virus was amplified by PCR technique. 2.7 kb fragment of enhancin gene was cloned into EcoRI/XbaI site of plasmid pBluescript KS. Sequence analysis revealed that enhancin gene was similar with that reported in the literature except eight nucleotides and five amino acids. Thereby enhancin gene was inserted into vector pET-30a and expressed successfully in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The preliminary bioassay of expressed product and HaNPV indicated that mortality of larvae increased 31.7%-34.1% in 7 post-infection days and the LT50 decreased at least 1.5-2.1 days.
