RMDP: a dedicated package for 131I SPECT quantification, registration and patient-specific dosimetry. The limitations of traditional targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) dosimetry can be overcome by using voxel-based techniques. All dosimetry techniques are reliant on a sequence of quantitative emission and transmission data. The use of (131)I, for example, with NaI or mIBG, presents additional quantification challenges beyond those encountered in low-energy NM diagnostic imaging, including dead-time correction and additional photon scatter and penetration in the camera head. The Royal Marsden Dosimetry Package (RMDP) offers a complete package for the accurate processing and analysis of raw emission and transmission patient data. Quantitative SPECT reconstruction is possible using either FBP or OS-EM algorithms. Manual, marker- or voxel-based registration can be used to register images from different modalities and the sequence of SPECT studies required for 3-D dosimetry calculations. The 3-D patient-specific dosimetry routines, using either a beta-kernel or voxel S-factor, are included. Phase-fitting each voxel's activity series enables more robust maps to be generated in the presence of imaging noise, such as is encountered during late, low-count scans or when there is significant redistribution within the VOI between scans. Error analysis can be applied to each generated dose-map. Patients receiving (131)I-mIBG, (131)I-NaI, and (186)Re-HEDP therapies have been analyzed using RMDP. A Monte-Carlo package, developed specifically to address the problems of (131)I quantification by including full photon interactions in a hexagonal-hole collimator and the gamma camera crystal, has been included in the dosimetry package. It is hoped that the addition of this code will lead to improved (131)I image quantification and will contribute towards more accurate 3-D dosimetry.
