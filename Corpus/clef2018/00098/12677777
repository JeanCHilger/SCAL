Clinical surveillance after surgery for prostate cancer. The incidence of prostate cancer is remarkably increased in the last decade. This dramatic epidemiological change can be primarily attributed to the widespread use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) as a diagnostic tool. Nowadays most of the prostate cancers are detected at an early stage and the age of the patients is decreased. This has led to a significantly increase in the number of prostate cancer patients treated by radical prostatectomy. Serum determination of PSA is the standard method to monitor the disease after radical surgery, while other tests can be required only when PSA is detectable. After radical prostatectomy the mean half-life of PSA is 1.5 days and it must become undetectable to consider a patient free of disease. A value greater than 0.4 ng/ml, with an increase in two determination, indicates a recurrence of the disease. PSA is an extremely sensitive marker. In fact, in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, the presence of detectable serum PSA levels allows to detect tumor recurrence even before any other diagnostic investigation (radiological or scintigraphical) becomes able to document it ("serological" disease). Unfortunately, increasing serum PSA levels do not reveal whether a patient is affected by local relapse or by metastases, with obvious repercussion for the therapeutic choice. Clinical examination of the patient, together with random and echoguided biopsies of the vesico-urethral anastomosis, do not reveal all cases of local recurrence. Ongoing study are evaluating other diagnostic tools in the monitoring patients after radical prostatectomy, such as the serum chromogranin A, the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for PSA and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), the Positron Emission Tomography and the immunoscintigraphy with radiolabeled monoclonal antibody directed toward the PSMA.
