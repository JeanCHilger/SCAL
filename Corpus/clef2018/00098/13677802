Evidence-based medicine: neuroimaging of seizures. Evidence-based medicine is useful in epilepsy and neuroimaging (Figs. 1 and 2). An understanding of the pretest probability suggests that focal neurologic deficits are important in predicting the outcome of neuroimaging examinations. In cases of nonacute symptomatic seizures, confusion and postictal deficits should prompt MR evaluation. In remote symptomatic seizures, MR imaging should be performed in a child with unexplained cognitive or motor delays or a child less than 1 year of age. Patients with partial seizures, abnormal EEG, or generalized epilepsy also should be imaged. Acute seizures should be imaged with CT to exclude hemorrhage and because of the availability and speed of the modality. Ictal SPECT is the best neuroimaging examination to localize seizure activity. MR imaging can offer prediction of surgical outcome and may hold promise in the future for dimensional localization of seizure focus. Evidence-based medicine can only work if there is physician communication. The pretest probability is helpful only when an accurate history is provided to the consulting physician. This field will flourish if physicians can develop accurate methods of collating information and reporting it in a timely fashion in the literature.
