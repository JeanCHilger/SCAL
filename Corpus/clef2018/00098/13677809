Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and primary lateral sclerosis: evidence-based diagnostic evaluation of the upper motor neuron. Magnetic resonance imaging and MR spectroscopy are important tools in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected motor neuron disease. Further investigation is needed to determine and to compare the utility of various neuroimaging markers for diagnosis and disease progression [112]. Newer MR tools, such as diffusion tensor imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, and functional MR imaging, have substantial promise as scientific and clinical tools in this ongoing endeavor.
