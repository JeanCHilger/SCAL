Physiological evaluation of a new quantitative SPECT method measuring regional ventilation and perfusion. We have developed a new quantitative single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) method that uses (113m)In-labeled albumin macroaggregates and Technegas ((99m)Tc) to estimate the distributions of regional ventilation and perfusion for the whole lung. The multiple inert-gas elimination technique (MIGET) and whole lung respiratory gas exchange were used as physiological evaluations of the SPECT method. Regional ventilation and perfusion were estimated by SPECT in nine healthy volunteers during awake, spontaneous breathing. Radiotracers were administered with subjects sitting upright, and SPECT images were acquired with subjects supine. Whole lung gas exchange of MIGET gases and arterial Po(2) and Pco(2) gases was predicted from estimates of regional ventilation and perfusion. We found a good agreement between measured and SPECT-predicted exchange of MIGET and respiratory gases. Correlations (r(2)) between SPECT-predicted and measured inert-gas excretions and retentions were 0.99. The method offers a new tool for measuring regional ventilation and perfusion in humans.
