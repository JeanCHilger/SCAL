Neuroanatomical localization for clinical SPECT perfusion brain imaging: a practical proportional grid method. For the purpose of facilitating anatomical localization in interpretation of 99Tcm-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) brain single photon emission tomographic (SPECT) scans, a stereotaxic proportional grid system was applied in the form of an interactive computer program. This method takes advantage of a rotating gamma camera system which permits planar scout imaging for the determination of anatomical reference lines, and standardization of tomographic slices for brain size. Using measurements made on a lateral planar HMPAO image, proportional grids were constructed onto standardized transaxial images. This method was implemented for 33 clinical HMPAO SPECT studies. It required less than 15 min of an operator's time. This simple and practical neuroanatomical localization technique can be instrumental as an aid to the interpretation of routine clinical HMPAO SPECT images.
