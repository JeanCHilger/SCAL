Action of labetalol on norepinephrine myocardial content in left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients. The high incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy shows the great interest in understanding the pathophysiology of this process. Many reports suggest the role of catecholamines in generating left ventricular hypertrophy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of labetalol on myocardial norepinephrine content in hypertensive subjects with left ventricular hypertrophy by using an isotopic norepinephrine marker, the 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG). Eight male and female hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy were investigated after a 30 day placebo period. Resting, ambulatory and effort blood pressure was measured. Echocardiographic parameters allowed measure of left ventricular mass index according to Devereux. And we considered left ventricular hypertrophy as left ventricular mass index greater than 120 g/m2. Cardiac and mediastinal radioactivity is detected 4 h after a 4 mCi i.v. injection of 123I-MIBG and MIBG myocardial uptake is definite as the cardiac/mediastinal ratio (N : 1.78 +/- 0.19). All subjects received at the beginning of the study (D0) 2 tablets of labetalol 200 mg, increased to 4 tablets if diastolic blood pressure during follow-up remained above 95 mmHg. Patients again underwent these explorations after 3 months of treatment (D90). Labetalol decreases in considerable manner MIBG myocardial uptake as it has been shown that it decreases tissular norepinephrine content in experimental studies. Therefore, MIBG myocardial uptake seems to be a reliable tool in evaluating drugs effect on cardiac sympathetic nervous system.
