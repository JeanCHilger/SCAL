Functional imaging of the brain using single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). The use of tracers is an important technique available for studying cerebral function. Changes in 'signal' are large, but as a result of its photon limited nature, the measurement of this signal is limited: spatially, temporally and in terms of accuracy. The most commonly used single photon (SPECT) system (as apposed to positron) is that with a rotating gamma camera, although multi-headed devices and special purpose rings are now also commonly available. The problems of obtaining good functional information are however identical. Firstly the devices need to be optimised in terms of resolution and sensitivity. Secondly several sources of error, notably those associated with scatter, attenuation and limited spatial resolution, need to be corrected, with the aim of obtaining quantitative estimates of radioactivity concentration. Finally such quantitative estimates need to be converted into meaningful estimates of physiological variables by use of an appropriate model. The general aim of many SPECT measurements is to estimate blood flow for example using Tc-99m labelled HMPAO as a tracer. Good results have been obtained in many clinical conditions: stroke, dementia, tumour and epilepsy, for example. Many other tracers are also available, for example to measure density of receptor sites. The use of SPECT in conjunction with other techniques after image registration is suggested as being an essential tool in extracting maximal clinical information.
