(11)C]methionine positron emission tomography and survival in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas treated by carbon ion radiotherap. The development of the novel carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in the treatment of refractory cancers has resulted in the need for a way to accurately evaluate patient prognosis. We evaluated whether L-[methyl-(11)C]-methionine (MET) uptake and its change after CIRT were the early survival predictors in patients with unresectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas.MET positron emission tomography was prospectively performed in 62 patients with unresectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas before and within 1 month after CIRT. Tumor MET uptake was measured with the semiquantitative tumor:nontumor ratio (T/N ratio). The MET uptake in the tumor and relevant clinical parameters were entered into univariate and multivariate survival analysis.The overall median survival time was 20 months. Patients with a baseline T/N ratio of <or=6 had a significant better survival than patients with a baseline T/N ratio >6 (2-year survival rate: 69.4% versus 32.3% P = 0.01). Patients with a post-CIRT ratio of <or=4.4 had a better survival than that with a post-CIRT ratio >4.4 (2-year survival rate: 63.7% versus 41.3%MET uptake as measured by either baseline or post-CIRT T/N ratio was an independent predictor of survival in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas treated by carbon ion radiotherapy, whereas post-therapeutic MET uptake change might have potential value for the same purpose.
