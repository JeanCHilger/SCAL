In vivo evaluation of tumor response to radiosurgery: application to vestibular schwannomas. Imaging follow-up of vestibular schwannomas (VS), such as CT or MR, does not allow assessing the response of the tumor tIssue to radiosurgery. Changes in contrast enhancement are frequently observed, with a loss of contrast enhancement within the treated VS. However, this typical aspect does not anticipate the long-term success of radiosurgery for VS. New functional and metabolic image modalities could be useful to assess in vivo radiosurgery-induced tIssue changes. Such data already exist, using techniques such as MR spectroscopy, positron emission tomography (PET) and SPECT, but they concern almost exclusively the evaluation of primary SNC tumors and metastases of systemic cancers. There are, however, very sparse metabolic and functional data concerning the in vivo evaluation of the response of the tumor tIssue to radiosurgery. Moreover, such information is only anecdotal in VS. In other disorders, PET and MR spectroscopy data suggest interesting new directions for the assessment of radiosurgery follow-up. Based on the predictive information provided by PET and MR spectroscopy in primary CNS tumors, it would be worthwhile to design a prospective study evaluating the role of these imaging modalities for in vivo assessment of radiosurgery-treated SV.
