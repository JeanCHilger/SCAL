The role of positron emission tomography with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose in the evaluation of the epilepsies. Cerebral glucose metabolic mapping using positron emission tomography (PET) and 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) has been extensively studied in the epilepsies. Regions of interictal glucose hypometabolism are highly associated with cerebral sites of seizure generation-propagation in focal epilepsies. The volume of reduced glucose metabolism is often widespread and even bilateral in focal epilepsies, although ictal onset zones typically are located at the sites of most severe hypometabolism within a larger volume of hypometabolism.
