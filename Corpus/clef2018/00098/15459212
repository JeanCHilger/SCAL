Scintigraphic response by 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan correlates with event-free survival in high-risk neuroblastoma. To investigate whether response to induction therapy, evaluated by metaiodobenzylguanadine (MIBG) and bone scintigraphy, correlates with event-free survival (EFS) in children with high-risk neuroblastoma (NB).Twenty-nine high-risk NB patients were treated prospectively with an intensive induction regimen and consolidated with three cycles of high-dose therapy with peripheral blood stem-cell rescue. The scintigraphic response was evaluated by MIBG and bone scans using a semi-quantitative scoring system. The prognostic significance of the imaging scores at diagnosis and following induction therapy was evaluated.A trend associating worse 4-year EFS rates for patients with versus without osteomedullary uptake on MIBG scintigraphs at diagnosis was seen (35% +/- 11% v 80% +/- 18%, respectively P =.13). Similarly, patients with positive bone scans at diagnosis had worse EFS than those with negative scans, although the difference did not receive statistical significance (34% +/- 10% v 83% +/- 15%, respectivelyMIBG scores >/= 3 following induction therapy identifies a subset of NB patients who are likely to relapse following three cycles of high-dose therapy with peripheral blood stem-cell rescue, local radiotherapy, and 13-cis-retinoic acid. Alternative therapeutic strategies should be considered for patients with a poor response to induction therapy.
