Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in head and neck cancer. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluordeoxyglucose is a diagnostic imaging technique very useful in the management of head and neck cancer, better than anatomic imaging in most cases. PET shows higher diagnostic accuracy in the detection of local and regional tumor recurrences. PET is also indicated for the identification of unknown primary tumors when regional nodal metastasis is the presenting feature. The improved planning of radiation therapy with hybrid cameras PET-CT, the earlier diagnosis of post-radiotherapy residual disease and the possibility of monitoring the effects of chemotherapy makes PET imaging an important tool in evaluating tumor response to treatment.
