Contractile reserve, thallium-201 reverse redistribution and mismatch between perfusion and metabolism in reperfused infarct-related myocardium with delayed and incomplete functional recovery. We investigated simultaneously the correlations between dobutamine-induced contractile reserve (CC), thallium-201 reverse redistribution (RR) and a mismatch between perfusion and metabolism (MM) to the magnitude of functional recovery. In 32 patients with coronary angioplasty early after infarction, echocardiography was performed at low-dose dobutamine stress within 1 week and at resting state at 1 month. Thallium-201/iodine-123 beta-methyl-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) dual-isotope single photon emission tomography was performed at 1 month. Wall motion and the uptake of each tracer were scored as 0 to 2 in the infarct-related segments, and CC, RR, and MM were evaluated in the infarct-related segments. In 71 akinetic or dyskinetic segments before reperfusion, the initial thallium-201 uptake and initial BMIPP uptake scores and the 4 hour redistribution thallium-201 uptake scores were less severe in the group with complete functional recovery (group A), followed by the group with incomplete recovery (group B) and then the group with no recovery (group C) (each P < 0.0001). CC was the greatest in group A, followed by group B, and then group C (76.2% in 16/21, 60% in 15/25, 36% in 9/25, P = 0.0212). RR and MM were greater in group B (52% in 13 and 64% in 16) than in groups A and C (19% in 4 and 8% in 2, 33.3% in 7 and 24% in 6, P = 0.0013 and P = 0.0113). The intensity of functional damage reflects perfusion and metabolism, but the delayed and incomplete functional recovery after reperfusion may be closely related to RR, MM, and CC.
