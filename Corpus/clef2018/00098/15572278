The homozygosity for 10-repeat allele at dopamine transporter gene and dopamine transporter density in Korean children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: relating to treatment response to methylphenidate. The symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be treated with methylphenidate (MPH), a potent blocker of dopamine transporter (DAT). The homozygosity of the 10-repeat allele at the DAT gene (DAT1) seems to be associated with a poor response to MPH in children with ADHD. In the present study, we investigated the association between DAT density using I-123-N-(3-iodopropen-2-yl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl)tropane [123I]IPT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)] and the homozygosity for 10-repeat allele at DAT1 and response to MPH in Korean children with ADHD. Eleven drug-naive children with ADHD were included in the study and treated with MPH for about 8 weeks. After the genotyping and SPECT were performed, we compared DAT density between ADHD children with and without the homozygosity for 10-repeat allele at DAT1 and investigated the correlation between the homozygosity for 10-repeat allele and response to MPH. ADHD children with 10/10 genotype (n=7) had a significantly greater increase of the DAT density in basal ganglia than the children without 10/10 genotype (n=4). We found that while only 28.6% (2/7) of the subject with 10/10 genotype showed good response to MPH treatment, 100% (4/4) of the subjects without 10/10 genotype showed good response to MPH treatment. Our findings support an association between homozygosity for 10-repeat allele at DAT1 and the DAT density assessed in vivo and correlation between the homozygosity for 10-repeat allele and poor response to MPH.
