18F-FDG PET early after radiotherapy in lymphoma patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of postactinic inflammatory alterations that could lead to false-positive results in FDG-PET images, in a group of lymphoma patients studied with positron emission tomography (PET) early after the end of radiation therapy.Sixteen (16) consecutive patients were referred to our center for malignant lymphoma 14 of 16 patients had a mediastinal bulky mass at diagnosis. Each patient underwent chemotherapy and then radiotherapy (RT): for clinical reasons, shortly after RT (range, 25-56 daysDespite a relatively short time after RT, there was no pathological tracer uptake in 13 of 16 patients. In 3 cases, a mild increase in FDG uptake was observed, but no findings which would lead to a false-positive diagnosis. In 2 of 3 cases, postactinic pneumopathy was diagnosed (PET scan performed 51 and 52 days after RT) while in 1 patient, soft-tissue inflammation was present (PET scan performed 42 days after RT).Our data indicates that the rate of postactinic PET inflammatory alterations in lymphoma patients is not very high and appear to be not strictly linked to the elapsed time since the end of RT treatment.
