Growth of Dalbergia sissoo in desert regions of western India using municipal effluent and the subsequent changes in soil and plant chemistry. Increasing demand for fodder and fuelwood and the scarcity of a good quality water in arid areas has resulted in a search for an alternative source of water for biomass production. An experiment utilizing municipal effluent in growing Dalbergia sissoo was conducted. Five treatments included T1, municipal effluent at 1 PET (Potential evapo-transpiration) (without plant) T2, municipal effluent at 1/2 PET
