Accelerated embolization healing of aneurysms by polyethylene terephthalate coils seeded with autologous fibroblasts. The objective of this study was to develop a therapeutic system of aneurysm embolization on the basis of organization of fibrous tissue. The healing process of aneurysms by means of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fiber coils seeded with autologous fibroblasts was evaluated.The aneurysm was prepared at the common carotid artery of 42 rabbits by end-to-side anastomosis of the jugular vein pouch. PET fiber coils seeded with or without autologous fibroblasts were applied to the aneurysm. Assessment of the tissue appearance and histological examination were performed 3 and 5 weeks after application to evaluate the area embolized by fibrous organization in the aneurysm and the neointima formation at the aneurysm orifice.An agitated seeding method enabled autologous fibroblasts to attach and proliferate homogeneously on the PET fiber coil. In contrast to the PET fiber coil, the PET fiber coil seeded with autologous fibroblasts accelerated the organization of fibrous tissue in the aneurysm and time to achieve aneurysm embolization. The aneurysm orifice was closed with neointima formed. The aneurysm was histologically embolized with newly formed fibrous tissue, and the area embolized was significantly larger than that of nontreated and the PET fiber coil-treated groups. The orifice was completely covered with endothelial cells.The PET fiber coil seeded with autologous fibroblasts is a promising tool for healing aneurysms using embolization therapy by tissue organization.
