Myocardial perfusion reserve in adults with cyanotic congenital heart disease. In patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD), a right-to-left shunt results in systemic hypoxemia. Systemic hypoxemia incites a compensatory erythrocytosis, which increases whole blood viscosity. We considered that these changes might adversely influence myocardial perfusion in CCHD patients. Basal and hyperemic (intravenous dipyridamole) perfusion measurements were obtained with [13N]ammonia positron emission tomographic imaging in left (LV) and right (RV) ventricular and septal myocardium in 14 adults with CCHD [age: 34.1 yr (SD 6.5)] hematocrit: 62.2% (SD 4.8)] and 10 healthy controls [age: 34.1 yr (SD 6.5)]. In patients, basal perfusion measurements were higher in LV [0.77 (SD 0.24) vs. 0.55 ml x min(-1) x g(-1) (SD 0.09), P < 0.02], septum [0.71 (SD 0.16) vs. 0.49 ml x min(-1) x g(-1) (SD 0.09), P < 0.001], and RV [0.77 (SD 0.30) vs. 0.38 ml x min(-1) x g(-1) (SD 0.09), P < 0.001]. However, basal measurements normalized for the rate-pressure product were similar to those of controls. Calculated oxygen delivery relative to rate-pressure product was higher in the patients [2.2 (SD 0.8) vs. 1.6 (SD 0.4) x 10(-5) ml O2 x min(-1) x g tissue(-1) x (beats x mmHg)(-1) in the LV, P < 0.05, and 2.0 (SD 0.7) vs. 1.4 (SD 0.3) x 10(-5) ml O2 x min(-1) x g tissue(-1) x (beats x mmHg)(-1) in the septum, P < 0.01]. Hyperemic perfusion measurements in CCHD patients did not differ from controls [LV, 1.67 (SD 0.60) vs. 1.95 ml x min(-1) x g(-1) (SD 0.46)
