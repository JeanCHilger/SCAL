Prenatal diagnosis and management of twin pregnancies complicated by a co-existing molar pregnancy. Recent advances in ultrasound and molecular genetics have increased our understanding and hence enhanced the perinatal management of complete and partial hydatidiform mole. By contrast, the management of a twin pregnancy combining a normal pregnancy with a normal fetus and a complete hydatidiform mole (CHM) remains complex and controversial due to conflicting data from different parts of the world. The aim of this review is to analyse the international literature on twin pregnancies that include a mole, present the complications and outcome of pregnancy and to discuss the perinatal management. Management is complicated and women should be counselled about the maternal and fetal complications, and the pregnancy monitored carefully by a perinatal team with experience in high-risk obstetrics and access to neonatal care. The data reviewed here suggest that a woman who decides to continue with the pregnancy including a CHM must be aware that, overall, she only has a one in four chance of live birth and in around 35% of cases she will develop persistent trophoblastic disease (PTD) after delivery. In ongoing pregnancies, there will be, in at least 20% of the cases, an early onset of pre-eclampsia (PET) and a 29% risk of fetal loss due to late miscarriage, intrauterine death and neonatal death. Maternal serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (MShCG) could be useful in predicting outcome in twin pregnancy combining normal pregnancy and CHM, but this needs to be investigated prospectively.
