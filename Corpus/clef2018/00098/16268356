Target volume calculation methods based on PET-CT images. The applications of PET-CT have developed from qualitative analysis to quantitative analysis. Target volume is important for tumor biological volume defining, tumor isotope therapy, organ function evaluation, acceptor affinity calculation, and pharmaceutical metabolic kinetics. Many factors work on the target volume calculation, such as PET image acquisition mode, scatter correction, attenuation correction, reconstruction method, image display mode, positron pharmacy. The commonly-used methods of target volume calculation are background-threshold, max threshold, and background-max threshold. In this article we will discuss about the methods of target volume calculation.
