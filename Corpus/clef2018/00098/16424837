Speech activation SPECT and plasticity of language networks. Neuronal activity might be measured by regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) as there is a close relationship between neuronal activity and rCBF changes. In order to study the hemispheric dominance for language and the plasticity of language networks by measuring the rCBF rest and language activation SPECT studies were performed in the presurgical evaluation of ten right-handed and two left handed patients with brain lesions of the dominant hemisphere. A special group of hemisphere-specific neuropsychologic tasks were used for activation, after a proper psychologic conditioning. The rCBF results were calculated by comparing the rest and activation SPECT data using a special regions of interest program and asymmetry index (AI). We compared the results of speech-activation to the results of clinical, morphological (MRI), and postoperative data. In controls, significant activation was found in Brodmann's area 44 and 45, contralateral cerebellum, superior middle and posterior temporal gyrus. In patients, additional regions of activation were seen in contralateral frontal and temporal regions, and in ipsilateral temporal region. AIs of the cerebellum demonstrated a negative correlation with hemispheric dominance for language. In conclusion, significant changes in rCBF in or adjacent to the eloquent areas with various patterns of rCBF changes of the additional regions demonstrate the close relationship between neuronal activity and cerebral blood flow, that can be measured by SPECT.
