Imaging of the brain cannabinoid system. This review covers two major strategies for imaging of the brain cannabinoid system: autoradiography and in vivo neuroimaging. Cannabinoid receptors can be imaged directly with autoradiography in brain slices using radiolabeled cannabinoid receptor ligands. In addition, the effects of pharmacologic doses of unlabeled cannabinoid drugs can be autoradiographically imaged using indicators of blood flow or indicators of metabolism such as glucose analogs. Although cannabinoid imaging is a relatively new topic of research compared to imaging of other drugs of abuse, autoradiographic strategies have produced high-quality information about the distribution of brain cannabinoid receptors and the effects of cannabinoid drugs on brain metabolism. In vivo neuroimaging, in contrast to autoradiography, utilizes noninvasive techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to image both the binding and the effects of drugs within living brain. These techniques are well developed however, in vivo imaging of cannabinoid systems is in a very preliminary state. Early results have been promising yet hard to generalize. Definitive answers to some of the most important questions about cannabinoid drugs and their effects await development of suitable in vivo neuroimaging ligands for cannabinoid systems.
