Positron emission tomography and scintigraphy. Nuclear imaging in clinical orthopaedics. Nuclear medicine uses the function of organs or organ systems to diagnose and treat disease. The source of radiation is brought into the patient's body by means of a radioactive labelled pharmaceutical. Its way through the body is recorded by appropriate equipment on the outside. Of the many nuclear medical procedures, those primarily applicable to orthopaedic problems are explained here, such as bone scintigraphy, scintigraphy of inflammatory lesions, and tumour scintigraphy. Besides their use in diagnostics, therapeutic applications are covered as well. Using examples from clinical practice, "conventional" nuclear medicine and positron emission tomography are also covered.
