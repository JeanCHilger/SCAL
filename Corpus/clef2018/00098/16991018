Effect to the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) on personality dimensions in individuals without psychopathology. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between the serotonin transporter gene and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) personality dimensions in subjects without psychopathology.Fifty seven individuals without psychiatric symptoms were assessed with the SCL-90, and the TCI. In all subjects a peripheral blood sample was taken to determine their genotypes, after informed consent. Three groups were formed according to the 5-HTT genotype: SS, SL and LL, and the TCI results were compared.There was no association among the 5-HTT genotypes and any of the TCI subscales. There were also no statistical differences among any of the three groups divided by genotype only according to the TCI scores, as well as when compared with historical controls.These results are consistent with other studies that have not found associations among the different measurements of personality and 5-HTT genotypes. Likewise, our data suggest that our sample can be useful as a source of controls for later studies. This is the first study assessing TCI dimensions and the 5-HTT gene in the Mexican population.
