Idiopathic epilepsy in dogs: owners' perspectives on management with phenobarbitone and/or potassium bromide. To explore seizure management from the perspective of the owners of dogs with idiopathic epilepsy.Questionnaires were mailed to owners of 29 dogs under management for suspected or diagnosed idiopathic epilepsy through the clinics of the Small Animal Hospital of the University of Glasgow Veterinary School, using either phenobarbitone or potassium bromide alone or in combination.The postal survey had an 86 per cent response rate. Analysis of the responses demonstrated that "the dog's quality of life", "adequate seizure frequency" and "acceptable side effects of antiepileptic drugs" were the three greatest concerns for owners 52 per cent of owners strongly agreed that the seizure management for their dog was adequate, though the seizure frequency reported varied within this groupFrom the owners' perspective, adequacy of seizure control is determined by the balance between "the dog's quality of life", "adequate seizure frequency" and "acceptable side effects of antiepileptic drugs". A frequency of less than one seizure every three months is associated with the perception by owners of adequate seizure control.
