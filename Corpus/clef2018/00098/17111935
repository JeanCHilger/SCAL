The role of dominant motivation in the formation of a goal-seeking personality. The article contains experimental data on the neurophysiological mechanisms of dominant motivations. Motivation is considered a component of the system architectonics of behavioral actions, closely connected with the mechanisms of reinforcement. The author shows that cortico-subcortical mechanisms constitute the energetic basis for dominant motivations. The apparatus of action result acceptor plays the role of the directing component of human goal-seeking activity. The author considers the role of action result acceptor in interaction with dominant motivation, in the molecular mechanisms of genetically determined and individually acquired memory, and in the forming of dynamic stereotypes.
