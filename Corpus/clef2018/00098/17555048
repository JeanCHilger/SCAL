Radiation exposure of the pet owner during standardised X-ray diagnostic examinations of dogs and cats. In Germany pet owners are present during X-ray examinations of dogs and cats. Due to a change in the German X-ray Ordinance and the directive "Radiation Protection in Veterinary Medicine" it is necessary to determine the body dose of the pet owners. This study in the Clinic for Small Animals includes at least ten measurements for each of thirteen X-ray examinations of a dog and four of a cat. The equivalent doses of eye lens, thyroid, chest, hands, gonads, and lower leg were measured using TLD (LiF:Mg,Cu,P). The maximum value of 52 microSv was measured on the right hand. The 99 % -quantiles amount to 13 microSv for eye lens, 9 microSv for thyroid, 2.3 microSv for chest (under lead apron), 14 microSv for both hands, 2.1 microSv for gonads (under lead apron), and 2.0 microSv for lower leg. In every case the median and mean values at the seven measuring positions are lower than 2.5 microSv per radiograph. In view of the constant measured equivalent doses under the lead apron of less than 5 microSv for the trunk and gonads per X-ray examination the measurement of the personal dose of the pet owner during every X-ray examination of small animals is not justified. Alternatively, with reference to up-to-date measurements and the presented paper a certificate of exemption from the dose determination for pet owners could be applied for from the local authority.
