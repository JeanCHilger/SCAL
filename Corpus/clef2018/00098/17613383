Medical imaging of the diabetic foot. Medical imaging of the diabetic foot entails a variety of imaging modalities. The diagnostic evaluation often includes a gamut of studies that include conventional radiography, CT, nuclear medicine scintigraphy, MRI, ultrasonography, and a newcomer, positron emission tomography combined with CT and leukocyte labeling. There is not yet "one best test" for sorting out the diagnostic dilemmas that are commonly encountered. Confirmation or exclusion of the frequent diagnosis of osteomyelitis often requires multiple studies, which are complementary to one another.
