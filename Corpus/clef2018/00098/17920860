Imaging in the investigation of paraneoplastic syndromes. Paraneoplastic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of disease presentations caused by underlying tumours. As they are non-metastatic in nature an intensive diagnostic evaluation is warranted to identify potentially curable lesions. The selection of the appropriate method of imaging is important in these cases, especially when history and physical examination are unrevealing. In this review the important paraneoplastic syndromes and underlying malignancies are discussed along with relevant imaging strategies.
