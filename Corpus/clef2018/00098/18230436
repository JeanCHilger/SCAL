A theoretical study of some maximum likelihood algorithms for emission and transmission tomography. This paper has the dual purpose of introducing some new algorithms for emission and transmission tomography and proving mathematically that these algorithms and related antecedent algorithms converge. Like the EM algorithms for positron, single-photon, and transmission tomography, the algorithms provide maximum likelihood estimates of pixel concentration or linear attenuation parameters. One particular innovation we discuss is a computationally practical scheme for modifying the EM algorithms to include a Bayesian prior. The Bayesian versions of the EM algorithms are shown to have superior convergence properties in a vicinity of the maximum. We anticipate that some of the other algorithms will also converge faster than the EM algorithms.
