Estimation algorithms for dynamic tracer studies using positron-emission tomography. Algorithms are developed for estimating statistics for use by parameter estimation algorithms in dynamic tracer studies utilizing positron-emission tomography and requiring high temporal resolution. Two types of statistics are considered. One can be used with the expectation-maximization algorithm to compute maximum likelihood parameter estimates, and the other computes a histogram of activity levels versus time for use with weighted least squares parameter estimation algorithms. An estimator of the variance of this histogram is also given. Variants for use with both time-of-flight and projection data collected at high frame rates are presented. The algorithms account for the effects of attenuation, randoms, detector efficiency, and nonuniform sampling.
