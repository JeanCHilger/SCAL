Automatic Contour Detection Using a "Fixed-Point Hachimura-Kuwahara Filter" for SPECT Attenuation Correction. Attenuation correction for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) usually assumes a uniform attenuation distribution within the body surface contour. Previous methods to estimate this contour have used thresholding of a reconstructed section image. This method is often very sensitive to the selection of a threshold value, especially for nonuniform activity distributions within the body. We have proposed the "fixed-point Hachimura-Kuwahara filter" to extract contour primitives from SPECT images. The Hachimura-Kuwahara filter, which preserves edges but smoothes nonedge regions, is applied repeatedly to identify the invariant set-the fixed-point image-which is unchanged by this nonlinear, two-dimensional filtering operation. This image usually becomes a piecewise constant array. In order to detect the contour, the tracing algorithm based on the minimum distance connection criterion is applied to the extracted contour primitives. This procedure does not require choice of a threshold value in determining the contour. SPECT data from a water-filled elliptical phantom containing three sources was obtained and scattered projections were reconstructed. The automatic edge detection procedure was applied to the scattered window reconstruction, resulting in a reasonable outline of the phantom.
