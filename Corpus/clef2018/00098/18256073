Assessment of alphavbeta3 integrin expression after myocardial infarction by positron emission tomography. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of a new positron emission tomography (PET) imaging approach using an (18)F-labelled alpha(v)beta(3) integrin antagonist ((18)F-Galacto-RGD) to monitor the integrin expression after myocardial infarction.Male Wister rats were subjected to 20 min transient left coronary artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. Autoradiographic analysis and in vivo PET imaging were used to determine myocardial (18)F-Galacto-RGD uptake at different time points following reperfusion.PET imaging and autoradiography demonstrated no significant focal myocardial (18)F-Galacto-RGD uptake in non-operated control rats and at day 1 after reperfusion. However, focal accumulation in the infarct area started at day 3 (uptake ratio = 1.91 +/- 0.22 vs. remote myocardium), peaked between 1 (3.43 +/- 0.57) and 3 weeks (3.43 +/- 0.95), and decreased to 1.96 +/- 0.40 at 6 months after reperfusion. Pretreatment with alpha(v)beta(3) integrin antagonist c(-RGDfV-) significantly decreased tracer uptake, indicating the specificity of tracer uptake. The time course of focal tracer uptake paralleled vascular density as measured by CD31 immunohistochemical analysis.Regional (18)F-Galacto-RGD accumulation suggests up-regulation of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin expression after myocardial infarction, which peaks between 1 and 3 weeks and remains detectable until 6 months after reperfusion. This new PET tracer is promising for the monitoring of myocardial repair processes.
