Early detection of recurrence by 18FDG-PET in the follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer. We assessed the potential benefits of including systematic 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for detecting tumour recurrence in a prospective randomised trial. Patients (N=130) who had undergone curative therapy were randomised to undergo either conventional (Con) or FDG-PET procedures during follow-up. The two groups were matched at baseline. Recurrence was confirmed histologically. 'Intention-to-treat' analysis revealed a recurrence in 46 patients (25 in the FDG-PET group, and 21 in the Con group P=0.50), whereas per protocol analysis revealed a recurrence in 44 out of 125 patients (23 and 21, respectively
