Assessment of myocardial perfusion in systemic lupus erythematosus. Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Necropsy studies found a high incidence of myocardial and coronary injuries while clinical manifestations were observed in less than 10%. The purpose of this study was to evaluate myocardial perfusion in SLE patients.The study was carried out in 153 patients with a definite diagnosis of SLE according to the revised criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. Ninety-four (61.4%) underwent 99mTc-t√©trofosmine SPECT analysis at rest and after stress.The average disease duration was 11 years. Ninety-four patients (93 women and one man) with a mean age 37 years were assessed. Twelve had a past history of vascular event: six stroke, four angina pectoris and two myocardial infarctions. Cardiovascular risk factor included: high blood pressure (35.2%), dyslipidemia (62.3%), moderate hyperhomocysteinemia (55%), BMI greater than 25 (40%).The cumulative prednisone dose per patient was 45.5g. Myocardial perfusion stress scanning showed abnormal perfusion in 21 patients (22.3%). Among these, eight underwent coronary angiography which was normal in seven cases. One patient had a right coronary stenosis. Perfusion abnormalities were correlated with stroke (p<0.01) and coronary events (p<0.02).Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy can be a useful noninvasive method to identify subclinical myocardial involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus and patients at risk of later events.
