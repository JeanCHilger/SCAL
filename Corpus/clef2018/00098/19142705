Validation of fast-RAMLA in clinical PET. Images using the fast row action maximum likelihood algorithm (fast-RAMLA), which employs half-interpolated sinograms of conventional 3DRAMLA, are immediately generated following positron emission tomography (PET) scanning and are invariably produced in the process of line-of-response RAMLA (LOR-RAMLA) reconstruction. We quantitatively and visually compared the clinical validity of dual time point [(18)F]-FDG imaging with fast-RAMLA and LOR-RAMLA.An International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) phantom was established in which the ratio of the activities in the hot sphere was set up and a background of 3.8:1 was scanned and reconstructed using both algorithms. The contrast recovery coefficient was then calculated. The clinical study retrospectively analyzed 35 patients (25 men and 10 women age range 30-84 yearsWe identified a quantitative correlation and determined the visual quality of lesion detection between fast-RAMLA and LOR-RAMLA and indicated usefulness and improvement point on fast-RAMLA.Fast-RAMLA can improve the strategy for using dual time point [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([(18)F]-FDG-PET) and increase the efficiency of the [(18)F]-FDG-PET scanner.
