Potato tuber type H phosphorylase isozyme. Molecular cloning, nucleotide sequence, and expression of a full-length cDNA in Escherichia coli. Higher plant tissues contain two alpha-glucan phosphorylase isozymes (EC 2.4.1.1), types L and H, localized in the plastid and the cytoplasm, respectively. We already isolated and sequenced a cDNA clone encoding the type L isozyme. Presently, a cDNA clone encoding the type H counterpart was isolated from a cDNA library of immature potato tuber by plaque hybridization, using two oligonucleotide probes synthesized based on the partial amino acid sequences of the type H isozyme. The message encodes a polypeptide of 838 amino acid residues. Sequence comparison of the two potato tuber phosphorylase isozymes revealed two major distinctions the type L isozyme contains a 78-residue insertion in the middle of the polypeptide chain as well as a 50-residue amino-terminal extension. Except for these extra portions, the two isozyme sequences show an identity of 63%. The entire structural gene for the type H isozyme was inserted 3'-downstream of the strong T7 RNA polymerase promoter in the expression plasmid pET-3b. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells carrying this plasmid produced active phosphorylase upon induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside at 22 degrees C. The expression is entirely dependent on the temperature
