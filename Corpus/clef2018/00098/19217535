Development and validation of 2-deoxy-2-chloro-d-glucose impurity analysis in [(18)F]FDG by three potential-time waveforms of high-performance liquid chromatography/pulsed amperometric detection. A suitable three potential-time waveforms for the electrochemical detection of 2-deoxy-2-chloro-d-glucose (ClDG) by gold working electrode and palladium reference electrode have been developed and method validation was performed on Waters 2796 Bioalliance HPLC system coupled with pulsed amperometric detection (HPLC/PAD). FDG and ClDG could be completely separated by 50 mM NaOH mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min 30 degrees C analytical column temperature
