Three-dimensional reconstructions in neuroanatomy. Computer-aided 3D reconstructions of neurofunctional systems and structures are generated as a reference for neuroimaging (CT, MRI, PET). The clinical application of these 3D reconstructions requires a coordinate system and conditions resembling the intravital neuroanatomy as far as possible. In this paper the neuroanatomical Reference System (NeuRef) of the Department of Neuroanatomy of Hannover Medical School is presented. This consists of methods to record brain structures from serial sections with minimal error (less than 1 mm) and to display 3D brain models derived from such a data base. In addition, NeuRef is able to generate sections through, for instance, the visual and pyramidal system and to transfer these data onto a corresponding CT image. Therefore, this method can serve as a diagnostic aid in neuroradiology, in operation planning, and radiotherapy. It can also be used in PACS.
