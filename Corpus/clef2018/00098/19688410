Novel solid-state-detector dedicated cardiac camera for fast myocardial perfusion imaging: multicenter comparison with standard dual detector cameras. To compare the diagnostic performance of a new dedicated ultrafast solid-state cardiac camera (Discovery NM 530c [DNM]) with standard dual detector cameras (S-SPECT) in myocardial perfusion imaging. The primary goal was a per-patient analysis of diagnostic performance of the DNM using S-SPECT as the reference standard.In total, 168 patients underwent one-day Tc-99m tetrofosmin rest/stress myocardial perfusion SPECT. DNM and S-SPECT images were obtained with the same injected doses. The DNM camera uses an array of cadmium zinc telluride pixilated detectors and a multipinhole collimator simultaneously imaging all cardiac views with no moving parts. Rest and stress acquisition times were 4 and 2 minutes for DNM and 14 and 12 minutes for S-SPECT. Two blinded readers independently interpreted all scans on a patient level and on a vascular territory level using a standard five-point scale. Interobserver differences were resolved by a third observer. Agreement between DNM and S-SPECT for presence or absence of myocardial perfusion defects on a per-patient analysis was 91.9% and 92.5%, respectively. Correlation coefficients of rest and stress left ventricular ejection fractions were 0.87 (P < .01) and 0.90 (P < .01).The diagnostic performance of DNM is comparable to that of S-SPECT on a per-patient basis. However, superior image quality can be achieved with significantly shorter acquisition times with DNM because of improved count sensitivity and image contrast over S-SPECT.
