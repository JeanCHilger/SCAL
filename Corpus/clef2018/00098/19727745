Accuracy of dual-source computed tomography in quantitative assessment of low density coronary stenosis--a motion phantom study. We assessed the accuracy and reproducibility of non-calcified plaque quantification as simulated by a low-density stenosis in vessel phantoms using diameter and area measures, as well as the influence of vessel size and motion on quantification accuracy in dual-source computed tomography (DSCT).Four phantoms (2, 2.5, 3, and 4 mm in luminal diameter) made from a radiopaque Lucite (126 +/- 23 Hounsfield units, HU) simulating a fixed radiolucent concentric coronary stenosis (7 +/- 2 HU, 50% luminal narrowing) were connected to a cardiac motion simulator. Stenosis quantification was based on area and diameter measurements. All measurements were highly reproducible (all ICC > or =0.95, p < 0.001).The mean measured degree of stenosis was 38.0 +/- 11.7% for a single diameter measurement, resulting in a mean relative error of 22.0 +/- 18.7%, decreasing with increasing phantom size (31.9 +/- 22.1% 25.2 +/- 20.9%DSCT enables highly reproducible quantification of low density stenosis, but underestimates the degree of stenosis, especially in small vessels. Area-based measurements reflect the true degree of stenosis with higher accuracy than diameter.
