Intraductal ultrasonography combined with percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy for the preoperative evaluation of longitudinal tumor extent in hilar cholangiocarcinoma. In hilar cholangiocarcinoma, an accurate assessment of preoperative resectability is important to optimize surgical resection. We investigated the accuracy of the combination of intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy (PTCS) for evaluating longitudinal extent in hilar cholangiocarcinoma.Patients diagnosed with hilar cholangiocarcinoma underwent multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) for tumor staging and Bismuth type. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was performed at the left or right bile duct of the liver section that was anticipated to be preserved in the surgical treatment. After tract dilation, PTCS with cholangioscope-directed biopsy and IDUS were sequentially performed to evaluate Bismuth type. Surgical treatment was executed according to tumor staging and longitudinal tumor extent. Postoperative histological Bismuth types were compared to preoperative Bismuth types based on MDCT, MRC, PTCS with biopsy, and IDUS.From June 2006 to November 2008, 25 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma were enrolled, with 20 of these patients evaluable. The accuracy of MDCT, MRC, PTCS with biopsy, and IDUS for the evaluation of Bismuth type was 80%, 84.2%, 90%, and 85.0%, respectively, in 20 patients, and 82.4%, 82.4%, 94.1%, and 88.2%, respectively, in 18 patients with Bismuth type IIIa, IIIb, or IV cancer. The accuracy of the combination of IDUS and PTCS with biopsy was 95% in 20 patients, and 100% in 18 with Bismuth type IIIa, IIIb, or IV cancer.The combination of IDUS and PTCS with biopsy was highly accurate for assessing Bismuth type and may help in the identification of an optimal surgical plan for the treatment of hilar cholangiocarcinoma, especially in Bismuth type IIIa, IIIb, or IV.
