Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: pre-operative combined radiochemotherapy from a surgical oncological viewpoint. Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) are an interdisciplinary challenge in terms of diagnosis, multimodal and/or surgical treatment procedures and also postoperative management as they are often associated with multiple comorbidities. The gold standard for a curative treatment approach is radical surgery, which is standardized and can be carried out with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. ESCCs are usually diagnosed at locally advanced tumor stages and neoadjuvant treatment procedures are therefore used. Patients who respond to neoadjuvant therapy (responders) have a significantly better survival rate. The neoadjuvant studies that are currently available need to be critically assessed as they do not include response as an end point. In this context the WHO clinical response evaluation that has been used up to now is questionable. The histopathological findings with percentage proportions of residual tumor cells represent the gold standard for evaluating the response. Positron-emission tomography as a response criterion is predictive for the histopathological response and survival. ESCC patients who are classified as non-responders do not appear to benefit from surgical resection. In the future the results of a response evaluation and of pretreatment molecular biological tests could have a place in the process of pretherapeutic and peritherapeutic oncological decision-making in patients with ESCCs.
