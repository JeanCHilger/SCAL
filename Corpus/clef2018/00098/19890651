Imaging techniques in rheumatology: PET in rheumatology. Positron emission tomography (PET) using F-18-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) is suitable for many indications in oncology and can also be used in rheumatology to search for inflammatory foci and benign lesions with increased glucose metabolism in, for example soft tissue and joints (arthritis, vasculitis etc.) and fever of unknown origin. Usually a whole-body scanning technique is used for data acquisition in the search for foci of unknown localization or for the characterization of glucose metabolism of one or more known lesions - also for observation of the effect of, for example pharmacotherapy. Patients are admitted under fasting conditions and acquisition starts 1 h after i.v. injection of FDG with an acquisition time of 30-60 min. The method is sensitive and can measure glucose metabolism in an objective manner, but is not specific for inflammatory diseases (FDG also accumulates in malignant diseases).
