High-affinity dopamine D2/D3 PET radioligands 18F-fallypride and 11C-FLB457: a comparison of kinetics in extrastriatal regions using a multiple-injection protocol. (18)F-Fallypride and (11)C-FLB457 are commonly used PET radioligands for imaging extrastriatal dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptors, but differences in their in vivo kinetics may affect the sensitivity for measuring subtle changes in receptor binding. Focusing on regions of low binding, a direct comparison of the kinetics of (18)F-fallypride and (11)C-FLB457 was made using a MI protocol. Injection protocols were designed to estimate K(1), k(2), f(ND)k(on), B(max), and k(off) in the midbrain and cortical regions of the rhesus monkey. (11)C-FLB457 cleared from the arterial plasma faster and yielded a ND space distribution volume (K(1)/k(2)) that is three times higher than (18)F-fallypride, primarily due to a slower k(2) (FAL:FLB k(2)=0.54 min(-1):0.18 min(-1)). The dissociation rate constant, k(off), was slower for (11)C-FLB457, resulting in a lower K(Dapp) than (18)F-fallypride (FAL:FLB
