Direct fixation of [(11)C]-CO(2) by amines: formation of [(11)C-carbonyl]-methylcarbamates. [(11)C-Carbonyl]-methylcarbamates can be synthesised directly from [(11)C]-CO(2) and primary or secondary amines in a one-pot, two-step reaction. The use of either diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) or 2-tert-butylimino-2-diethylamino-1,3-dimethyl-perhydro-1,3,2-diazaphosphorine (BEMP) enables efficient trapping of [(11)C]-CO(2) in small volumes of DMF as [(11)C]-carbamate salts. Subsequent reaction with a variety of methylating agents rapidly generates the desired [(11)C-carbonyl]-methylcarbamates in high radiochemical yields. The usefulness of the method is illustrated by the efficient radiosynthesis of a kappa opioid receptor imaging radiotracer, useful in positron emission tomography (PET).
