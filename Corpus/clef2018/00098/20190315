Role of 2-deoxy-2-[F-18] fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography in the management of bone and soft-tissue metastases. We retrospectively reviewed 71 histopathologically-confirmed bone and soft-tissue metastases of unknown origin at presentation. In order to identify the site of the primary tumour all 71 cases were examined with conventional procedures, including CT, serum tumour markers, a plain radiograph, ultrasound examination and endoscopic examinations, and 24 of the 71 cases underwent 2-deoxy-2-[F-18] fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). This detected multiple bone metastases in nine patients and the primary site in 12 of the 24 cases conventional studies revealed 16 primary tumours. There was no significant difference in sensitivity between FDG-PET and conventional studies. The mean maximal standardised uptake value of the metastatic tumours was significantly higher than that of the primary tumours, which is likely to explain why FDG-PET did not provide better results. It was not superior to conventional procedures in the search for the primary site of bone and soft-tissue metastases
