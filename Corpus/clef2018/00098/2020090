The significance of resting thallium-201 delayed SPECT for assessing viability of infarcted regions--comparison with exercise thallium-201 SPECT. To clarify the clinical significance of resting thallium-201 (Tl) delayed SPECT for assessing the viability of infarcted regions, we studied resting Tl initial and delayed Tl SPECT one week after exercise (Ex) Tl SPECT in 38 patients (40 regions) with old myocardial infarction (OMI) and 35 patients (37 regions) with effort angina pectoris (EAP). Analysis of resting Tl and Ex Tl SPECT divided the patients with OMI into 3 groups. Twenty-three patients whose perfusion defect (PD) on resting delayed image was same as that of Ex delayed image were divided into 12 patients with Ex Tl redistribution (RD) (G1) and 11 patients without Ex Tl RD (G3). Fifteen patients showed a decrease of PD on resting delayed image compared with Ex delayed image (G2). Thirty-five patients with EAP were divided into 18 patients who had no PD on Ex delayed image (G1) and 17 patients whose PD did not disappear on Ex delayed image but disappeared on resting delayed image (G2). The increase of pulmonary artery wedge pressure on Ex was higher in G2 than in G1 of both OMI and EAP (OMI G1 15 +/- 16 mmHg vs G2 27 +/- 7 mmHg
