Fluoroethylthyrosine 18F PET in the detection of brain tumours. PET with fluoroethylthyrosine (FET), amino-acid analogue, has been performed in Germany since the beginning of the decade for molecular and metabolic imaging of brain tumours, since FDG, the glucose analogue which is the reference tracer for clinical PET, has this drawback to be taken-up intensely by cerebral cortex. We report on our preliminary results on the comparison of PET/CT with FET and FDG in 10 evaluable patients presenting with a brain lesion either at diagnosis or after treatment. In an attempt to optimise specificity, FET PET/CT has been acquired as a static image 1h after injection, while the most current practice is a dynamic 40 min acquisition starting at FET injection. With our acquisition protocol, diagnostic performance of FET was 88% sensitivity and 80% accuracy vs 13% and 30% respectively for FDG.FET is a radiopharmaceutical with clinical usefulness for the diagnosis, delineation and monitoring of brain tumours. Association with FDG allows identification of high-grade lesions or components, but it could be avoided providing that acquisition and quantification procedures of FET PET/CT would have been better optimised and standardised.
