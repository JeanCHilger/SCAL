(99)Tc(m)-MIBI exercise stress single photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging of patients with myocardial bridge. To observe the exercise single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging of patients with myocardial bridge and assess the association between myocardial ischemia and extent of myocardial systolic compression.Seventeen patients with myocardial bridge diagnosed by coronary angiogram were included and underwent exercise SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging.Abnormal SPECT perfusion imaging was evidenced in 12 out of 17 patients with myocardial bridge (2 out of 6 patients with systolic compression induced stenosis < 50%, 3 out of 4 patients with systolic compression induced stenosis between 50% - 75% and 7 out of 7 patients with the systolic compression induced stenosis between 75% - 100%).Exercise stress SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging could detect myocardial ischemia in patients with myocardial bridge and abnormal perfusion is positively related to the extent of systolic compression induced stenosis.
