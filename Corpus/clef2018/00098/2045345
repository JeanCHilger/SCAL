FDA fast-tracking of pet population control drugs. Theriogenologists have been studying estrus prevention and termination of pregnancy in dogs for at least 2 decades. However, drugs approved for estrus suppression are few. No dog or cat abortifacients or male dog and cat sterilants have been approved. Marketed drugs with alternate indications that have antiestrus and antihormonal activity might be good candidates for study after obtaining an INAD from FDA. With the support of the original drug sponsor or manufacturer and appropriate safety and effectiveness studies, these products may be studied for additional label claims. New (not previously approved) drugs additionally need detailed information regarding the synthesis and manufacturing controls. Drugs offering substantial benefit over existing therapeutics may be eligible for expedited review. Prior to starting any studies in this area, clinical investigators and sponsors should communicate with FDA, an INAD must be granted, and the protocol submitted for evaluation. Approvability is evaluated after establishment of safety and effectiveness in clinical field trials.
