. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a cell surface receptor that interacts with several different ligands (1), mediates its activity through an intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) (2), and is involved in the survival, growth, proliferation, and differentiation of cells. This receptor is known to participate in the metastases of cancers, and its overexpression in tumors indicates a poor outcome for the patient (3). Therefore, the EGFR-associated TK and the EGFR have been respectively targeted with TK inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for the treatment of cancers. Although several TK inhibitors and MAbs are being evaluated in clinical trials, only two MAbs, cetuximab and panitumumab, have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of malignant tumors (3). Early detection of a cancer, particularly by non-invasive techniques such as imaging, could be helpful for the development of an appropriate treatment and to monitor the progress of a patient. Cetuximab has been conjugated to different nuclides (4) or optical dyes (5), and the MAb conjugates were evaluated in a preclinical setting as imaging agents for cancerous tumors that overexpress EGFR. However, these MAb-based imaging agents had limited application for imaging, and the investigators concluded that further development of the bioagents would be necessary before use in humans (4, 5). In an effort to develop an anti-EGFR antibody suitable for the imaging and therapy of cancer patients, a humanized MAb, h-R3 (the murine form is known as ior egf/r3), was labeled with
