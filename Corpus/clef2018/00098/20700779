Neuroimaging in medicine. Neuroimaging has in recent years greatly contributed to our understanding of a wide range of aspects of central neurological diseases. These include the classification and localization of disease (e.g., in headache), the understanding of pathology (e.g., in Parkinson's disease), mechanisms of reorganization (e.g., in stroke), and the subclinical progress of disease (e.g., in degenerative diseases). Apart form presurgical mapping, clinical applications of fMRI are limited. However, functional imaging enables the formulation of neurobiological hypotheses that can be tested clinically and is suited to test classical clinical hypotheses about how the brain works. Understanding the mechanisms and the site of pathology, e.g., in cluster headaches, will lead and has led to new therapeutic strategies. New methodological developments for neuroscientific applications are aimed at the integration of functional and morphological connectivity through a combination of magnetic resonance techniques (fMRI, DTI) and electrophysiological (EEG, MEG) recordings. In addition to stimulus-dependent activations, resting state activity has found increasing interest, for example, in sleep research and various psychiatric diseases (e.g., schizophrenia, borderline).
