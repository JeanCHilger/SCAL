Kinetic models for cancer imaging. As tumors have distinctly different blood flow compared to that of normal tissue, the kinetic in cancerous tissue is of importance in cancer diagnosis and in assessing the efficacy of treatment. To this end, dynamic cancer imaging provides a noninvasive way for early detection of tumors and subsequent treatment planning. This paper provides an overview of currently available imaging modalities and compares different kinetic models used for analyzing tumor scans. Specific research issues that arise when analyzing dynamic imaging scans are examined and current developments in the field are highlighted.
