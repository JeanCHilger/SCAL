Antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in dogs in Hokkaido. During 1985 to 1990, serum samples were obtained from 229 healthy dogs. The dogs lived in Hokkaido, known to be infested with ticks. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi HO14 and HP3, which were isolated from Ixodes ovatus and I. persulcatus in the area. IgG antibody to B. burgdorferi HO14 was detected in 8.8% (1985), 16.4% (1987) and 18.5% (1990). IgM antibody to the bacteria was detected in 1.8% (1987) and 2.5% (1990). Antibodies to the strain HP3 of B. burgdorferi were also detected in the serum samples of dogs, but the percentage of seropositive sample to the strain HP3 was lower than that to the strain HO14. Statistical differences were not noticed between pet and street dogs. No antibody to B. burgdorferi was observed in 13 beagle dogs as experimental animal.
