Chronic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation failed to change dopamine synthesis rate: preliminary L-[β-11C]DOPA positron emission tomography study in patients with depression. We have examined the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on central dopaminergic function in patients with depression using positron emission tomography with L-[β-11C]DOPA, a ligand to assess the rate of endogenous dopamine synthesis. Eight patients were treated with 10-daily sessions of rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Positron emission tomography scanning was performed in each patient twice, before the first session and 1 day after the last session. Although four out of eight patients responded to rTMS, there were no changes in the striatal dopamine synthesis rate (k) following rTMS. These results suggest that chronic rTMS had a limited effect on the dopaminergic system.
