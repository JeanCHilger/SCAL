Synthesis and evaluation of 6-[1-(2-[(18)F]fluoro-3-pyridyl)-5-methyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl]quinoline for positron emission tomography imaging of the metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 in brain. The purpose of this study was to synthesize 6-[1-(2-[(18)F]fluoro-3-pyridyl)-5-methyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl]quinoline ([(18)F]FPTQ, [(18)F]7a) and to evaluate its potential as a positron emission tomography ligand for imaging metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 (mGluR1) in the rat brain. Compound [(18)F]7a was synthesized by [(18)F]fluorination of 6-[1-(2-bromo-3-pyridyl)-5-methyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl]quinoline (7b) with potassium [(18)F]fluoride. At the end of synthesis, 1280-1830MBq (n=8) of [(18)F]7a was obtained with >98% radiochemical purity and 118-237GBq/Î¼mol specific activity using 3300-4000MBq of [(18)F]F(-). In vitro autoradiography showed that [(18)F]7a had high specific binding with mGluR1 in the rat brain. Biodistribution study using a dissection method and small-animal PET showed that [(18)F]7a had high uptake in the rat brain. The uptake of radioactivity in the cerebellum was reduced by unlabeled 7a and mGluR1-selective ligand JNJ-16259685 (2), indicating that [(18)F]7a had in vivo specific binding with mGluR1. Because of a low amount of radiolabeled metabolite present in the brain, [(18)F]7a may have a limiting potential for the in vivo imaging of mGluR1 by PET.
