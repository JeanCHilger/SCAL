Human Brain Imaging Studies of Emotional Memory: Uncovering Influences of Sex and Hemisphere The advent of human brain imaging techniques (PET, fMRI) has allowed previously unimaginable examination of human brain functions including studies of the mechanisms underlying memory for emotional events. Many of these studies have been guided by findings from animal research that identified the amygdala as a key candidate brain region crucial to emotional memory. Evidence from human brain imaging studies has robustly confirmed this conclusion. At the same time, it has expanded our understanding of emotional memory in unsuspected directions. For example, it is now evident that males and females on average do not process memories of the same emotional events in identical ways. This fact is most clear at present regarding the amygdala, for which a sex by hemisphere interaction in its relation to memory has been documented. Whether and how these sex differences influence what is retained in memories of men and women from emotional events is now an important area of research. The evidence to date also makes clear that the long standing and still widespread assumption that subject sex matters little if at all in studies of the neurobiology of emotional memory is no longer tenable and should be abandoned.
