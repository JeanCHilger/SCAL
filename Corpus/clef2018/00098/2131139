Regional brain metabolism during auditory hallucinations in chronic schizophrenia. Regions of the brain involved in language and attention were studied using [18F]-fluorodeoxy-glucose in PET. In nine chronic DSM-III schizophrenic patients who had persistent auditory hallucinations, ten who had recovered from hallucinations and ten normal controls. In none of the regions examined was metabolic activity significantly different in hallucinating patients compared with that in other groups. However, a pattern of seven significant correlations of metabolic activity between language regions and between frontal and parietal cortex characterised the hallucinating but not the other groups. Three of the seven correlations were significantly greater in hallucinating patients than in the two other groups, and six were greater in hallucinating patients than controls. Metabolism in Broca's region and its right-hemisphere homologue correlated positively and significantly in the hallucinating group, as it did in anterior cingulate and left superior temporal areas, and in right frontal and parietal areas. Hallucination ratings correlated with metabolism in the anterior cingulate region.
