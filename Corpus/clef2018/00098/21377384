Spiral vein reconstruction of the infected abdominal aorta using the greater saphenous vein: preliminary results of the Tilburg experience. The aim of this study was to evaluate patients, who underwent spiral vein reconstruction of the abdominal aorta to repair infected aneurysms or replace infected aortic grafts.All spiral vein reconstructions between March 2005 and May 2010 because of vascular infections of the abdominal aorta were retrospectively included. Diagnosis was determined by clinical examination, laboratory results, computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and microbiological tests. Spiral vein reconstruction consisted of harvesting the greater saphenous vein (GSV) and construction into a spiral graft, aortic reconstruction and a transmesenteric omentumplasty. Primary outcomes were survival and limb salvage. Secondary outcomes included technical, clinical and ongoing success, re-infection, ongoing infection and patency.All five patients survived surgery, and there were no in-hospital deaths. Survival and limb salvage were 100% after median follow-up of 13 months (6-67 months). Further, technical, clinical and continuing success was 100%. There were no re-infections or ongoing infections.Spiral vein reconstruction using the GSV showed good short-term survival and limb salvage. It, therefore, might be considered as an attractive treatment method for vascular infections of the abdominal aorta. Still, more follow-up is needed to evaluate long-term results.
