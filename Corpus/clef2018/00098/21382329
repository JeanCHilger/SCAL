Neuroimaging Alzheimer's disease: early diagnosis, monitoring, and mechanism understanding. Neuroimaging offers a promising tool for the priority goals of current researches in Alzheimer's disease (AD) including early diagnosis, monitoring the progression of the disease and understanding the underlying mechanisms. The brain profiles of atrophy and hypometabolism associated with AD are well known and they can be used as support for early diagnosis, although the accuracy of each of these biomarkers on its own is not sufficient. An increasing number of studies highlights the relevance of disconnection processes in the development and progression of AD. The recent development of PET tracers such as the Pittsburg compound (PiB) allowing to visualize in vivo one of the neuropathological lesions characterizing AD (i.e. beta-amyloid depositions) offers a unique opportunity to better understand the mechanisms underlying this multifaceted disease.
