Magnetic resonance imaging of malignant lymphoma. Computed tomography (CT), (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET and the hybrid FDG-PET/CT are the most commonly used diagnostic tools for the initial staging and treatment response assessment of malignant lymphomas. MRI techniques such as whole-body MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging may be good radiation-free alternatives to FDG-PET/CT, which may be particularly relevant for children. Diffusion-weighted imaging is characterized by high sensitivity for the detection of lesions and allows quantitative assessment of diffusion that may aid in the evaluation of malignant lymphomas. This article will review the value of these emerging MRI techniques for the staging and response assessment of malignant lymphoma. Furthermore, we will discuss some additional imaging techniques that are the subject of ongoing research and may have potential for future clinical application.
