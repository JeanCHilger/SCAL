18F-FDG uptake in primary lung cancer as a predictor of intratumoral vessel invasion. This study investigated how fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on PET in the primary tumor may predict intratumoral vessel invasion (IVI) in it.A total of 512 patients with lung neoplasms determined by a surgical procedure and histopathological diagnosis had undergone FDG-PET scanning.Among the 440 cases confirmed to be malignant, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) was significantly lower in IVI-negative cases than IVI-positive cases (P < 0.001). In the substudy on adenocarcinoma (AC), SUV(max) was significantly lower in IVI-negative cases too (P < 0.001), but SUV(max) in squamous cell carcinoma was without significant difference. In addition, IVI was associated with a significantly higher probability of lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001).This study indicates that a malignant lung tumor with higher SUV(max) has a significantly higher probability of IVI and lymph node metastasis, particularly if the malignancy is an AC.
