Treatment outcome of chemotherapy with superselective cerebral artery catheterization in vegetative state patients. The purpose of the study is to assess the impact of superselective neurotransmitter metabolic therapy in patients in a vegetative state. Superselective intraarterial infusion was conducted on 26 patients with relevant international criteria for the diagnosis of vegetative state. Comprehensive assessment of neurologic symptoms and severity of low metabolism on PET scan allowed to select the vascular pool, for the catheter installation. The catheter was placed either in the carotid or the vertebrobasilar pool. Infusion of neurotransmitter agents was conducted for 7 days continuously. Control of the level of metabolism of labeled glucose in the brain (PET) was performed within 2 weeks after arterial infusion. 14 out of 26 patients showed a positive trend of changes in energy metabolism of the brain. However, only 7 out of 14 patients showed further recovery of consciousness. The data confirms that the delivery path and a combination of medications play a definite role in the effectiveness of vegetative state therapy.
