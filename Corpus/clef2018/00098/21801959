Shifting trends in liver-directed management of patients with colorectal liver metastasis: a population-based analysis. We sought to evaluate population-based temporal trends in perioperative management, as well as short- and long-term outcomes associated with the operative management of colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM).Using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked data, we identified 2,121 patients with operatively managed CRLM between 1991 and 2006. Clinicopathologic data, trends in operative management, and survival were examined.Preoperative evaluation included computed tomography (CT 66%), magnetic resonance imaging (MRIMost patients were evaluated with CT PET was employed rarely. Although there was a temporal increase in chemotherapy utilization, only one half of patients received perioperative chemotherapy. Mortality associated with hepatic operations was low, but morbidity remained high with no temporal change despite an increased number of patient medical comorbidities.
