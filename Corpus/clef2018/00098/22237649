Epilepsy surgery. Epilepsy surgery is an important therapeutic option for patients with epilepsy since one third of all epilepsy patients will still not be become seizure free despite newly developed antiepileptic drugs. Anterior temporal lobe resection is the most common procedure. Extratemporal resections require more complex diagnostics and often invasive evaluation which is not the case in most temporal epilepsy patients due to improved imaging (MRI, PET, SPECT). Electrical stimulation of the anterior thalamus has been available as a treatment option since last year.
