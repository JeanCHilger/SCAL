Fluorogenic sensing of CH3CO2- and H2PO4- by ditopic receptor through conformational change. Cyclo-bis-(urea-3,6-dichlorocarbazole) (1) forms a 1 : 2 complex with CH(3)CO(2)(-) and H(2)PO(4)(-) through hydrogen bonding with the two urea moieties, resulting in fluorescence enhancement via a combined photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and energy transfer mechanism. The binding mechanism involves a conformational change of the two urea receptors to a trans orientation after binding of the first anion, which facilitates the second interaction.
