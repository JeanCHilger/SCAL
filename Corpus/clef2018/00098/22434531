Bisphosphonate therapy in multiple myeloma in preventing vertebral collapses: preliminary report. The aim of the study was to report and discuss the preliminary data obtained in a homogeneous series of 50 patients affected by multiple myeloma treated with bisphosphonates.Patients were followed for a minimum of 1 year. Main orthopaedic data were recorded. Visual Analogue Score and QLQ-C30 and MY 20 were used to assess the quality of life.Statistical analysis showed less lytic lesions in the group with zoledronate therapy and stable primary disease compared with a greater number of lesions in the non-treated group. Results regarding VAS score and QLQ-C30 and MY were statistically better in the first group than in the second.Our results confirm the efficacy of zoledronate in ensuring an acceptable quality of life restraining the aggressiveness of the myeloma on bone tissue, especially in spine although further prospective studies have to be conducted to determine its correct use in myeloma patients.
