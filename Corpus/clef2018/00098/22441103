Signalling pathways passing Src in pancreatic endocrine tumours: relevance for possible combined targeted therapies. The most frequent molecular abnormalities in pancreatic endocrine tumours (PETs) are mutations of the MEN1 gene, deregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway and overactivation of growth factors and their receptors, such as the VEGF. On this basis, everolimus (Afinitor® Novartis) and sunitinib (Sutent®
