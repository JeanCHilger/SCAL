FDG PET/CT diagnosis of hepatic lymphoma mimicking focal fatty infiltration on CT. Areas of hypoattenuation in the liver which do not have mass effect are typically thought to represent focal fatty infiltration. Rarely, tumors can present without mass effect in the liver. We present a case in which areas of liver hypoattenuation which were initially thought to represent focal fatty infiltration on CT due to lack of mass effect had abnormal uptake on a FDG PET/CT exam these areas were due to secondary hepatic involvement from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
