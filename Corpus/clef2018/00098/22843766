Pattern of cardiac sympathetic denervation in idiopathic Parkinson disease studied with 11C hydroxyephedrine PET. To determine whether cardiac sympathetic denervation in idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD) affects the left ventricle in a distinct regional pattern versus a more global pattern with use of carbon 11 (11C) meta-hydroxyephedrine (HED) positron emission tomography (PET).This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board and was compliant with HIPAA. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Cardiac PET was performed with 11C HED in 27 patients with IPD (20 men and seven women aged 50-74 years mean age, 62 years±6 [standard deviation]). 11C HED retention indexes (RIs), which reflect nerve density and integrity, were determined. RIs for 33 healthy control subjects (15 men and 18 women aged 20-78 yearsThe mean 11C HED RI was 0.086 mL of blood per minute per milliliter tissue±0.015 for control subjects and 0.043 mL of blood per minute per milliliter tissue±0.016 for patients with IPD (P<0001). When compared with normative data from the control database, profound cardiac denervation (global extent>50%) was seen in most patients (19 of 27 patients, 70%). Four patients had normal 11C HED studies and four had mild denervation (global extent<25%). The mean global denervation extent was 62%±38, the mean severity z score was -2.7±1.2, and the mean SEP was -202±131 (range, -358 to 0). Segmental analysis revealed relative sparing of anterior and proximal septal segments (mean extent, 48%-51% mean severity z score, -2.47 to -2.0Cardiac sympathetic denervation in IPD is extensive, with a segmental pattern that involves the proximal lateral left ventricular wall most severely, with relative sparing of the anterior and proximal septal walls.
