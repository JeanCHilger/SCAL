Fluoro-deoxy-glucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Pattern in a Patient with Linitis Plastica of the Stomach Caused by Primary Signet Cell Adenocarcinoma. We report the findings of [18F] fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) performed in a 67-year-old female with suspicion of gastric carcinoma. Intense FDG uptake was noted in the thickened gastric wall. Subsequent laparotomy showed diffuse involvement of the gastric wall by signet ring cell adenocarcinoma. This report highlights FDG PET/CT pattern in linitis plastica of the stomach caused by primary signet cell adenocarcinoma.
