Single photon emission computed tomography with technetium-99m hexamethyl propylenamino oxime in the pain-free interval of migraine and cluster headache. Thirty-three headache-free patients (19 F/14 M) suffering from common (n = 9) and classic migraine (n = 19) as well as cluster headache (n = 5) were investigated using the flow tracer 99mTc-hexamethyl propylenamino oxime and single photon emmission computed tomography. A regional decrease of cerebral tracer uptake was observed in 16 patients with common migraine, but only in 3 patients with classic migraine and in no patient with cluster headache. In 10 of 15 cases with hemiplegic symptoms during migraine attack the areas of decreased tracer uptake showed a topographic relationship to neurological deficits. It appears that migraine attacks occur in connection with exacerbations of preexisting changes of neuronal activities, cerebral perfusion and metabolism.
