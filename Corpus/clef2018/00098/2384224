Stability of cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism during normal aging. Cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in aged normal subjects were measured with positron emission tomography and their relationship with brain atrophy was evaluated. Brain atrophy progressed in a linear fashion during aging while cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism were well preserved. The finding suggests that brain atrophy is an aging process less dependent on cerebral blood flow and metabolism over the course of normal aging.
