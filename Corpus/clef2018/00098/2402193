Iodobenzamide for in vivo exploration of central dopamine receptors: evaluation in animal models of supersensitivity. Iodobenzamide is a promising agent to investigate D2 receptors by SPECT in living human brain. In this work, we have evaluated this radiolabeled compound in two animal models of D2 receptors supersensitivity. In the first model, rats were treated chronically with haloperidol during three weeks (S.C. injection of 0.5 mg/kg/day). One week after the last day of treatment, they were I.V. injected with 125I-IBZM. In vivo specific binding study showed a 45 percent increase of 125I-IBZM fixation in the striatum of treated rats. In a second step of experiments, animals were unilaterally lesioned by a stereotaxic injection of 6-OHDA in the substantia nigra, 23 days before receiving 125I-IBZM. Autoradiographic analysis of coronal brain sections showed a 38 percent enhancement of 125I-IBZM in vivo binding in the striatum on the lesioned side as compared to the contralateral intact side this increase occurred in striatal lateral area. These data demonstrate that 125I-IBZM is convenient to detect alterations of dopamine D2 receptors in vivo in the rat. Thus IBZM labelled with 123I can be a very useful imaging agent for the exploration of D2 receptors in pathological situations.
