Evaluation of CT-guided stereotaxic aspiration for thalamic hemorrhage by single photon emission CT. Sixteen patients with thalamic hemorrhage (hematoma volume greater than or equal to 10 ml and CT classification greater than or equal to IIa) were included in this study. In sixteen patients, ten were treated conservatively (conservative group) and six were subjected to CT-guided stereotaxic aspiration (aspiration group). Stereotaxic aspiration was performed at the acute stage within five days after the onset. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) using Single Photon Emission CT (Tomomatic 64) and 133-Xe inhalation method. In both groups, CBF was measured at the onset (day 1-5), acute stage (day 7-13), subacute stage (1 month from the onset) and chronic stage (2-4 months from the onset). In this study, mean hemispheric cerebral blood flow (mCBF) was calculated from the middle slice 2, positioned 5cm above the orbitomeatal line. Regional devision of slice 2 in the hematoma side was made as follows. rCBF-A: regional cerebral blood flow in the anterior area of the hematoma. rCBF-L: regional cerebral blood flow in the lateral area of the hematoma. rCBF-P: regional cerebral blood flow in the posterior area of the hematoma. In both groups, age, neurological grading, CT classification and hematoma volume had no significance. In the conservative group, mCBF of the hematoma side in the subacute stage was 68 +/- 7%, and in the aspiration group it was 85 +/- 17%. This difference was statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
