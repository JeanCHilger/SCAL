Clinical trial of 111In-antimyosin antibody imaging: (2). Imaging of myocardial infarction and myocarditis. A new scintigraphic method to detect myocardial necrosis has been developed using antimyosin monoclonal antibody F ab labeled with indium-111 (111In-antimyosin). We investigated 111In-antimyosin scintigraphy in 35 patients with myocardial infarction, 5 patients with myocarditis and 3 patients with angina pectoris. 111In-antimyosin F ab was administered iv and antimyosin images were recorded by planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) 48-72 hrs after injection. Planar images showed discrete localization of 111In-antimyosin in 26 of 27 patients within 16 days after the onset of acute myocardial infarction in 14 of whom creatine kinase, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase had already normalized. In addition, positive scans were also obtained in 4 of 8 patients 1 to 9 months after the onset of the disease. Three patients with acute myocarditis (two of whom were biopsy-proven) had positive scans 2 and 4 weeks after the onset of the disease. Although mechanism of persistent positive anti-myosin images in the chronic stage remains to be clarified, 111In-antimyosin scintigraphy holds potential promise as a noninvasive method for the detection of myocardial injury.
