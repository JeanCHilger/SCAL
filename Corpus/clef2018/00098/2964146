Dilatation balloons: polymer selection, balloon design and assembly. The current status of coronary dilating instruments is presented from the designer's perspective. Catheter shaft design is considered by important features, common catheter materials and types of catheter construction. Among the seven companies manufacturing balloon dilating instruments, only three types of catheter and four materials are offered. Balloon design is presented by important features and by materials selected. Performance comparisons are made between the three materials used to fabricate dilating balloons: PVC, PE and PET.
