Human-animal relationships within the context of Rogers' principle of integrality. A study was conducted to investigate the relationship of human rhythms, as expressed by heart rate and blood pressure, in response to environmental rhythms, including a companion dog and an unknown dog, within the context of Rogers' Principle of Integrality. A convenience sample of 30 was used in replicating a study by Baun et al. Results did not support the hypothesis but did support and clarify the relationship between human and environmental fields as postulated by Rogers.
