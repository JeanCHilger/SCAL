Prednisolone improves the response to primary endocrine treatment for advanced breast cancer. Two hundred and twenty patients with progressive advanced breast cancer were given primary endocrine treatment (PET) according to menstrual status. Pre-menopausal patients received ovarian irradiation (O) and post-menopausal tamoxifen 10 mg bd (T). Patients were randomised to receive either no additional treatment or prednisolone 5 mg bd (P). Similar results were observed in each menstrual subgroup. In 194 evaluable patients, the response to PET + P was 49% and to PET alone 30% (P less than 0.01). P increased the median duration of response from 9 to 14 months (P less than 0.002) and the median time to disease progression from 5 to 9 months (P less than 0.001). Response to P after O or T alone occurred in only 2/62 (3%). Median survival in patients randomised to receive P at the outset of PET was prolonged by 4 months (P less than 0.05). The addition of P significantly improves the response to O or T in the treatment of advanced breast cancer.
