Iodomethylated fatty acid metabolism in mice and dogs. The myocardial uptake of fatty acids labeled with radioactive iodine and injected i.v. can only be evaluated with SPECT if their oxidation kinetics is slow enough. For this reason, we evaluated different iodomethylated fatty acids in mice and dogs to determine which of them shows the highest myocardial uptake and the slowest oxidation. The most suitable was found to be 16-iodo-3-methyl hexadecanoic acid (mono beta) since its myocardial fixation was the same as that of the reference, i.e. 16-iodo-9-hexadecenoic acid (IHA), whereas it was degraded more slowly. Thirty min after injection of mono beta into dogs, the decrease in myocardial activity with respect to the maximum was two fold less than after IHA injection. The myocardial uptake of the two dimethylated fatty acids studied, i.e. 16-iodo-2,2-methyl hexadecanoic acid and 16-iodo-3,3-methyl hexadecanoic acid, was less than that of IHA in mice and dogs. In the latter, the myocardial uptake was so small that we were unable to study the time course of its activity. Consequently, these dimethylated fatty acids are not suitable for the study of the myocardial uptake of fatty acids in man.
