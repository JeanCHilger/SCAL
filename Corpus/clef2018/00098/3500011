Radioimmunoscintigraphy with monoclonal antibodies. Radioimmunoscintigraphy is presented as a new imaging modality in nuclear medicine, using specific antigen-antibody interactions. Monoclonal antibodies to tumor-associated antigens facilitate the characterization of molecular differences between tumors and normal cells. Labelled with gamma-emitting radioisotopes like I-131, I-123, In-111, and Tc99M, these antibodies can be used for in-vivo imaging. Radioimmunoscintigraphy does not compete with morphological modalities like CT and ultrasound, but provides additional information based on its functional principle. Hidden lesions may be detected. Target-to-background ratios, however, are still rather low hampering scintigraphic imaging. The use of Single Photon Emissions Computed Tomography (SPECT) in addition to planar scintigraphy resolves background activities thus providing better visualization and localization of tumors, and increasing sensitivity. The high cost of these time-consuming studies is still a limiting factor to its wider use. Its preliminary indication is founded on the suspicion of tumor progression, based on clinical findings and/or increasing serum tumor markers (CEA, CA 19-9, CA 12-5). This paper provides an overview over possible applications of radioimmunoscintigraphy. Its clinical use is demonstrated by studies of malignant melanoma, colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer.
