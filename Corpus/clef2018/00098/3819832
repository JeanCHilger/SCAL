Cerebral blood flow in patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus before and after shunting. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by xenon-133 inhalation and single photon emission tomography in 17 demented patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus before and after shunt treatment. All patients had a decreased conductance to outflow (C out) of cerebrospinal fluid as measured by lumboventricular perfusion (C out less than 0.12 ml X mm Hg-1 X min-1). Computerized tomography (CT) scanning, clinical assessment, and neuropsychological grading were performed pre- and postoperatively. The preoperative CBF studies revealed abnormal flow patterns in all patients. Fourteen patients showed moderate-sized, large, or very large central low-flow areas, and four patients had reduced flow bilaterally in the occipital and contiguous temporoparietal regions. After shunting, six patients had a significant reduction in the size of the central low-flow area on the CBF map, agreeing well with the changes of ventricular size on the CT scan. All six patients showed an improvement in either clinical or neuropsychological grading. In 10 of the remaining 11 patients flow patterns were essentially unchanged one patient deteriorated further. Four of these 11 patients improved on postoperative clinical or neuropsychological testing. Thus, a positive correlation was found between the changes in CBF and the reduction of the ventricular size on the CT scan, but changes in CBF as measured by the present technique did not accompany improvement in the functional state in all patients.
