Measurement of blood flow, oxygen utilisation, oxygen extraction ratio, and fractional blood volume in human brain tumours and surrounding oedematous tissue. The blood flow, oxygen utilisation, oxygen extraction ratio, and fractional blood volume were measured in brain tumours and the surrounding cerebral tissues. A total of 21 patients were studied. These included 10 primary tumours, eight secondary and three with unknown histology. Measurements were performed using the oxygen-15 steady state inhalation technique and positron emission tomography. Within the tumours no relation between blood flow, oxygen utilisation and blood volume was found. In all tumours oxygen supply was in excess of the oxygen demand of the tissues as reflected in oxygen extraction ratios that were lower than those of normal brain tissue. No indication of local ischaemia in peritumour oedema was found.
