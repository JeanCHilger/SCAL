CT-guided stereotactic neurosurgery: experience in 24 cases with a new stereotactic system. Twenty-four cases have been operated upon using a prototype Brown-Roberts-Wells, CT-guided stereotactic neurosurgical system. This device has proved to be practical and flexible in clinical use. No CT scanner modifications were required, a fact which simplified its use in more than one hospital. Multiple targets can be biopsied with ease and relative safety. Drainage and other therapeutic procedures can be carried out with minimal hazard. Future applications of this system may include its use with NMR and PET images.
