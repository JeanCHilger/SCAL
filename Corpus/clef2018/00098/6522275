Results of scintigraphic studies with 131I-meta-benzylguanidine in space-occupying lesions of neuroectodermal origin. Between 1982 and 1984, 48 studies with 131I-meta-benzylguanidine were carried out in Erlangen in patients with suspected pheochromocytoma or neuroblastoma. Scintigraphy with MIBG was found to be highly specific. False positive findings can be avoided if with weak uptakes an exact correlation with the results of morphological studies such as CT or sonography is sought and if follow-up observations ensure that they are not caused by activity residues in the biliary, intestinal or urinary pathways. False negative findings are made in 5-10% of the investigations in pheochromocytoma and in 41% of those in neuroblastoma patients. In pheochromocytoma the uptake rates are generally low (1-2%), whereas in neuroblastoma they may reach 10% and more.
