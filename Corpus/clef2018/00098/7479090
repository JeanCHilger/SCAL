Image fusion of MRI and immunoscintigraphy with MAb-170 in ovarian tumors. In recent years multimodality imaging achieved growing importance. It is mostly performed by means of quite expensive software and hardware solutions. In the present pilot study a simple and low-cost procedure was developed to achieve image fusion in the pelvis. The image data of immunoscintigraphy (SPECT) and MRI were transferred to a personal computer and combined by standard software for image manipulation. The results in eleven patients with space-occupying lesions in the pelvis showed that adequate anatometabolic slices could be achieved. The results show a tendency to increased specificity and precision of multimodality imaging in comparison with SPECT and MRI alone. In conclusion, the low-cost solution, as developed by us, is feasible in clinical practice. Its results are reliable in clinical decision making.
