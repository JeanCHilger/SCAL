Electroencephalography and single photon emission computed tomography in dementia: a comparative study. A series of elderly patients with dementia of Alzheimer type (AD), multi-infarct dementia (MID) and functional (non-organic) psychiatric illness (major depressive disorder) were selected according to DSM-III-R criteria and received: a battery of cognitive tests, EEG and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) using 99mTc HMPAO. The EEG and SPECT scans were examined independently of the clinical data. The former were divided into two abnormal categories, those showing AD type change and vascular change respectively, and a normal group. The SPECT scans were classified as follows: a SPECT rCBF pattern showing bilateral temporoparietal perfusion deficits (AD type) those showing single focal perfusion deficits or multiple areas of low perfusion in the cerebral cortex suggestive of ischaemic change (vascular type SPECT picture)
