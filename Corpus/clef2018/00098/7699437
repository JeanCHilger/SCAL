Rapid calculation of regional cerebral blood flow and distribution volume using iodine-123-iodoamphetamine and dynamic SPECT. Iodine-123-iodoamphetamine (IMP) is commonly used as a flow tracer for SPECT due to its large first-pass extraction fraction. Significant clearance from the brain, however, causes changes in distribution and underestimation of CBF values when a conventional microsphere model is applied to prolonged data acquisition. We have developed a rapid method to calculate CBF images in which clearance effects are taken into account.A dynamic SPECT scan was obtained from five subjects (four patients with cerebral infarctions and one healthy volunteer) following intravenous injection of IMP lasting 1 min. The arterial input function was obtained by frequent blood sampling and measurement of the octanol extraction ratio. The dynamic images were weighted and integrated so that the look-up table procedures yielded values of CBF and distribution volume (Vd) simultaneously.Calculated values for CBF and Vd were consistent with those determined by nonlinear least squares fitting [CBF: Y = 1.03X-0.30 (ml/100 ml/min), r = 0.998, p < 0.001 Vd: Y = 0.99X-0.11 (ml/ml), r = 0.99, p < 0.001] and calculated CBF correlated significantly with CBF measured by PET [Y = 0.85X-0.15 (ml/100 ml/min), r = 0.92, p < 0.001].This technique is valid for estimating CBF.
