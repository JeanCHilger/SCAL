A case of successful acute revascularization using a long vein graft. We experienced a case of successful acute revascularization using a long vein graft. A 68-year-old man was admitted to our department due to transient ischemic attack of the left hemiparesis. CT scan showed no infarction, but PAO-SPECT revealed moderate hypoperfusion in the right ACA and MCA area. Cerebral angiography demonstrated right IC occlusion at its origin and moderate collateral circulation via leptomeningeal anastomosis from the PCA area, and via the external carotid system, especially directly from STA. But the STA was very narrow. Three days after admission, left hemiparesis appeared again and deteriorated severely. This time the hemiparesis persisted. Although MRI demonstrated little infarction in the right frontal lobe, we decided to carry out revascularization on the same day. Right saphenous vein was harvested for a graft because of the narrow STA. The facial artery and angular artery was selected as a donor and a recipient respectively, to avoid a clamp of the EC and a craniotomy of the STA running area. Finally we performed a facial artery-vein graft-angular artery (M4) bypass. The patient showed no complication and the left hemiparesis improved enough to allow the patient to walk by himself. Revascularization using vein graft is dangerous for acute ischemia due to the possibility of a complication such as brain edema and hemorrhagic infarction. The usual style of vein graft bypass is an EC-vein graft-M2 or M3 bypass. Using this style, high pressure inside the EC is carried intracranially.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
