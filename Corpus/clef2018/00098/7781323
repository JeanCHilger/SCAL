Activation of human hippocampal formation during memory for faces: a PET study. Using positron emission tomography, we examined cerebral blood flow changes in human subjects whilst engaged in the visual processing of face stimuli. A task requiring anterograde memory of faces was compared with a control task involving simple gender classification--considered an automatic process that did not require any significant memory component. A second task requiring recognition of famous politicians' faces, and therefore involving long-term "semantic" memory, was also contrasted with the control task. To identify brain regions associated with primary visual processing of the face we compared all tasks against a control population scanned with eyes closed. Our results indicate--(1) The involvement of bilateral lingual/fusiform gyri and the right parahippocampal gyrus in addition to striate cortex in primary visual processing of the face (2) the involvement of the left hippocampal gyrus in both types of memory
