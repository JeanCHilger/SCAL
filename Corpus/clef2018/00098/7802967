Distribution of cocaine recognition sites in rat brain: in vitro and ex vivo autoradiography with [125I]RTI-55. The distribution of binding sites of [125I]RTI-55 (3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropan-2 beta-carboxylic acid methyl ester), a phenyl tropane analog of cocaine, and the selective labeling of the dopamine transporter (DAT) were studied by in vitro and ex vivo autoradiography in the rat whole brain. Recent evidence has shown that RTI-55 binds to not only DAT but also serotonin transporter (5HTT). In the present study, in vitro autoradiography revealed that [125I]RTI-55 bound to the olfactory tubercle, the caudate putamen, the accumbens nucleus, the midline and lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus, the hypothalamic nuclei, the substantia nigra compact part, the subthalamic nucleus, the ventral tegmental area, the superior colliculus, the dorsal raphe nucleus, and the facial nucleus. Further, in the presence of clomipramine, a selective ligand for 5HTT, [125I]RTI-55 binding was remarkably inhibited in the midline and lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus, the hypothalamic nuclei, the superior colliculus, the dorsal raphe nucleus, and the facial nucleus, while [125I]RTI-55 binding remained in the olfactory tubercle, the caudate putamen, the accumbens nucleus, the substantia nigra compact part, the subthalamic nucleus, and the ventral tegmental area. These findings suggest that [125I]RTI-55 binds to 5HTT in the former areas and to DAT in the latter areas. It is therefore concluded that RTI-55 is a suitable ligand for studying the action of cocaine in whole brain regions, including the thalamus, the hypothalamus and the dorsal raphe nucleus, regions in which cocaine is thought to act evoking several neurological effects, e.g., analgesia and elevation of adrenocorticotropic hormone. DAT was also labelled selectively both in vitro and in vivo using [125I]RTI-55 combined with clomipramine. Therefore, radiolabelled RTI-55, combined with unlabelled clomipramine, which displaces its binding to 5HTT, also appears to be suitable for the selective imaging of DAT in vivo.
