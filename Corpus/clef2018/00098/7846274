Information improving secondary evaluation procedures in neuroradiology. The development of special computer and software systems has exerted great influence on computer-assisted image processing in neuroradiology. In this article we try to give an overview of the present and future applications. The applications can be subdivided into segmentation, image analysis, three-dimensional imaging and image fusion. Segmentation plays an important role, because it is frequently the basis for the other methods. Image analysis, like planimetry, volumetry or the calculation of angles, is already used in clinical applications. In this way the course of diseases can be checked objectively. Three-dimensional imaging is especially useful in the planning of surgical and stereotactic approaches. The results and value of three-dimensional imaging depend on the segmentation technique. Therefore, they are evaluated differently. Image fusion allows the simultaneous presentation of image data of different modalities. In particular, the image fusion of morphological findings and functional parameters is applied in clinical neuroradiology. Our experience with these methods suggests that computer-assisted image processing will be of considerable help in neuroradiology.
