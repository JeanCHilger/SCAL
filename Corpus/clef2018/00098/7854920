Evaluation of cerebral vasoreactivity by SPECT and transcranial Doppler sonography using the acetazolamide test. rCBF SPECT with 99mTc-HMPAO was performed prospectively in 29 patients (3 controls and 26 stroke patients) as well as TCD studies in 20 patients (3 controls and 17 stroke patients) before and after 1 g i.v. acetazolamide. The sensitivity of rCBF SPECT increased from 62% to 77% after acetazolamide provocation in stroke patients. In patients with a reversible neurological deficit, the sensitivity under resting conditions was 50% which increased to 71%, while in cases with a permanent deficit it increased from 75% to 83%. In the evaluation of the cerebrovascular reserve capacity the results of rCBF SPECT and TCD coincided in 91% of the hemispheres. The correlation was statistically significant.
