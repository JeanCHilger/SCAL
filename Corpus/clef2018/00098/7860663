Systemic and cerebral kinetics of 16 alpha [18F]fluoro-17 beta-estradiol: a ligand for the in vivo assessment of estrogen receptor binding parameters. Estrogen receptors are expressed in several brain areas of various animal species, and steroid hormones exert physiologic and biochemical effects on the central nervous system. The aim of the present study was to evaluate in female adult rats, the suitability of 16 alpha [18F]fluoro-17 beta-estradiol ([18F]FES), a selective estrogen receptor ligand, for the in vivo assessment of brain estrogen receptors. This was considered to be a preliminary step in evaluating the potential usefulness of [18F]FES for studies of cerebral estrogen receptors with positron emission tomography (PET) in nonhuman primates and human subjects. We evaluated (a) the time course of the metabolic degradation of [18F]FES in blood (b) the time course of distribution of the tracer in discrete cerebral areas
