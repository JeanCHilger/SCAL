Dust from carpeted and smooth floors. VI. Allergens in homes compared with those in schools in Norway. The amounts of dust, protein, and allergens in vacuumed floor covering samples taken from both schools and homes in Norway have been investigated. Classrooms contained significantly more crude dust per unit area than homes, while the mean protein content per unit area was somewhat higher in homes. The main allergen exposure problem in classrooms was that of pet allergens the contents of dog allergens and the major cat (Felis domesticus) allergen Fel d I per unit area were significantly higher in school classrooms than in homes of families who do not keep pets. The mite and food allergens, on the contrary, were more prevalent in homes. Carpeted floors in schools and homes contained significantly more dust, proteins, and allergens than smooth floors (P < 0.05). Fel d I was detected in the vacuum cleaners' filter system in concentrations from < 1 ng to 1080 ng, confirming that this allergen can pass through the dust bag during vacuuming.
