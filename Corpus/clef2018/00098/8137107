Central D2 receptors and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Most in vivo studies of striatal D2 receptor (SD2R) density with positron emission tomography in schizophrenia have attempted to relate this variable to the diagnosis of the illness. In the present study, a relationship between SD2R and clinical dimensions of this psychosis was searched for in a highly selected group of young negative schizophrenics (8 drug-na√Øve and 2 drug-free). The SD2R density index measured in vivo using 76Br-bromolisuride and PET correlated negatively (r = 0.80, P < 0.01) with a psychomotor dimension of schizophrenia involving blunted affect and alogia. The mean SD2R index of the patients did not differ from that of age-matched control subjects. Therefore, this behavioural dimension accounts for the variance of the SD2R, suggesting that the striatal dopamine system modulates symptoms such as flattened affect and alogia.
