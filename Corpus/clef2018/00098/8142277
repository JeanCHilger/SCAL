Value of thallium-201 SPECT imaging in childhood brain tumors. Thallium-201 chloride single photon emission computed tomography (201Tl SPECT) has been proposed as a diagnostic tool in the assessment of patients with brain tumors. We performed SPECT scans coupled with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with brain tumors to determine the sensitivity and potential value of SPECT in neuro-oncology. Each patient was injected with 2.5-3.0 mCi of thallium chloride, followed by technetium-99m HMPAO (5-15 mCi) to assess cerebral perfusion. 201Tl uptake was imaged with triple-headed SPECT in 20/24 (83%) histologically and anatomically diverse neoplasms with MRI-measurable residual disease, including 13/16 (80%) posterior fossa tumors. 201Tl SPECT demonstrated uptake in tumors with MRI volumes ranging from 0.03 to 60 cm3. 201Tl SPECT imaging was not correlated with the following MRI features: gadolinium enhancement, necrosis, exophytic, unicentric and multicentric. 201Tl uptake was not detectable in patients with tumors of maldevelopmental origin or radionecrosis. It is suggested that 201Tl SPECT is an important imaging adjunct in the assessment of children with brain tumors.
