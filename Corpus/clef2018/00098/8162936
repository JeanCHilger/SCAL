Preparation of a potential positron emission tomographic radioligand for the dopamine transporter. NNC 12-0722 (1-[2-(bis(4-fluorophenyl)-methoxy)ethyl]-4-methyl piperazine) is a new selective inhibitor of the dopamine transporter. [11C]NNC 12-0722 was prepared by N-methylation of the desmethyl compound with [11C]methyl iodide. The total radiochemical yield of [11C]NNC 12-0722 was 40%-50% with an overall synthesis time of 30-35 min. The radiochemical purity was higher than 99% and the specific radioactivity about 1500 Ci/mmol (55 GBq/mumol). Autoradiographic examination of [11C]NNC 12-0722 binding on whole hemisphere cryosections from human brain post mortem demonstrated specific binding in the caudate nucleus and putamen. In a positron emission tomographic examination of [11C]NNC 12-0722 in a cynomolgus monkey there was a rapid uptake of radioactivity in the brain. In the striatum, a region with a high density of dopamine transporters, the radioactivity was two times higher than in the cerebellum. These results indicate that [11C]NNC 12-0722 may be a useful radioligand for labelling of the dopamine transporter in man.
