Brain imaging in schizophrenia -- especially by Computed Tomography. The evaluation of the contribution of structural and functional brain imaging to the contemporary understanding of schizophrenia is presented. The studies of schizophrenia using, especially, Computed Tomography (CT) and also Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET), are reviewed and their contribution to current theories of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia are discussed. This literature is reviewed for clinical, biochemical and environmental correlates of structural brain abnormalities in schizophrenia. The results are summarized and the critical questions raised by these studies are outlined. Future studies in this field are needed to yield current insight into the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
