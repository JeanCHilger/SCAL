Correlations between abnormalities on brain SPECT scan and interictal EEG-foci in children with 'intractable' partial epilepsy. SPECT scanning with Tc99mHM-PAO was performed on 40 children with 'intractable' partial epilepsy 27 patients had abnormalities on SPECT images consisting of areas of decreased cerebral blood flow. In 18 of these 27 subjects there was a good correlation between site of the abnormalities on SPECT scan and interictal EEG foci. 12 patients with regionally decreased CBF had also neuroimaging (C.T. and/or R.M.I.) abnormalities. The brain SPECT provides more precise detection of epileptogenic foci, when used to complement EEG, also in childhood-onset epilepsy.
