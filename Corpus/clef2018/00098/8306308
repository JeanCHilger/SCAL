3D modeling in myocardial 201TL SPECT. A method to model the left ventricular myocardium in thallium-201 Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is presented. This method is based on the fitting of the morphological skeleton of the left ventricle to a truncated bullet. This automatic approach would provide a more reproducible visualization of the organ for clinical applications.
