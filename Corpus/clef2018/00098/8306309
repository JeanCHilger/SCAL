Validation of an MRI/PET landmark registration method using 3D simulated PET images and point simulations. Three-dimensional (3D) simulated PET images generated from MRI were used to validate a multimodality registration technique based on the identification of internal anatomical landmarks. In addition, point-based simulations were compared with registration datasets acquired over 3 yr of routine use of the technique. Registration errors were found to range from 1.0 mm at the brain centre to 2.8 mm in each dimension at the brain surface.
