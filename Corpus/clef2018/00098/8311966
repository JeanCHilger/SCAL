Comparison of dobutamine stress echocardiography and stress thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography for detecting coronary artery disease. Dobutamine stress echocardiography and stress thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were compared for detecting coronary artery disease in 120 consecutive patients who underwent concomitant quantitative coronary angiography. The left ventricle was divided into anterior, inferior, and lateral regions. Wall motion or perfusion abnormalities observed within each region were classified as ischemia or fixed abnormality. Both tests showed 81% agreement in all 120 patients. Complete agreement was observed in 77% of the 360 regions analyzed. The overall sensitivity of dobutamine stress echocardiography and thallium-201 SPECT for the detection of coronary artery disease was 85% and 89%, and the specificity was 93% and 85%, respectively. A good correlation was found between the wall motion score index and perfusion defect size at peak stress and at rest (r = 0.70). Dobutamine stress echocardiography and thallium-201 SPECT exhibit a comparable accuracy for diagnosing coronary artery disease, localizing coronary artery stenosis, and detecting regional myocardial abnormalities. The wall motion score index may be useful for evaluating the myocardial area at risk.
