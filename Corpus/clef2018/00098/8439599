Spectral analysis of the EEG and 99m-Tc-HMPAO SPECT-scan in Alzheimer's disease. 99m-technetium-hexamethylpropylene-amineoxine (99m-Tc-HMPAO) single-photon-emission-computer-tomography (SPECT)-scans and spectral analyzed electroencephalogram (EEGs) of 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were studied. A significant correlation was found between the temporoparietal-cerebellar-ratio (TP/C-ratio) of the SPECT-scan and the peak frequencies of leads T3-T5, C3-P3, and C4-P4 of the EEG. In addition a significant negative correlation between the TP/C-ratio and the theta/alpha-ratio (t/a-ratio) of leads T3-T5, T4-T6, C3-P3, and C4-P4 was demonstrated. Our study demonstrates that slowing of the EEG parallels a decrease in blood flow in the temporoparietal regions in AD-patients. Both findings could be parallel phenomena of regional hypometabolism.
