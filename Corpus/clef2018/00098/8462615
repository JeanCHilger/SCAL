Verification of the integral transformation of the projections technique for scatter correction in positron tomographs. A scatter correction algorithm, based on the integral transformation of the projections, has been implemented when using the C.N.R. positron tomograph in Pisa. The performance of the method has been evaluated by measurements on ad hoc phantoms. The technique allows a significant average reduction of the reconstructed scatter fraction. The limitations of this approach have also been investigated.
