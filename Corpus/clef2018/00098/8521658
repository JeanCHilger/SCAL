Evaluation of cerebral blood flow in patients with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension using Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT during postural testing. To determine whether regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) would change on standing in patients with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension (IOH), Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT studies were performed during postural testing in five patients with IOH. After 10 minutes of quiet rest on a bed, the patients arose quickly and, at the same time, the radiotracer was injected intravenously. SPECT data were obtained with a ring-type SPECT scanner. Another dose of Tc-99m HMPAO was injected with the subjects in the supine position, and SPECT was performed again. Image subtraction was used to evaluate the change in rCBF caused by postural testing. In all patients, the authors observed a decrease of rCBF ni the frontal cortex and basal ganglia. This preliminary study suggests that changes in rCBF occur in patients with IOH on standing, and Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT performed during postural testing may have an important role in evaluating these changes.
