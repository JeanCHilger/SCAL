Estimation of overall pulmonary function after irradiation using dose-effect relations for local functional injury. To predict the pulmonary function 3-4 months after irradiation for malignant lymphoma from the three-dimensional (3-D) dose distribution.Dose-effect relations for the relative reduction of local perfusion (Q) and local ventilation (V), were calculated in 25 patients, using correlated SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) and CT data. By combining the 3-D dose distribution of an individual patient with the dose-effect relations averaged over all patients, the average reduction of local Q and V (i.e., the overall response parameters) in the whole lung was estimated for each patient. Correlation coefficients were calculated between these overall response parameters and the change in standard lung function tests. In addition, the relation between the overall response parameters and the incidence of radiation pneumonitis was determined.The overall response parameter for perfusion was correlated with the change in standard lung function tests, with correlation coefficients varying between 0.53 (p = 0.007) and 0.71 (p < 0.001) for the change of Vital Capacity and Forced Expiratory Volume at 1 s, respectively. For the overall response parameter for ventilation similar correlations were observed. Four out of the 25 patients developed radiation pneumonitis in these four patients the overall response parameter for perfusion was on average somewhat higher (13.2 +/- 1.4% (1 standard error of the mean)) than in patients without radiation pneumonitis (10.5 +/- 1.0%), but this difference was not significant. A higher incidence of radiation pneumonitis was observed for larger values of the overall response parameter for perfusionBy combining the 3-D dose distribution with the average dose-effect relations for local perfusion or ventilation, an overall response parameter can be calculated prior to irradiation, which is predictive for the radiation-induced change in the overall pulmonary function, and possibly for the incidence of radiation pneumonitis, in this group of patients.
