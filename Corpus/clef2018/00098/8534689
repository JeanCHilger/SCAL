Peritoneal transport evaluation in peritonitis: comparison between methods. Peritoneal dialysis patients may need solute permeability transport evaluation during acute peritonitis. The aim of this study was to assess if the simplified mass transfer coefficient (MTCS) or the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was equivalent to the complex MTC (MTCX) in solute transport evaluation during acute peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. We studied 15 episodes of peritonitis (PTIS). Results were compared to a baseline patient study (PRE) and a control study done 30 days after diagnosis of peritonitis (POST). All peritoneal evaluation methods showed a significant increase in solute transport during acute peritonitis compared to baseline and control studies. There was an acceptable correlation between MTCX and simplified methods including the PET in the baseline and control studies. However, correlation between MTCX and simplified methods decreased during acute peritonitis. Likewise, the PET showed a better correlation with MTCX than MTCS. We conclude that the PET has an acceptable agreement with MTCX even during acute peritonitis, so the PET can be a useful tool in evaluating peritonitis-induced peritoneal permeability changes.
