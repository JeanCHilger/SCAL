Positron emission tomography in drug evaluation: influence of three different catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors on metabolism of [NCA] 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa in rhesus monkey. We compared the influence of three different catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors (CGP 28014, OR-611 and Ro 40-7592) on the metabolism of no-carrier-added (NCA) 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa (6-FDOPA) in one Rhesus monkey. All three COMT inhibitors improved 6-FDOPA availability in plasma, increased the specific uptake in the brain and thus improved 6-FDOPA uptake measurements using positron emission tomography (PET). Best results were obtained with Ro 40-7592.
