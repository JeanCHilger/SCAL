Magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy, like PET, allows cerebral function to be assessed neuro-anatomically. In addition to being noninvasive and not requiring ionizing radiation, this technique can be performed with equipment available at most medical centers. Initial studies suggest both proton and phosphorous spectroscopy will be useful adjunctive presurgical tests for the localization of the epileptogenic foci in patients with partial epilepsy, especially those with extratemporal foci. Furthermore, MRS imaging may prove to be a useful tool for studying the response to medical treatment and the pathophysiologic basis of epilepsy.
