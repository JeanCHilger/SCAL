Positron emission tomography and plasma biochemistry findings in schizophrenic patients before and after electroconvulsive therapy. The clinical effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on the morbidity of paranoid schizophrenic patients were assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) and plasma biochemistry studies before and after ECT. The present study included five patients whose average age was 41.4 years. The average duration of illness was 23.0 years. To avoid any effect of changes in drugs on PET, no changes were made in the medication of any of the five patients during the study period. ECT improved the clinical symptoms in every patient. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) on PET in both temporal lobes and the left cerebellum was higher in paranoid schizophrenia before ECT than in normal subjects, and rCBF after ECT in both frontal lobes, the right temporal lobe and the right putamen was lower than before ECT as mental symptoms improved. These findings suggest high cerebral blood flow volume in paranoid schizophrenia. Plasma biochemistry studies revealed a lower level of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) after ECT than before ECT, but a higher level of prolactin existed.
