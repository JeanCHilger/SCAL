Positron emission tomographic studies of cerebral benzodiazepine-receptor binding in chronic alcoholics. Positron emission tomography was used with [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose to study GABA type A/benzodiazepine (GA-BA-A/BDZ) receptors and cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (1CMRg1c) in 17 male patients with severe chronic alcoholism (ALC), 8 with (ACD) and 9 without alcoholic cerebellar degeneration (non-ACD). In comparison with male normal controls of similar ages, the ALC group had significantly reduced FMZ ligand influx (K1), FMZ distribution volume (DV), and 1CMRg1c bilaterally in the medial frontal lobes, including superior frontal gyrus and rostral cingulate gyrus the ACD group had significant reductions of K1, DV, and 1CMRg1c bilaterally in the same distribution, and also in the superior cerebellar vermis
