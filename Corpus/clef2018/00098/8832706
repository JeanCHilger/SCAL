Back-to-back "one-pot" [18F]FDG syntheses in a single Siemens-CTI chemistry process control unit. Simple changes in the chemistry, plumbing, and programming of the Siemens-CTI chemistry process control unit (CPCU) effectively double its output by enabling two back-to-back "1-pot" syntheses of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose in a single unit. Replacement of Kryptofix 2.2.2 with tetramethylammonium carbonate and elimination of diethyl ether from the procedure shorten synthesis time to 48 min, improve process and end-product safety, and increase end-of-synthesis yields from 37% to 52% by minimizing steps and transfer losses.
