Activation PET scanning in pretreatment evaluation of patients with cerebral tumours or vascular lesions in or close to the sensorimotor cortex. Treatment of tumours and vascular lesions in or close to eloquent cortex may inflict neurological deficits. Intra-operative mapping procedures have been used for many decades in efforts to minimize neurological sequelae. The possibility for non-invasive pre-operative brain mapping has emerged with the advent of positron emission tomography (PET). In this paper we report on 11 patients with a tumour or vascular lesion in or close to the sensorimotor (10 patients) or visual cortex (one patient). The patients were subjected to activation PET scanning by means of vibrotactile or visual stimulation. The results show that in most of the patients the important relation between the lesion and the sensorimotor cortex could be determined. The patient with a lesion in the occipital lobe had involvement of the entire visual cortex as judged by comparison with activated areas on the nonlesion side.
