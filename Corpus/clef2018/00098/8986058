Regional cerebral blood flow measurements using 99mTc-ECD SPECT in patients with Alzheimer's disease (ad) in the early stage. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements using a Patlak plot method and SPECT with 99mTc-ECD were performed in 10 patients with possible Alzheimer's disease (AD), 14 patients with probable AD, and 11 age-matched normal control subjects. The whole brain CBF for the probable group showed significant reduction to 37.2 ml/100 g/min as compared with the normal value of 42.1 ml/100 g/min, whereas the possible group did not show significant reduction of the whole brain CBF. In the possible and probable groups, rCBF values in the bilateral hippocampi, supramarginal gyri, angular gyri were lower than normal values. Moreover, in the probable group, rCBF values showed significant decrease in the superior, middle and inferior temporal gyri. The whole brain CBF and rCBF, especially in the bilateral hippocampal regions, showed significant positive correlation with the scale of MMSE and HDS-R. These results suggest that noninvasive rCBF measurements using 99mTc-ECD are quite useful for the early diagnosis of AD.
