Correlation of functional independence measure (FIM) and SPECT Iofetamine (I-123) as a predictor of functional return in stroke. Function following stroke is often measured using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Independence occurs when the patient achieves certain levels of functions. SPECT imaging assesses the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Is it possible to correlate the FIM scores with SPECT imaging and predict functional return? We evaluated total of 69 stroke patients with SPECT imaging using Iofetamine (I-123). Patients were scanned within 14-21 days post-stroke. CT scans were evaluated and correlated with the SPECT images. This information was compared with the admission and discharge FIM scores. The rCBF reperfusion changes and region of stroke were evaluated and correlated with discharge functional status. The right parietal areas demonstrated a strong correlation with SPECT and FIM changes as predictors of return of functional living status (p-value = 0.0438). The right parietal area demonstrated an improvement in ambulation (p-value = 0.0578) the right brain correlated with overall improvement in FIM scores and change in SPECT imaging (p-value = 0.0833)
