Pheochromocytoma in dogs and cats. Pheochromocytomas are endocrine tumors arising from chromaffin cells (pheochromocytes) of the adrenal glands in dogs and cats. The clinical symptomatology produced results from the direct presence and space-occupying nature of the tumor, or the secondary presence of excessive amounts of excreted catecholamines. Diagnosis and management of pheochromocytomas remain great challenges for veterinary clinicians. The diagnosis is based on the results of supporting routine lab evaluation, blood-pressure determinations, selected biochemical and pharmacologic tests, and a number of imaging techniques. Surgical extirpation continues to be the only definitive treatment for the pheochromocytoma. Medical therapy is used to stabilize the metabolic and cardiovascular states of the patient in a preoperative and surgical setting as well as to manage chronic long-term effects of excess catecholamines in patients with inoperable or metastatic disease.
