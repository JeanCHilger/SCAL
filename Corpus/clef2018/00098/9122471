Left ventricular function in patients with chronic ischemic cardiopathy: relationship with the status of myocardial perfusion. The aim of this study was the evaluation of left ventricular function compared to myocardial perfusion in patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD). Thirty-two patients with chronic CAD (27 men and 5 women, mean age 58 +/- 9 years) underwent radionuclide angiography and rest-redistribution thallium-201 (TI-201) single photon emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). Ejection fraction (EF, %), peak filling rate (PFR, end diastolic volume/second), and the coefficient of variation of the regional time to PFR (CV-TPFR, %) were computed. Patients with severe irreversible defects (i.e. with TI-201 uptake < 50%) had lower EF (42 +/- 7% vs 52 +/- 11%, p < 0.01) and lower PFR (1.9 +/- 0.4 vs 3.1 +/- 1.0, p < 0.0005) than those without. Patients with severe irreversible perfusion defects in the left anterior descending artery territory had lower EF (41 +/- 6% vs 50 +/- 11%, p < 0.01), lower PFR (1.8 +/- 0.3 vs 2.8 +/- 1.0, p < 0.005), and higher CV-TPFR (39 +/- 22 vs 13 +/- 7, p < 0.001) than those without. The results of the present study indicate that in patients with chronic CAD left ventricular systolic and diastolic function is more deteriorated when the left anterior descending artery is involved. Similarly, the presence of severe irreversible perfusion defects is clearly associated with significantly lower EF and PFR.
