Positron emission tomography (PET) with fludeoxyglucose F 18 in the study of adrenal masses: comparison of benign and malignant lesions. In this study, 15 patients (4 men and 11 women, mean age: 50 +/- 13 years) with unilateral adrenal masses detected on ultrasound (US), Computed Tomography (CT) and/or Magnetic Resonance (MR) studies were submitted to positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG). Histology demonstrated 3 adenomas, 1 myelolipoma, 1 angiolipoma, 1 neurinoma, 1 cyst, 1 malignant pheochromocytoma, 4 carcinomas and 3 metastases. The patient population was divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 7) consisted of benign adrenal lesions. Group 2 consisted of malignant adrenal tumors. Lesion measurements were performed on the basis of the results of US, CT and/or MR images. In Group 1, no FDG uptake was observed in adrenal masses. Conversely, in Group 2 adrenal lesions showed abnormally increased FDG uptake, suggesting high glucose tumor metabolism. No significant difference in lesion size was observed between Groups 1 and 2 (5.6 +/- 4.0 vs 6.3 +/- 3.0 cm). Furthermore, in 6 patients of Group 2, total body PET images showed abnormal FDG uptake in extra-adrenal locations, such as chest (n = 2) and abdominal (n = 5) lymph nodes, lungs (n = 6), liver (n = 5), pancreas (n = 1), bone (n = 1) and muscle (n = 1) tissues. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that PET imaging with FDG can characterize adrenal masses. In particular, abnormally increased FDG uptake in adrenal malignancies allows to differentiate these abnormalities from benign lesions. Furthermore, total body imaging PET can identify extra-adrenal tumor sites in patients with malignant tumors.
