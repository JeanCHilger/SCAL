Brain hypometabolism of glucose in low-weight depressed patients and in anorectic patients: a consequence of starvation? As low-weight anorectic patients presented a global as well as a regional absolute hypometabolism of glucose, we investigated a population of ten age- and sex-matched low-weight depressed patients without anorexia nervosa to evaluate the impact of weight loss on cerebral glucose metabolism evaluated by positron emission tomography and [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose. Ten age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were used as controls. Absolute global and regional glucose activity was significantly lower in anorectic and low weight depressed patients than in control subjects. Anorectic patients compared with normal control subjects also showed lower relative metabolism of glucose in the parietal cortex. Within patients, absolute hypometabolism of glucose seems to be a consequence of low-weight while there is a positive correlation between absolute metabolism of glucose and body mass index.
