Benign lesions of the liver and their surgical treatment. The authors submit a group of 17 patients with benign hepatic lesions operated during the past five years. Most frequently haemangiomas were encountered, less frequently adenomas and focal nodular hyperplasia. It was revealed that accurate diagnosis is possible even when sonography, CT, MRI and even scintigraph (SPECT) are used only in haemangioms. When indicating surgery the clinical symptomatology, uncertain diagnosis and difficulty and risk of surgery itself must be taken into account.
