Does the anabolic metabolism of L-[2-18F]fluorophenylalanine and L-[2,6-3H]phenylalanine differ in the cerebrum and the cerebellum? The anabolism of isotopically labeled amino acids was compared between the cerebrum and the cerebellum in conscious rat at three feeding conditions. After L-[2-18F]fluorophenylalanine and L-[2,6-3H]phenylalanine injections, the incorporation rate of both radioactivity into protein fraction showed no difference between the cerebrum and the cerebellum at normal condition, but the lipid fraction in the cerebellum was higher than that in the cerebrum in any conditions. These results show the usefulness of L-[2-18F]fluorophenylalanine as a positron emission tomography tracer and different anabolic rate of the amino acids to lipid between the cerebrum and cerebellum.
