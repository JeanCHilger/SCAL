A windowless 13N production target for use with low energy deuteron accelerators. The recent development of low energy accelerators for positron emission tomography has necessitated the development of new targets for 13N production. 12C(d,n)13N reaction yields in graphite at low deuteron beam energies (0.8-3.2 MeV) are presented and a new technique for the in situ extraction of 13N activity from solid graphite and subsequent conversion to [13N] ammonia is described. The target is windowless and is reusable for multiple isotope production runs. This technique utilizes radio frequency induction heating to rapidly heat the graphite to combustion temperatures in an O2 gas stream. The conversion of activity induced in the target to [13N] ammonia in under 10 min with an overall decay-corrected efficiency of 45% is reported.
