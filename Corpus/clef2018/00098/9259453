Mapping of cortical areas involved in color vision in non-human primates. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to measure changes in the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of rhesus monkeys performing visual discrimination tasks. In comparison with both position and brightness discrimination tasks, the color discrimination task activated the posterior inferior temporal cortex and a ventromedial occipital region, which is located along the anterior one-third of the calcarine sulcus. In contrast, the position task activated the middle temporal area and intraparietal cortex as compared with the color task. These results confirm the segregation of visual pathways and delineate the visual areas involved in color vision. This approach might bridge the gap between invasive studies in animals and functional imaging studies in humans.
