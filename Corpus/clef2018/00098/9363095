High-resolution computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography in interstitial lung disease. In patients who have interstitial lung disease, chest radiography remains the primary imaging technique for both initial diagnosis and follow-up. For further investigation of selected patients the imaging modality of choice is currently high-resolution computed tomography. Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography have great potential in this field, particularly with respect to disease activity, but are still largely experimental and are not routinely employed.
