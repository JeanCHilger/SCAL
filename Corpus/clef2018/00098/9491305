SPECT and MRI findings in a case of extensive neuronal migration disorder. We report a 20-year-old male with epilepsy, mild mental retardation, growth asymmetry, and MRI and SPECT features of unilateral subcortical ectopic cortex. The neurological examination showed mild growth asymmetry, hemiparesis and hemihypoesthesia and pyramidal signs on the left side. EEG showed focal abnormality in the right frontotemporal region. MRI revealed pachygyria and severe heterotopia associated with some abnormalities of ventricles and cerebellum on the right. Cortical responses were absent on stimulation of the left median and tibial nerves. Central motor conduction time from cortex to left upper extremity was prolonged in magnetic stimulation test. SPECT using 99 mTc-HMPAO revealed increased perfusion of the right subcortical region as compared with those of overlying cortical mantle and opposite hemisphere. To our knowledge, there has been no report documenting such a large and extensive subcortical ectopic cortex which appears as a mass distorting and shifting the middle structure in an adult, such as in our case.
