Results of the surveys for the year were aggregated, and weighted data were analyzed.Ninety percent of respondents had heard about rabies during the preceding year, and 84% considered it a problem in Connecticut. Forty-seven percent of households surveyed owned dogs or cats. Ninety-three percent of dogs and 80% of cats were reported to be vaccinated against rabies. Twenty-two percent of households with cats had at least 1 cat that was not current on rabies vaccination.In Connecticut, an epizootic of rabies in raccoons was accompanied by a high degree of awareness of rabies and rate of reported vaccination of dogs and cats. However, vaccination of cats was less common than that of dogs. Public education efforts should emphasize the necessity to vaccinate cats and to avoid contact with unknown cats in rabies epizootic or enzootic areas. A surveillance system can be used to help evaluate public health programs.
