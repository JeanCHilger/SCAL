Effects of subcortical cerebrovascular lesions on cortical hemodynamic parameters assessed by perfusion magnetic resonance imaging. A simultaneous decrease of cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) has been described after subcortical stroke with positron emission tomography. However, this imaging modality cannot be applied routinely to stroke patients. Dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI techniques (DSC-MRI) might be interesting in the assessment of these effects. Dynamic T2-weighted echo planar imaging was used to produce DSC-MR images during an intravenous bolus injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine in 9 patients who experienced a subcortical stroke involving thalamus or basal ganglia and in 8 control subjects. A series of 50 consecutive images at 1-second intervals was acquired at the anatomic level of the centrum semiovale quite distant from the subcortical lesion, rCBF and rCBV were determined over frontal and parietal regions of interest and through the entire cortical mantle. DSC-MRI enabled the detection of hemodynamic changes induced by subcortical stroke. Analysis of rCBV and rCBF values showed that the hemodynamic parameters were significantly decreased on the affected side. In controls mean rCBF and rCBV values recorded over the whole cortical mantle of each hemisphere showed no significant interhemispheric asymmetry.
