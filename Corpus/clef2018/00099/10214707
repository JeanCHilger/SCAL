Preparation and primary evaluation of [11C]CSC as a possible tracer for mapping adenosine A2A receptors by PET. A 11C labeled selective adenosine A2A antagonist, (E)-8-(3-chlorostyryl)-1,3-dimethyl-7-[11C]methylxanthine [11C]CSC) was prepared by the reaction of (E)-8-(3-chlorostyryl)-1,3-dimethylxanthine and [11C]methyl iodide. The decay-corrected radiochemical yield was 32.3% with a radiochemical purity of 99%, a specific activity of 1.85-5.55 GBq/mumol and a preparation time of 1 h. A primary evaluation of [11C]CSC as a potential tracer for mapping adenosine A2A receptors by positron emission tomography (PET) is also presented. Biodistribution and autoradiographic studies were carried out on Swiss mice and domestic rabbits. In mice the lung showed the highest uptake at 10 min after i.v. injection, followed by the liver, kidney, heart and brain. Inside the brain a high level of radioactivity accumulated in the striatum, in accordance with previous findings on the specific spatial distribution of A2A adenosine receptors and also in the medulla oblongata. Dynamic PET studies on rabbits showed a fast brain uptake of CSC, reaching a maximum in less then 2 min. On the basis of competition experiments with the unlabeled ligand [11C]CSC proves to bind specifically to the appropriate receptor.
