Synthesis of [11C]salicylic acid and related compounds and their biodistribution in mice. For in vivo measurement of the hydroxyl radical (.OH), we synthesized [11C]salicylic acid, [11C]O-acetylsalicylic acid and [11C]2-methoxybenzoic acid by carboxylation of 2-bromomagnesiumanisol using [11C]CO2. The radiochemical yield of [11C]salicylic acid, [11C]O-acetylsalicylic acid and [11C]2-methoxybenzoic acid calculated from trapped [11C]CO2 in a liquid argon cooled stainless tube was 7.3 +/- 1.6, 5.2 and 10.2 +/- 1.7% (decay corrected), respectively. The uptake of 11C tracers by mouse brain was 0.46, 0.32, and 0.46% dose/g tissue, respectively, at 10 min post injection and presented washout patterns thereafter.
