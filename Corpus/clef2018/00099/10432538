Gender differences in gated acquisition and perfusion tests. This article reports results of coronary artery disease assessment in 475 patients. Each patient underwent both perfusion testing and a gated acquisition test. Female patients had much higher normal rates on both tests than male patients, a discrepancy that is not attributable to age differences, the stress method used or the patients' ability to reach 85% of maximum heart rate.
