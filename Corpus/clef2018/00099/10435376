Comparison of three PET dopamine D2-like receptor ligands, [11C]raclopride, [11C]nemonapride and [11C]N-methylspiperone, in rats. We studied the tracer kinetics of three dopamine D2-like receptor ligands, [11C]raclopride ([11C]RAC), [11C]nemonapride ([11C]NEM) and [11C]N-methylspiperone ([11C]MSP), in anesthetized rats by tissue dissection, ex vivo ARG and PET in order to clarify their characteristics for PET imaging. The in vivo affinity of the three ligands for the striatum ([11C]MSP > [11C]NEM > [11C]RAC) obeyed the in vitro affinity for dopamine D2 receptors. The affinity of [11C]RAC and [11C]MSP for the cerebellum was very low, but the affinity of [11C]NEM for the cerebellum was compatible to that for the cortex and was not to be ignored. Also the affinity of [11C]MSP for the cortex was relatively high. [11C]RAC showed the highest selectivity. The striatal PET image with [11C]RAC was clearer than that with [11C]NEM or [11C]MSP, but the activity decreased much faster than that measured by tissue dissection because of the partial volume effect. The striatal activity with [11C]NEM remained high and that with [11C]MSP gradually increased. [11C]RAC and [11C]MSP, but not [11C]NEM, showed a high accumulation in the periorbital region.
