Comparative in vivo study of iodine-123-labeled beta-CIT and nor-beta-CIT binding to serotonin transporters in rat brain. Both iodine-123-labeled beta-CIT (2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane) and nor-beta-CIT (2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane) have shown to be suitable radioligands for imaging serotonin (5-HT) transporters. [(123)I]nor-beta-CIT has the highest in vitro affinity for 5-HT transporters among beta-CIT analogs reported so far. However, no direct comparison-studies of these two radiotracers as to their in vivo binding to 5-HT transporters have been reported so far. Therefore, it is still unclear which of the two radiotracers is more suitable for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of 5-HT transporters. The purpose of this study was to compare directly in a controlled design the in vivo [(123)I]beta-CIT and [(123)I]nor-beta-CIT binding to 5-HT transporters under the same conditions in rats with the focus on brain kinetic characteristics by means of a two-compartment analysis. We observed that [(123)I]beta-CIT has a higher binding potential and faster kinetics for 5-HT transporters than [(123)I]nor-beta-CIT, suggesting that [(123)I]beta-CIT may be a more suitable radioligand than [(123)I]nor-beta-CIT for imaging 5-HT transporters with SPECT.
