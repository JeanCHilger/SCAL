Hibernating myocardium: morphological correlates of inotropic stimulation and glucose uptake. In patients with postischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, segments recovering function after revascularisation (hibernating myocardium) may not respond during dobutamine echocardiography, despite preserved [(18)F] 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake at positron emission tomography.To investigate whether this lack of response might reflect the degree of ultrastructural change in hibernating myocardium.Transmural biopsies were obtained from 22 dysfunctional segments in 22 patients during coronary artery bypass grafting and examined by light and electron microscopy. Wall motion scores and coronary vasodilator reserve were assessed before and after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).Mean (SD) wall motion score improved in all segments following CABG (from 2.24 (0.4) to 1.55 (0.4) p < 0.0001), confirming hibernating myocardium. In these segments myocardial blood flow (positron emission tomography with H(2)(15)O) before CABG was similar to that in normal volunteers (1.02 (0.24) v 1.02 (0.23) ml/min/g), while the coronary vasodilator reserve was blunted (1.26 (0.7) v 3.2 (1.6)Hibernating myocardium is characterised by a reduced coronary vasodilator reserve which improves on revascularisation and shows a spectrum of ultrastructural changes that influence the response to dobutamine, while FDG uptake is invariably preserved.
