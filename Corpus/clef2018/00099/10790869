Tracking Alzheimer's disease in transgenic mice using fluorodeoxyglucose autoradiography. While transgenic mice have great promise in the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD), uncertainties remain about the extent to which they provide a model of the disorder or the best way to characterize disease progression. Using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) autoradiography, we found that transgenic mice over-expressing a mutant form of the human amyloid precursor protein have preferentially and progressively reduced activity in the posterior cingulate cortex and relatively spared activity in visual cortex, sensorimotor cortex, cerebellum and brain stem, a pattern previously demonstrated in FDG PET studies of persons with Alzheimer's disease, Brain imaging of posterior cingulate activity could provide an indicator of AD in suitable animals, helping to clarify disease mechanisms and screen candidate treatments.
