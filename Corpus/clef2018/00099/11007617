Novel beta-emitting poly(ethylene terephthalate) surface modification. Restenosis after percutaneous interventions in coronary and peripheral arteries leads to repeat procedures and surgery in a significant number of patients. We have previously demonstrated that irradiation of an arterial site using an endovascular source (brachytherapy) is highly effective in preventing the restenotic process. To this end, a novel beta radiation delivery system was developed, based on the adsorption of (32)P (o-phosphoric acid) by pH-sensitive chitosan hydrogel on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) balloon surface. The PET balloon surface was treated with oxygen plasma and coated with chitosan hydrogel. Covalent bonds, ionic bonds, and hydrogen bonds all contribute to the adhesion between chitosan hydrogel and PET. In the aqueous phosphoric acid (PA) solution, the -NH(2) groups of chitosan were protonated by PA and the adsorption of PA occurred at the same time. The effect of PA concentration and temperature on adsorption efficiency and kinetics were studied. More than 70% PA was adsorbed on the sample surface in 0.2 mM PA solution. The surface of samples was also investigated by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. PET surface may be modified to carry high activity beta emitters such materials may be useful in a therapeutic setting
