Efficacy and safety of rectal thiopental sedation in outpatient echocardiographic examination of children. The efficacy and safety of rectal thiopental administration in sedation for paediatric echocardiographic examination were prospectively investigated in infants with known or suspected congenital heart disease in an outpatient manner. A total of 1150 patients (546F, 604M) were studied 264 were 7 d to 6 mo old (group I), 572 were 6 mo to 2-y-old (group II), and 314 were 2 to 6-y-old (group III). Thiopental sodium dissolved in 10 ml of water in a syringe to which a 6-F feeding catheter was attached was administered prior to echocardiographic examination to patients in groups I, II and III with doses of 50, 35 and 25 mg/kg, respectively in an emergency care environment. Length of time to achieve sedation (induction time), duration of sedation, length of time to return to normal activity (recovery time), whether sedation was successful and side effects were recorded. In the overall study population, sedation was successful in 1094 (95.1%) of the patients, the induction time was 16.34 +/- 3.69 min, the duration of sedation was 35.07 +/- 7.04 min, the recovery time was 63.25 +/- 10.17 min and the overall side-effect prevalence was 2%. Sedation was significantly more successful, the induction time was significantly shorter, the recovery time was significantly longer and side effects significantly more prominent in groups I and II compared to group III.Rectally administered thiopental is a safe and efficacious agent for sedation of infants and young children with known or suspected congenital heart disease who are undergoing echocardiography in an outpatient cardiology clinic, provided that it is used in an emergency care setting considering the risk of respiratory depression even though the prevalence of this side effect is significantly low.
