The short- and mid-term results of bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt with additional source of pulmonary blood flow as definitive palliation for the functional single ventricular heart. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the early and late outcomes of bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (BCPS) as a definitive procedure for the functional single ventricular heart.From September 1991 to December 1997, 34 patients underwent a BCPS procedure without a routine conversion to Fontan circulation. The additional source of pulmonary blood flow was left in all patients. Conversion was performed only when it was required for excessive cyanosis.The hospital mortality rate was 8.8% (3/34, 95% confidence limit 1.9-23%) and the 5-year survival rate was 75% for a mean follow-up period of 33+/-22 months. Seven patients underwent a conversion procedure for remnant or recurrent cyanosis and deterioration of exercise tolerance. Four of these patients died after conversion to Fontan circulation. Twenty-five long-term survivors with BCPSs maintained an arterial oxygen saturation of 84+/-6.1%, and 52% of them had a normal exercise tolerance or mild limitation. No patients developed severe late complications other than recurrent cyanosis.Due to the high mortality after conversion to Fontan circulation in patients whose conditions had deteriorated, we could not demonstrate the clear superiority of long-term BCPS over the construction of Fontan circulation for management of the functional single ventricular heart. If deteriorated conditions were successfully managed in the late period, the outcome of long-term BCPS would have been better.
