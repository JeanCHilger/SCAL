The effect of a single-dose intravenous vinpocetine on brain metabolism in patients with ischemic stroke. The effect of a single-dose i.v. infusion of vinpocetine on the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and glucose metabolism of post-stroke patients was studied by measuring the regional and global cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (CMRglu) and the corresponding kinetic constants before and after treatment. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) measurements were also performed. The cerebral glucose metabolism was significantly higher in the contralateral hemisphere than in the affected one before therapy. In the affected hemisphere the regional glucose metabolism was inhomogenous: relatively low values were measured in the stroke region, whereas it was increased in the peristroke region. Although a single-dose vinpocetine treatment did not affect significantly the regional or global metabolic rates of glucose, the glucose transport (both intracellular up-take and release) was strongly affected in the whole brain, in the contralateral hemisphere and in the peri-infarct area of the symptomatic hemisphere. A slightly increased (not significant, N. S.) cerebral blood flow could be observed in the contralateral and a decreased flow (N. S.) in the symptomatic hemisphere.
