Comparison of 133Xe gas dynamic SPECT and thin-section CT in patients with pulmonary emphysema. We assessed 133Xe gas dynamic single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) by comparing washout axial images with thin-section CT (TSCT) in patients with pulmonary emphysema.Twenty-three patients were studied. All patients were diagnosed as having pulmonary emphysema on the basis of TSCT. We compared TSCT of upper, middle and lower lung fields with 133Xe gas dynamic SPECT axial images at the corresponding levels during the 3 to 4 minutes of washout phase. If the degree of 133Xe gas retention or TSCT finding of ventral and dorsal parts was not the same, the images were divided into two parts.A total of 174 lesions in 23 cases were examined, but 3 lesions having no retention of 133Xe gas at equilibrium phase were excluded. The results showed that: there were 37 lesions (21.6%) with equivalent severity on both images there were 42 lesions (24.5%) with more severity on 133Xe gas dynamic SPECT than on TSCTBy comparison of axial images of 133Xe gas dynamic SPECT with CT images, we could recognize the areas of 133Xe gas retention in detail. Results suggest that 133Xe gas dynamic SPECT can be useful to identify ventilation impairment in pulmonary emphysema.
