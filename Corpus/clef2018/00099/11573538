Undiagnosed cardiomyopathy in a neonate: significance of low oxygen saturation during anaesthesia. A case study is described of a 7-day-old full term baby with bilateral congenital cataracts who underwent surgical removal of both cataracts 2 days apart. Problems with oxygen saturation during and after the first anaesthetic prompted further investigation that revealed a non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The significance and possible causes of low oxygen saturation in a previously healthy neonate during anaesthesia are discussed. The likely diagnosis of Sengers syndrome, and the evaluation of asymptomatic babies with cardiac pathology are discussed.
