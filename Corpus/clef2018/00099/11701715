Plasma fatty acids, adiposity, and variance of skeletal muscle insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Skeletal muscle insulin resistance (IR) is typically severe in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the factors that account for interindividual differences in the severity of IR are not well understood. The current study was undertaken to examine the respective roles of plasma FFA, regional adiposity, and other metabolic factors as determinants of the severity of skeletal muscle IR in type 2 DM. Twenty-three subjects (12 women and 11 men) with type 2 DM underwent positron emission tomography imaging using [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose during euglycemic insulin infusions (120 mU/min x m2) to measure skeletal muscle IR, using Patlak analysis of the tissue activity curves. Body composition analysis included body mass index, fat mass, and fat-free mass by dual energy x-ray tomography, and computed tomography determinations of visceral adiposity, thigh adipose tissue distribution, and muscle composition. Body mass index, fat mass, subfascial adiposity in the thigh, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were all significantly related to skeletal muscle IR (r = -0.48 to -0.63 P < 0.01). However, the strongest simple correlate of IR in skeletal muscle was insulin-suppressed plasma FFA (r = -0.81
