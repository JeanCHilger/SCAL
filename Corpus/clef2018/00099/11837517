Left ventricular function and infarct size 20 months after primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction. To study changes in left ventricular function and infarct size during long-term follow-up after acute myocardial infarction treated with primary angioplasty.From 1996 to 1998, 100 consecutive patients were treated with primary angioplasty for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Angioplasty was successful in 95% of the patients. Global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was determined by radionuclide ventriculography before discharge, after 6 weeks and after a mean follow-up time of 20 months. Infarct size was assessed by technetium 99m-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion tomography (SPECT) at rest, performed at the same time intervals.Mean LVEF was 56% at discharge, 55% after 6 weeks and 57% after 20 months of follow-up. No significant improvement in LVEF was observed. Only 8% of the patients at follow-up had LVEF lower than 40%. After 1 week, a mean perfusion defect of 19% was measured by SPECT. After 6 weeks and 20 months of follow-up, the mean perfusion defects were reduced to 14% (p < 0.001) and 15%, respectively.Left ventricular function was well preserved with a mean LVEF of 57% 20 months after primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction. No significant change in LVEF was observed from 1 week after angioplasty to follow-up. Infarct sizes as assessed by SPECT imaging with tetrofosmin were reduced from 1 to 6 weeks, but did not change further during long-term follow-up. The reduction in the perfusion defects over time was probably due to gradual relief of stunning.
