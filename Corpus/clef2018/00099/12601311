Combined positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging of recurrent thyroid cancer. The study goal was to evaluate the use of combined positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging for localization of recurrent disease in thyroid cancer patients.Eight patients with suspected recurrence of thyroid cancer on the basis of elevated serum thyroglobulin or calcitonin levels underwent combined PET/CT imaging on a prototype device. All 8 patients had previously undergone total thyroidectomy and (131)I ablation for thyroid carcinoma. Patients with papillary carcinoma had negative (131)I scans.Eight patients underwent combined PET/CT scanning. Four (50%) of 8 patients underwent PET/CT indicating recurrence in the head and neck. A total of 11 lesions in these 4 patients were suspicious for recurrence on combined PET/CT imaging. Three patients with 8 lesions suspicious for recurrence on PET/CT underwent surgical removal of disease. All 3 patients had pathologic confirmation of recurrence, with 6 (75.0%) of 8 lesions being positive.Combined PET/CT imaging is a valuable tool for the diagnosis and anatomic localization of recurrent thyroid cancer.
