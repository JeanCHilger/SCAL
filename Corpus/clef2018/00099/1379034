Palliative arterial repair for transposition, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary vascular disease. Failure to repair transposition of the great arteries and ventricular septal defect in the young infant results in the early development of pulmonary vascular occlusive disease. Complete repair, preferably by an arterial switch procedure and ventricular septal defect closure, may then not be possible. We report a palliative arterial switch procedure in a 5 1/2-year-old patient with transposition, ventricular septal defect, and severe pulmonary vascular obstructive disease in whom progressive hypoxemia and exercise intolerance developed. An arterial repair without ventricular septal defect closure was performed. After the operation, the child's systemic arterial oxygen saturation and exercise tolerance have substantially improved. Although the progression of pulmonary vascular disease may not be altered, arterial repair can provide effective palliation in this subset of patients.
