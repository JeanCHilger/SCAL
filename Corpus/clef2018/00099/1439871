Neuropsychiatric disorders: investigation of schizophrenia and substance abuse. Because neuropsychiatric disorders involve functional and neurochemical cerebral abnormalities, positron emission tomography (PET) is ideally suited for their investigation. The use of tracers to measure regional brain glucose metabolism and/or blood flow has allowed the evaluation of brain function in psychiatric patients. The use of radioligands to assess receptor concentration has enabled an evaluation of the extent to which specific neurotransmitter systems are involved in the pathogenesis of mental illness. This article reviews the application of PET technology to the understanding of schizophrenic disorders and substance abuse.
