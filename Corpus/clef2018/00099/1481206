Digestive disorders in rabbits and guinea pigs. Numerous digestive tract diseases in pet rabbits and guinea pigs result from both an inherent physiological predisposition and from poor feeding and husbandry. A large proportion of digestive disturbances in rabbits and guinea pigs are secondary to changes in the oral cavity caused by inadequate teeth wear. The required regular trimming of the cheek teeth using a modified spatula and hollow pair of pincers is described and illustrated. The symptoms, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of a selection of digestive disorders, as commonly encountered in small animal practice, are presented. The difficulties of using antibiotics in view of the gram positive intestinal flora and possible dysbacteria, dysentery and enterotoxaemia are considered. Finally, advice on feeding and on the rearing of orphan neonates is given.
