Identification of phosphatidylcholine-selective and phosphatidylinositol-selective phospholipases D in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Intact cells and cell-free systems were employed to characterize phospholipase D (PLD) activity in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. In cells prelabeled with [3H]glycerol, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) elicited phosphatidylcholine (PC) hydrolysis by PLD, as shown by the prolonged formation of [3H]phosphatidylethanol (PEt) and an accompanying decrease in [3H]PC. In contrast, bradykinin elicited rapid formation of [3H]PEt (approximately 1 min) accompanied by a decrease in [3H]phosphatidylinositol (PI). When the agonists were administered simultaneously, [3H]PEt formation was biphasic. In cells prelabeled with [3H] choline, at times less than 1 min, bradykinin failed to induce significant change in [3H]choline release. Bradykinin-induced formation of [3H]PEt in the [3H]glycerol-labeled cells was strictly dependent on extracellular Ca2+, whereas TPA-induced formation of [3H]PEt did not require extracellular Ca2+. Cell-free assays for PLD were used to assess the enzyme location, substrate specificity, and cofactor requirements. The PC-PLD activity (PEt formation) against [3H]stearoyl-PC was primarily localized in the 440 x g pellet (membrane- and nuclear-associated), preferred PC as a substrate, required detergent, and was not influenced by Ca2+ at low concentrations but was inhibited by Ca2+ in excess of 0.5 mM. The PI-PLD activity against [3H]stearoyl-PI was found largely in the 100,000 x g supernatant (cytosol), was strictly Ca(2+)-dependent, and did not require detergent. From these data, we conclude that MDCK cells contain two PLD subtypes: 1) a membrane-associated, PC-selective enzyme that responds to TPA resulting in prolonged hydrolysis of PC (the PC-PLD is Ca(2+)-independent, but requires detergent) 2) a cytosolic, PI-selective enzyme that responds rapidly but transiently to bradykinin (the PI-PLD requires Ca2+ but not detergent).
