Utilization of PET scan in breast and gynaecologic cancers. The use of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in positron emission tomography (PET) is a major advance in imaging in the recent past. Its use in breast and gynaecologic cancers is not well established and needs to be discussed for each patient. This discussion must rely on a better knowledge of potential interests as well as of the limits of metabolic or logistic limits of PET.
