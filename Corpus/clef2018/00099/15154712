Regional wall motion and wall thickening visual scores from gated SPECT in anterior and infero-lateral myocardial infarctions. The relationship between the visual scores for wall motion (WM) and wall thickening (WT) of different left ventricular regions in patients with anterior and infero-lateral myocardial infarctions was evaluated using gated SPECT.Ninety consecutive patients (79 men and 11 women mean age 56 +/- 9 years) with previous myocardial infarction (33 anterior and 57 infero-lateral) were included. Left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions (EFs) were calculated from quantitative rest gated SPECT 99mTc tetrofosmin images by using the QGS automatic algorithm. Global and regional (anterior, septal, inferior and lateral) wall motion and wall thickening scores were calculated by consensus of three experienced observers.The correlation between EFs and wall motion and wall thickening scores was better for WM scores in anterior (r=0.904, P<0.0001) than infero-lateral infarctions (r=0.674, P<0.0001). Correlation between wall motion and wall thickening scores was also better for anterior (r=0.898, P<0.0001) than for infero-lateral infarctions (r=0.750, P<0.0001). Except in septal regions, WT scores of the different regions were higher than WM scores (P<0.05) but the statistical significance was higher (P<0.001) in inferior and lateral regions of infero-lateral infarctions.Visual global wall motion and wall thickening scores obtained by gated SPECT showed good correlation between them and with the EF, but differences were observed between regional wall motion and wall thickening, especially in inferior and lateral regions of patients with infero-lateral infarctions.
