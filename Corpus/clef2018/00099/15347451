Non-dilated coronary artery lesion and myocardial perfusion in children with Kawasaki disease: analysis of 43 cases. The study was designed to investigate the impact of non-dilated coronary artery wall lesion on myocardial perfusion.Doppler tissue image (DTI) was used to measure regional ventricular wall motion in 43 Kawasaki children with non-dilated coronary arterial wall echocardiographic abnormalities (rough intima and arterial wall thickening) detected by two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) at acute phase. A total of 31 cases who had both non-dilated coronary lesion and lowered ventricular wall motion velocity at subacute and convalescence phase underwent submaximal exercise single photon emitting computerized tomography (SPECT) for the evaluation of myocardial perfusion.In 43 cases of Kawasaki disease with non-dilated coronary arterial wall abnormalities, 36 cases (83.7%) still had such lesions at subacute phase and 32 (74.4%)at convalescence. At the same time, lowered regional ventricular wall motion (RVWM) was found in 34 cases at subacute phase and in 31 cases at convalescence. DTI and 2DE had a very good correlation in the detection of such abnormalities (chi(c)2 = 9.64, P < 0.01 in subacute period, and chi(c)2 = 7.14, P < 0.01 in convalescence). In 31 cases accepting SPECT, 17 were positive. A total of 22 ischemic regions were detected. Eighteen out of 22 cases having ischemic regions had abnormal RVWM on DTI. SPECT ischemic regions were significantly in accordance with lowered RVWM in ventricular septum and anterior wall (chi(c)2=5.07 and 7.48, P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) noted in DTI.Non-dilated coronary arterial wall abnormality is one of the forms of coronary artery wall lesions which could reduce myocardial flow perfusion. Its clinical significance is worthy of attention.
