MIBG, an inhibitor of arginine-dependent mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation, prevents differentiation of L6 skeletal myoblasts by inhibiting expression of myogenin and p21(cip1). The development of skeletal muscle is controlled by a highly synchronized series of cellular events, and various signals from both inside and outside the cell play a role in the switch from multipotential mesodermal stem cells to muscle fibers. Meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), an inhibitor of mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation, has been shown to prevent terminal differentiation of skeletal myoblasts however, its mechanism of action has not been established. We recently reported that MIBG is capable of preventing phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells by interfering with specific trans-acting factors [L. Yau, B. Litchie, S. Thomas, B. Storie, N. Yurkova, P. Zahradka, Endogenous mono-ADP-ribosylation mediates smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration via protein kinase N-dependent induction of c-fos expression. Eur. J. Biochem. 270 (2003) 101-110.]. We therefore examined the effect of MIBG on select myogenic regulatory factors known to control terminal differentiation. It was confirmed that MIBG, but not inhibitors of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (3-aminobenzamide, PD128763), inhibits fusion of L6 skeletal myoblasts in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, inhibition by MIBG correlated with a failure to induce expression of myogenin and p21(cip1), while levels of MyoD and MEF2 were unaffected. Time-of-addition studies revealed that MIBG also affected a late event possibly linked to cell fusion. Finally, arginine-dependent mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferase activity increased over the first 24 h of the differentiation period. These data support a role for arginine-dependent mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferase as an essential positive regulator of differentiation in skeletal muscle cells that operates by modulating the expression of specific myogenic factors.
