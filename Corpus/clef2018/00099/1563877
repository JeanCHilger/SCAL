Identification of recurrent ischemia after coronary artery bypass surgery: a comparison of positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography. Current techniques for the detection of recurrent coronary stenoses following bypass grafting have shown disappointing diagnostic accuracy. This study used the same dipyridamole-handgrip stress to compare the accuracy of rubidium-82 positron emission tomography and thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography, in 50 consecutive post-bypass patients undergoing coronary arteriography at a mean interval of 6.5 years after surgery. Significant stenoses in native coronary vessels (greater than 50% diameter) or grafts (greater than 70% diameter) were defined by quantitative angiography. Forty-six patients had recurrent or residual stenoses, 43 (93%) had a perfusion defect identified by positron emission tomography, and 35 (76%) were identified by single photon emission computed tomography (P = 0.04). Fourteen of the 17 patients (82%) without previous Q-wave myocardial infarction were identified by positron emission tomography 10 of the 17 (59%) were detected by single photon emission computed tomography (P = NS). Stress-induced perfusion defects were demonstrated by positron emission tomography in 19 patients
