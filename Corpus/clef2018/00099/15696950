99mTc-MIBI imaging of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. To explore a noninvasive, effective and preoperative method of diagnosis for nasopharyngeal angiofibroma.The craniocervical examination oncotropic by 99mTc-MIBI imaging was performed in 3 patients with nasopharyngeal angiofibroma.Early 99mTc-MIBI imaging was weakly positive and late its imaging was radioactively defective in 3 cases of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. 99mTc-MIBI imaging of the angiofibroma was significantly different from that of malignant and benign tumors.99mTc-MIBI oncotropic imaging is of qualitatively diagnostic value for nasopharyngeal angiofibroma before operation, because 99mTc-MIBI imaging was of certain features.
