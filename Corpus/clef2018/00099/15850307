Criss-cross heart: anesthetic considerations for total cavopulmonary shunt (Fontan procedure). We report the anesthetic technique used for interatrial septal defect a 2-year-old girl weighing 11 Kg who presented with crossed atrioventricular connection (criss-cross heart), transposition of the great vessels, interatrial and interventricular septal defects, and subpulmonary and pulmonary valve stenoses. The patient was proposed for total cavopulmonary anastomosis with basal arterial oxygen saturation (SapO2) at 65%. Anesthesia was induced with inhaled agents and after intubation, hyperventilation was induced to achieve an end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure around 27 mm Hg. General anesthesia was provided in combination with spinal infusion of morphine chloride (100 microg Kg(-1)) for pain control. A Fontan procedure was carried out uneventfully with cardiopulmonary bypass. Milrinone was used at the extracorporeal circuit pump outlet. The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit where she was extubated without complications 90 minutes after admission. Anesthetic management is based on maintaining adequate preloading doses by administering volume, inhaled and/or intravenous agents, or use of vasoconstrictors and adjustment of ventilator parameters to modify pulmonary or systemic vascular resistance. We were able to maintain normal arterial pressure in our patient and provide adequate preloading through hyperventilation to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance.
