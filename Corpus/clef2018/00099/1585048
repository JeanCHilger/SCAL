A guide dog in the life of the blind--experiences, insights, considerations. A guide dog user himself, the author nevertheless sets out to put forth in as unprejudiced a manner as possible the pros and cons of this mobility aid for blind persons. After a brief outline of the history and present situation of guide dog use in Germany, the author addresses the skills such a service animal must be provided with, dealing both with genetic and biographic issues relative to his or her suitability and training. Also, the team, conceived as a differentiated action entity, is set out in some detail due to its unique structure and dynamics, dealing also with its intricate relationship with the environment. Concluding, the author on the one hand addresses the psychologically important adjustment difficulties a person without previous experience in using this aid may be faced with, and on the other the partnership-based position of the guide dog in private and occupational social interaction.
