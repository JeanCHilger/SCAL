Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy at various parts of the body in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. We compared MIBG uptake at various parts of the body in controls and patients with Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. In the heart, MIBG uptake in Parkinson's disease (early H/M: 1.668+/-0.325, late H/M: 1.500+/-0.402) was less than that in multiple system atrophy (early H/M: 2.395+/-0.186, late H/M: 2.530+/-0.391) and controls (early H/M: 2.635+/-0.508, late H/M: 2.575+/-0.635) (early: P<0.0001, late: P<0.0001). There were no significant differences in uptake by the lung, thyroid, or liver in the three groups. Only on early images, uptake in the shoulder in multiple system atrophy (early S/M: 0.473+/-0.78) and Parkinson's disease (early S/M: 0.470+/-0.710) was decreased compared to that in controls (early S/M: 0.560+/-0.118) (P=0.0252). MIBG is reported to be taken up in the terminal part of sympathetic nerves and demonstrates sympathetic nerve activity, especially on late images. The cause of differences between the heart and other parts of the body remains unknown. We consider the following possibilities: (a) differences in the sympathetic nervous system between Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy are more subtle in organs other than the heart (b) the cause of MIBG uptake reduction by the heart in Parkinson's disease involves factors in addition to sympathetic nervous system damage
