Positron emission tomography imaging of small animals in anticancer drug development. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of small animals enables researchers to bridge the gap between in vitro science and in vivo human studies. The imaging paradigm can be established and refined in animals before implementation in humans and image data related to ex vivo assays of biological activity. Small animal PET (saPET) imaging enables assessment of baseline focal pathophysiology, pharmacokinetics, biological target modulation and the efficacy of novel drugs. The potential and challenge of this technology as applied to anticancer drug development is discussed here.
