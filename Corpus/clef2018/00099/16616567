Clinical evaluation of multimodal environmental modification (MEMO) in the management of cats with idiopathic cystitis. This prospective observational study evaluated client-reported recurrence of lower urinary tract signs (LUTS) and other signs of abnormalities in cats with idiopathic cystitis after institution of multimodal environmental modification (MEMO). Forty-six client-owned indoor-housed cats with idiopathic cystitis, diagnosed based on a history of recurrent LUTS and evidence of absence of urolithiasis or bacterial urinary tract infection were studied. In addition to their usual care, clients were offered recommendations for MEMO based on a detailed environmental history. Cases were followed for 10 months by client contact to determine the effect of MEMO on LUTS and other signs. Significant (P<0.05) reductions in LUTS, fearfulness, nervousness, signs referable to the respiratory tract, and a trend (P<0.1) toward reduced aggressive behavior and signs referable to the lower intestinal tract were identified. These results suggest that MEMO is a promising adjunctive therapy for indoor-housed cats with LUTS, and should be followed up with prospective controlled clinical trials.
