Whole-body positron emission tomography with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose for the detection of recurrence in uterine sarcomas. We evaluated the usefulness of whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) using F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) for the detection of recurrence in follow-up patients after primary treatment of uterine sarcoma. Eight patients with pathologically proven uterine sarcoma underwent FDG-PET, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasonography (US). Final diagnoses of recurrence were established in five cases (three carcinosarcomas and two leiomyosarcomas). PET revealed recurrent sites in the intraperitoneum, liver, lung, bone, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. However, the minimum size of the tumor detected by PET depended on the sites of recurrence. CT and US images showed two false-negative cases of intraperitoneal tumors. PET was able to detect a solitary small intraperitoneal tumor, which was very difficult to detect by CT and US. Positive PET findings did not affect the prognosis in three of the five recurrent patients however, the remaining two patients consequently underwent the combination therapy consisting of surgery and chemotherapy and survived for more than 1 year after the positive FDG-PET results. Application of PET imaging for the early detection of recurrent sites was useful for the decision of treatment strategy for patients with recurrent uterine sarcoma.
