The effects of coronary abnormalities on reconstruction of right ventricular outflow tract in patients with complex congenital heart disease. To explore the effects of coronary abnormalities on reconstruction of right ventricular outflow tract in patients with complex congenital heart disease.Eighty patients, including tetralogy of Fallot 14 cases and double outlet right ventricle (DORV) 4 cases with anomalous coronary artery, underwent surgical treatment from April 1989 to May 2004. The coronary diseases included single left or right coronary artery in 11 cases, left anterior descending coronary artery originating from right coronary artery in 6 cases, vascular plexus on right outflow tract in 1 case. One-stage correction was undergone in 17 cases, palliative procedure in 1 case. The reconstruction methods were as follows: mobilizing coronary artery and expanding incision under coronary artery with pericardial patches in 4 cases repairing ventricular septal defect (VSD) via the incision beneath the coronary artery and expanding right ventricular outlet tract (RVOT) and pulmonary via longitudinal incision over the coronary artery in 3 cases. VSD were repaired via right atrium and minimal incision on RVOT plus incision on pulmonary were made to expand RVOT. Trunk of pulmonary were anastomosis with RVOT in 3 cases. Homograft valved aorta were used in 3 cases.One case died of serious low cardiac output syndrome postoperatively. There was no critical complication of hemorrhage and respiratory tract. Oxygen saturation rose from 68.0% to 82.0% after treated by palliative procedure. Seventeen cases were followed from 10 months to 8 years, 1 case suddenly died with no clear cause. Three cases were with residual leak, 3 with residual obstruction.Surgical procedure should be selected according to the characteristics of coronary disease with complex congenital heart disease.
