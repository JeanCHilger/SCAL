Failure of right ventricular adaptation in children with tetralogy of Fallot. The left ventricle (LV) adapts to chronic hypoxia by expressing protective angiogenic, metabolic, and antioxidant genes to improve O2 delivery and energy production, and to minimize reoxygenation injury. The ability of the right ventricle (RV) to adapt to hypoxia in children with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is unknown.Gene expression using real-time polymerase chain reaction was measured in RV myocardium obtained during surgical repair of TOF from 23 patients: 13 cyanotic and 10 acyanotic. Results were compared between the 2 groups and correlated with age at surgery, severity of cyanosis, and early postoperative course. The cyanotic patients were younger at surgery compared with acyanotic (5+/-3 versus 9+/-4 months P=0.01), had higher hematocrit (43+/-4 versus 38+/-3 grams/dLThe RV fails to up regulate adaptive pathways in response to increasing hypoxia in children with TOF. The implications of an early maladaptive response of the RV on long-term RV function require further investigation.
