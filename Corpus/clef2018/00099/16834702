Lack of initiative and interest in Alzheimer's disease: a single photon emission computed tomography study. Apathy is defined as a lack of motivation. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between two major dimensions of apathy (lack of initiative and lack of interest) and brain perfusion. in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain perfusion was measured by single photon emission tomography (SPECT). Thirty-one AD patients were included. Lack of initiative and interest were assessed with the Apathy Inventory. Nineteen AD subjects presented a lack of initiative and interest pathological score whereas 12 AD subjects did not. The lack of initiative and interest score correlated significantly with the right frontal and the right inferior temporal lobes. The AD patients with lack of initiative and interest showed a significantly lower perfusion in the right anterior cingulate than the AD patients without lack of initiative and interest. These results derive from rather small subgroups of patients but have the interest to dismantle the complementary aspects of emotion and motivation in apathy and suggest that the latter one is more related to cingulate area.
