Advantages of temporary venoatrial shunt using centrifugal pump during bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt. Single-ventricle palliation without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass carries advantages that reduce systemic edema and inflammatory responses however, simple clamping of the superior vena cava (SVC) without a temporary shunt leads to increase in cerebral venous pressure and subsequent decrease in cerebral blood flow during bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (BCPS). We report our experience of BCPS, using a centrifugal pump-assisted temporary shunt. The criteria included an unrestrictive interatrial communication, the absence of atrioventricular valve regurgitation, and the existence of an antegrade pulmonary blood flow. From August 2000, 14 children with single-ventricle physiology met the criteria. The mean age was 1.0 +/- 0.9 years, and the mean weight was 8.4 +/- 2.6 kg. A temporary shunt was established between the SVC and the right atrium with right-angle cannulae, which were connected to a centrifugal pump to accelerate the blood flow from the SVC to the right atrium. All patients tolerated the procedure. Mean central venous pressure was 17 +/- 4 mm Hg, and transcutaneous oxygen saturation was maintained at 77 +/- 8% during anastomosis. No patients required blood transfusion. There were no postoperative neurological complications. The centrifugal pump-assisted temporary shunt offered safer and more effective circulatory support than other shunt systems, with excellent venous drainage in pediatric patients undergoing BCPS.
