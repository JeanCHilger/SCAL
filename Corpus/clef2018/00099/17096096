Dopamine transporter imaging and the effects of deep brain stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [123I]FP-CIT is a marker for loss of presynaptic dopamine transporters in the striatum in Parkinson's disease (PD). We used [123I]FP-CIT SPECT in order to evaluate binding to the dopamine transporter before and after neurosurgical treatment with bilateral stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus (STN).Thirty-five patients with levodopa-responsive PD were examined with [123I]FP-CIT SPECT pre-operatively (baseline scan: mean 3 months before surgery), and 3 and 12 months after surgery.Pre-operatively, all patients already had substantial signs of severe nigrostriatal neuronal loss as determined from the [123I]FP-CIT SPECT scans. One year after surgery the specific [123I]FP-CIT binding to the striatum was significantly reduced by 10.3% compared with the pre-operative baseline scan. The mean time span from the baseline scan before surgery to the follow-up scan 1 year after surgery was 16.2 months. Hence, the rate of reduction equals a mean annual reduction of 7.7%. A comparable control group of patients with PD who did not undergo surgery was also examined longitudinally. In this group the specific binding of [123I]FP-CIT was reduced by 6.7% per year.The specific binding of [123I]FP-CIT was reduced equally in the STN-stimulated patients and a group of non-operated PD patients with advanced disease. Our study does not support the notion that electrode implantation and STN stimulation exert a neuroprotective effect by themselves.
