Clinical and hemodynamic results after Fontan operation. Twenty-six patients, ranging in age from 2 to 14 years (mean, 6 years and 8 months), with tricuspid atresia or other complex cyanotic cardiac diseases underwent a modified Fontan operation between 1980 and 1990. In 13 patients, palliative operations had been previously performed. There were 7 mortalities within 1 month after the operation. Seventeen of the 19 survivors were followed up for 5-122 months (mean, 27) with no late deaths. Fifteen patients were in the New York Heart Association functional class 1. Two patients required reoperations at 2 and 57 months postoperatively: the former for atrio-ventricular valvular regurgitation, and the latter for late-developing conduit obstruction and residual atrial right to left shunting. Fourteen patients underwent cardiac catheterization after 1-57 months (mean, 9.8) postoperatively. Two patients had a residual right to left shunt at the atrial level, while the oxygen saturation in the remaining 12 patients was above 90%. Thus, the modified Fontan operation offers an alternate surgical approach for patients with complex congenital heart disease for whom no other palliative procedure can be expected to obtain significant improvement. It can be performed with good clinical and hemodynamic results in selected patients.
