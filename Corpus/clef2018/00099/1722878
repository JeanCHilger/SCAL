Investigation of normal pressure hydrocephalus by 123I-IMP SPECT. We evaluated N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as a method for identifying normal pressure hydrocephalic (NPH) patients eligible for shunting procedures. 123I-IMP SPECT scans were taken before and after cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) taps in NPH cases. Post-subarachnoid hemorrhagic (SAH) patients showed apparent frontal blood flow reduction but non-SAH cases did not. The frontal blood flow increased in comparison with the temporal flow after CSF tapping in SAH cases who benefited most from shunting. Cerebral blood flow study before and after CSF removal is a potential method for classifying NPH patients likely to benefit from the shunting operation.
