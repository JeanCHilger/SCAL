Congenital anomalies of coronary artery origin in adults: 64-MDCT appearance. The purpose of this pictorial essay is to review the 64-MDCT appearance of congenital anomalies of the origins of the coronary arteries in adults.Increasing use of MDCT for cardiac imaging of adults requires familiarity with the cross-sectional appearance of congenital coronary artery anomalies visualized with noninvasive imaging techniques. Many of these anomalies are benign, but a small number are associated with myocardial ischemia and sudden death. Increasing use of MDCT in cardiac imaging may yield diagnostic information not obtained with coronary angiography. Axial, multiplanar, and 3D volume-rendered reconstructions should aid in detection and improve interpretation of such anomalies.
