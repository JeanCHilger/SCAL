The role of vinpocetine in the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases based in human studies. It shows the importance of cerebrovascular diseases that they are the third main cause of death exceeded only by coronary artery diseases and cancer. Cerebral ischemia leads to irreversible brain damage, thereby it is important to rescue the hypoperfused areas. Patients without stroke but with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion can also benefit from the increasing of the cerebral blood flow.The aim of this review was to summarize the indications and the potential effects of vinpocetine in acute and chronic cerebrovascular diseases based on clinical studies.There is no evidence that vinpocetine treatment is applicable in acute ischemic stroke, only few study with low patient number showed a slight but significant improvement in the patients conditions. In chronic cerebrovascular patients after single dose and long-term vinpocetine therapy, PET, TCD, SPECT and NIRS examinations showed increasing perfusion and elevated glucose and O 2 consumption of the examined areas, furthermore significant improvement of the rheologic factors was detected. A meta-analysis of international clinical studies showed a significant improvement in cognitive achievement in chronic stroke patients after oral therapy.The cited studies showed the potential multi-pharmacological effects of vinpocetine and its beneficial hemorheological potential. The drug also improves the blood flow and the metabolism of the affected brain areas. There is increasing evidence that vinpocetine improves the quality of life in chronic cerebrovascular patients.
