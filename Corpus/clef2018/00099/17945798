Direct Fourier method in 3D PET using accurately determined frequency sample distribution. In this paper the frequency sample distribution in the reconstructed 3D object spectrum in 3D PET is investigated and accurately determinable by means of the here presented approach. It emerges from Fourier transform of both non-oblique and oblique 2D parallel projections. Direct Fourier method (DFM) is applied for the reconstruction due to its speed advantage. Simulation studies are accomplished to verify the imposed assertion.
