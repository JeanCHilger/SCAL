18-F FDG-PET in the staging of lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease. This bicentric study assessed retrospectively the usefulness of 18 F-FDG-PET in the staging of 31 patients with lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease (LPHD). FDG-PET and conventional explorations (CE) were performed for initial disease (n=25) or recurrence (n= 6). All the 68 involved sites were detected by PET including 5 extra-nodal lesions. Only 43 nodal sites (68%) and one splenic focus were detected by CE. PET changed staging in 9 patients (7 upstaged, 2 downstaged) and radiation fields in 3 patients. These results showed the potential role of PET in the staging of LPHD.
