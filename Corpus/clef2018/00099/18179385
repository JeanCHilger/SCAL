Escherichia coli colonization patterns among human household members and pets, with attention to acute urinary tract infection. Within-household transmission of Escherichia coli may promote urinary tract infection (UTI) but is poorly understood.Fecal samples from 228 individuals (152 humans [5 with acute UTI] and 76 pets) in 63 households were extensively processed for unique E. coli clones, as defined by random-amplified polymorphic DNA analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Patterns of strain sharing (presence of a clone in multiple individuals) were assessed.Of 335 E. coli clones, 90 (27%) were recovered from multiple hosts (up to 11 per clone). Within-household strain sharing (1) involved 68% of households, including 3 of 5 households in which a member had a UTI (2) was more frequent than across-household strain sharing (27% vs. 0.8% of potential sharing pairsWithin-household sharing of E. coli, including in households in which a member has a UTI, is common and can involve any combination of humans and pets. Identification of the underlying mechanism(s) could lead to novel preventive measures against UTI.
