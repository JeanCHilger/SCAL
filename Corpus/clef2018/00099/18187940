Peritoneal membrane evaluation in routine clinical practice. Establishment of reference values for small solute transport, sodium sieving and effluent CA125 with 3.86% (4 h) peritoneal equilibration test (PET), and comparison with fast-fast PET with regard to small solute transport categories.Cross-sectional study 69 prevalent patients. Sodium sieving corrected for sodium diffusion with a formula applicable to the PET. CA125 appearance rate (AR) was measured. Expected and observed 60 min D/P(creatinine) were compared by Bland and Altman.Means (95% CI): D/P(creatinine) 0.73 (0.70-0.76), MTAC(creatinine) 9.6 (8.4-10.9) ml/min, D/D0 glucose 0.30 (0.28-0.31), corrected dip 0.17 (0.15-0.18), CA125 150 (125-176) U/min. Both corrected and uncorrected sodium sieving were informative. Peritoneal transport was faster at 60 min dwell. UFF patients presented very low corrected dip and CA125 AR.3.86% (4 h) PET provided results similar to those from SPA. Correction for diffusion of sodium sieving is dispensable for simple clinical evaluations. D/P(creatinine) at 60 min overestimated small solute transport rate. Effluent CA125 was consistently lower in UFF patients.
