Right prefrontal hypometabolism predicts delusions in dementia with Lewy bodies. Delusions (DEL) are frequent in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) however, the neural equivalent is poorly understood. The present study therefore aimed to identify the cerebral metabolic pattern of glucose of a DLB group suffering from DEL (DLB+DEL) as compared to a non-delusional group (DLB-DEL) and a control group (NL)
