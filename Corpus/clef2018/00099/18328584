Correlation of intra-tumour heterogeneity on 18F-FDG PET with pathologic features in non-small cell lung cancer: a feasibility study. We evaluated the feasibility to correlate intra-tumour heterogeneity as visualized on 18F-FDG PET with histology for NSCLC. For this purpose we used an ex-vivo model. The procedure was feasible in all operated patients. We have shown that this method is suitable for correlating intra-tumour heterogeneity in tracer uptake with histology.
