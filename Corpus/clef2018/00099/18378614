Effects of left bundle-branch block on cardiac structure, function, perfusion, and perfusion reserve: implications for myocardial contrast echocardiography versus radionuclide perfusion imaging for the detection of coronary artery disease. We aimed to investigate the cardiac effects of left bundle-branch block (LBBB) using myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) to ascertain the value of MCE for detecting coronary artery disease (CAD) and to uncover the mechanism that affects the accuracy of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in these patients.Sixty-three symptomatic LBBB patients (group A), 10 left ventricular ejection fraction-matched control subjects without LBBB and no CAD (group B), and 10 normal control subjects (group C) underwent resting echocardiography. Rest and vasodilator MCE and SPECT were undertaken in LBBB patients. Septal (SW) and posterior wall (PW) thickness, thickening, quantitative myocardial blood flow (MBF), and MBF reserve were measured. SW/PW thickness and percentage thickening ratios were lower (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively) in group A compared with both groups B and C, but resting SW/PW MBF and MBF reserve ratios were similar in all 3 groups. MBF reserve but not MBF was reduced in groups A and B (2.2+/-0.7 versus 2.2+/-0.2 P=0.98) compared with group C (3.1+/-0.5Despite asymmetrical reduction in SW thickness and function, MBF is preserved and MBF reserve is homogeneously reduced in LBBB patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Because of partial volume effects, the accuracy of SPECT for detecting CAD was significantly compromised compared with MCE in this patient cohort.
