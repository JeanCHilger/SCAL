Schistosoma mansoni: SmLIMPETin, a member of a novel family of invertebrate-only regulatory proteins. Eukaryotic LIM domain proteins contain zinc finger forming motifs rich in cysteine and histidine that enable them to interact with other proteins. A cDNA clone isolated from an adult schistosome cDNA library revealed a sequence that coded for a novel class of proteins bearing 6 LIM domains and an N-terminal PET domain, SmLIMPETin. Phylogeny reconstruction of SmLIMPETin and comparison of its sequence to invertebrate homologues and to the vertebrate four-and-a-half LIM domains protein family (FHLs), uncovered a novel LIM domain protein family, the invertebrate LIM and PET domain protein family (LIMPETin). Northern blots, RT-PCR and Western blot showed that SmLIMPETin gene was less expressed in sexually mature adult females compared to sexually immature adult females and sexually mature and immature adult males, and not expressed in schistosomula.
