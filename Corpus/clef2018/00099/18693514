Role of sentinel lymph nodes and lymphatic mapping of colorectal cancer. The accuracy of staging of colorectal cancer is dependable of number of lymph nodes, colected and investegated from the pathologist. Moreover 50% of newfounded cases with colorectal cancer are diagnosed as I or II stage of the desease. Between 15% and 20% of these patients develop regional or distant metastases around 5 years after the examination, despite of the radical surgery. This may be due to pathological "understaging" (decrease of the stage), becouse of missed micrometastases, which size often is smaller than 5 mm. High accurate and specific pathologoanatomical methods for "ultrastaging" are cost-expensive, therefore their selective application to labeled sentinel lymph nodes has a economical benefit and saves a time. Moreover it is decreasing the understaging effect, assosiated with convectional pathologoanatomical investigaton. In the future, the technical progress will develop the intensive competiton between the sentinel lymph node mapping and the improved imaging diagnostic techniques as flurodeoxyglucose (18FDG), positron emision tomography (PET), or the other molecular imaging techniques. Unfortunately, the limited spatial resolution of these techniques, do not allow to be used for tumor staging as sentinel lymph node techniques. Therefore the sentinel lymphnode mapping become the choice of the lymphnode staging technique.
