Ferret cardiology. Cardiac disease in pet ferrets is common and includes dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and acquired valvular disease. Clinical presentation of cardiac disease in ferrets may be similar to dog or cats, although hind limb weakness may be a prominent feature. Radiography, ECG, and ultrasound are all useful tools in the diagnosis of cardiac disease in ferrets. Therapeutics for cardiac disease in ferrets is based on recommendations for dogs and cats. The prognosis for cardiac disease in ferrets varies from fair to guarded, depending on underlying disease.
