Impact of solar radiation in disinfecting drinking water contaminated with Giardia duodenalis and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar at a point-of-use water treatment. To determine the impact of natural sunlight in disinfecting water contaminated with cysts of Giardia duodenalis and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar using plastic containers.Known quantities of Giardia duodenalis and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar cysts in sterile water were exposed to the sun. Containers were made of polyethylene terephthalate, eight painted black on one side, one not painted and another cut open at the top and the last was a high density polypropylene container. Viability testing was performed using vital and fluorescent dyes. The same assays were conducted under cloudy conditions. Thermal control tests were also performed using heat without ultra violet light from the sun. Results show that 99.9% of parasites was inactivated when water temperatures reached 56 degrees C after sunlight exposure.Both solar radiation and heat produced by the sun have a synergistic effect in killing cysts of Giardia duodenalis and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar when temperatures rise above 50 degrees C, with complete death at 56 degrees C, using painted 2-l PET containers.Solar disinfection system using PET containers painted black on one side can be used to disinfect water against Giardia duodenalis and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar using natural sunlight.
