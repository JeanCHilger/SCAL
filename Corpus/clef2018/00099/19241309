Modified central aortopulmonary shunt with end-to-end anastomosis of the shunt to the pulmonary trunk: Early results of a novel shunt procedure for first-stage palliation of infants with pulmonary atresia and hypoplastic pulmonary arteries. The aim was to investigate a novel palliative shunt performed between the ascending aorta and the main pulmonary artery in patients with pulmonary atresia.Thirteen patients with intracardiac defects [tetralogy of Fallot (seven patients) tetralogy of Fallot and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (one patient)Operations were performed through a median sternotomy. The main pulmonary artery was transected from the right ventricular outflow tract and using a 3-3.5 mm diameter graft, a modified central aortopulmonary shunt was created (graft anastomosis was end-to-end to the pulmonary artery and side-to-side to the aorta). Postoperative oxygen saturation increased 5-10% and diastolic blood pressure decreased by 3-6 mmHg. One hospital mortality occurred, due to sepsis, and two late deaths, one due to pneumonia and one sudden death, occurred in the follow-up period. Patients were followed up for 3-16 months after the operations. During the follow-up period four patients received corrective operations, one unifocalization and three total corrections.Modified central aortopulmonary shunt with end-to-end anastomosis of the shunt to the pulmonary trunk is a novel palliative shunt operation. Our early results with this technique indicate rapid palliation and early achievement of bilateral homogenous adequate pulmonary artery size with a low incidence of overflow to pulmonary circulation and minimal arterial distortion.
