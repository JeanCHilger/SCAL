Functional effects of AAV2-GDNF on the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway in parkinsonian rhesus monkeys. We investigated the safety and neuroregenerative potential of an adeno-associated virus (AAV2) containing human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in an MPTP primate model of Parkinson's disease. Dopaminergic function was evaluated by positron emission tomography with 6-[(18)F]fluoro-l-m-tyrosine (FMT) before and after AAV2-GDNF or phosphate-buffered saline infusion bilaterally into the putamen. FMT uptake was significantly increased bilaterally in the putamen of AAV2-GDNF but not phosphate-buffered saline-treated animals 6 months after infusion, indicating increased dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathways. AAV2-GDNF-treated animals also showed clinical improvement without adverse effects. These findings are consistent with our previous report in aged nonhuman primates that showed evidence of enhanced use of striatal dopamine and dopaminergic nigrostriatal innervation. Clinical improvement and evidence of functional recovery in the nigrostriatal pathway, and the absence of adverse effects, support the safety of this approach for the delivery of GDNF over a 6-month period.
