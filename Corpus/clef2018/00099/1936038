Dosimetry of iodine 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine for treatment of resistant neuroblastoma: results of a UK study. In 1987, the United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG) set up a multi-centre study to investigate the toxicity of iodine 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) in the treatment of resistant neuroblastoma. Since December 1987, 25 children suffering from neuroblastoma have been treated with 131I-mIBG at six UK centres. All centres followed standardised physics and clinical protocols to provide consistent toxicity and dosimetry data. These protocols describe the methods employed for both the tracer study using 131I-mIBG and the subsequent therapy. Whole-body dosimetry calculations were performed on data from the tracer study. The activity administered for therapy was the amount predicted to deliver a predefined whole-body dose. Estimates of doses delivered to various organs during treatment are given in Table 1.
