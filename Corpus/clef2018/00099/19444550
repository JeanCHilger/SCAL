Differential diagnosis between (18)F-FDG-avid metastatic lymph nodes in non-small cell lung cancer and benign nodes on dual-time point PET/CT scan. To clarify the difference of (18)F-FDG uptake kinetics between FDG-avid metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and FDG-avid benign LNs associated with various etiologies on dual-time point PET/CT scan, and to determine the optimal parameter for differentiation.The subjects were 134 FDG-avid metastatic LNs in 67 patients with NSCLC and 62 FDG-avid benign LNs in 61 patients with various lung disorders including NSCLC. PET/CT scan was performed at 2 time points (at 60 min and at 120 min) after intravenous injection of 4.4 MBq/kg (18)F-FDG. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on early and delayed scans and the percent change of SUVmax (%DeltaSUVmax) were measured at each FDG-avid LN. The optimal parameter for differentiation was determined by the receiver-operating characteristic analysis.Delayed SUVmax was increased compared with early SUVmax in 114 (85.0%) FDG-avid metastatic LNs and 42 (67.7%) FDG-avid benign LNs, with significant higher delayed SUVmax than early values (7.0 +/- 5.0 vs. 5.9 +/- 3.4 P < 0.0001, and 3.0 +/- 1.3 vs. 2.8 +/- 1.0Although dual-time point PET/CT scan enhances the difference of FDG uptake between FDG-avid metastatic and benign LNs and improves the differentiation when compared with a single scan, biopsy procedure may be still required for accurate assessment of LN status in patients with NSCLC and possible etiologies showing intensive FDG uptake in benign LNs.
