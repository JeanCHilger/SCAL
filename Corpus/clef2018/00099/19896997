Paclitaxel-loaded poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone)-b-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) nanoparticles: preparation and antitumor activity in vivo. Paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone)-b-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PVP-b-PCL) nanoparticles with high drug payload were successfully prepared by a modified nano-precipitation method and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential. The satisfactory drug loading content (>25%) and high encapsulation efficiency (>85%) were achieved. The in vivo real-time biodistribution of PTX-loaded nanoparticles was investigated using near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging. The antitumor effect of PTX-loaded nanoparticles was evaluated, both, in vitro on three different cancer cell lines and in vivo on hepatic H22 tumor bearing mice model via intravenous administration (i.v.). It is found that PTX-loaded nanoparticles exhibit significant superior in vivo antitumor effect than the commercially available Taxol formulation by combining the tumor volumes and survival rates measurement, intravital positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging.
