Cutaneous malignant melanoma diagnostic procedures and their evaluation in diagnosing and mapping sentinel nodes. Cutaneous malignant melanoma represents 4% of all the malignant neoplasms. Nevertheless, 79% of the fatal malignant skin diseases are attributed to melanoma. In melanoma patients, the most important prognostic factor is the regional lymph node invasion. The present article describes the classical diagnostic, staging and therapeutic strategies in melanoma patients. In the realm of cutaneous melanoma, pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy and the intra-operative gamma-probe detection, removal and biopsy of the sentinel lymph node(s), comprise convenient, procedures, virtually lacking morbidity. The definition of sentinel includes the first lymph node or nodes, draining the lymph from the primary lesion, thereby attributed with the highest probability of harbouring migrating metastatic cells. A sentinel lymph node negative for malignancy accurately "predicts" the absence of melanoma cell invasion in all the rest regional and distant lymphatic basins. The method aims in the best discrimination of high-risk patients, as candidates for selective lymphadenectomy, with or without adjunctive treatment. Radionuclide-guided lymphatic mapping and surgery is based on the phagocytosis of colloidal-based radiopharmaceuticals by the macrophages encountered in functional tumour-infiltrated sentinel nodes. The nuclear methods successfully add to the staging and the potential surgical treatment of the disease.
