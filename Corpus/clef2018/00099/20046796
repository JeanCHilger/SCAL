Investigation of Depth of Interaction Encoding for a Pixelated LSO Array with a Single Multi-Channel PMT. A new approach to depth of interaction (DOI) encoding for a pixelated LSO array using a single multi-channel PMT was investigated. In this method the DOI information was estimated by taking advantage of optical crosstalk between LSO elements and examining the standard deviation (spread) of signals on all channels of the PMT. Unpolished and polished 6×6 LSO arrays with a crystal size of 1.3×1.3×20 mm(3) were evaluated on a Hamamatsu H7546 64-channel PMT. The arrays were placed on the center of the PMT and the central 16 channels of the PMT were individually read out and digitized. For the unpolished array, all crystals were resolved in the flood histogram. An average DOI resolution of 8 mm was obtained. The energy resolution was ∼25% after the signal amplitude was corrected using the measured DOI information. For the polished array, the flood histogram was superior to the unpolished array, however no DOI information could be measured. Using unpolished crystals, this method could be a practical way to achieve limited DOI information in PET detectors. The standard deviation of all PMT channels can be readily obtained using a resistor network. Only five signals (four signals to determine the x-y position and one signal measuring the standard deviation) need to be digitized, and this method only requires a single photon detector to read out the array. Unlike phoswich detectors, the method does not require segmenting the scintillator array into layers. The measured DOI resolution was much worse than that obtained with the dual-ended readout method, however, it was similar to that obtained with a two-layer phoswich detector.
