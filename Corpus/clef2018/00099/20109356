Evaluation methods for the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. With the widespread clinical application of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, it has become an essential part of combination therapy for patients with breast cancer. However, a rapid, accurate, and effective approach for assessing the therapeutic efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is unavailable. Routine physical examinations cannot provide effective clinical evaluation. Although imaging techniques play an important role in evaluating the therapeutic effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, this is limited because it only detects morphologic changes. Blood oxygen detection for breast diseases is an emerging diagnostic technique that has distinctive merit in assessing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Biologic markers are becoming more important in assessing the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer. This review summarizes the principles and the current applied practice of these approaches to evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer.
