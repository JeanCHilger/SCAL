Fontan completion in patients with atrial isomerism and separate hepatic venous drainage. Fontan completion in patients with atrial isomerism, in which the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the hepatic vein (HV) drain separately, is technically challenging. Herein, we review our surgical approach to these patients.The medical records of 50 consecutive patients with atrial isomerism who underwent Fontan completion between 1998 and 2008 were reviewed retrospectively.Separate HV drainage was present in 17 patients. Patients with interrupted IVC were excluded. Patient characteristics were as follows: median age, 26 months (range 15-149) median weight, 9.6 kg (range 8.1-47.2)The mid-term results of the Fontan completion in patients with atrial isomerism and separate HV drainage were excellent. The distance between the IVC and the separate HV and the position of the vertebrae should be considered when choosing a surgical technique.
