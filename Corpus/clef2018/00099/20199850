Comparison of standardized uptake value-based positron emission tomography and computed tomography target volumes in esophageal cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. To study various standardized uptake value (SUV)-based approaches to ascertain the best strategy for delineating metabolic tumor volumes (MTV).Twenty-two consecutive previously treated esophageal cancer patients with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and computed tomography (CT)-based radiotherapy plans were studied. At the level of the tumor epicenter, MTVs were delineated at 11 different thresholds: SUV ≥2, ≥2.5, ≥3, ≥3.5 (SUV(n)) ≥40%, ≥45%, and ≥50% of the maximum (SUV(n%))The mean conformality indices ranged from 0.33 to 0.48, being significantly (p < 0.05) closest to 1 at SUV(2.5) (0.47 ± 0.03) and SUV(L4σ) (0.48 ± 0.03). The mean volume ratios ranged from 0.39 to 2.82, being significantly closest to 1 at SUV(2.5) (1.18 ± 0.36) and SUV(L4σ) (1.09 ± 0.15). The mean value of the SUVs calculated using the SUV(L4σ) approach was 2.4.Regardless of the SUV thresholding method used (i.e., absolute or relative to liver mean), a threshold of approximately 2.5 yields the highest conformality index and best approximates the CT-based GTV at the epicenter. These findings may ultimately aid radiation oncologists in the delineation of the entire GTV in esophageal cancer patients.
