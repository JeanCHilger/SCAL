The value of 11C-5-hydroxy-tryptophan positron emission tomography in neuroendocrine tumor diagnosis and management: experience from one center. Many neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are small and may escape localization by conventional imaging techniques. In such cases, 11C-5-hydroxy-tryptophan (11C-5-HTP) positron emission tomography (PET) has been tested as an additional diagnostic tool. Nine patients with clinically, biochemically and/or histologically confirmed NET and negative computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 111In-pentetreotide (Octreoscan) scintigraphy underwent imaging with 11C-5-HTP-PET/CT in order to: 1) detect the primary tumor lesion in three patients 2) detect residual disease in two patients with appendiceal carcinoid, one with rectal carcinoid, one with midgut carcinoid, and one with ectopic ACTH secretion (EAS) due to residual pulmonary carcinoid
