Preparation and characterization of nonfouling polymer brushes on poly(ethylene terephthalate) film surfaces. In this study, a surface grafting of nonfouling poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMA) on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) was carried out via surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) to improve hemocompatibility of polymer based biomaterials. To do this, the coupling agent with hydroxyl groups for the ATRP initiator was first anchored on the surface of PET films using photochemical method, and then these hydroxyl groups were esterified by bromoisobutyryl bromide, from which PET with various main chain lengths of PEGMA was prepared. The structures and properties of modified PET surfaces were investigated using water contact angle (WAC), ATR-FTIR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Atomic force microscopy (AFM). The molecular weights of the free polymer from solution were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). These results indicated that grafting of PEGMA on PET film is a simple way to change its surface properties. The protein adsorption resistance on the surfaces of PET was primarily evaluated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The result demonstrated that the protein adsorption could be well suppressed by poly(PEGMA) brush structure on the surface of PET. This work provides a new approach for polymers to enhance their biocompatibility.
