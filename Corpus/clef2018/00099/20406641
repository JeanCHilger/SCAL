Regional brain activity in functional dyspepsia: a H(2)(15)O-PET study on the role of gastric sensitivity and abuse history. Differences in brain activity between health and functional dyspepsia (FD) have been reported it is unclear whether this is influenced by gastric hypersensitivity or abuse history. Therefore, we aimed to determine the influence of gastric sensitivity and abuse history on gastric sensation scores and brain activity in homeostatic-afferent, emotional-arousal, and cortical-modulatory brain regions in FD.Abuse history was assessed using a validated self-report questionnaire. H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography was performed in 25 FD patients (13 hypersensitive and 8 abused) during 3 conditions, that is, no distension, gastric distension at discomfort threshold, and sham distension. Data were analyzed in SPM2. Region of interest analysis was used to confirm differences in prehypothesized regions.No association between hypersensitivity and abuse history was found. Gastric hypersensitivity was associated with significantly higher gastric sensation scores during baseline and sham. A condition-independent difference in ventral posterior cingulate activity was found between groups, as well as distension and sham-specific differences in brainstem and cingulate areas. Abuse history was associated with higher gastric sensation scores in all conditions and with differences in insular, prefrontal, and hippocampus/amygdala activity.Gastric sensitivity and abuse history independently influence gastric sensation as well as brain activity in FD.
