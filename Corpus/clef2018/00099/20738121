Organic photovoltaic devices using highly flexible reduced graphene oxide films as transparent electrodes. The chemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was transferred onto polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates and then used as transparent and conductive electrodes for flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. The performance of the OPV devices mainly depends on the charge transport efficiency through rGO electrodes when the optical transmittance of rGO is above 65%. However, if the transmittance of rGO is less than 65%, the performance of the OPV device is dominated by the light transmission efficiency, that is, the transparency of rGO films. After the tensile strain (âˆ¼2.9%) was applied on the fabricated OPV device, it can sustain a thousand cycles of bending. Our work demonstrates the highly flexible property of rGO films, which provide the potential applications in flexible optoelectronics.
