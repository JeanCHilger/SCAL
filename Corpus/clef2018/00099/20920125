Iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphic assessment of pulmonary vascular status in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Lung uptake of iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (¹²³I-MIBG) is used as an indicator of pulmonary endothelial function. Decreased lung uptake of ¹²³I-MIBG has been demonstrated in patients with COPD as compared with normal subjects. The present study was performed to examine the relationship between lung uptake of ¹²³I-MIBG and pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) at rest and during exercise, in patients with COPD.¹²³I-MIBG scintigraphy was performed in 19 patients with COPD. Anterior planar images were acquired 15 min after the injection of ¹²³I-MIBG, and the total lung to upper mediastinum ratio (LMR) was calculated for both lungs. Right heart catheters were used to monitor Ppa continuously at rest and during exercise. Exercise was performed on an electrically braked bicycle ergometer at a constant workload of 25 W for 3 min.In COPD patients the LMR were not correlated with the pulmonary function parameters measured before exercise, including FEV₁, PaO₂, DL(CO), or Ppa at rest. However, the percentage increase in Ppa during exercise was significantly correlated with LMR.Evaluation of the kinetics of lung uptake of ¹²³I-MIBG may be a novel scintigraphic tool for the assessment of exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension in patients with COPD.
