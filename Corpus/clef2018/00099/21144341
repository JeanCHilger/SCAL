Positive patch-test reactions to iodopropynyl butylcarbamate: retrospective analysis of North American contact dermatitis group data, from 1998 to 2008. iodopropynyl butylcarbamate (IPBC), a commonly used preservative, is found in industrial and personal care products.to evaluate prevalence, clinical relevance, occupational relationship, and sources of positive reactions to IPBC in patients in North America.the North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG) tested IPBC 0.1% and/or 0.5% in petrolatum (pet) between 1998 and 2008. Two patient groups of interest were defined, based on patch-test reactions to IPBC: weak (+) reactors and strong (++ or +++) reactors. Patient characteristics, site(s) of dermatitis, sources of positive reactions, clinical relevance, and occupational relevance to IPBC were tabulated.of the 25,321 patients tested, there were 226 (0.9%) weak reactors and 67 (0.3%) strong reactors. For IPBC-positive patients, the most frequent sites of dermatitis were scattered generalized distribution, hands, and arms. The majority (> 50%) of currently relevant reactions were to personal care products, and most reactions (> 90%) were not related to occupation. Only four of the strong reactors had definite clinical relevance (positive use-test reaction or positive patch-test reaction to a product containing IPBC). The frequency of positive reactions increased (0.2% vs 1.5%) when the higher concentration of IPBC was utilized, but most (> 64%) were weak reactions, of which some were likely irritant.allergy to IPBC is relatively uncommon. When clinically relevant, personal care products were the most likely allergen source. Because IPBC is a marginal irritant, caution should be utilized when testing with higher concentrations of IPBC (â‰¥ 0.5% pet) and when interpreting weak (+) reactions. Verification of clinical relevance by use test or repeat patch testing or both is also important.
