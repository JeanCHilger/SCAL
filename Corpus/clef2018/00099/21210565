 The B cell differentiation antigen CD20 is a transmembrane, non-glycosylated, hydrophobic protein that is characteristically expressed in >90% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma tumors. Although the exact function(s) of CD20 in the cell are not known, CD20 is believed to play a role in B cell growth, activation, and maintenance of cellular calcium homeostasis (1). In addition, depletion of B cells with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in human CD20/non-obese diabetic mice has been shown to prevent and reverse diabetes in the animals (2). Also, once an antibody (Ab) binds to an extracellular domain of the CD20, the Ab-antigen complex is not internalized and expression of the antigen on the cell surface is not downregulated (3). Because of its specific presence on non-Hodgkin lymphoma tumor cells, the antigen is a therapeutic target of different anti-CD20 Abs, such as rituximab for monotherapy or combination therapy with a chemotherapeutic agent, or tositumomab (
