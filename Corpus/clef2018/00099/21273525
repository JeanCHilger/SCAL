Pulmonary radiofrequency ablation in patients with a single lung: feasibility, efficacy, and tolerance. To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and tolerance of pulmonary radiofrequency (RF) ablation for the treatment of lung tumors in patients with a single lung.This was a retrospective study from four institutions, with waiver of institutional review board approval and of informed consent. From July 2003 to March 2009, 15 single-lung patients (nine men and six women mean age, 64 yearsNo procedural deaths occurred. Procedural complications observed at CT during RF ablation were mild parenchymal hemorrhages (n = 5 31%). All pneumothoraces (n = 6RF ablation appears to be a reasonable and safe option in patients with a single lung.
