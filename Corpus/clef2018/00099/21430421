Stent implantation into a totally occluded Blalock-Taussig shunt: a case report. Stent implantation into a ductus arteriosus or systemic-pulmonary shunt is a relatively new but infrequent approach for palliation. A 22-month-old boy with a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt for tetralogy of Fallot was admitted with severe cyanosis. Echocardiographic examination showed complete occlusion of the shunt. Initial balloon angioplasty resulted in reocclusion of the shunt by acute thrombosis. Finally, recanalization was achieved by stent implantation. Oxygen saturation of the patient increased from 32% to 92% following stenting. He was discharged on aspirin therapy.
