Detection of recurrent prostate carcinoma with anti-1-amino-3-18F-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid PET/CT and 111In-capromab pendetide SPECT/CT. To compare the diagnostic performance of the synthetic amino acid analog radiotracer anti-1-amino-3-fluorine 18-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (anti-3-(18)F-FACBC) with that of indium 111 ((111)In)-capromab pendetide in the detection of recurrent prostate carcinoma.This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board and complied with HIPAA guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained. Fifty patients (mean age, 68.3 years ± 8.1 [standard deviation] age range, 50-90 years) were included in the study on the basis of the following criteria: (a) Recurrence of prostate carcinoma was suspected after definitive therapy for localized disease, (b) bone scans were negative, and (c) anti-3-(18)F-FACBC positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and (111)In-capromab pendetide single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT were performed within 6 weeks of each other. Studies were evaluated by two experienced interpreters for abnormal uptake suspicious for recurrent disease in the prostate bed and extraprostatic locations. The reference standard was a combination of tissue correlation, imaging, laboratory, and clinical data. Diagnostic performance measures were calculated and tests of the statistical significance of differences determined by using the McNemar χ(2) test as well as approximate tests based on the difference between two proportions.For disease detection in the prostate bed, anti-3-(18)F-FACBC had a sensitivity of 89% (32 of 36 patients 95% confidence interval [CI]: 74%, 97%), specificity of 67% (eight of 12 patientsanti-3-(18)F-FACBC PET/CT was more sensitive than (111)In-capromab pendetide SPECT/CT in the detection of recurrent prostate carcinoma and is highly accurate in the differentiation of prostatic from extraprostatic disease.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11102023/-/DC1.
