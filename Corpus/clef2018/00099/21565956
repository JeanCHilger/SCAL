Could different hydration protocols affect the quality of 18F-FDG PET/CT images? In a group of oncologic patients undergoing (18)F-FDG PET/CT, we compared 4 different protocols of hydration to investigate their impact on image quality and to choose the best practice.One hundred twenty subjects undergoing (18)F-FDG PET/CT were randomized into 4 groups: group A, receiving free oral hydration group B, receiving an intravenous injection of 10 mg of furosemide and infusion of 500 mL of saline solution starting 5 min after tracer injectionThese 4 groups were comparable in age, body mass index, blood glucose level, and serum creatinine level. Group A showed the worst results. The controlled hydration protocols (groups B, C, and D) provided lower background activity in the soft tissues and lower urinary activity in the bladder and kidney without significant differences in blood activity. The administration of furosemide produces lower activity in the urinary tract without significant changes in (18)F-FDG distribution in the muscle, fat, or blood pool. The best results were in group D.Controlled hydration, particularly with standardized parenteral protocols, reduces the background activity in the soft tissues with the potential benefit of increasing the tumor-to-background contrast. Furosemide does not change tracer distribution in normal tissues but improves the quality of PET/CT images, reducing activity in the excretory system, particularly if the furosemide is administered late after (18)F-FDG injection.
