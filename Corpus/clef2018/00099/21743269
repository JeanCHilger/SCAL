Atrial septal stenting to increase interatrial shunting in cyanotic congenital heart diseases: a report of two cases. Aiming to increase mixing at the atrial level, atrial septal stenting was performed in two pediatric cases with cyanotic congenital cardiac diseases. The first case was a 3-month-old male infant with transposition of the great arteries. The second case was an 18-month-old male infant with increased central venous pressure due to postoperative right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Premounted bare stents of 8 mm in diameter were used in both cases. The length of the stent was 20 mm in the first case and 30 mm in the latter. The procedure was accomplished without any complications. In the first case, oxygen saturation increased approximately 20-25% with no significant interatrial gradient. In the latter, central venous pressure decreased from 16 to 8 mmHg immediately after the procedure. The patient was weaned from the ventilator on the second day and discharged from intensive care unit on the fifth day. Follow-up echocardiograms of both patients showed patent stents with good position relative to the atrial septum. Stenting of the atrial septum seems to be a safe and effective method to create a reliable, nonrestrictive interatrial communication.
