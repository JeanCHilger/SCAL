Cloning, expression and purification of allergen parvalbumin from Aristichthys nobilis and its allergic activity. To clone, express and identify the parvalbumin gene from Aristichthys nobilis, and investigate its allergenicity.The parvalbumin gene was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into PMD18-T for sequencing and analysis. Then the target gene was subcloned into pET-28a (+) for expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3) by IPTG induction. The recombinant protein was purified by metal (Ni2+) chelating affinity chromatography. Its allergenicity was examined by Western-blotting assay.The length of gene (Accession No. FJ013047) was 330 bp, coding 109 amino acids. The E. coli strain could express a recombinant protein with a molecular weight of 11 537 Da. The recombinant allergen was identified as its affinity to specific IgE antibodies from the allergic patient sera by Western-blotting.The parvalbumin gene from Aristichthys nobilis is successfully cloned and expressed in this study, and the recombinant protein possesses good IgE-binding capacity.
