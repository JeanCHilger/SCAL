Practical issues regarding the incorporation of PET into a busy SPECT practice. Incorporating positron emission tomography (PET) imaging or PET/computed tomographic (PET/CT) imaging into a clinical cardiology practice provides opportunities to better assess patients as well as to expand the services offered by the practice. Clinical evidence continues to accrue, demonstrating the superior quality, the breadth of assessments possible, the diagnostic certainty and accuracy, and the lower patient radiation exposure of PET versus single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). PET imaging is more accessible to non-hospital imaging centers than ever before because of the availability of radiopharmaceuticals that can be generated on-site or delivered in unit doses from regional cyclotrons, and camera systems of lower cost than previously available. In this manuscript, we offer guidance on the many factors a practice must address before replacing an aging SPECT camera or adding new PET or PET/CT imaging capabilities. Key among these are defining the PET and CT procedures the practice members wish to perform, learning the equipment and radiotracers required to perform those procedures, determining whether their facility has sufficient physical space and shielding to accommodate the dedicated PET or PET/CT instrumentation, and addressing issues related to the practice's referral base, competition, cost-of-entry, reimbursement, and return on investment.
