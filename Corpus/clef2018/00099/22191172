Hair coat contamination with zoonotic helminth eggs of farm and pet dogs and foxes. Infections of dogs with Toxocara canis and Echinococcus multilocularis pose an infection-risk particularly for contact persons. We examined specimens of hair coat and faeces of 124 farm dogs, 118 household dogs, 49 kennel dogs, 15 puppies from two litters, and 46 red foxes. Microscopically identified eggs of Toxocara or taeniids were further investigated by species-specific PCRs. In farm dogs, eggs of E. multilocularis or T. canis were identified in each 2.4% of faecal samples, eggs of T. cati (gastrointestinal passage) in 7.3%, respectively. Household dogs excreted eggs of T. canis (0.8%) and of T. cati (2.5%). In kennel dogs, eggs of T. canis (4.1%), but not of T. cati were detectable. Coat samples contaminated with eggs of Toxocara spp. were found from farm dogs (5.6%), household dogs (1.7%) and kennel dogs (2.0%). Taeniid eggs were isolated from the coat samples from only two farm dogs (1.6%) a molecular species determination was not achieved. In six intrauterinely infected puppies, Toxocara-eggs were found in 17/38 samples taken within six weeks. No intact Toxocara eggs could be isolated from the coat of nine puppies from a second litter 13 days after deworming. Of the 46 red foxes investigated (dissection and faecal samples) 13 (28.3%) were infected with E. multilocularis and 20 (43.5%) with Toxocara. Eggs of taeniids and Toxocara were found in 13% (in three cases confirmed as E. multilocularis) and 21.7%, respectively, of the coat samples. None of the retrieved Toxocara eggs in the coat samples were embryonated. Thus, an infection of humans through the transmission of E. multilocularis eggs after direct contact with dogs or foxes is conceivable, whereas a corresponding infection risk by Toxocara eggs must be critically challenged.
