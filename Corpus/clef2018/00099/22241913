Radiation dosimetry and biodistribution of the TSPO ligand 11C-DPA-713 in humans. Whole-body PET/CT was used to characterize the radiation dosimetry of (11)C-DPA-713, a specific PET ligand for the assessment of translocator protein.Six healthy control subjects, 3 men and 3 women, underwent whole-body dynamic PET scans after bolus injection of (11)C-DPA-713. Subjects were scanned from head to mid thigh with 7 passes performed, with a total PET acquisition of approximately 100 min. Time-activity curves were generated in organs with visible tracer uptake, and tissue residence times were calculated. Whole-body dosimetry was calculated using OLINDA 1.1 software, assuming no voiding.The absorbed dose is highest in the lungs, spleen, kidney, and pancreas. The lungs were determined to be the dose-limiting organ, with an average absorbed dose of 2.01 × 10(-2) mSv/MBq (7.43 × 10(-2) rem/mCi). On the basis of exposure limits outlined in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR361.1), the single-dose limit for (11)C-DPA-713 radiotracer injection is 2,487.6 MBq (67.3 mCi).(11)C-DPA-713 has an uptake pattern that is consistent with the biodistribution of translocator protein and yields a dose burden that is comparable to that of other (11)C-labeled PET tracers.
