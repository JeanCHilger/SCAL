Value of positron emission tomography in urological neoplasms: more form than substance?. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is widely used for imaging urological neoplasms. This overview should help the urologist actively involved in oncology to assess the value of PET or PET/CT in each tumor entity. Besides prostate, testicular, renal, and bladder cancer less common urological malignancies like penile carcinoma and retroperitoneal masses are discussed. Differences in using PET/CT for primary diagnosis, staging, or restaging are outlined separately. Appropriate indications for the use in clinical practice are cited.
