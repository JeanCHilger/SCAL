Strategy for soluble expression of phage-displayed scFv antibody specific for zebrafish vitellogenin. We developed a new method for soluble expression of phage-displayed scFv antibody specific for zebrafish vitellogenin. The scFv antibody F5 could bind zebrafish vitellogenin specifically in phage-displayed form but not soluble form. The gene of scFv antibody F5 was cloned into vector pET 32a and transferred into Escherichia coli ori DE3. With inducible expression, soluble scFv antibody 32a-F5 was obtained successfully and could also specifically bind to zebrafish vitellogenin. The insoluble expression of phage-displayed scFv antibody was a common problem in the practical use of phage display. This study offered a feasible way to express soluble scFv antibodies with biological activity.
