Computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging with 320-row detector computed tomography accurately detects myocardial ischemia in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTA) has been shown to be accurate in detecting anatomic coronary arterial obstruction, but is limited for the detection of myocardial ischemia. The primary aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of 320-row computed tomography perfusion imaging (CTP) to detect atherosclerosis causing myocardial ischemia.Fifty symptomatic patients with recent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) underwent a comprehensive cardiac computed tomography (CT) protocol that included 320-CTA, followed by adenosine stress CTP. CTP images were analyzed quantitatively for the presence of subendocardial perfusion deficits. All analyses were blinded to imaging and clinical results. CTA alone was a limited predictor of myocardial ischemia compared with SPECT, with a sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 56%, 75%, 56%, and 75%, and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.51-0.78, P=0.07). CTP was a better predictor of myocardial ischemia, with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 72%, 91%, 81%, and 85%, with an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.68-0.91, P<0.001), and was an excellent predictor of myocardial ischemia on SPECT-MPI in the presence of stenosis (≥50% on CTA), with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 100%, 81%, 50%, and 100%, with an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.80-0.97, P<0.001). The radiation dose for the comprehensive cardiac CT protocol and SPECT were 13.8±2.9 and 13.1±1.7 respectively (P=0.15).Computed tomography perfusion imaging with rest and adenosine stress 320-row CT is accurate in detecting obstructive atherosclerosis causing myocardial ischemia.
