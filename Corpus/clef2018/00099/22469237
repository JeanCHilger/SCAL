Novel positron emission tomography/computed tomography of diffuse parenchymal lung disease combining a labeled somatostatin receptor analogue and 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose. We prospectively investigated the potential of positron emission tomography (PET) using the somatostatin receptor (SSTR) analogue ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE and 2-deoxy-2[¹⁸F]fluoro-D-glucose (¹⁸F-FDG) in diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD). Twenty-six patients (mean age 68.9 ± 11.0 years) with DPLD were recruited for ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE and ¹⁸F-FDG combined PET/high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) studies. Ten patients had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 12 patients had nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), and 4 patients had other forms of DPLD. Using PET, the pulmonary tracer uptake (maximum standardized uptake value [SUV(max)]) was calculated. The distribution of PET tracer was compared to the distribution of lung parenchymal changes on HRCT. All patients demonstrated increased pulmonary PET signal with ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE and ¹⁸F-FDG. The distribution of parenchymal uptake was similar, with both tracers corresponding to the distribution of HRCT changes. The mean SUV(max) was 2.2 ± 0.7 for ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE and 2.8 ± 1.0 (t-test, p  =  .018) for ¹⁸F-FDG. The mean ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE SUV(max) in IPF patients was 2.5 ± 0.9, whereas it was 2.0 ± 0.7 (p  =  .235) in NSIP patients. The correlation between ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE SUV(max) and gas transfer (transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide [TLCO]) was r  =  -.34 (p  =  .127) and r  =  -.49 (p  =  .028) between ¹⁸F-FDG SUV(max) and TLCO. We provide noninvasive in vivo evidence in humans showing that SSTRs may be detected in the lungs of patients with DPLD in a similar distribution to sites of increased uptake of ¹⁸F-FDG on PET.
