Change in regional (somatic) near-infrared spectroscopy is not a useful indicator of clinically detectable low cardiac output in children after surgery for congenital heart defects. Near-infrared spectroscopy correlation with low cardiac output has not been validated. Our objective was to determine role of splanchnic and/or renal oxygenation monitoring using near-infrared spectroscopy for detection of low cardiac output in children after surgery for congenital heart defects.Prospective observational study.Pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care teaching hospital.Children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit after surgery for congenital heart defects.None.We hypothesized that splanchnic and/or renal hypoxemia detected by near-infrared spectroscopy is a marker of low cardiac output after pediatric cardiac surgery. Patients admitted after cardiac surgery to the pediatric intensive care unit over a 10-month period underwent serial splanchnic and renal near-infrared spectroscopy measurements until extubation. Baseline near-infrared spectroscopy values were recorded in the first postoperative hour. A near-infrared spectroscopy event was a priori defined as ≥20% drop in splanchnic and/or renal oxygen saturation from baseline during any hour of the study. Low cardiac output was defined as metabolic acidosis (pH <7.25, lactate >2 mmol/L, or base excess ≤-5), oliguria (urine output <1 mL/kg/hr), or escalation of inotropic support. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed using near-infrared spectroscopy event as a diagnostic test for low cardiac output. Twenty children were enrolled: median age was 5 months median Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery category was 3 (1-6)Splanchnic and/or renal hypoxemia as detected by near-infrared spectroscopy may not be an accurate indicator of low cardiac output after surgery for congenital heart defects.
