Radioarsenic from a portable (72)Se/(72)As generator: a current perspective. Positron emission tomography (PET) of slower biological processes calls for the use of longer lived positron emitting radioisotopes. Beyond radionuclide production considerations, practicality and rapidity of subsequent labeling chemistry further limits the selection of radioisotopes with potentially favorable nuclear properties. One additional limitation is the availability of PET radiotracers at the point-of-care with appropriate on-site production methodologies or robust radionuclide generator systems. The positron emitter (72)As (half-life 26 h) is generated via decay of (72)Se (half-life 8.5 d) this pair comprises and excellent generator system for clinical availability of a longer lived PET isotope. Many (72)Se/As generator systems have been introduced utilizing the rich interplay of Se(IV)/Se(VI) and As(III) /As(V) chemical behavior. This paper describes available generator concepts, and briefly outlines some current arsenic labeling methodologies for the introduction of radioarsenic into biomolecules.
