Synthesis, radiolabeling and initial in vivo evaluation of [(11)C]KSM-01 for imaging PPAR-α receptors. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor transcription factor that regulates the fatty acid β-oxidation. An in vitro assay identified the p-methoxy phenyl ureido thiobutyric acid derivative KSM-01 (IC(50)=0.28±0.09nM) having a higher affinity to activate PPAR-α than the PPAR-α agonist GW7647 (IC(50)=0.46±0.19nM). In this study, we report the synthesis and initial in vivo evaluation of [(11)C]KSM-01. The radiosynthesis was carried out by first alkylating the corresponding p-phenol precursor with [(11)C]MeI in DMF using NaOH, followed by deprotection of the t-butyl ester group by TFA, yielding [(11)C]KSM-01. SUV analysis of dynamic micro PET/CT imaging data showed that [(11)C]KSM-01 accumulation was ∼2.0-fold greater in cardiac-specific PPAR-α overexpressing transgenic mice compared to wild-type littermates. The post-PET biodistribution studies were consistent with these results and demonstrated 2.5-fold greater radiotracer uptake in the heart of transgenic mice compared to the wild-type littermates. These results demonstrate the potential utility of PPAR-α agonists as PET radiopharmaceuticals.
