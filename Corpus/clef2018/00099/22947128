Advantages of positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. To explore the value of positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), we retrospectively summarize the results of PET-CT scan from 118 patients, with ESCC who underwent PET-CT scan in the different courses during treatment. Then, the results of PET-CT scan plus other conventional methods were analyzed to identify the value of PET-CT scan in diagnosis, staging, response evaluation, monitoring recurrence, and metastasis following treatment. It is suggested that PET-CT scan possess high value in diagnosis and gives more favorable indication in N and M staging. PET-CT scan should be translated into routine surveillance for postoperation follow up and is one of more helpful evaluators of response to chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy.
