Characterization and cytocompatibility of carbon films. Carbon layers on polyethyleneterephtalate (PET) backing were prepared by 3 different deposition methods as evaporation, sputtering and photo induced chemical vapor deposition. UV-Vis, Raman spectroscopy, Rutherford backscattering techniques, goniometry and electrical resistance measurement were used for the characterization of the layers. Surface morphology of the layers was determined by AFM technique and the thickness was determined by SEM and profilometry. Adhesion and proliferation of 3T3 cells by method in vitro were studied. It was found that the properties of the deposited carbon layer depend on the deposition method. The layers prepared by sputtering are composed from oxidized amorphous carbon in the form of disordered graphite. Contact angle of deposited carbon layers decreases in comparison to pristine PET. The electrical resistance of carbon layer also decreases, a dramatic decrease being observed especially after carbon flash evaporation. The carbon deposition has no significant influence on surface roughness, but the surface morphology is strongly influenced. Adhesion of 3T3 fibroblast didn't show any significant difference between PET, sputtered and CVD layers. Proliferation of 3T3 fibroblast has shows differences due to the surface morphology and also wettability of the surface which is linked to the chemical composition.
