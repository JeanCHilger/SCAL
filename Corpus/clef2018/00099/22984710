Pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart disease: a review. Evidence demonstrates that screening newborns for critical CHD via SpO2 is practicable, efficacious, and has excellent sensitivity and specificity. SpO2 does not detect all forms of CHD, but does detect those presenting with hypoxemia. Although SpO2 screening has been recommended at the federal government level, states are ultimately responsible for the initiation and management of neonatal SpO2 screening programs. Issues of logistics, training and education, quality control, and reimbursement remain incompletely addressed but are anticipated to be resolved in the near future.
