Estimation of geometrical parameters and collimator evaluation for cone beam tomography. A method is presented for estimating the geometrical parameters for a cone beam detector geometry from the coordinates of the centroid of a projected point source sampled over 360 degrees. Nonlinear expressions are derived for the coordinates of the centroids in terms of the geometrical parameters which include: the two-dimensional coordinates of the projection of the center of rotation onto the detector image plane the focal length
