Anomalous left anterior descending artery from pulmonary artery: an extremely rare coronary anomaly. We report a rare coronary artery anomaly-anomalous origin of the left anterior descending artery from the pulmonary artery in a 40-year-old woman. The uniqueness of this case is the absence of any significant morbidity from this condition in adulthood which is in contrast to other reported cases where patients present with myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and sometimes death during the early infantile period.(1).
