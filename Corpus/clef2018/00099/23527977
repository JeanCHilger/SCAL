Non-invasive ventilation in the treatment of infants with respiratory failure after cardiopulmonary bypass. To evaluate the effects of non-invasive ventilation in the treatment of infants with respiratory failure after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and extubation.Sixty-three infants who had undergone successful surgery with CPB, got respiratory failure after extubation. These infants were randomly divided into two groups: non-invasive (NV) group, treated with non-invasive ventilation and invasive (IV) group, treated with tracheal intubation. The alteration of clinical symptoms, heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), pulse oxygen saturation (SpO₂) and blood gas were measured. A comparison was conducted in the incidence of complication and hospital infection, mechanical ventilation time, length of stay in ICU and hospital stay.Among the 32 patients in NV group, 1 patient died of heart failure, the remaining 31 patients recovered. Of these 32, 26 patients had relief of respiratory failure, the HR 181 (19.7) bpm, RR 54 (16.7) bpm and PaCO₂ 55.5(6) mm Hg decreased to 157 (12) bpm, 35 (3.25) bpm, and 42 (10.5) mm Hg, meanwhile SpO₂ 87% (10.5%), pH 7.29 (0.24), PaO₂ 55.5(6) mm Hg increased to 96% (3%), 7.37(0.15), 82.5 (11) mm Hg after treatment with non-invasive ventilation (P < 0.01). Six patients underwent tracheal intubation because their condition was not improved. Tracheal hemorrhage or laryngeal edema did not occur in these patients. Among the 31 patients in IV group, 1 patient died of heart failure, the other patients were cured. Of these 30, one patient had tracheal hemorrhage and four patients had laryngeal edema. The incidence of hospital infection in NV group was lower compared with that in IV group. The mechanical ventilation time in NV group 42 (17.2) h was shorter compared with that in IV group 50 (20) h (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the length of ICU and hospital stay between the two groups.Non-invasive ventilation is a safe and effective method to treat infants with respiratory failure after CPB and extubation.
