Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor as an additive treatment after successful balloon dilation of a critical pulmonary valve stenosis. A 2 days old, 2.7 kg heavy baby boy with critical pulmonary stenosis, underwent successful balloon dilation. After the uneventful procedure, he remained oxygen dependent. The baby was given oral angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor), instead of an infusion of alpha blocker. Within few hours, in the afternoon of the same day after administration of ACE Inhibitor, the baby could be weaned off oxygen, maintaining on room air, oxygen saturation between 87% and 92%. At follow-up, two months later, his saturation was 99% on room air. We believe that some neonates with critical pulmonary valve stenosis who remain oxygen dependent despite successful balloon dilation, could benefit from such management.
