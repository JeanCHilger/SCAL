Total intravenous general anesthesia during radical correction of tetralogy of Fallot. Three techniques of general intravenous anesthesia were compared, using mathematical parameters of the heart rhythm, hemodynamic and sympathoadrenal system responses, arterial blood Hb saturation with O2 (SaO2) and thermometry. It has been established that anesthesia with dipidolor ensures adequate protection against the operation stress both in patients with tetralogy of Fallot previously subject to interarterial anastomoses and patients with tetralogy of Fallot without anastomoses. Combined fentanyl and ketamine anesthesia ensures an adequate protection against the operation stress only in patients with tetralogy of Fallot without anastomoses. A more marked response of sympathetic autonomous nervous system and hemodynamics in patients with tetralogy of Fallot previously subject to anastomoses is, probably, mediated by a more intensive analgesic sequestration in the lungs in the presence of functioning anastomoses, which attenuates the analgetic effect. Anesthesia in patients with tetralogy of Fallot previously subject to interaortic anastomoses should be performed using higher doses of narcotic analgesics.
