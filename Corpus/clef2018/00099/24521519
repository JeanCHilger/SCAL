Near-infrared spectroscopy after high-risk congenital heart surgery in the paediatric intensive care unit. To establish whether the use of near-infrared spectroscopy is potentially beneficial in high-risk cardiac infants in United Kingdom paediatric intensive care units.A prospective observational pilot study.An intensive care unit in North West England.A total of 10 infants after congenital heart surgery, five with biventricular repairs and five with single-ventricle physiology undergoing palliation.Cerebral and somatic near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring for 24 hours post-operatively in the intensive care unit.Overall, there was no strong correlation between cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy and mixed venous oxygen saturation (r=0.48). At individual time points, the correlation was only strong (r=0.74) 1 hour after admission. The correlation was stronger for the biventricular patients (r=0.68) than single-ventricle infants (r=0.31). A strong inverse correlation was demonstrated between cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy and serum lactate at 3 of the 5 post-operative time points (1, 4, and 12 hours: r=-0.76, -0.72, and -0.69). The correlation was stronger when the cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy was <60%. For cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy <60%, the inverse correlation with lactate was r=-0.82 compared with those cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy >60%, which was r=-0.50. No correlations could be demonstrated between (average) somatic near-infrared spectroscopy and serum lactate (r=-0.13, n=110) or mixed venous oxygen saturation and serum lactate. There was one infant who suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest, and the cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy showed a consistent 43 minute decline before the event.We found that cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy is potentially beneficial as a non-invasive, continuously displayed value and is feasible to use on cost-constrained (National Health Service) cardiac intensive care units in children following heart surgery.
