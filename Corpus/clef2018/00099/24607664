Impact of educational video on critical congenital heart disease screening. To assess the status of pulse oximetry screening and barriers to implementing screening programs.This was a prospective pre-post intervention survey of nurse managers and medical directors of hospital-based birthing centers in Oregon, Idaho, and Southern Washington. The intervention was a 7-minute video demonstrating and discussing pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart disease.Analysis of matched pairs showed a significant increase in the use of pulse oximetry screening during the study period from 52% to 73% (P < .0001). Following implementation of the video, the perception of all queried potential barriers decreased significantly among individuals from hospitals self-identified as nonscreening at baseline. Viewing the educational video was associated with an increase in the percentage of individuals from nonscreening hospitals that rated screening as "very beneficial" (45% vs 90%, P = .0001).An educational video was associated with improved opinions of pulse oximetry screening among hospitals not currently screening.
