In vivo functional localization of the human visual cortex using positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are two recently developed methods for imaging the human brain in vivo. One application of PET measures stimulus-evoked changes in cerebral blood flow while MRI provides a detailed anatomical map of the brain. Here we report the combined application of these two techniques in the same human subject. Subtracted PET scans of a brain receiving visual stimulation were superimposed upon MRI images of the same brain. The PET scans were converted into the MRI coordinate space before superposition, which allowed for a more precise correlation between MRI anatomical data and PET physiological data. Responses were localized in striate and extrastriate visual areas as well as in the posterior thalamus.
