Important considerations for the newborn: access to postdischarge newborn care, pulse oximetry screening for congenital heart disease, and circumcision. This article addresses three areas in which new policies and research demonstrate the opportunity to impact the health of neonates: access to postdischarge newborn care, pulse oximetry screening for congenital heart disease, and circumcision.Recent research has identified that child healthcare providers are not typically adhering to the recommended first newborn visit within 48â€Šh of hospital discharge. Despite its benefits, cost-effectiveness, and the recommendation that routine screening for cyanotic congenital heart disease be added to the panel of universal newborn screening, adoption of this practice is variable. Evidence suggests a significant reduction in the transmission of HIV linked to circumcision, leading professional organizations to generate new policy statements on neonatal male circumcision.Pediatric healthcare providers should pay careful attention to the timing of the first newborn outpatient follow-up visit. Pulse oximetry screening for cyanotic congenital heart disease is specific, sensitive and meets criteria for universal screening, and providers should utilize well designed screening protocols. In addition, healthcare providers for newborns, especially those who perform circumcisions, should provide nonbiased, up-to-date information on the medical, financial, and ethical aspects of the procedure.
