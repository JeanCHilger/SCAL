Evaluation of ischemia by exercise stress Tl-201 myocardial SPECT in silent and symptomatic ischemia. Forty patients with ischemic heart disease confirmed by coronary arteriography were performed Tl-201 stress myocardial scintigraphy using SPECT. Fifteen patients had anginal attack during exercise Tl-201 myocardial perfusion study (symptomatic group), and 25 patients had horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression more than 0.1 mV without angina (asymptomatic group). The washout maps were derived from circumferential profile analyses of tomographic short-axis slices, and the data were plotted as a bull's eye map. The patient's washout map was compared with the lower limit of normal (mean--2 SD), and the extent and severity scores were calculated. On visual analysis 87% (13/15) of symptomatic patients showed redistribution, while only 56% (14/25) of asymptomatic patients showed redistribution (p less than 0.05). The extent score was significantly higher in the symptomatic group than in asymptomatic group (37.2 + 23.6 vs. 19.6 + 20.8, p less than 0.05), but severity score was slightly higher in symptomatic group (56.1 + 59.4 vs. 30.0 + 54.8, NS). In conclusion, symptomatic ischemia may be more severe than asymptomatic one and the degree of ischemia may be one of the factors that determine the presence of angina during ischemia.
