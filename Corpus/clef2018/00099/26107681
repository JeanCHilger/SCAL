Outcomes of Early Ligation of Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Preterms, Multicenter Experience. Persistent ductal patency may have serious effects in preterm infants. Analysis of the results of different trials were inconclusive in determining whether medical or surgical closure of the ductus is preferable and what is the best timing for surgical intervention.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of timing of surgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) on ventilatory, hemodynamic, and nutritional status of preterm infants.The authors retrospectively looked at the outcomes of surgical ligation of PDA from January 2010 to June 2014 at 2 Saudi neonatal intensive units at 2 tertiary care centers and the authors compared the results of early ligation (before 3 weeks) to the late ligation (after 3 weeks) regarding different hemodynamic, ventilatory, and nutritional parameters.A total of 120 preemies were included (75 preemies with early ligation and 45 with late ligation of PDA). The early ligation group had shorter duration of assisted ventilation of 10 (8-37) days as compared with 37 (26-90) days in the late ligation group (P < 0.05). The median fraction of inspired oxygen, needed to maintain good oxygen saturation in patients, was higher in the late ligation group [0.29 (0.21-0.70)] than in the early group [0.23 (0.21-0.55)] at 24  hours postoperatively. Full oral feeding was achieved earlier in the early ligation group than in the late group, 29 (15-73) days of life versus 53 (34-118) days of life, respectively (P < 0.05). Body weight at 36 weeks postconceptional age was higher in the early group--2100 (1350-2800) g--than in the late group-1790 (1270-2300) g--(P < 0.05).Our study demonstrated that earlier surgical ligation of the PDA in preterm infants has a more favorable nutritional and ventilatory outcome.
