Modified total cavopulmonary shunt as a staged Fontan operation. The left superior vena cava became occluded in an infant with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. After a bidirectional Glenn procedure, he presented with severe oxygen desaturation and right ventricular dysfunction the left superior vena cava drained into the inferior vena cava through collateral veins. As salvage therapy, we created a modified total cavopulmonary shunt using only autologous tissue in which the right hepatic vein and inferior vena cava drained into the pulmonary artery via a lateral tunnel in the right atrium. Immediately after surgery, his oxygen saturation increased and right ventricular function improved.
