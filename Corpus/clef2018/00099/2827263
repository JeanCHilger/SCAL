SPECT studies with 99mTc-HMPAO in Huntington's chorea patients. Huntington's chorea is an autosomal dominant inherited disease with a chronic course and atrophy of the corpus striatum. PET examination shows reduced glucose metabolism in the caudate nucleus. We examined seven patients with Huntington's chorea by SPECT, using 99mTc-HMPAO. All patients had cortical defects of varying severity. In addition, five patients showed increased uptake in the region of the caudate nucleus. The specific tracer uptake due to the metabolic processes in the region of the caudate nucleus in Huntington's chorea is discussed.
