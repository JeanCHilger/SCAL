Noninvasive identification of collateralized myocardium by 201 thallium tomography in vasodilation and redistribution. Coronary arteriolar vasodilatation may provoke the redistribution of flow to collateral-dependent jeopardized myocardium. To assess the physiologic significance of collateral channels, 80 consecutive postinfarction patients (aged: 58 +/- 8 years) underwent vasodilatation/redistribution thallium-201 tomographic (SPECT) imaging using 0.56 mg dipyridamole/kg body weight. Circumferential profile analysis of redistribution and slow washout in representative left ventricular tomograms provided quantitative evaluation of transient and persistent defects and a separation between a periinfarctional and distant inducible hypoperfusion. Tomographic perfusion data were correlated to subsequent cineangiographic analysis of wall motion and to the extent of collateral circulation between two distinct anatomic perfusion areas, one of which involved the infarct zone. Patients were grouped according to the presence (59%) or absence (41%) of angiographically visible collateral channels to the jeopardized myocardium. In the presence of collaterals, distant reversible defects were larger than in the absence of collaterals (p less than 0.05) the extent of combined periinfarctional and distant redistribution was also larger in collateralized patients (p less than 0.025), whereas the size of the persistent perfusion defect was similar in both groups. In a prospective analysis, the tomographic perfusion pattern of combined periinfarctional and distant ischemia revealed a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 78% for the detection of significant collateral circulation in this group of patients. Thus, using the limited collateral flow reserve as a diagnostic tool, vasodilatation/redistribution thallium-201 tomography has some potential for identifying and quantifying collateral-dependent myocardium and may guide diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making.
