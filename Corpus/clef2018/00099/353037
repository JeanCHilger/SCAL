Molecular events during the release of delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase from catabolite repression. Transfer of exponential-phase cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, previously grown in 2% glucose, to a derepression medium resulted in a prompt increase in the level of delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase, the rate-limiting enzyme of heme biosynthesis under these conditions. This derepression exhibited a lag of 35 min at 23 degrees C and required the participation of both RNA and protein syntheses. Dissection of the molecular events during this lag period disclosed that RNA synthesis, rnal gene function (messenger RNA transport from nucleus to cytosol), and initiation of protein synthesis were completed within less than 10, 18, and 24 min, respectively. The potential regulation of derepression by mitochondrial gene products and mitochondrial function was probed by means of a series of isogenic, respiration-deficient (rho-, pet-, and mit-) mutants no such regulation was found.
