Isolations of salmonellas from humans and foods in the Manchester area: 1981-1985. Isolations of salmonellas from humans and food products are recorded for the period 1981-5 and an attempt has been made to investigate the relationship between serotypes isolated from humans and those from meat products. The predominant serotypes isolated from humans were Salmonella typhimurium, S. enteritidis and S. virchow. S. typhimurium was commonly isolated from a range of meat products. S. derby was one of the most common serotypes isolated from tripe and sausages but was relatively uncommon in humans. Salmonellas were found in less than or equal to 0.5% of most cooked meat products apart from tripe and udder (3.2%) and pet foods (12.4%). Isolations from raw meats ranged from 3% for pork to 28% for poultry. Incidents of salmonella infection in humans in Manchester increased between 1981 and 1984 but decreased during 1985.
