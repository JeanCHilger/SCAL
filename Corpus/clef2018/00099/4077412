Toxoplasma prevalence and human occupational groups. Toxoplasma antibody prevalence was studied in four specialized groups of human population at Hissar, Haryana to study the influence, if any, of the degree of animal contact. While seropositivity among 64 persons of general population was 28.1 per cent, that in livestock and pet owners was found to be higher (35.0 per cent). Among other groups the overall positivity was similar to that in the general population, but there was greater concentration of higher serotitres among the laboratory animal handlers and postmortem attendants. It appears that the intimacy of animal contact is more important than the duration.
