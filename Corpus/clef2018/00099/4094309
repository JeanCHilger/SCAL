Intracardiac hemodynamics in patients with different forms of complete transposition of the major vessels. Intracardiac hemodynamic data obtained at catheterization of the heart in 110 patients with complete transpositions of major vessels (CTMV) are reviewed. The patients were divided into 6 hemodynamic groups depending on the presence of concomitant heart diseases. The age of the patients varied between 22 hours and 12 years. Blood oxygen saturation and pressure inside the cardiac cavities and the major vessels, total pulmonary and total peripheral resistance, pulmonary and systemic blood flow, effective pulmonary blood flow and intercavity pressure gradient were measured. Hemodynamic changes in patients with CTMV were shown to be associated with concomitant heart diseases. Low left-ventricular systolic blood pressure, an interatrial pressure gradient and high oxygen saturation of the blood in a pulmonary artery, as compared to the respective values in a systemic artery were the most specific features in these patients.
