Synthesis of ethyl 8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-[11C]methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (RO 15.1788-11C): a specific radioligand for the in vivo study of central benzodiazepine receptors by positron emission tomography. A method of labelling ethyl 8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-[11C]methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (RO 15.1788 11C), a benzodiazepine antagonist with carbon-11 has been developed. RO 15.1788-11C was prepared by methylation of the nor derivative by I11CH3. About 100 mCi (maximum 153 mCi, 5.66 GBq) of the chemically and radiochemically pure labelled product were obtained within 25 min with a specific activity on average of 1100 mCi/mumol (maximum 1740 mCi/mu mol--64.4 GBq/mu mol). Preliminary results obtained after i.v. administration in the baboon have shown RO 15.1788-11C to be of interest as a benzodiazepine radioligand for the in vivo study of benzodiazepine receptors by positron emission tomography.
