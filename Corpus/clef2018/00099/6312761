Non-uniformity induced artifacts in single-photon emission computed tomography. Changes of gamma camera uniformity due to choice of flood source configuration and camera head orientation, and influence of these changes on the reconstructed image, have been analysed using phantom measurements. The transfer of defects in the projection data to the reconstructed image has also been investigated using computer simulations. The results indicate that the use of gamma cameras for emission computed tomography will impose higher demands on gamma camera uniformity than conventional scintigraphy.
