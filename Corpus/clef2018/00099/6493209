Comparison of the sodium dependency of uptake of meta-lodobenzylguanidine and norepinephrine into cultured bovine adrenomedullary cells. Radioiodinated meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), a scintigraphic agent used for the detection of human pheochromocytomas, is thought to utilize the same uptake and retention mechanism(s) as norepinephrine (NE). Using cultured bovine adrenomedullary cells, we compared the mechanism(s) of uptake of MIBG to that of NE. Two different uptake systems were identified. NE and MIBG were taken up by a sodium-dependent system that was characterized by: 1) temperature dependency 2) high affinity: Km of 1.22 +/- 0.12 microM for MIBG and 1.41 +/- 0.50 microM for NE
