Nuclear medicine--an overview. A radioactive isotope behaves chemically and biologically like its non-radioactive counterpart. The application of this principle to medical diagnosis has evolved into a whole specialty called nuclear medicine. The development of the rectilinear scanner and gamma camera has extended the study of molecular pathways into an exciting imaging modality while developments in radiopharmaceuticals have made radionuclide imaging of many organ systems widely available. The most significant improvements have occurred in bone, hepatobiliary and cardiac imaging. Today, however, nuclear medicine is evolving into a more dynamic study of physiological processes in the body and how these processes may be affected by disease and medical treatment. Emission tomography with a new generation of both gamma and positron emitters will be integral part of nuclear medicine in the future. The challenge to develop radio-labelled antibodies for immunotherapy and immunodetection remains while many of the older techniques like radioimmunoassay, and even the simple colloid liver scan, will continue to contribute significantly to health care.
