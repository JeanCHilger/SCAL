Treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with radiolabeled murine, chimeric, or humanized LL2, an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody. LL2 is a murine IgG2a anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody found to react with virtually all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). Twenty-one patients with chemotherapy-resistant NHL received nonmyeloablative doses of 131I-labeled LL2 IgG and F(ab')2 ranging from 15 to 343 mCi given in cycles of 15-50 mCi, for up to seven treatment cycles. The cumulative protein dose ranged from 1.1 mg IgG to 157 mg F(ab')2. Seventeen patients were assessable for treatment response, and antitumor effects were seen in five (one complete remission, two partial remissions, and two minor or mixed responses). In addition, one complete response was seen in a patient who received only "diagnostic" doses of 131I-LL2 IgG. Thus, a total of six patients had responses according to the defined response criteria. Three additional patients have been treated with potentially myeloablative doses of 131I-LL2 IgG at a starting dose level of 90 mCi/m2 (100 mg). Two patients were evaluable, and both had partial remissions lasting 8 and 3 months, respectively. Chimeric and complementarity-determining region-grafted LL2 have been developed. Initial clinical studies have shown that these agents have targeting properties similar to the murine LL2 and, therefore, may be suitable alternatives to murine LL2 in the treatment of NHL. LL2 is a promising agent for the treatment of lymphoma, particularly when the maximum tolerated dose is given either with or without autologous bone marrow transplantation.
