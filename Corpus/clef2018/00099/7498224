A quantitative approach to technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer: a comparison with technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime. To develop non-invasive regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements using technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer (99mTc-ECD) and single-photon emission tomography (SPET), the same graphical analysis as was described in our previous reports using technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) was applied to time-activity data for the aortic arch and brain hemispheres after intravenous injection of 99mTc-ECD. Hemispherical brain perfusion indices (BPI) for 99mTc-ECD showed a highly significant correlation (n = 22, r = 0.935, P = 0.0001) with those for 99mTc-HMPAO in 11 patients who underwent both tracer studies. Using both linear regression line equations between 99mTc-ECD BPI and 99mTc-HMPAO BPI and between 99mTc-HMPAO BPI and mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) values obtained from a xenon-133 inhalation SPET method in a previous study, 99mTc-ECD BPI was converted to 133Xe CBF values (y = 2.60 chi + 9.8). Then raw SPET images of 99mTc-ECD were converted to rCBF maps using Lassen's correction algorithm. In this algorithm, the correction factor alpha was fixed to 1.5, 2.6 and infinite. In the comparison of rCBF values for 99mTc-ECD SPET with those for 99mTc-HMPAO SPET in 396 regions of interest in the aforementioned 11 patients, the fixed correction factor alpha of 2.6 gave nearly the same rCBF values for 99mTc-ECD (50.1 +/- 16.9 ml/100 g/min, mean +/- SD) as for 99mTc-HMPAO (49.9 +/- 17.3 ml/100 g/min). In conclusion, the same non-invasive method as has been used in 99mTc-HMPAO studies is applicable to a 99mTc-ECD study for the measurement of rCBF without any blood sampling.
