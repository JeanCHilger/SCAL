Changes in the brain of persons who participated in the cleaning-up of the Chernobyl AES accident based on the data of radiodiagnosis (single-photon emission-computed radionuclide tomography, x-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance tomography). Presents the data of x-ray examinations of the brain in cleaner-ups of the consequences of the Chernobyl power plant accident who complained of headaches, ache in the bones, poor memory, giddiness, weakness, a drastic drop of performance ability, fits with loss of consciousness. Hypometabolic foci localized both in the white and gray matter of the brain were revealed. X-Ray computer-aided tomography and magnetic imaging showed dilatation of the ventricular system of the brain, dilatation of the subarachnoidal spaces, symmetrical reduction of the density of medullary tissue round the bodies and anterior and posterior horns of lateral ventricles, round the third ventricle, near semi-oval centers, as well as solitary or multiple focal reduction of medullary tissue density. Findings of x-ray methods of diagnosis permit a conclusion on a complex organic involvement of the brain in subjects who participated in liquidation of the consequences of the Chernobyl power plant accident. The most typical are signs of the hypertensive hydrocephalic syndrome with cerebrospinal fluid disturbances and of the vascular encephalic syndrome with development of focal postischemic malacia of the brain matter.
