Imaging, biodistribution and therapy potential of halogenated tamoxifen analogues. Tamoxifen binds to estrogen receptors (ERs) and prevents breast cancer cell proliferation. This study is aimed at developing a ligand for imaging ER (+) breast tumors by positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). [18F]-Labeled tamoxifen analogue ([18F]FTX) was prepared in 30-40% yield and [131I]-labeled tamoxifen analogue ([131I]ITX) was prepared in 20-25% yield. In mammary tumor-bearing rats, the biodistribution of [18F]FTX at 2 h showed a tumor uptake value (% injected dose/gram tissue) of 0.41 +/- 0.07 when rats were pretreated with diethylstilbestrol (DES), the value changed to 0.24 +/- 0.017. [131I]ITX at 6 h showed a tumor uptake value of 0.26 +/- 0.166
