CT and SPECT image registration and fusion for spatial localization of metastatic processes using radiolabeled monoclonals. The fusion of computed tomography (CT) and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) antibody images can enhance the information provided by either single modality by providing precise anatomical-functional correlation. Functional abnormalities seen on low resolution SPECT antibody images can be precisely located with specific anatomic structures seen in high resolution CT images. External fiducials located on each image modality aid in the automated registration, alignment and matching of CT and SPECT antibody images. The potential benefits of multimodal fusion include (A) the discrimination of more subtle activity peaks using anatomic organ segmentation, (B) temporal discrimination of recurrent disease, (C) assessment of residual activity post-surgery and (D) automated localization of significant focal activity. In addition, the correlation of function with anatomy may be used to establish the physiologic status of ambiguously identified objects in the anatomic image.
