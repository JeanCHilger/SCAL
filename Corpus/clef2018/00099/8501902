An animal model for in vivo evaluation of tumor glycolytic rates with positron emission tomography. We developed a method for evaluating tumor glycolytic rates in vivo with nude mice injected with 2-[F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and a dedicated animal positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. Animals were injected with NR-6 mouse fibroblast tumor cell lines. When tumors achieved a large enough size to be macroscopically visible, quantitative measurements of FDG uptake in vivo were obtained, using both standard nonlinear regression with the FDG tracer kinetic model to generate estimates of model parameters, including KNLR, the rate constant for net phosphorylation of FDG. Additionally, we determined the values of KPAT, the rate constant for net phosphorylation of FDG measured with a non-iterative graphical method. Estimates of K were highly correlated (r = 0.95) with both methods, and parametric images of KPAT demonstrate both the tumor location and size, but are also scaled in units of phosphorylation of FDG. The method is suitable for serial studies of tumor glucose metabolism during and after therapeutic interventions, such as chemotherapeutic trials.
