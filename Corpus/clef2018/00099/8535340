Selective alkylation of pyrimidyl dianions III: no-carrier-added synthesis of [11C-methyl]-thymidine. A no-carrier-added, high specific activity synthesis of [11C-methyl]-thymidine is reported. Reaction of 3'. 5'-O-bis-(tetrahydropyramyl)-5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine with n-butylithium produced a diamion which was alkylated with [11C]-methyl iodide, and on subsequent hydrolysis, yielded [IIC-methyl]-thymidine. The labeled compound was isolated from the by-product 2'-deoxymidine by HPLC on a reverse phase C18 semipreparative column with mean radiochemical yield of 18.8% (decay corrected) in 30-35 min and radiochemical purity >99%. This no-carrier-added synthesis can be used to produce [11C-methyl]-thymidine with mean specific activity over 1000 mCi/mumol for positron emission tomography (PET) studies.
