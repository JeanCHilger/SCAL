Functional mapping of human learning: a positron emission tomography activation study of eyeblink conditioning. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using positron emission tomography during eyeblink conditioning in young adults. Subjects were scanned in three experimental conditions: delay conditioning, in which binaural tones preceded air puffs to the right eye by 400 msec pseudoconditioning, in which presentations of tone and air puff stimuli were not correlated in time
