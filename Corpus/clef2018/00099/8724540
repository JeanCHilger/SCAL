Monitoring bulky mediastinal disease with gallium-67, CT-scan and magnetic resonance imaging in Hodgkin's disease and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Treatment of both Hodgkin's disease (HD) and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (HG-NHL) with bulky presentation at diagnosis frequently results in residual masses detected radiologically. Conventional diagnostic radiology and computed tomography (CT) are generally unable to detect the differences between tumor tissue and fibrosis. Gallium-67-citrate (67Ga) SPECT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can potentially differentiate residual active tumor tissue and fibrosis. Thirty-three patients with HD or HG-NHL presenting with bulky mediastinal disease were studied with CT, 67Ga SPECT, and MRI (only for 16 patients) at diagnosis, after two-thirds of their chemotherapy, at the end of chemotherapy, and after radiotherapy in order to evaluate the mediastinal region on the basis of persistence of residual masses and activity of pathological tissue. After treatment, all patients with 67Ga-negative (30/33) disease are still in continuous complete response. Among the three 67Ga-positive patients, 2 relapsed within one year and another one is still alive without evidence of disease. Regarding MRI, two patients were found to be positive, one of them concomitant with 67Ga-positivity both patients survive in complete response. In lymphoma patients with bulky mediastinal presentation, the 67Ga SPECT remains the preferable imaging technique for monitoring and differentiating the eventual active residual tumor. In combination, CT and 67Ga SPECT represent a suitable complete imaging approach to the radiological diagnosis which may be useful in these particular patients. MRI could probably be considered as a second-line method and from our data would be used only in selected cases because of the high cost, accessibility, and lower specificity as opposed to 67Ga SPECT in evaluating potentially active residual disease.
