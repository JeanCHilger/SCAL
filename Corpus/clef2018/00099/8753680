Recovery of impaired left ventricular function in patients with acute myocardial infarction is predicted by the discordance in defect size on 123I-BMIPP and 201Tl SPET images. A discrepancy between myocardial perfusion defect and wall motion abnormalities is frequently found early after coronary reperfusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to assess recovery of impaired left ventricular function by reference to the discordance in defect size between myocardial fatty acid uptake and myocardial perfusion using combined single-photon emission tomographic (SPET) imaging early after coronary perfusion therapy. In 37 patients with acute myocardial infarction, iodine-123 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3(R, S)-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) and thallium-201 SPET scans were performed early after coronary reperfusion. A severity score was determined from the extent of the imaging defect with each tracer. Left ventricular wall motion score (WMS) and ejection fraction (EF) were obtained at admission and at 4 weeks after the onset of infarction. In 32 of the 37 patients, discordance in defect sizes delineated with the two SPET studies was found during the acute stage. The severity score for BMIPP was larger than that for 201Tl during the acute stage (7. 7+/-2.4 vs 4.4+/-2.5, P <0.001). There was a fair correlation between the severity score for BMIPP and WMS (r=0.82, P <0.0001), but a poor correlation between that for 201Tl and WMS. The extent of discordance in severity scores between BMIPP and 201Tl during the acute stage correlated well with the extent of the improvement in WMS (r=0.86, P <0.0001) and that of EF (r=0.85, P <0.0001). We conclude that the discordance in defect size on BMIPP and 201Tl SPET images during the acute stage of infarction is an early predictor of the viability of the myocardium at risk of infarction.
