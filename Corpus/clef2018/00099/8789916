Wisconsin card sorting activated regional cerebral blood flow in first break and chronic schizophrenic patients and normal controls. Dynamic 133Xe single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was used to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during the Wisconsin Card Sorting test (WCS) and the Number Matching task (NM) in six never-medicated first break schizophrenic and schizophreniform patients, seven chronic schizophrenic patients, and seven normal controls. Because of a difference in mean age between first break patients and normals, we adjusted rCBF data for age effects using ANCOVA. For age-adjusted absolute superior and middle frontal rCBF bilaterally, we found significantly less activation from NM to WCS in first break patients compared to normals. Similarly, for age-adjusted absolute and relative left middle frontal rCBF, we found significantly less activation in chronics compared to normals. Changes in age-adjusted global cerebral blood flow (gCBF) were not statistically significant among the three groups, but were in the same direction as activated absolute frontal rCBF. Because of the small number of subjects in each group, the results of this study should be regarded as preliminary and interpreted cautiously.
