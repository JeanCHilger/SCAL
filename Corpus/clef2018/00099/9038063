Assessment of cerebral benzodiazepine receptor distribution in epilepsy by 123I-iomazenil-SPECT. 123I-Iomazenil (123I-IMZ) and 123I-IMP imaging were performed in 8 epileptic patients (EP) in the interictal phase and 6 normal volunteers (NV). On 123I-IMZ delayed imaging, the 8 EP showed abnormally decreased findings. Two EP showed decreased perfusion in the same region on 123I-IMP imaging. 123I-IMZ imaging for the detection of epileptic foci showed relatively high specificity compared with EEG recording. On 123I-IMZ early images, the count ratio of the right lower frontal cortex was lower the cerebellar cortex in EP was lower than that in NV. On 123I-IMZ delayed images, the count ratio of the bilateral occipital and the right upper and lower frontal cortices to the cerebellar cortex in EP was lower than that in NV. On 123I-IMZ delayed images, the count ratio of the right upper frontal cortex to the occipital cortex in EP was lower than that in NV. On 123I-IMZ delayed images, the count ratio of the left lower frontal cortex to the occipital cortex in EP was higher than that in NV. These results pointed to the involvement of the benzodiazepine receptor complex in epilepsy.
