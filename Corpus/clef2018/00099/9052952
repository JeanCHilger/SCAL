Surgery for epilepsy: evaluation and indication. Surgery for epilepsy is effective for the controlling of seizures in patients with pharmacoresistant forms. To screen candidates for surgery, diagnosis must be certain sure and the form must be drug resistant. Seizures must interfere with quality of life and the patient must be medically and psychologically stable. Selecting patients for surgery demands meticulous evaluation, including prolonged video-EEG to record seizures, magnetic resonance and, often, additional function imaging tests and neuropsychological examination. The most frequently performed surgery and the type with the best results is temporal lobectomy in patients with complex partial seizures arising in the mesial temporal lobe. Other techniques, such as hemispherectomy, callostomy or reduced cortical or extratemporal lobar resection, can yield improved or total control over seizures in certain patients.
