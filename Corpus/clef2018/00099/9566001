Relationship between imaging and pathological features and clinical factors in surgical cases of temporal lobe epilepsy. The relationships between imaging, pathology and presumed causes in surgical cases of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) was studied. The subject was 62 patients (33 males and 29 females) who had had no attacks for more than one year after surgery. Average age at surgery was 28.2 +/- 9.9 years. Obvious neurological abnormalities were not found in these cases. MRI, PET and SPECT were performed. Hematoxylin and eosin was used for pathological judgement. Their medical charts were used to investigate their clinical factors. Although patients suspected of having encephalitis/meningitis had been hospitalized for 2 days to three months during childhood due to disturbance of consciousness with high fever and convulsion for several days they were not diagnosed with encephalitis/meningitis at that time, and they suffered almost no handicaps other than epilepsy for several years following their comatose episodes.
