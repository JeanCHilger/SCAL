Dopamine transporter imaging with [123I]-beta-CIT demonstrates presynaptic nigrostriatal dopaminergic damage in Wilson's disease. The most common neurological manifestations in Wilson's disease are parkinsonism and dystonia. These are assumed to be due to striatal injury, which has been repeatedly demonstrated by pathology and CT or MRI. The substantia nigra has not been shown to be damaged in pathological studies. However, there have been clinical and imaging studies suggesting presynaptic nigrostriatal injury. (1r)-2Beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (beta-CIT) is a specific ligand that binds to the dopamine transporter (DAT), and can examine the integrity of dopaminergic nerve terminals. Evidence for presynaptic nigrostriatal dopaminergic damage in Wilson's disease was searched for using [123I]-beta-CIT SPECT.Six patients with Wilson's disease were studied, together with 15 healthy normal controls, and six patients with Parkinson's disease. After injection of [123I]-beta-CIT, SPECT studies were done at 18 hours. Specific striatal/occipital binding ratio (S/O ratio) was calculated as (striatal binding-occipital binding)/occipital binding.The specific S/O ratios were 6.22 (1.32) (mean (SD)) in normal volunteers, 3.78 (0.65) in Parkinson's disease, and 3.60 (0.49) in Wilson's disease.There was severe loss of the DAT in the striatum suggesting significant damage in presynaptic nigrostriatal dopaminergic nerve terminals. Therefore, a presynaptic lesion may contribute to neurological manifestations in Wilson's disease.
