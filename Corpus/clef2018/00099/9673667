Visual form discrimination from texture cues: a PET study. With the purpose of localising the cerebral cortical areas participating in the discrimination of visual form generated exclusively by texture cues, we measured changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with positron emissions tomography (PET) and 15O-butanol as the tracer. The subjects performed two odd-one-out discrimination tasks: a form-from-texture discrimination task (in which a visual form was defined by differences in texture) and its reference task, the discrimination of texture. During task performance, activated fields were present bilaterally in the primary visual cortex and its immediate extrastriate cortex, the right lateral occipital gyrus, bilaterally in the fusiform and superior temporal gyri and posterior parts of the superior parietal lobules, along the medial bank of the right intraparietal sulcus, and in the right supramarginal gyrus. Other fields were found in the cingulate and prefrontal cortex. The findings demonstrate that the discrimination of visual form as defined by texture engages cortical fields that are widely distributed ion the human brain. In the visual cortex, the activated fields are present in both the occipito-temporal and occipito-parietal visual areas. These results suggest that the perception and discrimination of forms in the visual system requires the joint-activation of neuronal populations in the visual cortex.
