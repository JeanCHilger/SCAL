Cerebral imaging in paediatrics. Radioisotope brain imaging has focused mainly on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). However the use of ligands which go to specific receptor sites is being introduced in paediatrics, mainly psychiatry. rCBF is potentially available in many institutions, especially with the availability of multi-headed gamma cameras. The use of this technique in paediatrics requires special attention to detail in the manner of data acquisition and handling the child. The interpretation of the rCBF study in a child requires knowledge of normal brain maturation. The major clinical use in paediatrics is epilepsy because of the advances in surgery and the frequency of complex partial seizures. Other indications in paediatric neurology include brain death, acute neurological loss including stroke, language disorders, cerebral palsy, hypertension due to renovascular disease, traumatic brain injury and migraine. There are paediatric psychological conditions in which rCBF has been undertaken, these include anorexia nervosa, autism, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) and attention deficit disorder-hyperactivity (ADHD). Research using different ligands to specific receptor sites will also be reviewed in paediatrics.
