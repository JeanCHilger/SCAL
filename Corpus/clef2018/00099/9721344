Use of bone SPECT of the dorsolumbar spine in oncological patients with suspected bone metastases. A retrospective study was made to evaluate the usefulness of bone SPECT of the dorsolumbar spine in identifying benign and malignant lesions. A study was made of oncological patients who presented active images in the spinal column visible on planar radionuclide scans who also underwent SPECT. The average follow-up period was 25+/-13 months.In 43 neoplastic patients 55 visible lesions on SPECT were evaluated, of which 29 were benign and 26 metastatic. The criteria for benign lesions were the absence of change or involution without treatment in the follow-up period. The criteria for classifying metastases were: 1. Positive biopsy. 2. Neurological complications derived from the lesion. 3. Increased extension and tracer uptake by the lesion, and the appearance of other bone metastases.Twelve of 15 lesions located in the vertebral body or pedicle and 11/16 located in the body with extension toward the pedicles were metastases. Twenty-one of 24 lesions located on the anterior face of the vertebral body, articular processes, lamina, or intervertebral disk were benign.Bone SPECT was useful for locating the vertebral lesion, which in many cases allows differentiation of benign and metastatic lesions.
