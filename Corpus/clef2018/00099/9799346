Comparative myocardial uptake of technetium-99 m sestamibi and technetium-99m tetrofosmin one hour after stress injection. Technetium-99m sestamibi and 99mTc-tetrofosmin are at present the preferred tracers for simultaneous assessment of myocardial perfusion and function by gated single-photon emission tomography (SPET). The aim of this work was to compare sestamibi and tetrofosmin myocardial uptake 1 h after stress injection. Consecutive unselected patients were studied either with sestamibi or with tetrofosmin on a random basis, until at least 100 patients had been enrolled for each gender and tracer. Stress was obtained by dipyridamole or exercise or combined dipyridamole + exercise in the latter cases, exercise was sustained for at least 1.5 min after tracer injection. Injected activity was similarly adjusted to body weight. For each patient, imaging began 60-75 min after injection. All SPET projections were summed
