Impairment of cardiac neuronal function in acute myocarditis: iodine-123-MIBG scintigraphy study. Abnormalities of norepinephrine uptake have been found to reflect impairment in adrenergic nerve function that has influenced the cardiac outcome of patients with heart failure. The aim of this study was to explore the cardiac neuronal function by using 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy in patients with acute myocarditis.We studied 15 patients (age range 42 +/- 10 yr) with clinical, biological, electrocardiographic and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (41% +/- 7%) data indicating myocarditis and 10 normal subjects (age range 36 +/- 7 yr, mean radionuclide LVEF 69% +/- 8%, p < 0.05). Fourteen patients had positive histologic findings of myocarditis and 1 had nonspecific histological data. All patients underwent planar cardiac imaging after intravenous injection of 185 MBq 123I-MIBG and right ventricular biopsy within 7 days. A chest anterior view was acquired 4 hr later. Heart-to-mediastinum ratio activity was measured, as previously described in our laboratory.Significant impairment of cardiac neuronal uptake of MIBG was observed and based on a reduction of heart-to-mediastinum ratio (148% +/- 16% versus 234% +/- 36%, p < 0.05). A significant correlation was observed between LVEF and MIBG uptake in patients (y = 1.58x +/- 83.7, r = 0.72, p < 0.01).Acute myocarditis is associated with an injury of the cardiac adrenergic neuronal function. In addition to the inflammatory injury of the myocytes, the impairment of adrenergic function may be involved in the cardiac pump failure induced by myocarditis.
