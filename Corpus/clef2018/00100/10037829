Safety and indication of open heart surgery without blood transfusion for congenital cardiac defects in infants. Between January 1994 and June 1997, 16 cases of ventricular septal defect (VSD) and endocardial cushion defect (ECD) with pulmonary hypertension (PH), each weighing from 5 to 9 kg, underwent definitive surgery at Matsudo Municipal Hospital. We classified them into 2 groups Group N: 8 cases without blood transfusion, Group H: 8 cases with blood transfusion. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) system was a closed circuit and priming volume was 370 to 500 ml. There was no difference between the 2 groups in operative age, body weight, preoperative state, operation time, CPB time, aortic cross clamp time, bleeding and postoperative state. In Group N, CPB blood was returned to the patient as soon as possible after CPB was weaned, and postoperative hemodynamics were stable in both groups. In Group N, hematocrit (Ht) values were consistently lower than in Group H, from initiation of CPB to leaving the hospital. To accomplish safe CPB, we measured systemic venous oxygen saturation (SvO2). In 6 cases of Group N, SvO2 during rewarming was 48.1 +/- 16.0% and Ht value was 13.2 +/- 1.5%. It is thought that the safe CPB could be conducted in Group N. In addition, in Group N, respiratory index showed better values than in Group H during the postoperative period. It is thought that CPB without blood transfusion may be favorable to prevent lung injury after CPB. Retrospectively, it is thought that, to accomplish safe CPB without blood transfusion, preoperative Ht values of over 30% are desirable in patients weighing 6 kg and those of over 35% are desirable in patients weighing 5 kg.
