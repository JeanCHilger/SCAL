The role of bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt on selection of Fontan patients. There are no objection against that pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) is one of the most important factors for completion of successful application of Fontan-type operation. However, calculated PVRI in single ventricle physiology in often unreliable because of difficulty in accurate measurement of pulmonary blood flow, especially in patients with decreased pulmonary blood flow. Although the role of bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (BCPS) in such patients has been increasingly recognized, the impact of BCPS on PVRI has not been fully understood. Between November 1993 and November 1996, 24 patients, aged between 0.54 and 22.2 years, with a wide variety of cardiac malformations underwent BCPS, and were followed up for the mean of 15.1 months. There were four hospital deaths (16.7%) and three deaths in follow-up (12.5%). Serial catheterization revealed that significant increase in mean arterial oxygen saturation from 75.8% to 83.9% (p = 0.005), and decrease in mean Nakata's index from 433 to 311 (p < 0.0001). PVRI calculated by using formulas derived from Ohm's law before BCPS (Pulmonary flow was derived from Fick formula) was highly (greater than 10 u.m2) or moderately (between 4 and 10 u.m2) elevated in 6 and 7 patients, respectively. However, PVRI in these patients was normal after BCPS. Fourteen out of 24 patients underwent total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) with 8 to 15 months of interval from BCPS, and have been currently surviving, and in NYHA functional class I or II, except 2 patients who underwent take-down. In conclusion, early and midterm outcome after staged operation appears to be excellent. BCPS is a good interim procedure, in part because one can more properly select patients undergoing Fontan operations from the PVRI point of view.
