Balloon dilation of the right ventricular outflow tract in tetralogy of Fallot: a palliative procedure. Fifteen patients requiring palliation for tetralogy of Fallot were treated by balloon dilation because of hypercyanotic spells. The mean age at dilation was 1.9 +/- 0.7 years (range 0.5-3), and the mean weight 9.8 +/- 2.1 kg (range 6.0-13.5). Dilation of the outflow tract was combined with dilation of the left and/or right pulmonary arteries in 5 patients. Successful dilation was achieved in 12 patients (80%), but failed in 3 patients with hypoplastic pulmonary arteries. In one patient, the stenosis of the right pulmonary artery could not be dilated because of a very sharp angle at the site of the stenosis. Two of the 3 patients in whom the procedure failed died of severe cyanotic spells within 24 hours of the unsuccessful procedure. No major complications occurred during or after the procedure in the cases undergoing successful dilation. The arterial oxygen saturation increased significantly, from 71 +/- 5.7% to 89 +/- 3.9%, immediately after the procedure (p < 0.005). During a period of follow up of 6 +/- 3.7 months (range 1-13), the procedure was repeated on 3 occasions, and successfully accomplished in 2 of these. In conclusion, balloon dilation is a satisfactory palliative procedure for tetralogy of Fallot in those units in which total correction is not performed under 2 to 3 years of age.
