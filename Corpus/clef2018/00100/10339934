Anesthetic management of an infant with pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect accompanied by excess pulmonary blood flow for systemic-pulmonary shunt operation. A 6-month-old infant had pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA + VSD) accompanied by excess pulmonary artery flow via major aortopulmonary collateral artery, underwent aortopulmonary shunt with artificial graft under midazolam-fentanyl anesthesia. After the administration of protamine, arterial oxygen saturation gradually decreased. We suspected that hypotension and decrease in cardiac output induced by protamine caused the decrease in pulmonary blood flow via central shunt. It is suggested that pulmonary blood flow should be maintained by using an inotropic agent and a selective pulmonary arterial dilator such as prostaglandin E1 in a patient with PA + VSD after the institution of aorto-pulmonary shunt, because the patient with excess pulmonary flow has been reported to have high pulmonary resistance due to pulmonary abnormalities such as stenosis and thrombosis.
