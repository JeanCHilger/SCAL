Bi-directional cavopulmonary shunt: is accessory pulsatile flow, good or bad? Evaluation of the effect and long-term outcome of accessory pulsatile blood flow versus classical bi-directional cavopulmonary connection (BCPC).Retrospective review of the medical and surgical records.Two-hundred and five patients (119 boys, 86 girls) underwent BCPC from 1990 to 1996. Accessory pulsatile flow was present in 68%, flow being maintained through the pulmonary trunc in 46%, systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt in 13% and mixed in 7%, or patent ductus arteriosus in 2%. Patients with accessory pulsatile flow had lower hospital mortality (3% versus 5%), while mean pulmonary artery pressure (14.1 versus 12.6 mmHg P = 0.050) and increase of oxygen saturation (12.4 versus 8.7, P = 0.034) were significantly higher. The period of artificial ventilation (1.9 day) and ICU stay (6 days) did not differ for both groups. Late mortality was higher following accessory pulsatile flow (6% versus 1%). At late follow-up patients with accessory pulsatile flow had significantly higher oxygen saturation (mean 85 +/- 4%, versus 79 +/- 4% P < or = 0.005). If subsequent completion of Fontan is considered the optimal palliation and subsequent systemic to pulmonary artery shunt, arteriovenous fistula and transplantation is considered a failure, patients with accessory pulsatile flow had significantly more and earlier completion of the Fontan procedure (mean 1.7 +/- 2.4 years, versus 2.7 +/- 4.4 yearsDespite two different initial palliative techniques the outcome was not significantly different. Accessory pulsatile blood flow appeared not to be a contra-indication for a completion Fontan procedure. Moreover, the data suggest that after accessory pulsatile flow can safely be performed, at late follow-up oxygen saturation is higher, while, significantly more and earlier completion of Fontan occurred. Age at bi-directional cavopulmonary shunt, basic left or right ventricular anatomy or previous palliative surgery did not influence survival.
