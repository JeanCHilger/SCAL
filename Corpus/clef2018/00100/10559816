Left superior vena cava connection to unroofed coronary sinus associated with positional cyanosis: successful transcatheter treatment using Gianturco-Grifka vascular occlusion device. A persistent left superior vena cava connection to an unroofed coronary sinus is a rare cardiac anomaly that is associated with a variable degree of cyanosis. We report an infant with this condition and the unusual feature of cyanosis dependent on head position. When the patient's head was rotated to the left, he developed severe stenosis of the left internal jugular vein, enlarged cervical collateral veins that connected to the right superior vena cava and had an oxygen saturation 95%. When the patient's head was rotated to the right, the left internal jugular vein was widely patent and systemic oxygen saturation decreased to 87%. There was no right ventricular volume overload. Temporary occlusion of the left superior vena cava documented tolerable proximal venous pressure. Cyanosis was relieved by transcatheter closure of the left superior vena cava with a Gianturco-Grifka vascular occlusion device. Cathet. Cardiovasc. Intervent. 48:369-373, 1999.
