Stent implantation in palliative central aortopulmonary shunt of congenital cardiopathies with pulmonary hypoperfusion. Experience of 2 cases. We describe the pioneer experience of balloon angioplasty and stent implantation in the central polytetrafluoroethylene aorto-pulmonary shunt. Two infants 1 and 13 month-old, with cyanotic complex congenital cardiopathy and pulmonary hypoperfusion, presented signs of prosthesis dysfunction with severe and critic hypoxemia. The angioplasty and stent implantation were performed through retrograde femoral arterial approach and "freely" (without a guide catheter) in the first case and venous via by using Judkins right coronary guiding catheter in the second one. Both cases experienced sustained O2 saturation improvement, although the neonate died on the fifth post-procedure day clue to acute renal failure. The postmortem anatomical findings are shown.
