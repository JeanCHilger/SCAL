Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of the hemodynamics in absent aortic valve. Hemodynamics were estimated by Doppler echocardiography in a neonate with an absent aortic valve and absent or extremely hypoplastic mitral valve. The coronary blood flow depended on the increased end-diastolic pressure of the left ventricle. Pulmonary venous congestion, which was also due to the increased end-diastolic pressure of the left ventricle, may induce decreased oxygen saturation and, subsequently, further myocardial hypoxia, poor contraction and increased end-diastolic pressure of the left ventricle. Finally, hypoxic blood was supplied to each organ from the pulmonary artery through the ductus arteriosus, which induced severe acidosis and differential cyanosis after birth.
