Laryngeal mask as alternative to facial mask in the newborn. The present study demonstrates that the use of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is an alternative to face-mask (FM) during induction of general anesthesia with halothane. In all patient the induction of general anesthesia is carried out by halotane and N2O/O2 50%, using only the LMA, preceding topical anesthesia of pharynx.prospective study.this study was carried out at the surgical-division of the Pediatric Clinic, of University "La Sapienza", Rome.a total of 80 newborns, average age 14.8 +/- 2.4 days and average body weight 2280 +/- 110 g were examined.newborns were submitted to surgery for congenital malformations, diagnostic research and positioning of a central venous catheter (CVC).Heart rate, non-invasive arterial pressure through cardiomonitor Hewlett Packard 78352A, oxygen saturation through Nellcor N3000, time of induction of general anesthesia and respiratory rate were assessed.Blood pressure and heart rate were increased during the positioning of LMA oxygen saturation remained > or = 94% and respiratory rate was constant during the whole observation. Muscular relaxing, as an index of anesthesia, was observed after 33 +/- 1.5 sec after positioning of LMA.In the light of the results obtained, the use of the LMA for airway ventilation during the induction period of pediatric anesthesia is suggested.
